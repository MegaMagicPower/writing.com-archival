            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Though usually quiet and peaceful, on this day the sounds of chatter, games and laughter erupted from the Ponyville library.  It wasn't the biggest party that Pinkie Pie had thrown that year (or month, or even week) but the Good-Luck-And-We'll-Miss-You-So-Much-But-We-Know-You'll-Do-Great party being held would certainly be remembered by everypony present for years to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive young mares and about a dozen little colts and fillies were at the center of the party, playing a round of Pin The Tail On The Pony.  Each one wore a cape marking them as Cutie Mark Crusaders, though the ones on the oldest five were well-worn and too small for them now.  The capes and emblems of a caped pony over a blue shield were nevertheless sported with pride and infused with countless happy memories.  There were the original three: Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo.  The one being spun around was the frizzy-haired Twist, and the one doing the spinning was the young black alicorn, Nyx.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike her friends, Nyx was starting to grow into adulthood. But whereas for them, that meant they were still smaller than fully-grown adults, she stood taller than all but the largest ponies.  Her eyes, no longer hidden by the enchanted lenses that made the dragon-like pupils look round like a normal ponies, now shone with laughter and joy where once they had looked down on all ponies with scorn when they belonged to the jealous and spiteful Nightmare Moon.  Her horn gleamed with magic as--at her friends' insistence--she held Twist up off the ground with her mind, spinning and flipping her around in all directions before daintily setting the bespectacled pony back onto the floor.  The extra third dimension of spin had made the candy-making pony even dizzier and more unsteady than usual, as demonstrated by the tails already attached.  When Twist pinned her own tail and took off the blindfold, everyone including her giggled at how she had placed it on the pony's back hoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, who's next?\" Nyx asked, and she was answered by several cries and hooves raised up into the air, including Pinkie Pie who bounced in, squealing, \"Oooh!  Ooh, me me me!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom a short distance away, Twilight Sparkle watched her adopted daughter with love and pride while Rarity and Applejack did the same toward their little sisters.  One of the little colts got blindfolded and levitated, giggling around the tail in his mouth as Nyx gave him a spin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hard t' believe they're this big already, ain't it, Sugarcube?\"  Applejack turned to look at the other two as she mused, \"Are y'all gonna be okay?  Ah know it's easy fer me.  Apple Bloom's just gonna be apprenticin' with Rusty Nail when she ain't lendin' a hoof around the orchard, and Twist'll still be in town workin' at the candy shop if she gets lonely, but with Sweetie Belle goin' to that fancypants consternarium--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack was suddenly interrupted by Rarity wailing, \"CONSERVATORY!\"  She then started bawling, quickly dabbing at her wet eyes with a handkerchief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight put a hoof on her friend's shoulder.  \"It's okay, Rarity, I know this is hard, but Sweetie Belle's going to be just fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I know,\" Rarity sniffled, her lip quivering as she looked to her little sister.  \"It's just that I offered and I begged, and I <i>pleaded</i> with her, but... but...\"  The fashion-conscious pony started weeping again.  \"Oh, Sweetie Belle, why oh WHY wouldn't you wear the new capes I made for you?!  They would drape SO much more elegantly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack rolled her eyes as Twilight struggled not to do so herself, giving Rarity a reassuring smile instead.  \"Yeah, uh... it's a tragedy, but it's just for a few hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity continued to dry her eyes until she slowly eased out of her moment of drama.  \"*sniff*  Yes, I know... I'll just miss my little sister so terribly while she's gone...  What about you, Twilight?  Did Nyx finally decide what she was going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack asked, \"Decide?  Ah thought the princesses invited her up t' Canterlot so's they could teach her alicorn stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They did,\" Twilight replied, still gently patting Rarity's shoulder.  \"But Nyx said that she wanted to consider other options.  She really wants to use her power to help everypony, but... well, even with the princesses vouching for her, there are still a lot of ponies who think she should have been banished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack nodded.  \"Yeah, takin' over Equestria and two weeks o' night ain't easy t' get over.\"  When Twilight looked at her, she replied, \"Hey, <i>I</i> think those ponies have rocks fer heads, but ah know her.  An' just look at all them Cutie Mark Crusaders.  Most o' them had t' join in secret just on account o' Nyx bein' in the group, but they did anyhow, an' now they're all friends.  Things're bound t' be tough, but she's grown up right, so it'll work out one way or another.\"  After a pause, she remembered the original question and asked, \"So, what DID she decide, Sugarcube?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Twilight said to her friends, \"Well, we spent a few days considering her options. I made charts with the pros and cons of each one and modified for the severity of each factor of course. And I made sure to thoroughly research each one, because I didn't want her to make a decision based on a knee-jerk bias over objective-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TWILIGHT!\" Rarity and Applejack both interrupted in unison as the unicorn started to ramble, snapping her out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sheepishly smiled and continued, \"R-right. Well, eventually, we figured that apprenticing with the princesses was probably for the best. We knew there would be ponies in the capitol who wouldn't want her so close after... after what happened...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe choked a little, still having difficulty talking about how the cult that had created Nyx flooded her with the memories and power of Nightmare Moon that she had been intended to have from the beginning. Nyx... <i>her</i> Nyx, as much as she didn't want to think about it like that, had taken on that role and overthrew the Royal Sisters. Thankfully for all of Equestria, it was because she was Nyx, and didn't have Nightmare Moon's spite and jealousy that she had chosen of her own will to reject the role that had been chosen for her and undo the harm she had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And she doesn't really need lessons on being an alicorn. She still has the latent talent and knowledge. It's just that her mental and physical maturity are based on how much magical power she has, so that'll come back on its own eventually. They just thought that everypony seeing her prove her loyalty to the princesses will go a long way toward showing that she really isn't Nightmare Moon anymore. Not in any way that matters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity beamed happily at the news. \"That's quite an astute observation. She certainly does take after her mother in that regard.\" Twilight blushed at the praise. \"Oh, and just think! The conservatory Sweetie Belle will be attending is within trotting distance.\" Stars started to gleam in the white unicorn's eyes. \"The two of them, bosom friends, together mingling with the <i>creme de la creme</i> of high society! Oh my... oh my, I simply MUST make dear Nyx a suitable gown to match with the one I made for Sweetie Belle! Such a cosmopolitan center of culture and style, it would be an absolute CRIME to send them off without giving them the opportunity to make the best possible impression for their grand debut! And Twilight, how could you have kept this to yourself, knowing that I would have so little time to work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight blinked a few times and opened her mouth to say something, only for Rarity to place a hoof over her lips.  \"Shhh, it's alright, dear. I know you have so much on your mind, and I DO forgive you, but I simply must hurry.\"  Turning to the gathered Crusaders, she called out, \"Sweetie Belle! Sweetie Belle, dear, I'm afraid that I have to dash off to the Boutique!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie Belle looked confused for a moment, but could tell that her big sister was on a mission, so she waved and assured her that she would make it home after the party. As Rarity made it to the door, Pinkie Pie, who was being spun around, quickly pulled her blindfold up and cried out, \"Waaaaaiiiit!  Don't go out yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white unicorn was already out the door, however, and a series of loud bangs and brightly colored flashes filled the library through the windows and open door.  Nyx dropped Pinkie Pie as everypony quickly ran over to look, only catching the last few trails of a fireworks show that backlit Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy as they held up a banner reading \"GOOD LUCK, CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS!\" Fluttershy's end was hanging lower, as she'd reflexively cringed from the display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hay, Rarity?!\" Dash exclaimed, glaring down at the unicorn. \"We've been waiting out here a good half hour setting up, and you go and blow it early!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike, who was down between the two pegasi with an empty box of fireworks, said to the downcast little Crusaders, \"Sorry, everypony, we were expecting you to be coming out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was met with a disappointed \"Awwwww\" from everyone until Pinkie Pie suddenly popped up from behind Spike, somehow having left the library without anypony noticing her pass them by, a second box of fireworks perched on top of her head.  \"Well, it's a good thing I brought backups!\"  This was met with a round of cheers as she set it down, and Spike lit the fuses with a puff of fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a cascade of sparks and streams of light exploded in the skies of Ponyville a second time, Scootaloo took the opportunity to show off by whipping out her scooter, upgraded and adjusted over the past few years, using her wings to give her a quick boost of speed and launch herself up a small rise in the road like a ramp. Hooves clapped together wildly as she flipped around in the air, backlit by a bright, star-shaped explosion, getting a high-five from Rainbow Dash at the apex of the arc. The sound of her fanfillyish squeal on the way down could be heard even over the pops and bangs of the display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown on the ground, Applejack and Apple Bloom sat next to each other, ooohing and ahhhing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie Belle clopped up alongside Rarity and asked, \"You still need to go off to the Boutique?\" Rarity, glancing down at her sister, smiled before putting a foreleg around her and pulling her in for a hug while they shared what would be the last of such moments for a while. \"Well, yes... but it can wait a minute longer,\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx, likewise, made her way to Twilight and leaned down a little to nuzzle her mother. \"You all had this set up for us?\" she asked, amazement in her voice. \"I love you so much, mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was actually as surprised as anyone else, but decided not to say so as she nuzzled back. Her horn lit up with magic as she formed an image in her mind, then cast a spell to shoot it up into the sky. A fond memory from when Nyx was just a little filly, the two of them with Spike and Owlowicious sitting around a storybook. This image then spread out, bringing all of their friends and family into a tapestry that spread across the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too, Nyx. So much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, it came time for those who were leaving for Canterlot to depart. Because of Twilight and Nyx's special relationship with the princesses, a private pegasus-drawn chariot was to be sent down to pick up Nyx and Sweetie Belle. Hugs and well-wishes were shared between everyone present, and an only ever-so-slightly frazzled looking Rarity levitated a pair of packages to her sister and Nyx.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go. It took me all night to finish yours, Nyx, but be sure to put it on before you land. You two will look so absolutely DIVINE, you'll steal the breath of everyone who sees you! I trust you both will act like proper ladies while you're there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two young mares giggled to one another, then replied in unison, \"Of course. Thank you, Rarity,\" both of them performing their finest curtsy, which had her smile in both pride and relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight also presented them with gifts in the form of stacks of books bound together with twine. \"Here, girls, I was able to requisition some books from the library, so you don't need to worry about returning them.\" Sweetie Belle's stack were largely books on music or collections of songs while Nyx's were mostly storybooks, with a few of her fillyhood favorites slipped in. \"And you promise you'll write?\" she asked Nyx.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black alicorn smiled and tried to keep from crying as she thought back to all the times Twilight had read her stories, even once when she was in her fully-grown form. \"Every week, mom. Cross my heart, hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's eyes widened, not having expected that. \"Oh? You know, if you make a Pinkie Pie promise, you'll have to keep it-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FOREVERRRR!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--What she said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx laughed and nuzzled Twilight again. \"I know. I'll definitely keep it.\" They then turned their heads up toward the sky as the moment approached for the chariot to arrive.</span></div></div>",

They just bowed and keep looking straght.

Sitting on the tree was a hoodded figure watching the runes of the Nightmare Moon old throne room as it was slowly falling in on it self.<br>\r\nNyx was uneazy being so close to a dark day in her life.

Nightmare Moon, You barrowed that tittle from the true pony of night.\" He said As he terned back to the land flying by agin. \"I seen the real one your not that impressive.\"  Nyx was taken back word where not that hurtful nor was the tone spiteful, just that he seemed all most didn't care that she plunged the world in to night. even if it was a shourt lived rain. As if it made no diffrents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget him Nyx.

Twilight the element of fraindship. I will enjoy seeing how you live up to that name.\" The hooded pony said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you know of her?\" Sweetie Belle asked with a bit of spite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I trained by her side when she was studying with the princesses She study with the day. I study with Luna at night.\" He said as he pulled his hood back. \"Im Azure, Azure Kage. I be your study partner slash Bodygard untill you take your place at there side.\" Azure said as he shook his hair out of his face. He was a Dark blue Anticorn Colt. With black hair with Crimson in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your a Alicorn?\" Nyx asked suprized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Im a decendent of Luna Personal Bodygard when she was young still.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nyx sat, her turqoise eyes glowing. She narrowed her eyes slightly, watching the alicorn colt with distaste. <i>How dare he. How dare he even suggest he needs to protect us. I am Nyx!</i> She fumed, her ears pinned back to her mane. Azure swiveled his head around, his intense eyes piercing her soul. \"We are about to arrive. When we depart the carraige, you are to stay by me. Understood?\" he blinked at Sweetie Belle, then sat his unwavering gaze back on the horizon. Sweetie Belle rolled her eyes, a smile on her pretty muzzle, and scooted closer to Nyx, shivering in the cold night air. Nyx stood, reaching with her long neck to snag a navy-wrapped parcel with her teeth. She placed it in her lap, then did the same for a purple wrapped package. Sweetie Belle blinked, then levitated the ribbon off the parcel, the paper gently falling. A pale pink gown slid off the wrapping, starry silk glistening in the moonlight. The gentle folds of the skirt descended to the ground, and a silvery strap fell a length, hanging in Sweetie Belle's magic. She quickly gasped, her eyes on the gorgeous garment. Nyx looked with awe and playful envy, admiring the beautiful handiwork of Rarity. Sweetie Belle stood, levitated the dress onto her hide, and smiled. She looked to Nyx with glowing eyes, and laughed, indicating the similarly wrapped package of Nyx's. \"Open yours!\" she cried, and circled Nyx, bouncing up and down. Nyx blinked, and picked up the parcel in her own aqua-blue magic. The wrapping fell away, albeit hastily, and a similarly made, navy blue and purple dress fell out, starry silk sparkling. Nyx slipped into it, and felt herself transform. She watched as her height shrunk, to match that of Sweetie Belle's, if not slightly taller, and as her own dark purple mane straightened, then curled slightly, appearing neat and sophisticated, not like her usual unkempt, stray plait. Nyx's eyes became rounded. \"Trust Rarity to try to protect me.\" she snorted, then ajusted the spell on the dress so that her eyes were the same. She understood the rest, but her eyes were special. They made her different. Nyx huffed slightly, seeing Azure's impressed gaze fall on her. He had a strange look in his eyes, dreamy, almost. Nyx narrowed her eyes, snorted, and looked to Sweetie Belle. Azure shook his head, cleared his throat, and turned back to the sky. Sweetie Belle smiled, trotted to her, and whispered in Nyx's ear. \"You have an admirer.\" she teased gently, and turned away. Nyx grimaced, looked to Azure, and shook her head. <i>He couldn't like me,</i> She thought. <i>Not with my history...I've never had an admirer, before...What good are colts, anyway?</i> She huffed, blushing slightly, and turned away. She staggered slightly as the chariot thudded to the ground, making Nyx blink. As she opened her eyes, she gasped as the hulking mass of Canterlot Castle loomed over them. Nyx regained composure, and stepped lightly out of the golden chariot, dipping her head gracefully to the pegasi driver. Sweetie Belle followed daintily in pursuit, followed by Azure. He blinked at her, then turned his head away. Sweetie Belle sniggered, then trotted off, a few meters ahead. Nyx rolled her aqua eyes, the dragonlike slits making the action strange, and followed at a gentle canter, levitating the hem of the beautiful dress away from the ground. Azure started in surprise, and followed at a brisk gallop, catching up on Nyx quickly, straining to be at her side for reasons other than to be her personal guard.<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx trotted up the marble staircase to the throneroom of Canterlot Castle. Azure was at her side, muscular shoulder brushing hers. Nyx shivered every time they touched. His warm black fur was pleasant for her to touch, and sent a shiver down her spine, making her heat race. Nyx shook her head, trying to shake off the strange feeling, and cantered the last few steps, huffing. As she blinked, panting, at the top, a warm voice reached her parked ears. \"It does take some getting used to. I don't know what the architect was thinking. He must have been fit.\" Celestia's flowing mane shone in the moonlight. Her sister, Luna, stood at her side, equal in height. There was a friendly shine in both their eyes, and Nyx bowed, muzzle brushing the floor. Azure stood at attention, mane flowing, wings and head raised. Nyx glanced sideways, and felt her heart quicken as his eyes met hers. Looking back to the Princesses, she stood, head held high, eyes wary. She was still slightly unsure of the two, and nearly killing them, then banishing them to the moon and sun respectively didn't help the feeling of it. Celestia smiled warmly, and beckoned Nyx closer, wrapping a heavy wing around her.  \"Come. I will take you to your quarters, and Luna will show you around the caste later. In the morning, we will start study. Luna will be your guardian, I your mentor. Azure Kage is your bodyguard, present at your will and when you leave the palace. For now, follow me!\" she said lightly, and trotted off. <i>I wish Sweetie Belle was here.</i> She thought. The unicorn had departed from their company at the heart of Canterlot to settle in at her residence. Nyx trotted off, mane flowing, heart racing as she felt the warm touch of Azure's shoulder. She had feelings for him, no doubt. And so did he.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nyx sat on the large velvet bed, sinking into the covers. She was deep in thought, brows furrowed, when her mind created an image. Muscled, black, with an azure mane and tail, stood Azure Kage, at attention. His glowing horn illuminated the dark night, catching Nyx's eyes in the shadows. He started, then smiled, walking forward with a devilish grin. He laughed, then nodded towards the sunrise appearing over the horizon. \"Walk with me.\" His deep voice rumbled, and he turned. Nyx followed, trotting to keep up with him. She brushed his warm side, and a shiver ran through her body, wanting more. As she went to nuzzle his cheek, a lighter voice broke into her dream. \"You know, I once had a crush.\" Nyx jumped around, blushing deeply, as the navy-blue Night Princess emerged. The dream faded, and Nyx woke, thrashing in the soft covers. She flapped her wings and landed aside the bed, still red. \"P-princess Luna.\" she stammered, bowing before the alicorn. A small smile touched her face, and she walked to the large window which held the perfect image of the full moon. Luna sighed, then turned to Nyx. \"He was all I ever dreamed about. Perfect in every way. My best friend, when Tia and I were...not seeing eye to eye. He comforted me. When I transformed, he was the only one whom did not look to me with hate. He looked to me with concern, with worry. But...a thousand years banishment takes its toll. He is no longer.\" she sighed, then blinked, her purple eyes on Nyx's turquiose. \"If you love him, let him know. You never know what can happen.\" The night princess turned, winking. \"I will return in the morning, to guide you around the castle.\" She winked again, then with a flash of navy magic, disappeared. Nyx sighed, then flopped onto the duvet, wings spread, magic soothing her aching muscles. She groaned with pleasure, and soon her dreams came, filled with images of Azure and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx awoke to the sun in her eyes. Blinking, her catlike pupils dilated, to a wisp. Stretching, she sighed, only to be greeted by the sight of Luna standing aside of the bed. Scrambling to make herself presentable, she levitated her hairband to her head, smoothing her flyaway mane. \"Princess.\" she greeted Luna, dipping her head as she jumped ungracefully from the bed. Her rear hooves caught on the heavy quilt, and she stumbled, landing squarely on her rump with a muffled 'oomph'. Luna snorted and levitated the young alicorn to her feet. \"We have our work cut out for us. Thou shall follow I, when ready.\" The night princess trotted off, mane flowing gracefully, head held high. Nyx scrambled after her, hooves echoing once on the marble floors. Luna blinked tiredly, then led the alicorn to the Sun Princess's private study. With a rap on the door with her magical mane, Luna and Nyx entered the high-ceilinged room. She gasped at the library surrounding them. Books upon books adorned the shelves set on the wall, their covers all different. Nyx went to run to the closest shelf, then stopped herself, remembering where she was. Striding across the room at Luna's heels, she stopped at Celestia's chair, then curtsied. Celestia snorted warmly. \"No need for that every time you see one of us.\" she laughed, then indicated the nearest book stack. \"Today we will start with the history of Equestria. Skim the books, them wait for me.\" Nyx promply levitated the first book, opened it gently, and started reading, her eyes darting across the page at a rapid pace. Celestia looked to Luna, eyes narrowing. \"You are tired. You must sleep, but first, you must tell me what you found last night.\" The sun princess said, casting a silence spell around the two. Luna grimaced, then started. \"It was an intrusion of her privacy. Nothing but...simple dreams?\" she turned away, grimacing, not wishing to expose the young alicorn's secret. Celestia narrowed her eyes, a playful smile on her face. \"Simple dreams...of what?\" Luna sighed. She rolled her eyes, ears twitching. <br>\r\n\"She has...feelings...for a colt...\" she said vaguely, and seeing the expression on Celestia's face, preempted the next question. \"Azure Kage. Desendent of Lapis Lazuli, original Night Guard for Princess Luna. Azure is her personal bodyguard, the colt alicorn. Around her normal age...and...\" Luna stopped. Celestia smiled devilishly, squeezing it out of her. \"And what, Luna?\"<br>\r\n-\"Tia, I really don't think...\"<br>\r\n-\"Luna...\"<br>\r\nCelesta started again. \"Luna, what is it?\"<br>\r\nLuna glared at her, then whispered a jumble of words at rapidfire pace.<br>\r\n\"LapisLazuliwasmycrushbeforeIwasbanishedandheobviouslyfoundsomeoneelseth ereforehercrushwhenIsayherImeanNyx'scrushisdescendedfrommineandforsomereason AzureisanalicornandIthinkInowhavefeelingsforAzureanditsallabigmessnowbutIhavenoc hancebecause...\"<br>\r\nCelestia widened her eyes, somehow keeping up with the jabber. \"Because of what?\" she asked, worried and curious. <br>\r\n\"Because...because...he has feelings for her, too.\" She sighed, and looked away. <br>\r\nCelestia snorted, annoyed. \"You have to fall for him, don't you...nevermind. Luna, keep it to yourself. Being High Princess of Equestria, you need to put these feelings aside and-\"<br>\r\nLuna snorted. \"-And I suppose you have put aside yours for that stallion?\" <br>\r\nCelestia reeled back. \"You know about-I mean, that is different. Our private student, who happens to be an alicorn, does not have a crush on him!\" She lashed back, fuming. Snorting, she turned to Luna, and looked her in the eye. \"You are tired, Luna. Go to bed.\" She removed the silence spell, and trotted over to Nyx. Luna sighed, anger smouldering and dying, then trotted out of the study in the direction of her chambers. Nyx looked up as Celestia approached, then put her nose back to the book, already up to her third. Celestia looked at her, then cleared her throat. \"Nyx Sparkle, tell me, who founded Equestria as we know it today?\" <br>\r\nNyx's eyes shone as she recited the well known Hearth's Warming Eve tale to the Sun Princess, Azure still sitting in the front of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\nOh, I had to put the Lunaloveshimtoo thing in this. <br>\r\n-Phoenix</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nyx sighed, gently shutting the heavy oak door of the Princess's private study. Celestia had drilled her on Equestria, Discord, and all she knew all day. Nyx glanced at the ornate stained glass window, one that depicted the six Elements of Harmony defeating Discord. The sun was just setting over the low hills of the far-off Neighvada. Snorting, wondering how the time had gone so fast, she trotted to her chambers, entering with a flick of her horn. Rustling through her personal belongings, she found a pair of aqua-glass slippers, to protect her hooves. Rooting through deeper, her horn grazed the golden fabric with a sigh. <i>I wonder how Sweetie Belle is. I must visit her...</i> She thought distantly, pushing the cape to the bottom of the chest. Her magic found a black cloak, and she levitated the heavy fabric on, sighing as the dark material made her resemble how she had looked in the days of her reign as the...monster. She shrugged, discarding the memories, and pulled her purple hair back with her headband. Trotting out the heavy doors, she rounded the corner to the throne room, then trotted down the thousands of sparkling marble steps until she was out the huge, ornate, golden palace doors, and into the gardens of Canterlot Castle. <br>\r\n------<br>\r\nHeavy breathing disturbed Nyx's deep thoughts. With a start, she whirled around, teeth bared, relaxing as she saw the black-and-azure form of Azure Kage. He winked at her, a smile on his face, and joined at her shoulder, still puffing. In between breaths, he glared at Nyx. \"You...know...I'm meant to...be at your side...twenty-four/seven...except when in...the castle...or with the...Princesses.\" He breathed out, huffing heavily. With a sharp intake of breath, Nyx apologised. \"I've just been so...free before. I've never had to wait for a guard before...before my...\" She broke off, blushing deeply, embarrassed as she recalled her exploits as a nightmare. Azure just smiled, a twinkle in his eye, and just reminded her of a small, unforgotten fact to Nyx. \"Don't mind me. I'm just a teenage colt, after all.\" He purposely reminded her of their age similarities. Nyx blushed deeper, heart racing, tingling skin. She turned away, feigning hurt, and spread her wingspan wide, gaining altitude fast. She was the one rare pony whom could keep up, and even best, Rainbow Dash, thanks to her almighty wing power and length. As she looped the air, she caught a glimpse of Azure quickly launching, a startled look painted on his <i>beautiful, handsome, gorgeous-Stop it. </i> She harshly told herself, snapping awake. She felt feathers brush her flanks and rump, and saw Azure beside her, taunting her. Their eyes met, and Nyx hovered in the air, Azure drawing closer, green eyes locked on her blue. Nyx flew forward, then smiled, flapping fast, spiraling quickly upwards, gaining height by the second. Azure matched her perfectly, and when Nyx felt the height sufficient, waited for Azure to catch up, he having fallen behind slightly. As he met her height, their eyes locked, cemented to each other's longing gaze. Nyx had never felt the intense passion before, and didn't know how she knew what to do. As Azure drew closer, inch by inch, asking her, Nyx smiled, and flapped forward, so that they were wrapped up in a close embrace. As their eyes met, held together, their lips followed suit, melting into each other. Nyx closed her eyes, and drew in her wings. They were plummeting, held tight together, sharing their lips together. Nyx drew him closer, and they spiraled, down towards the ground.<br>\r\n----<br>\r\nLuna levitated her blue-striped socks onto her hooves, gazing to the moon. She blinked, relishing in her night, and stepped to her balcony, a smile plastered on her face, moonlight warming her. She felt the warmer touch of a magical mane, and sighed contentedly as her sister sat next to her, yawning. \"Another masterpiece, more beautiful than the last.\" Celestia commented, before wrapping a heavy white wing around her sister. They sat together for awhile, watching the stars move. Suddenly Celestia moved her wing to shield her sister's gaze. Luna uttered a muffled squeak, and fought to surface for a glimpse of what the elder had shielded her from. As she burst up, wings spread, she watched as a dark, enterwined shape plummeted towards the ground. She recognized the windswept mane of Nyx Sparkle, and then the bulky shape of Azure Kage. Luna gasped as she realized what they were doing. A kiss. And it wasn't for her, from the colt she loved. A cry escaped her mouth, and Luna fell to the balcony, where Celestia awaited. She hit the cold ground, and she cried, covered by the elder sister's wing. Celestia sighed, realizing her sister's heartbreak. \"You do not know what is good for you, Luna.\" She consoled, stroking her head. \"They are meant to be, dear sister, and I think that you knew. You are so determined, or for want of a better word, plain stubborn.\" She sighed, and curled round her sister, her own tears melding with those of the younger's. The stars flickered twice, then dimmed. With a final blink, they disappeared from the sky.<br>\r\n----<br>\r\nNyx broke apart from Kage as they neared the ground. Flourishing her wings, she gently landed on all fours, breathing heavily. Azure hit the ground, a devilish smile on his face, mildly pleased with himself. He winked at Nyx, and lay down on the ground, ruffling his wings. After a pause, he smiled, winking. \"Well...I wasn't expecting that on our first night. As an emlpoyee guard, I'm not sure that was part of the contract.\" He joked, and walked to her, nibbling an ear, before planting a kiss on her muzzle, then taking to the sky, leaving Nyx alone. With a dreamy sigh, Nyx lay her head on the grass, and summoned a quill and parchment.<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\nDear Mother,<br>\r\nI am enjoying my stay at the castle so far. Celestia has already tested me on my knowledge, and I await the results...I hope  passed!<br>\r\nLuna has been very nice to me. She has shown me around the castle, helped me with...a little problem, and been my guide and friend. <br>\r\nI am coming to Ponyville for a visit tomorrow, Celestia told me I needed a rest. <br>\r\nWhen I visit, I have been issued...a...guard, of sorts. He will be accompanying me and staying with us, I hope.<br>\r\nI do have a little surprise, I will tell you when I arrive. <br>\r\nSweetie Belle is doing fine, and has been taken on as a singing student by Top Note, the head teacher at the conservatorium.<br>\r\nSee you very soon,<br>\r\nNyx<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nNyx stepped off the train with Azure at her shoulder. Over the past months, he had grown to be much more than a guard. He had officially asked her to be her 'coltfriend' the night after their first kiss. Nyx trotted towards the gates, levitating her small bag. Her mane was drawn back with a aqua headband, and in plaits. Her eyes were sparkling with happiness. Azure was equally as happy. As they walked slowly towards the massive tree in the distance, Azure winked, and walked closer to her, so that they were pressed together like in clamps. Nyx rubbed her muzzle along his, and Azure planted a soft kiss on her lips, before dancing away a few steps. Nyx sniggered. \"Good idea. Not sure how Twilight'd take it if we waltzed in the door like    that. She'd grill Celestia, then eat Luna alive.\" Azure looked at her worriedly. <br>\r\n\"Will she take it well?\" He was worried.<br>\r\nNyx snorted, then frowned. \"Not sure, really. I've never..well, had a coltfriend, before.\" She trotted ahead, nearing the library. Azure winked then cast a spell, hiding his wings and donning his royal Nightguard armour. He took on a distant look, flexed his muscles, and pranced forward, magically opening the door. When she stepped inside, she had a brief moment to register that Pinkie had thrown a surprise party before the deafening and almost illegible, muffled cry of 'Welcomehomehappyalicorn-princesstraining' was shouted. Nyx laughed, and trotted forward, only to be tightly embraced by a short, bouncy, pink earth pony. Soon Rainbow, Rarity, Applejack, Twilight, and a shy Fluttershy joined in the warm hug. As the others broke away, Twilight bounced around her, snuggling her, and laughing like an ecstatic Pinkie. \"It's been so long! Nothing's happened around here!\" she cried, and then literally cried. Nyx took a stunned step back, and then squeezed Twilight tight, before letting her gently go. Pinkie, with a loud call of, \"Let's Parrrrttaaayyy!\" started handing out cupcakes of all kinds.<br>\r\n----<br>\r\nLater that night, when the party had dispersed and died, Nyx sat in Twilight's room with Twilight and Rarity, with Azure standing emotionless at her side, like a buff stone statue. Rarity kept looking in his direction, obviously interesed, which pricked Nyx with soft jealousy. Twilight could stand the silence no longer, breaking it with a unwittingly rude, \"Does he speak? What's his name?\" Rarity gasped, and huffed, muttering something about 'No sense around stallions' and the like. Nyx snorted, and flicked Azure with her tail, signalling him to speak. Although they had grown close, he was still her guard and therefore, when in public, had to act like it. He blinked gratefully, and sighed. \"I do speak, Ms. Sparkle. I am Azure Kage, former lieutenant of the Royal Night Guard. I was re-employed to serve Miss. Sparkle.\" He shifted his weight, and Nyx continued. <br>\r\n\"I do have some... embarrassing, uncalled-for and startling news, but that can wait. Azure, stop acting like a guard, and I request that you reveal yourself.\" Nyx teased. Azure sighed, and levitated his armour off, revealing his flowing, bright-blue and red mane, and more importantly, his gorgeous wings. Rarity gazed at him with more intensity, and Twlilight gasped. <br>\r\n\"An alicorn? B-but...\"<br>\r\nAzure rolled his eyes with mock anger. He smiled. \"I am descended from the original Lapis Lazuli, first guard of the Princess Luna, who was an alicorn. I carry that gene.\"<br>\r\nNyx smiled. \"Now, for the embarassing and uncalled-for news...<br>\r\nAzure Kage is my...coltfriend!\" Nyx blushed.<br>\r\nBoth mares gasped.</span></div></div>",

I made charts with the pros and cons of each one and modified for the severity of each factor of course. And I made sure to thoroughly research each one, because I didn't want her to make a decision based on a knee-jerk bias over objective-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TWILIGHT!\" Rarity and Applejack both interrupted in unison as the unicorn started to ramble, snapping her out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sheepishly smiled and continued, \"R-right. Well, eventually, she figured that she wouldn't want to put herself in a position where it looks like she's being shown any kind of favoritism. She didn't want to cause any political trouble for the princesses by making it look like she was being allowed too close to the throne after... what happened... But she thought that it would still help for everypony to see her swear her loyalty to the princesses, so she applied to join the Royal Guard. She thought that starting at the bottom ranks would prove she isn't the power-hungry monster some ponies are still afraid of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity frowned a little. \"Oh my. That hardly seems the place for a proper lady. Are you both sure that it's what's best for her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack added, \"Yeah, I have a second-cousin in the Guard, and he always has horror stories 'bout the trainin' when he comes t' visit. Ah'm not doubtin' she can handle it, o' course, but those ponies take a lot of abuse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight hung her head a little, but put on a brave little smile as she glanced up at Nyx, who was levitating Pinkie Pie and spinning her around for her turn at Pin The Tail On The Pony. \"Yeah, I was worried about that, too. She's a lot tougher, mentally, than when she was little, but she'll be all on her own...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack patted Twilight on the shoulder.  \"Aw, don't worry like that, Sugarcube. Yeah, mah cousin says it's tough, but he also always talks about how he made some of his best friends in the Guard. And considerin' her momma's the biggest expert on friendship in Equestria, ah'm sure she'll get along fine with the other ponies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if she ever feels the craving for more <i>refined</i> company, she and Sweetie Belle will be within trotting distance of one another,\" Rarity assured her. \"And I <i>know</i> that you two will be corresponding, so it isn't as though she'll be all alone.\" This made Twilight's smile widen with gratitude before she blinked over at the game. \"WHAT is Pinkie Pie doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx had apparently decided to play a little joke on the pink earth pony, holding her upside-down with her magic and levitating books to act as a 'floor' while Pinkie walked toward the pony drawing on the wall, seemingly oblivious to the inversion of gravity while the little Crusaders laughed wildly and cheered her on. And yet, when she reached the wall, Pinkie somehow managed to pin the tail exactly on the X anyway, drawing gasps not just from the kids, but from Twilight and the other parents and guardians at the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nyx flipped Pinkie around to place her back on the real floor, the alicorn's jaw was hanging open. \"HOW did you do that?\" she asked, honestly astonished while Pinkie pulled off the blindfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's easy, you just have to HUUAAAAAAAGH!\" Everyone present was startled by the earth pony's sudden gasp as she pointed toward the front windows. \"Look out, there's a giant Ursa Major coming and it's gonna step on the library!!!\" This suddenly threw everyone into a panic, though Twilight and Nyx were the first to throw themselves into action, both of them bursting out the front door, their horns glowing with magic! Neither was going to let anypony to come to harm on their watch, though perhaps they should have noticed more quickly that they hadn't heard or felt any of the telltale signs of such an enormous creature stomping through town. As a result, what they did see took them completely by surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMere moments after stepping out of the library, the sky exploded in a burst of fireworks that backlit Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy as they held up a banner reading \"GOOD LUCK, CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS!\" Fluttershy's end dipped lower as she reflexively cringed from the loud noises, but she kept it aloft anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike, who was down between the two pegasi, grinned and waved before setting off a wave of fireworks with a puff of dragon fire. All the little ponies and their parents rushed outside to gawk as rockets and streamers flew up into the air, exploding in colorful blossoms of fire. \"Oh my gosh, this is perfect,\" Scootaloo exclaimed, taking the opportunity to show off by whipping out her scooter. Upgraded and adjusted over the past few years, she used her wings to give her a quick boost of speed and launch herself up a small rise in the road like a ramp. Hooves clapped together wildly as she flipped around in the air, backlit by a bright, star-shaped explosion, getting a high-five from Rainbow Dash at the apex of the arc. The sound of her fanfillyish squeal on the way down could be heard even over the pops and bangs of the display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown on the ground, the two pairs of sisters sat next to each other, ooohing and ahhhing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx, likewise, made her way to Twilight and leaned down a little to nuzzle her mother. \"You all had this set up for us?\" she asked, amazement in her voice. \"I love you so much, mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was actually as surprised as anyone else, but decided not to say so as she nuzzled back. Her horn lit up with magic as she formed an image in her mind, then cast a spell to shoot it up into the sky. A fond memory from when Nyx was just a little filly, the two of them with Spike and Owlowicious sitting around a storybook. This image then spread out, bringing all of their friends and family into a tapestry that spread across the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too, Nyx. So much. And... I'm still a little worried about the Guard, but I'm sure you'll do great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx smiled. \"Awww, thanks mom, but you don't need to worry. Remember how scared I was of the first day of school? And that turned out to be amazing! I bet Boot Camp will be the same way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoot Camp was <i>awful</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and Sweetie Belle had left in high spirits, saying tearful goodbyes to their friends and loved ones, and she even made a Pinkie Pie promise to write home every week. They then had to part ways from one another after arriving at Canterlot, but Nyx remained optimistic as she reached the recruit processing center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she stood in line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in another line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd filled out a stack of forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen stood in a few more lines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen did some basic physical, magical and flight-speed tests. Being the first alicorn recruit on record, she was required to go through all three. And though she had gotten respectable scores on all of them, blowing the magic test away in particular, the sheer number of tests left her feeling drained by the time she slogged through them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course, with each test came a seemingly exponential increase in the number of forms to be filled out. The earth ponies and pegasi behind her were getting jaw cramps trying to handle them all, and even she and the unicorn recruits who could levitate their pens came out of it feeling like their horns were going to fall off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat made it worse were the stares. She thought she had gotten used to some ponies continuing to regard her with suspicion, as though she would try to take over the world again at any moment. Those she could handle, but what she didn't know how to deal with were the stares of confusion. Fellow recruits kept their distance, not sure what to make of the black alicorn's presence, but apparently afraid to ask. In Ponyville, even those who hated her were at least used to her presence. Here, she felt more freakish and out of place than she had in a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she was made to stand in a line alongside the recruits she had been grouped with, and they were approached by a middle-aged grey earth pony in Guard armor who, despite being shorter than Nyx, was built like a slab of granite and had a stubbly chin that could probably be used to beat somepony to death with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FALL IN, YOU LAZY HORSEFLIES,\" he bellowed. \"MY NAME IS SGT. ROCK JAW, BUT YOU WILL REFER TO ME AS 'SIR, YES SIR!' OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, YOU WILL COME TO KNOW ME AS YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE MADE MANIFEST! I MAY NOT HAVE A HORN ON MY HEAD, BUT IT IS MY SACRED DUTY TO MAGICALLY TRANSFORM YOU GLUE FACTORY REJECTS INTO SOMETHING RESEMBLING REAL PONIES! AND BY CELESTIA AND LUNA'S GRACE, I WILL NOT FAIL IN THIS TASK, EVEN IF IT MEANS GRINDING EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU DOWN TO THE BONE! DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx joined the others in stammering, \"S-sir, yes sir!\" Not to the sergeant's liking, however, as he made them repeat it over and over again until he was satisfied enough to loudly order them into the mess hall for their evening meal. Her vocal chords were too sore to complain as she was passed a tray of something that probably only barely qualified as food, which she weakly levitated over to an empty seat near several other ponies, who quickly moved away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, she started to eat, pretty certain she'd made the wrong decision.</span></div></div>",

Though she experienced quite a bit of emotional and physical pain here, she gradually built up the strength to make it through the chalenges she had to face more easily than at first. As for Flint, they each kept an eye on the other as best they could though they were only together a few hours a day. He was always very timid around everypony but Nyx, if he saw somepony being mean to her he would anonimously cause them to fail inspections or find other ways to quietly get back at them. At times the other ponies made him so nervous Nyx actually had to speak for him. This often caused the other ponies to joke that he was too stupid to speak for himself, but he was very thankful to have her as his friend. These actions only served to bring them closer together. Occasionally Nyx would sneak out at night to be alone with her thoughts. The night was so peaceful and calm. It was a pleasant change from the constant running, yelling and harsh treatment of her everyday life. She might have done it regularly if it weren`t for the fear of what would happen if somepony saw her sneaking out the window one night. Tonight was one such night. She quietly waited for everypony else to fall into a deep sleep before getting out of bed and carefully slipping away. She had been very homesick for a while now. She recalled the stormy night she met Twilight. She was scared beyond description, `till Twilight gently removed her from the bush she was stuck in and took care of the cuts from the thorns. It was so long ago,but she could almost remember every last detail down to what she ate that night. A tear came to her eye as she remembered the day she met Rarity. It was also the day she tried to use magic for the first time (much to her surprise smashing a teacup into the ceiling). She missed her home and everypony there. Just then somepony who was hiding said something.</span></div></div>",

The simple gesture just served to remind her of how long it had been since she had been hugged, and how she had been craving something as basic as the touch of somepony she cared for. Due to the demands of training, she hadn't even had the opportunity to see her friend Sweetie Belle nearly as much as she would have liked, and had almost given up on such comforts. Her forelegs wrapped around Flint's shoulders to return the gesture, which felt so comfortable and right in that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, when she realized what she was doing, Nyx suddenly blushed and nudged him away.

With Flint keeping watch to make sure nopony was around, Nyx cast a very soft light spell, then moved the ball of light away from her horn so that it passed through the window like a Will-O'-The-Wisp, illuminating patches of the interior just enough to see. As the glowball passed near the deeply slumbering Rock Jaw, she caught a glimpse of the corner of a book poking out from under his pillow. \"Found it!\" she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you get it out with your magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx nodded. \"Pretty sure, yeah... I'll have to concentrate, though...\" To get it out from underneath the stallion's pillow would take very precise control to keep him from waking up, and ultimately it would come down to how heavy a sleeper he really was.

Floating it across the barracks toward her, she slipped it out the window and silently beamed as she showed it to Flint, who returned a bright smile of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to wait, and feeling confident that she could get away with it thanks to Rock Jaw's snoring, she magically cracked open the book and flipped through the pages, skimming through it until she found the most recent entry. What she found there, however, caused her spirit to immediately sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I just can't stomach it. I've served princess Celestia for over thirty years, and not once did I ever question my service to her, but this past month has been all but unbearable. I've been doing as ordered, keeping a watchful eye along with the agents she slipped into ranks and biting my tongue while seeing Nyx and Flint get all buddy-buddy with one another. I swore an oath, not just to train my recruits, but to protect them from harm, and watching that monster corrupt one of my ponies just twists my gut! No matter how many times I'm told to simply observe while treating that sick abomination like any other recruit, I feel like my head's going to split open.

'Monster?' 'Sick abomination?' Rock Jaw was always harsh, but had always been harsh to everyone equally. It was something that she could take solace in, that at least she was being treated the same as the others, but that was just a facade covering up that level of hatred? And princess Celestia had sent secret agents to keep an eye on her? How many of those ponies that she and Flint had been planning to impress with this stunt were actually only there to ensure that she didn't go bad again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was lost in thought, Flint poked a hoof toward the fallen book to flip it open again. \"So? What was in it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing!\" Before he could touch it, though, Nyx quickly scooped it up with her magic and put it back inside, floating it back to its spot under the sergeant's pillow.

She had hugged him tightly and thanked him for being her only friend that whole month. Even in the dark, she'd been able to see his shy smile as she watched him slip away. Then she crept back into her bunk and spent the next few hours thinking about what she had read, and what she would do about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>There's never nothing you can do,</i> she'd told herself on that first day, eating alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx didn't know if what she was thinking was a good idea or a horrible one, but wouldn't just do nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSgt.

TODAY IS THE DAY WE FIND OUT WHETHER YOU'RE JUST A FLEA-BITTEN NAG WITH DELUSIONS OF ADEQUACY, OR IF WE'VE MANAGED TO WHIP YOU INTO REAL THOROUGHBRED SHAPE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sergeant bellowed at the recruits from in front of two wooden crates. With a double-legged buck, he kicked open the crates, causing dozens of dull practice weapons to spill out onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TODAY, YOU WILL BE SPARRING AGAINST ONE ANOTHER, UTILIZING ALL OF THE SKILLS YOU HAVE <i>HOPEFULLY</i> LEARNED THUS FAR! EACH SPARRING MATCH WILL LAST UNTIL YOUR OPPONENT EITHER SUBMITS, OR CAN NO LONGER FIGHT! AFTER THAT, ANY PONY THAT CAN STILL MOVE WILL BE PAIRED OFF WITH ANOTHER OPPONENT UNTIL SUCH A TIME AS NOPONY IS LEFT STANDING!\" The grizzled sergeant smirked as waves of unease radiated from the recruits. \"OF COURSE, IF THAT SOUNDS TOO <i>STRENUOUS</i> FOR SOME OF YOU, ANY PONY HERE MAY CHALLENGE ME TO A ONE-ON-ONE MATCH INSTEAD! SHOULD THEY SURVIVE THE EXPERIENCE, IT WILL COUNT AS AN AUTOMATIC PASS, THOUGH I ONLY RECOMMEND IT IF YOU ENJOY THE PROSPECT OF EATING YOUR NEXT FEW WEEKS WORTH OF MEALS THROUGH A STRAW! SO, DO I HAVE ANY VOLUNTEERS?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSgt. Rock Jaw made his way down the line, asking each pony one by one to step up. Most immediately cowed with a quick \"Sir, no sir!\" A small few did try their luck, notably the first unicorn and pegasus recruits that he approached. Perhaps they thought that their natural gifts of magic or flight would give them an advantage over the earth pony, but the unicorn was sent flying by a surprisingly swift body-slam before he even got the chance to cast a spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pegasus lasted slightly longer, but only by flying around out of reach, trying to use her superior speed and mobility to confuse Rock Jaw. When he taunted her by shouting, \"I'M SORRY, TWINKLEHOOVES, IS THIS A SPARRING MATCH OR A DANCE? IF I'D KNOWN IT WAS THE LATTER, I'D HAVE PUT ON MY FANCY DRESS UNIFORM!\" She then tried to come at him from behind while he was shouting, wooden sword in her mouth to get him in the back of the head, only for him to punctuate his taunt with a swift buck behind him. Without even looking, he sent the pegasus spinning end over end before she finally crashed hard onto the ground to be attended by the medics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a chuckle, he turned to the rest of the recruits and continued down the line. \"WELL, NOW THAT I'VE LIMBERED UP, IS THERE ANYPONY ELSE WHO WANTS TO TANGLE WITH THE BIG DOG?! NO? HOW ABOUT YOU, PRINCESS?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had finally gotten to Nyx, who replied with a quick, \"Sir, no sir!\" Just as he was about to move on, however, she added, \"Sir, I wasn't finished, sir!\" All eyes turned to look at her as she glared at the sergeant. \"Sir, if you want a more even fight, why don't you use a real sword... sir!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sergeant set his rather prominent jaw as the other recruits, and even seasoned Guards observing the proceedings gasped in surprise. \"RECRUIT NYX, I THINK I MUST HAVE HAD SOMETHING SUICIDAL IN MY EARS, BECAUSE IT SOUNDED TO ME LIKE YOU WANT A REAL THROW-DOWN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx leaned down a little to look Rock Jaw square in the eye, her own dragon-like gaze challenging him with a hard glint as she whispered, \"Just giving you the chance you've been waiting for since day one, sergeant...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarrowing his own eyes, Rock Jaw whispered back in a quiet, gravelly rumble, \"And where'd you get <i>that</i> notion, missy? Because whatever you think you heard, I'd suggest forgetting about it before you get yourself hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx pulled her head back up and asked in front of everyone, \"Why? Are you <i>afraid</i> you might get shown up, you loud, obnoxious BULLY?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRock Jaw started grinding his teeth so hard that across the field, ponies started wondering if an earthquake was about to start. \"ALRIGHT, HAVE IT YOUR WAY, RECRUIT! DON'T SAY I DIDN'T TRY TO TALK SOME SENSE INTO YOUR PRETTY LITTLE HEAD! YOU! GET MY SWORD!\" He pointed to a startled earth pony recruit who was as stunned as anypony else by the impending showdown, but quickly ran off and returned from Rock Jaw's quarters with a sheathed claymore-sized sword in his mouth. While the recruit held it out toward Rock Jaw, the sergeant grabbed the hilt in his mouth and pulled it out in a smooth flourish. The blade, nicked in several places from hard use, nevertheless shone with a blindingly polished gleam in the sunlight. Around the hilt, he still managed to bellow with only a slight muffling effect, \"GO ON AND USE ANY FANCY TRICKS YOU WANT, MISSY! MIGHT ACTUALLY MAKE THIS A GOOD SHOW FOR THE PEANUT GALLERY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx stared down Rock Jaw. She'd already considered some of her options.

And in the aftermath of the drill sergeant's fall, everypony who was present gathered around Nyx to cheer for their new hero. The alicorn tried to stay calm while they pushed in to congratulate her, but she just couldn't do it. With a happy squeal, she told them, \"Hey, since Rock Jaw cut out early, let's party!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was met with a round of cheers as several earth ponies suddenly hoisted her up onto their backs and carried her back to the barracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoughly an hour and a half later, Nyx was in the middle of the barracks, allegedly dancing to a phonograph's tune. It was playing one of the more popular collaborations between cellist Octavia Philharmonica and her partner, DJ-PON3, and the fusion of classical and techno beats would have had more ponies moving their hooves if they weren't staring in fascinated confusion at the alicorn flailing her limbs around like she was in the throes of an epileptic seizure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet fancy Mareses,\" a bespectacled medic with a balding mane exclaimed as he stepped into the barracks. \"What in the-? *cough* I mean, recruit Nyx, Sgt. Rock Jaw's regained consciousness and wants to see you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a scratching sound as one of the ponies bumped into the phonograph, knocking the needle loose. Everypony stopped what they were doing, including Nyx mid-spasm. Putting all four hooves back on the ground, she looked around at the others. In the last hour and a half, she'd gotten to know her fellow recruits better than in all the time she'd been there before. In fact, aside from Flint, she hadn't even tried to speak to them much, thanks to that disastrous first day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn't known that Emerald Wing's sister was a favorite to win the Best Young Flyer Competition, or that Scribble was an amateur novelist, using his experiences with the Guard as a foundation for a series of short stories. And while she had won the fight with Rock Jaw fair and square, a part of her couldn't help but worry about what would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she walked toward the exit to follow the medic out, she heard somepony tell her, \"We got your back, Nyx!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, no matter what, you stand up to that jerk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were other murmurs of encouragement, and a few started stomping their hooves on the ground as Nyx left the barracks, her heart feeling more steady. Soon, she was led through the door to the infirmary, where Rock Jaw was laying back in one of the cots. Seeing him there, Nyx narrowed her eyes and mentally braced herself for what was bound to be an epic shouting match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, the sergeant simply asked in a very normal and even tone, \"Thanks, doc. You mind leavin' us alone to talk for a bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, sergeant,\" the medic replied, stepping out of the room and shutting the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were alone, Rock Jaw leaned back, crossing his forelegs behind his head as he grinned. \"So, how do you like being everypony's hero?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx just stared for a bit, blinking a few times in confusion. \"Uh... what? I mean... I thought you were going to start screaming at me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you did,\" Rock Jaw replied with a smirk. \"And here I thought I overplayed it durin' the fight. Guess the ol' legend of Rock Jaw's still alive and well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx sat down on her haunches. She was prepared for yelling, but this was so incongruous that it was making her head swim. \"Overplayed...? What... you mean... you didn't...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mean what I was screamin' during the fight? Psh, nah, that was just to keep up the image. Course, you gave me the best scrap I've had since Shining Armor was a recruit, so I can't honestly say I was even coherent for that last bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx rubbed her forehead. \"But... I don't understand. You think I'm a monster!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRock Jaw set his face in a more serious expression and leaned forward to look the alicorn in the eye. \"Listen, kid, and listen close. I've been serving Princess Celestia since I was a colt. If you've got two brain cells to rub together, you must've figured out that I was there when you put us all to sleep and took over. Then I was brainwashed with the rest of the Guard. And after you let us go, I was still raring to pick up my sword and come at you for the princess's sake, because I'm loyal to Celestia to my dying breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But a big part of loyalty some ponies have trouble with is trust. Trust that goes beyond your own personal feelings. When Princess Luna showed up, a lot of ponies in the Guard thought she should've been sent straight back to the moon, and if it'd been my call, that's exactly what would've happened. But it wasn't, so I trusted her highness and accepted her decision. Then you came along and got off with what a lot of ponies thought was a slap on the hoof. Imagine the grumbling over Princess Luna, times twenty. All the fear and wounded pride. Some even said they felt betrayed by the princesses, as if their own hurt feelings counted for more than thousands of years of knowing a thing or two about a thing or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So no, I don't think you're a monster, because I believe in Celestia, and she believes in you. Simple as that. Can't say I didn't enjoy our little sparring match, but considering I never got the chance to fight for my country the first time, you can't really blame me for relishing the opportunity for a rematch. Now are you gonna close your mouth? Can't have a Guard standing around with their jaw hanging open like they're trying to catch flies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx blinked and closed her mouth, not having realized that it was open. \"Sorry, sir. But that still doesn't explain why you wrote what you did in your journal!\" She quickly put a hoof over her mouth, going a few shades paler after realizing she had blurted out her invasion of the sergeant's privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of getting furious, though, he raised an eyebrow at her. \"And how do you know what's in my PRIVATE journal, recruit? No, don't bother backpedaling, I've got a good idea. The truth is...\"</span></div></div>",

Harmony comes from <i>friendship.</i> Y'know how you get friendship quickly when other ponies don't like ya? Ya earn <i>respect.</i>\" Rock Jaw waved a hoof dismissively. \"You'd be surprised how many friends I have, missy, and most of them are recruits I used to yell at, because they're better now, thanks to all that. Sometimes, the best kind of friend out there is the one who gives you encouragement. But you can't survive on a friend's encouragement alone, you need your own courage, your own strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eons ago, or however long it was before the Princesses were born, and even before Discord began his rule, ponies never stuck together. They'd congregate on small groups to mate, and then they'd scatter like grain on the wind. Didn't matter back them that most wouldn't survive, 'cause that's how life was. Then, they started travelling in bigger and bigger groups, until they were roaming around in herds of thousands at a time. And there, in the very thicket of history being made, a concept so new it didn't have a name yet was invented. Two concepts, actually. Family and friendship. Back then, a pony could survive into adulthood if they were cunning enough, or had enough other ponies around to use as shields. Then, when the herds got so big it was almost impossible to think of surviving on your own, There'd start to be order. A certain degree of comradeship that fostered and grew until the first recorded piece of magic not done by unicorns was recorded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat magic was the magic of love, friendship, and family. An earth pony mare fended off a fully grown dragon just by yelling at it, screaming at it, until a burst of light flew forth from her heart, scaring it away. She was protecting her daughter, and it was a phenomenon that happened more and more often as the herd mentality ponies had developed became something more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRock Jaw cleared his throat and picked up the glass of water on his nightstand, taking a small sip. \"The bottom line is that when the need was great, a pony was able to throw themselves in front of their friends, and guard them. We go a little bit further than that, here in the Royal Guard. We stuff a bunch of ponies in a sardine can so they have nothing to do <i>but</i> make friends, or get on each other's nerves. But you were the exception. So, taking note that you were pretty buddy-buddy with Flint, I got one of his bunk mates to yammer about my journal, and then waited. I didn't expect anything to come of it so quickly, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRock Jaw smiled, an honest smile. \"Now, I'm proud that you've gotten on the other recruits' good sides, but don't worry.\" His smile turned into a sinister, teasing smirk. \"I'm gonna push your horn to the grinding stone so hard that yer pretty little hoofsies will be sharp as a tack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx grinned, snapping off a salute as she straightened up. \"Sir, yes of course, sir!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I made myself clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clear as crystal 'neath the full moon, sir!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now get your poetic flank outta here before I court-martial you for taking away from my beauty sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx left the room, suppressing her laugh of relief until she was back out front of her barracks. \"Hey, uh... N-nyx?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" Nyx looked over her shoulder to see Flint standing there, pawing at the ground nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering...\"</span></div></div>",

Then, her eyes shot wide. \"Oh my gosh, I don't know <i>when the date is!</i> Oh, what am I gonna DO?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you what you're gonna do. You're gonna tell one of the other recruits to send a message to whoever asked you out, and deliver it. Make it so only the pony you send it to can read it, I don't know, but then you're gonna sit with me, and we'll go over your outfit. Once we got that done, and we know when your date is gonna be, you'll be all set!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... I...

She thought it was a strange place to meet, but she had other things to worry about at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlint arrived just seconds after her. He arrived out of breath. He had sprinted the whole way there because it took longer than he expected to get ready. He was wearing a black suit and tie that were just slightly too big for him. Despite this he looked quite nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi.\" they both said at the same time before exchanging looks in an attempt to decide who should speak first. He then used his magic to open a trap door disgiused by the tile floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A long time ago, the royal guard built shelters like this to keep ponies safe in an emergency. We've had som issues since, but none bad enough for us to have to use them. Everypony's forgotten about most of them.\" explains Flint, attempting to sound calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe motions for her to go down the stairs with him and under about ten feet of solid stone, she soon sees a surprisingly nice shelter light by candles. In it a table was set for them. There was a makeshift wooden wall between them and the kitchen area. Both of them struggle to hide thier nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of 'emergencies'?\" asked Nyx. As she finnished her question, she was surprised  by the muscle bound blue earth pony who walked up to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Linguini. We're ready now\" said Flint to the blue pony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they did it to prepare for a variety of situations. If the parasprites got out of hoof or if Discord returned to power or for some other reason ponies were no longer safe in their homes, everypony would be able to hide in shelters like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two ponies talked and gradually relaxed. It was turning out to be a very enjoyable evening for both of them until, right after Linguini brings them thier food, what sounds like an air raid siren sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh buck!\" shouts the blue pony as he runs for  the stairs.

She knows that if she went anywhere near the capitol, all the ponies who thought the princesses let her off too easily would start making hay about it all over again, and that would be right there with the princesses to vouch that she's reformed. Everywhere else, she was afraid of starting a panic just by showing up.\"  The unicorn let out a little chuckle. \"Plus, you know curious she is about the world. So she figured that as long as everypony is afraid she'll become Nightmare Moon again, maybe she should travel somewhere where there aren't many ponies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, traveling abroad? How romantic! Oh, darling, you should have told me sooner! If she's going to be visiting other cultures, then she should represent the best of our own. I simply MUST prepare a fine dress for her to wear when she arrives! First impressions are so very important, you know, and I just received a shipment of sapphires that will look absolutely DIVINE on Nyx.\" Rarity then stood up and called out to her little sister, \"Sweetie Belle, I have to dash off to the Boutique for a few hours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie, who was being spun around in the air, quickly pulled her blindfold up and cried out, \"Waaaaaiiiit! Don't go out yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity, who hadn't had a chance to get very far, blinked and asked, \"Whyever not?\" A question that caused Twilight to arch an eyebrow and ask their bubbly friend, \"Yeah, why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobbing around in the air, Pinkie Pie stammered, \"W-well, because... we haven't had CAKE yet!\"  Quickly zipping out of Nyx's telekinetic field, she moved back into it just as quickly, but this time holding a large five-layer cake in her hooves. All of the Crusaders cheered, including Nyx as she dropped Pinkie, and everypony gathered around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five oldest Crusaders were the first to get their pieces, and started munching on them. \"Mmm, this is so good! Thanks, Pinkie,\" Nyx said, watching the younger Crusaders line up for their slices next. Something seemed a little odd, though. She swallowed a mouthful of moist, chocolatey deliciousness before asking, \"Hey, where's Spike?\" She would have expected to see him at least lining up for a piece of his own, but had lost track of her draconic 'sibling' while spinning ponies around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight looked around as well, sharing the confusion. \"That's weird. Where DID he go? And where's Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy for that matter? I know they were here just a little while ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, maybe it was a mirage! Or an illusion! Maybe Fluttershy showed Dash a rabbit hole that sucked them into a parallel dimension where everything's topsy-turvy, and nothing makes sense! Here, have some cake,\" Pinkie Pie interjected, quickly shoving a slice of cake in front of the other three. Right at that moment, an irate Rainbow Dash threw the door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hay, Pinkie? How long are we supposed to wait out there? I'm looking forward to that...\" Her eyes widened, and her mouth opened as she saw the cake being served up. Then she narrowed her eyes in a cold glare, pointing accusingly at the pink earth pony. \"You were supposed to wait until after! CAKE TRAITOR!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie meeped as Rainbow Dash tackled her, Fluttershy timidly poking her head inside while Dash and Pinkie tussled, holding onto one end of some sort of banner. \"Umm... am I supposed to still be holding this...? I can fly with my end, but I don't think it would be very legible that way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash ended up knocking toward the doorway, where she tripped over the banner Fluttershy was holding, sending her tumbling outside. Moments later, a series of loud whistles and explosions filled the library as fireworks went off, illuminating the night sky with a festival of colors that all the little Crusaders and their parents had to rush to the windows or out the door to see, sadly only catching the last few streams of color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below the fading smoke trails of the display, an embarrassed Spike waved to them standing next to an empty box. \"Uh... heh... sorry, I kinda jumped the gun there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her spot on the ground, though, Pinkie Pie somehow produced a second box full of fireworks. \"It's okay,\" she exclaimed in her usual perky way. \"I brought backups!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Spike and Pinkie Pie got the second display started, the rest of their friends settled down on the grass to watch, chuckling at the comedy of errors that had led to that moment. Leaning over toward where Twilight and Nyx were sitting, Applejack asked, \"So, Nyx. Twilight tells us you're goin' abroad for a little while. Where'd y'all plan on headin'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx looked over to her mother, knowing she'd see the worried smile that was on the purple unicorn's face. Putting a foreleg around Twilight in a loving hug, she replied, \"Well, princess Celestia already knows about it, so she arranged for me to visit...\"</span></div></div>",

It was part of a journey they and Rainbow Dash undertook to save my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"<i>What?!</i>\" Nyx exclaimed, drawing startled looks from some nearby ponies. \"Save your - what are you talking about?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rarity coughed, and began to explain. \"You see, Nyx, on Plowpony's Day several years ago, Twilight decided she wanted to try and teach me teleportation. Now, I told her that it wasn't necessary, that I had no desire to be a great mage, unlike her or...\" she grimaced \"...<i>Trixie</i>. After my first attempt ended in spectacular failure, I swore it off. Twilight, though, just would not listen to me. She ran back to the library to get... what was it, Twilight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Magical lubricant,\" Twilight replied. \"It's meant to be used as an aid for unicorns who are having trouble learning how to teleport. I opened it up to check if it was still good, and didn't close it all the way. I tried teleporting with it back to the field.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx winced. She'd used the stuff once or twice after being stripped of her power as Nightmare Moon, and Twilight had explained how dangerous it could be if used improperly. \"Let me guess... boom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight nodded, and Rarity picked up the tale. \"The explosion could be felt and seen all the way out at the field. Being the good friends we are, all of us dashed to the library. We found Twilight and Spike, and they were mostly unharmed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uh, 'mostly'? That doesn't sound promising,\" Nyx said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It isn't,\" Twilight said with a wince at the memory. \"Turns out trying to teleport with a partially-opened tube of lubricant is a really bad idea. Not only did I cause an explosion - something I hadn't done since my early days as Princess Celestia's apprentice - but it gave me a case of Horn Rot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx winced. \"Ouch. And considering how powerful in magic you are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah. Zecora told me I had, at most, two-and-a-half weeks before the Horn Rot would run its course. The normal cure takes three weeks to brew.\" Twilight sighed. \"I thought I was a goner, until Zecora mentioned the Beneviolet, a flower that could reverse the effects. The problem was that the Beneviolet exists only in the Archback Mountains, far past the borders of Equestria. Past Gildedale, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rarity picked up the thread again. \"I was feeling guilty about Twilight hurting herself trying to help me, so I offered to go along with Applejack and Rainbow Dash to find the Beneviolet. We ended up journeying through Gildedale and the Shimmerwood on our way to the Archbacks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Applejack cut in. \"Durin' our stay in Gildedale, we met some of the local ponies, includin' their prince, Ashtail. We managed ta solve a problem they'd been havin' fer a long while, now. See, there are these creatures in Gildedale called komagas, which stampede across the plains fer a month at one point in the year. Thing is, the ponies there didn't know what a stampede was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx grinned. \"But with you there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Applejack returned the grin. \"Yep, we managed ta turn away a big herd of 'em before it could hit the capital, Thatchhome. Earned us quite a bit o' respect from their king, Hammer Hoof. He said the three of us would always be welcome in Gildedale.\" Her eyes grew wistful. \"Sometimes, ah think about goin' ta visit, see how things are doin'...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Visiting your coltfriend?\" Rainbow Dash snickered from above, startling the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"RAINBOW DASH!\" bellowed Applejack, incensed. \"What in tarnation d'ya think yer doin', startlin' us like that?!\" She glared up at the cackling pegasus. \"An' he AIN'T mah coltfriend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rainbow landed, still snickering. \"I heard you all talking about Gildedale, and I thought I'd chip in my two cents.\" She leaned up to whisper in Nyx's ear. \"AJ was rather fond of Ashtail, from what I saw.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Applejack was preventing from lunging at the pegasus by a combined aura of blue and purple magic. \"Applejack, Rainbow's just trying to rile you up,\" Twilight said. \"Don't rise to her bait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx chuckled. \"Well, I'll be sure to pass Ashtail your regards, if you want, Applejack,\" she said. The farmpony blushed, but nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The next day, the Crusaders left town, each heading their seperate ways. Nyx flew toward the Drackenridge Mountains, the natural border between Equestria and Gildedale. She carried with her a care package from Applejack, Rarity, and Rainbow Dash. Each of them had contributed something different. From Applejack, there was a bushel of apples, and a letter to Ashtail. From Rainbow Dash, a vial of liquid rainbow from her cloud-home's fountain. And from Rarity, a mane-care kit addressed to 'Shield Maiden and her grey filly', a designation that puzzled Nyx. Still, she flew strong, hoping to reach Gildedale before the day was out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was almost guiltily that Nyx proved Rainbow Dash right: It was easier to get over the Drackenridge Mountains by air than by ground, even with the gale-force winds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Nyx had pestered the three of them for details, Dash had shown her the trick she could do with lightning, and Nyx was definitely impressed when she <i>dashed</i> all the way up to Canterlot and then back with a letter to Twilight from Celestia, as well as one to Rarity from Falalauria, who had somehow known Dash would be dropping by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack had regaled Nyx with stories of Hammer Hoof's might, and even Ashtail's prowess with a lasso, once he knew what one was, and the times he had visited Sweet Apple Acres to see how she farmed. \"He was mighty impressed when he saw not only how strong I was, but also how gentle I could buck-\" Dash snickered- \"Mah trees, and DAMMIT, Dash!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dash and Applejack traded blows, Rarity spoke excitedly about their advances in fashion ever since she had done up a few designs for the ladies in the Eastern Quarter. Nyx's attention was drawn away when Dash tried to zap-tackle Applejack with her lightning run, only to bounce off and shoot off, out of town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came back a few minutes later with a bag of bits and a 'first prize' medal hung around her neck. When asked where she'd been, Dash had just shrugged, saying she'd won a race in Las Pegasus, a bet in Skybet*, and performed as a shooting star in the background for a movie being shot. As an aside to Rarity, it was a romance film she'd like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx shook off the memories of that morning, and started searching for her welcome party. Dash had sent word ahead, and she was expecting a small group, maybe around a campfire. All she could see was the beautiful golden grass, and a large patch of dirt below her. Banking sharply, she-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"LADY NYX, WE WELCOME YOU!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WELCOME!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx realizes that the large, square patch of what she thought to be dirt was actually a large formation of ponies, all with dull or mottled brown, gray, and tan coats. She alights in front of two ponies at the front of the company of mares and stallions, where two gray mares, the older with a shield on her flank, and the younger with an open mouth, where you could see the uvula. \"You must be Shield Maiden, and her daughter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger mare- no, she was just a big filly- nodded, smiling happily. \"My name is Mountain Voice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx blinked. \"Mountain Voice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I went over the mountains to visit the pegasususes-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pegasi,\" Nyx corrected unconsciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-and the unicorns, and on the way back, we got trapped in the snow, so I yelled, and <i>yelled, and <b>yelled, and <u>yelled</u></b></i> until somepony heard us, and came to help us. When I was pulled out of the snow, I had my Cutie Mark!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx smiled, impressed. \"That's amazing. You know, I can use the <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>ROYAL CANTERLOT VOICE</b></font> as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep Voice giggled. \"If that's the Royal Canterlot Voice, than <font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>IT IS WEAK! TROOPS! YOU WILL LINE UP BEHIND SHIELD MAIDEN, OUR GUEST, AND MYSELF! MOVE!\"</b></font> Nyx barely had the time to blink before everypony was galloping as fast as equinely possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx levitated the basket next to herself, keeping it level. She turned to Shield Maiden. \"I thought that Captain Ashtail would be here,\" she shouted, though her voice sounded small against the thundering of hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! He's with his father in Thatchhome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*For all intents and purposes, it's pronounced like Tibet, but with the 'skih' sound.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Twilight said to her friends, \"Well, we spent a few days considering her options. I made charts with the pros and cons of each one and modified for the severity of each factor of course. And I made sure to thoroughly research each one, because I didn't want her to make a decision based on a knee-jerk bias over objective-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TWILIGHT!\" Rarity and Applejack both interrupted in unison as the unicorn started to ramble, snapping her out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sheepishly smiled and continued, \"R-right. Well, eventually, she decided that as much as she would like to prove her loyalty to the princesses directly, she was worried that getting too close to the capitol would cause political problems from those who think she should have been punished more severely. Celestia and Luna vouching for her would go a long way, but would also make some ponies raise questions about the fairness of their decisions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still wants to prove that she wants to help everypony, though, so she decided to apply for a law-enforcement job in another city. By enforcing Equestrian law far away from the princesses, she hopes to prove that she doesn't have any desire to take the throne again, and build a reputation that'll eventually overshadow... everything everypony remembers about Nightmare Moon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack put a hoof on Twilight's shoulder as the purple unicorn's voice broke slightly. \"Ah, it'll be okay, Sugarcube. Ah can't wrap mah head around all that politics mumbo-jumbo, but it sounds lahk y'all've put a lot o' thought into it. That gal's got her head screwed on right, so ah'm sure it'll work out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed,\" Rarity said supportively. \"Though with Sweetie Belle in Canterlot and Apple Bloom and Twist staying here in Ponyville, I imagine you must be so worried about her being lonely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight perked up a little, thanks to her friends and their kind words. \"Actually, Nyx and Scootaloo will be going together. You know how she is about pursuing a serious racing and stunt career, so they arranged to go to the same city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's MARVELOUS,\" Rarity exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack chuckled. \"Yeah, ah can just imagine the trouble THOSE two'll get into on their own, but at least they'll have each other.\" She looked toward the game being played and arched an eyebrow so high that it raised the brim of her hat. \"Speakin' of trouble, what the hay is Pinkie Pie doin'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx had apparently decided to play a little joke on the pink earth pony, holding her upside-down with her magic and levitating books to act as a 'floor' while Pinkie walked toward the pony drawing on the wall, seemingly oblivious to the inversion of gravity while the little Crusaders laughed wildly and cheered her on. And yet, when she reached the wall, Pinkie somehow managed to pin the tail exactly on the X anyway, drawing gasps not just from the kids, but from Twilight and the other parents and guardians at the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nyx flipped Pinkie around to place her back on the real floor, the alicorn's jaw was hanging open. \"HOW did you do that?\" she asked, honestly astonished while Pinkie pulled off the blindfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's easy, you just have to HUUAAAAAAAGH!\" Everyone present was startled by the earth pony's sudden gasp as she pointed toward the front windows. \"Look out, there's a giant Ursa Major coming and it's gonna step on the library!!!\" This suddenly threw everyone into a panic, though Twilight and Nyx were the first to throw themselves into action, both of them bursting out the front door, their horns glowing with magic! Neither was going to let anypony to come to harm on their watch, though perhaps they should have noticed more quickly that they hadn't heard or felt any of the telltale signs of such an enormous creature stomping through town. As a result, what they did see took them completely by surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMere moments after stepping out of the library, the sky exploded in a burst of fireworks that backlit Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy as they held up a banner reading \"GOOD LUCK, CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS!\" Fluttershy's end dipped lower as she reflexively cringed from the loud noises, but she kept it aloft anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike, who was down between the two pegasi, grinned and waved before setting off a wave of fireworks with a puff of dragon fire. All the little ponies and their parents rushed outside to gawk as rockets and streamers flew up into the air, exploding in colorful blossoms of fire. \"Oh my gosh, this is perfect,\" Scootaloo exclaimed, taking the opportunity to show off by whipping out her scooter. Upgraded and adjusted over the past few years, she used her wings to give her a quick boost of speed and launch herself up a small rise in the road like a ramp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to help her friend, Nyx launched herself up into the air to intercept Scootaloo, pushing up under the bottom of the pegasus pony's scooter to give her an extra boost. Hooves clapped together wildly as she flipped around in the air, capping the highest tip of a bright, star-shaped explosion, then getting a high-five from Rainbow Dash at the apex of the arc. The sound of her fanfillyish squeal on the way down could be heard even over the pops and bangs of the display as Dash and Nyx flew underneath Scootaloo to bring her back down to the ground with her held aloft like a celebrity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown on the ground, the two pairs of sisters sat next to each other, ooohing and ahhhing at the impromptu display of showmanship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Nyx made it back to her mother, Twilight laughed and said, \"I can't believe you pulled that off on the spur of the moment!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx laughed as well, leaning down to nuzzle Twilight. \"I can't believe you set up all these fireworks for us. I love you so much, mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight was actually as surprised as anyone else, but decided not to say so as she nuzzled back. Her horn lit up with magic as she formed an image in her mind, then cast a spell to shoot it up into the sky. A fond memory from when Nyx was just a little filly, the two of them with Spike and Owlowicious sitting around a storybook. This image then spread out, bringing all of their friends and family into a tapestry that spread across the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too, Nyx. So much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, everyone big tearful goodbyes and well wishes to their friends and loved ones. Nyx made a Pinkie Pie promise to write home every week before she and Scootaloo got on the train that would take them to their destination. They both leaned out the window, waving as the train started to chug along out of the station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScootaloo could barely contain her excitement as she sat down, bouncing on her seat. \"I can't believe it. We're doing this! We're REALLY doing this! Nyx, this is gonna be the best time of our LIVES!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx giggled, smiling fondly as she watched Ponyville slowly vanish over the horizon. \"Eh... I'd be fine with second best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were on their way to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===============<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Appleoosa. It's grown into a boom town with a newly built racetrack, and Nyx can learn about frontier justice from the sheriff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Manehattan. The big city is bound to be full of wonders, and could surely use another friendly neighborhood policemare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Las Pegasus. A hotspot of entertainment, tourism, and absolutely no organized crime! Nope, just look somewhere else!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Fillydelphia. Current record holder for highest windspeed in a hurricane. The area's a bit of a disaster magnet.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The train whistle blew as it pulled into Manehattan Central Station, gradually slowing to a stop. Nyx and Scootaloo filed out with the rest of the passengers and looked around in awe. The two of them had gotten dressed in some clothes that Rarity had made for them as a farewell gift. Elegantly tailored dresses and wide-brimmed hats that she had assured them gave them a 'high-society allure'. In Nyx's case, this also covered her horn so that aside from her unusual eyes, she simply looked like an unusually large pegasus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of them carried their luggage out of the station with the handles in their mouths, both of them nearly dropped their bags as they gaped at the city around them. Even though Canterlot was more grand in the sense that it housed the Royal Palace and the manor homes of the aristocratic elite, the sheer number of immense buildings towering over them was an astonishing sight. Moreso because in stark contrast to Equestria's capital or smaller towns like Ponyville, Manehattan was a <u>busy</u> place, seemingly every inch of it bustling with activity. The two friends had to take extra care not to get separated from each other in the constantly moving crowds outside the station while at the same time being nearly overwhelmed by the sheer scale of everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a result, they didn't notice the pony that had been waving to them until he walked right up and tapped Nyx on the shoulder. \"Excuse me, miss...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx turned to look, seeing a purple earth pony in a chauffeur's uniform. Hanging from his neck was a sign reading:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><span style=\"font-family:arial, sans-serif\">Scootaloo<br>\r\n&amp; Nyx</span></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Yes, that's us,\" Nyx replied. \"And you are...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cobblestone, miss,\" the chauffeur replied. \"Mister Orange sent me to take you to your apartment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe earth pony pointed to the most ornate carriage either of the mares had ever seen, causing Scootaloo to actually drop her luggage this time as she squealed, \"Oh, wow, this is so awesome! Next time we see Applebloom, remind me to give her a big hug!\" Nyx was surprised too as Cobblestone picked up the fallen bag and put it inside the carriage. Applebloom had told them that she had well-to-do relatives in the city who would help them get a good deal on a place to stay, but knowing the down-to-earth Apple clan as she did, Nyx simply hadn't been able to imagine this sort of extravagance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Nyx and Scootaloo were in the carriage, Cobblestone hitched himself to it and started taking them down the busy streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't very far, but because of the teeming traffic, it took them about half an hour to reach their destination. Not that either of the mares were complaining, as it gave them a chance to get a good look at the city as they went. When they pulled up in front of a huge apartment building, Cobblestone took their luggage while a uniformed stallion in front of the building opened the door and tipped his hat to them. This caused Scootaloo to stop for a moment to ask him, \"Hey, is this your job?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorstallion blinked, but then replied, \"Well, yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're paid to just stand here outside the building all day and pull the door open?\" the pegasus asked with a raised eyebrow. \"Even though I'm pretty sure most of the ponies who live here can do something as simple as open doors for themselves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More or less. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScootaloo squealed excitedly. \"This is <i>so</i> awesome! Nyx, we've got a guy to open doors for us! Forget what I said before; next time I see Applebloom, I'm <i>kissing</i> her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx chuckled a little and shooed her friend inside, replying, \"Careful, Scoot, or I'll hold you to that.\" To the doorstallion, she said quietly, \"Sorry about that, she's just really excited.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all,\" he replied with a bemused grin and a tip of his hat. \"It's kind of refreshing, actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a trip up the elevator, which was a novelty in itself for the two, Cobblestone led them to their apartment, which caused them to gape anew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luna's mane...\" Nyx exclaimed breathlessly, \"It's practically bigger than the library! How are we supposed to afford this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCobblestone set their bags down and replied, \"This building is one of Mr. Orange's properties, Ms. Nyx. He wanted me to assure you that you would be getting a significant discount on the rent on account of your ties with the family.\" To Scootaloo, he added, \"And from the trolley stop at the corner, it's just a ten minute ride to Big Orange Technical, Ms. Scootaloo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pegasus was still stunned by the apartment, but nodded along. She had been accepted to the college on a scholarship program. In exchange for joining the school's racing team, she would be able to get attention from talent scouts as well as classes in aerodynamics and engineering that would help her go professional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much, Mr. Cobblestone,\" Nyx said as he handed her two copies of the apartment keys. \"And please give Mr. and Mrs. Orange our thanks, too!\" He smiled and nodded, leaving the apartment to let the mares get acquainted with their new home. Looking around, Nyx smiled. It was almost too good to be true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...</span></div></div>",

He opened up a file drawer and pulled out a thick sheaf of documents, flipping through them one by one. \"According to our records, that was supposed to be a rejection form. I'm afraid it happens, sometimes. The system is supposed to catch these things, but every so often a mistake filters through the net. Ah, here we are.\" He pulled out the letter of application that Nyx had sent a month previously, showing it to her along with the large <span style=\"font-family:impact, fantasy\">DENIED</span> stamped across it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... why...?\" Nyx asked, her heart sinking like a stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReading a hand-written note attached to the forms out loud, the clerk replied, \"'Though the applicant has been legally absolved of the counts of high treason against the crown, we must deny her application. The public outcry over having such a high-profile criminal in our ranks would be a permanent stain on this department's image. Not to mention the effect this would have on the morale of our officers. Don't include this in the rejection letter, though. The last thing we need is a ticked-off... alicorn...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk trailed off, eventually realizing his mistake as he looked nervously over at Nyx. Instead of getting angry, though, the black mare hung her head lower and lower with every word. \"I... I see...\" she muttered quietly in a manner more befitting Fluttershy. Slowly turning away, Nyx walked out of the building, her heart crushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had honestly thought this was different. She had sent out applications all over Equestria, and Manehattan had been the only department to accept. She pulled out the letter she had received again and looked it over. The tone of it was so positive. So proud to have her. But it had all just been a mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking her way into a small alley so no one would see her, Nyx clenched her eyes shut. She then started ripping apart the letter while berating herself for putting all her hopes on this false chance. \"I should've figured... everyone else sent a rejection, so I should've known it was a clerical error...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, though, she heard something that broke her from her depressed thoughts.</span></div></div>",

Who's there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone who knows the real reason you got turned away. You being here scares the wrong ponies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx glared down the alley. She couldn't see anyone. A Throw-your-voice spell, maybe? \"Yeah, the clerk in there said as much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not the citizens,\" the disembodied voice replied. \"And not the cops. I'm talking about the ones who have their hooves in some dirty business, but they're never afraid of getting arrested because they make big donations to the Copper's Ball every year.\" When Nyx blinked in surprise, the voice added, \"Don't look so shocked. The Orange family aren't the only ponies of wealth and influence in this city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx narrowed her eyes. <i>Now</i> she was getting angry. \"Oh yeah? Well, I've got connections, too. If that's how they want to play it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then they'll just wait patiently for the right time to destroy your life, and the lives of everyone you care about,\" the voice replied. \"The ponies I'm talking about know how to work the system. The more powerful ones practically <i>built</i> the system. If you call in favors from the Royal Sisters, they'll just keep their noses clean for a little while. You don't even know who they are, let alone have any evidence they've done anything wrong. But it'll disrupt their business just enough to annoy them, and the next thing you know, Scootaloo gets busted with some illegal substance on her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear mixed in with the anger at the mention of Scootaloo's name, which the disembodied voice apparently saw. \"That's right, I know about your friend. And that means <i>they</i> know about her, they just don't care enough to make a move unless you give them a reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But <i>why</i>? Why target me like this? I haven't done anything to them, yet. What am I supposed to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for 'why', you just answered your own question. You haven't bothered them <i>yet</i>, but you would, given the chance. You had Equestria in your hooves. But then you gave it back. They can't understand why anyone with that kind of power would ever just give it up, but the smarter ones know that it means you're trouble. Ponies with real integrity always bother them, but when it comes with the strength and connections to put that integrity into practice, that <i>terrifies</i> them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a pause, the voice continued, \"As for what you should do, that's up to you. If you try to get any kind of job that might give them grief, you'll find yourself blackballed in ten seconds flat. Honestly, the smart thing to do would be to just get back on the train and head home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx grimaced. She had come all this way in order to become someone who protected ponies from harm. But fighting off monsters from the Everfree Forest was very different from this sort of corruption. It certainly would be easier to go back home and deal with threats that she could actually hit back against. But instead, she replied, \"Then I must have taken my stupid-pills this morning, because I think this is exactly why I need to stay here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't see the expression on the face of the voice's owner, of course, but they sounded pleased as they said, \"I was rather hoping you'd say that. It won't be easy, though. These ponies got where they are in the first place by knowing how to get away with things. You'll be blackballed from any job that might let you give them trouble, and you can't openly make a move since... well, let's face it. You have some very distinct features.\" There was a pause before the voice added, \"I need to go. But I'll be in touch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx nodded. \"Duly noted... but who <i>are</i> you? And why did you tell me all this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe received no reply, however. Left alone in the alley, she looked at the torn-up remnants of her acceptance letter. She then set her jaw and headed back out onto the street. She couldn't say she really knew what was going to come of it, but she had an idea and several hours before Scootaloo was scheduled to get back to the apartment to put it into motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she had returned to the apartment, Nyx took the dress and hat she had worn the previous day. With a sigh, she whispered, \"Sorry, Rarity, but it's for a good cause,\" as she took some scissors and began cutting up the dress, along with some of the other clothes she had brought with her. Whoever the voice was, they were right about one thing. There weren't any other solid black alicorns with turquoise dragon eyes running around, so if she was going to do anything, it couldn't be as Nyx. No... she would become someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a story her mother had told her when she was a filly. Not one from any book, but from Twilight's life. A legend that she and her friends had created as part of one of their zany adventures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours of work, cutting and sewing the material into a new form, Nyx slipped herself into a dark full-body with holes for her wings. She then put on a pair of goggles and a scarf she had bought on the way home. Topping it off with the wide-brimmed hat Rarity had made, Nyx looked at herself in the mirror. In the reflection, she saw a tall pegasus, the hat keeping her horn hidden while the tinted goggles masked her unusual eyes, and the scarf covered up the rest of her face. With a hidden grin, she pulled the last piece into place, attaching a cape to her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe Nyx can't do anything in this city,\" she said to her reflection before rearing up in a pose. \"But Mare-Do-Well can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, being a masked vigilante alone wouldn't pay the bills, so Nyx had also begun working on a third identity that she could use to get a job. She had brought her old hairband and enchanted glasses as mementos of her fillyhood, but by placing the lenses into new frames, she could hide her dragon-like eyes easily enough. By wearing a vest to keep her wings concealed and a little magic to change the color of her hair and mane, she looked like nothing more than an unusually large unicorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, I'll just have to see about getting another job. Preferably one that'll help me dig up some dirt. Maybe I can ask Mr. Orange to help me out with that...\"</span></div></div>",

First, she needed to cover up her cutie mark. Fortunately, she knew of a cutie-mark removal spell. Rarity had shown it to her at one point, saying that she had nearly gotten ostracized from her circle of friends on getting her cutie mark. Rarity had discovered and made use of the spell until each of her friends had their own cutie marks, at which point she stopped using it. However, Nyx being the curious filly she'd been, she'd eventually convinced the fashionista to show the spell, which even Twilight hadn't heard of. With that out of the way, some carefully applied body paint would form a new cutie mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The last thing she needed to do to complete her new identity was to choose a name. Although not many ponies knew her true name, it was still a bit of an oddity. She needed a name that would blend in better. She sighed in frustration. \"Ugh, stupid bureaucrats and their stupid fear of somepony who's practical with her power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I could not agree more, Nyx,\" came a familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx jumped and spun to face the speaker. \"P-p-Princess Luna!\" she yelped, then hastily bowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The lunar princess chuckled. \"Rise, Nyx.

Now, as for bureaucrats, I see you're well on you way to making a secret identity to deal with that. Have you any idea what you wish this new identity to be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, and it's annoying me. Why do I have to go to so much trouble?

Nyx cocked her head curiously. \"Even during my... dark days, I had an appreciation for journals and the written word. Perhaps you inherited some of that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx blinked. \"Well, I do like to read... and I've even written a few things...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And Manehattan has one of the most prestigious newspapers around, from what I hear,\" Luna added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx nodded, a smile forming on her face. \"Alright, then! I'm going to be Night Quill, new reporter for the Manehattan Times!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Excellent!\" Luna clapped her hooves in approval. \"By the way, there's a spell that Celly and I developed in order to... blend in with the common folk if we felt the need. It's designed to hide our true nature as alicorns, since we're such a rare breed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx's eyes widened. \"Wow! That would be a big help with the disguise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Indeed, which is why I've decided you could use it. After all, even if you hide your wings with a vest, you're still a very large pony. Larger than most, and that makes you noticeable. Now, with this spell, you won't have to worry about that. Here's how it works...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So, Night Quill, do you have any previous journalism experience?\" asked Jonah Jamareson, chief editor of the Manehattan Times. He was an earth pony with a blue coat, bright blue eyes, and a short-cropped black mane with grey streaks. His cutie mark was that of a folded newspaper in a bright blue star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No professional experience, although I did occasionally write for the Foals Free Press in Ponyville,\" replied 'Night Quill'. She appeared to be a normal unicorn, with a deep blue coat, a cyan mane, and turquoise eyes. Her cutie mark was of a feather quill over a scroll, with a crescent moon on the scroll itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Really?\" Jamareson said. \"I heard about a bit of a fiasco with that newspaper a few years back. Something called 'Gabby Gums'. That wasn't you, was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The disguised alicorn shook her head. \"No, I only became part of the paper after that whole incident blew over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah,\" the editor said. \"Shame, a minor celebrity would have been a great addition. Still, I suppose you have the experience. Welcome to the Manehattan Times!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx blinked. \"Wait, seriously? That's it? You hear I wrote for a foal's paper, and you hire me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jamareson sighed. \"I'll be honest, Night Quill. We've been losing a lot of good writers lately. Ever since the Daily Planet went up in Maretropolis, suddenly it's <i>the</i> place to be for any newspony. But I'm staying here because I've been here since my old paper, the Daily Bugle, got bought out.

This gave the excited duo of Nyx and Scootaloo a chance to see a bright aura of light off in the distance, illuminating the growing dim. Pressing their faces against the cooling glass of the window, their train zoomed along the tracks toward the brilliant city that seemed to rise up over the horizon like a second sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is <i>so freaking awesome</i>,\" Scootaloo exclaimed, peeling herself from the window to bounce around the train car and punch the air a few times, simply unable to contain her energy. \"I can't believe we're almost there! Las Pegasus! THE place for stunts and racing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Nyx replied, every bit as excited. \"Before we know it, ponies are going to be packing the place to see Scootaloo: Fastest Pegasus on Wheels!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScootaloo laughed and replied, \"I prefer 'Scootaloo: Tires of Fire' myself, but that <i>does</i> have a nice ring to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx nodded, grinning widely as she looked down at her friend's cutie mark. A wheel that looked like it was spinning so fast that it had caught fire, and was going to zoom off Scootaloo's flank any moment. She had always been insanely talented with her scooter, but the mark hadn't appeared for a long time. It wasn't until she was a bit older and realized that her wings were never going to be strong enough to let her be a strong flier like her idol, Rainbow Dash. She had fallen into depression over it for a while, but thanks in small part to a zany scheme or two, the Cutie Mark Crusaders had helped her rekindle her love for wheeled vehicles instead. By letting go of her desire to be just like Dash and instead devote herself to developing her own skills, her cutie mark had finally appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I get to be the roommate of the 'Tires of Fire',\" Nyx said with a giggle. \"I should get your autograph now before you're too big a star to be associated with us 'little ponies.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally, the fact that they'd been offered opportunities in the same city was a miracle, especially since most of the police departments she'd applied for sent back replies that basically said, 'please don't ever contact us again' if they sent a reply at all. The Las Pegasus department, by contrast, had sent a glowing acceptance letter at the same time Scootaloo had gotten the attention of an amateur racing team. It was a fantastic turn of events for each of them, but being able to share the costs by travelling and rooming together was all the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the train pulled into the station, the two disembarked with their luggage and gaped as they walked down the strip. Herds of ponies practically flooded the streets, contributing to the sensory overload of brightly lit signs for all the various casinos, clubs and other tourist attractions.</span></div></div>",

There, standing on a platform that was backlit by the casino's trademark sign of a seven-leaf clover, was an earth pony in a track suit. He was sitting atop a motorscooter at the top of an extremely high ramp, and revved the vehicle's engine for the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a soft sigh, Nyx hurried over and grabbed Scootaloo's tail in her mouth before she could get lost in the crowd.

He was an older, flinty grey unicorn wearing an extremely expensive suit and fedora on the ground beside him. As she helped him to his hooves, Nyx suddenly gasped as recognition hit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-y-you're... Suave Crooner,\" she stammered, her jaw hanging open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching out with his magic once he was upright, the unicorn picked up his fedora and put it back on his head. \"The one and only.\" He then turned his head up to get a good look at Nyx, giving her a smile that made the mare's knees wobble. \"But a tall, dark and gorgeous drink of water like you can call me whatever she wants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Swa-who? Nyx, who's this geezer?\" Scootaloo had walked up and asked the question with a raised eyebrow, causing Nyx's face to feel like it had just caught on fire as she slapped a hoof over the pegasus's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhispering into her friend's ear, Nyx hissed, \"That's Suave Crooner! The Chairman! One of the greatest singers of all time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScootaloo blinked in confusion a few times, but then asked, \"Wait, is he the guy from those old records you borrowed from the mayor?\" She started snickering. \"Sweet Celestia, you're blushing! Oh, wow, wait'll the others hear you're in love with a fossil...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not <i>that</i> old! I-I mean, that's not it! I just admire his music!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" Suave Crooner said, interrupting their whispered conversation, \"I'm doing a set in the Seven-Leaf, and I always perform better with a couple of lovely ladies in the front row, if you'd like to accompany me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Nyx could say anything, Scootaloo got a wicked grin on her face and replied...</span></div></div>",

What made it worse was that when she tried to argue in favor of going to see the show, Scootaloo just smirkingly turned her own arguments against her. As a result, the two of them had found their way to the cheap hotel where they would be rooming together. She had barely noticed it, though, instead simply dropping her luggage as soon as they were in the door and throwing herself onto the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, speaking as a tax-paying citizen, I'm glad to know that our stalwart defender of law and order isn't gonna be sleeping through her training,\" Scootaloo teased. She then giggled as she ducked under the pillow Nyx threw at her. \"Aw, come on, Nyx, don't be like that. You'll get plenty of chances to see shows in this town. Though considering how old he is, maybe you <i>should</i> move fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Scootaloo snickered to herself, Nyx's horn glowed and reached out for the pillow she'd thrown, pulling it back to hit the pegasus in the back of the head. She looked over at the alicorn and narrowed her eyes into a challenging smirk. \"Of course you realize, this means war,\" she said before picking up her own pillow in her mouth and launching herself at Nyx!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCushions flew and bits of stuffing scattered around the room as the two young mares settled their differences in the traditional ways passed down through the generations. In the end, both of them had taken many a blow, and were panting heavily with exhaustion. \"... Truce...?\" Scootaloo asked with a tired grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx nodded, falling back into her bed. \"Yeah... truce... Ugh... I was so stupid... Your thing would've only taken a few minutes... so sorry, Scoot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScootaloo picked up her pillow and put it back on her own bed, fluffing it up a bit before climbing onto the mattress. \"Nah... don't be.\" She snickered to herself. \"You were so busy trying to convince me to let you see that Crooner guy sing, Flip had time to do his trick and you didn't even notice, so I got what I wanted.\" When Nyx stared blankly at her, the pegasus gushed, \"Quadruple-flip through two rings of fire! Can you believe it? Hoo boy, I'd have been kicking myself the whole way here if I hadn't seen that! Guess it would've been like how you felt, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx's teeth started to grind together, her eyes shifting to a solid turquoise glow. \"Vengeance... eternal vengeance...!\" she growled, causing Scootaloo to yelp and quickly pull out two small slips of paper that she held out toward her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-that's why before I left, I told him about what a huge fanfilly you are, and he gave me a couple of tickets for later in the week!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx blinked, her eyes snapping back to normal with an almost audible *poof* as her usual slit-shaped pupils widened and glistened with unbridled joy. \"T... tickets?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScootaloo chuckled and nodded. \"I was gonna surprise you later on, but considering you looked like you were gonna turn me into a houseplant or something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx practically pounced the pegasus, hugging her tightly! \"Aw, Scoot, I'm sorry I was mad at you! We're totally even now! <i>More</i> than even! I owe you <i>big</i> for this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScootaloo laughed, hugging back. \"Well, keep in mind it's for the end of the week, so there's always a chance he could petrify by then... I'm kidding! I'm kidding! Hey, he looks good for someone who could be my grandpa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx pretend-glared at her friend as she replied, \"I love you, Scootaloo, but I <i>will</i> unleash pillowy wrath again if you keep that up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the two ponies laughed and finished getting ready for the night before going to their beds and drifting off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Though police work probably wasn't all glamour and heroism, it would go a long way in trying to dispel the stigma of being Nightmare Moon's reincarnation. She had considered other options, and while some were enticing, she wanted to get to work burying her past as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Looking up, she realized she had arrived at the Las Pegasus Police Academy. Smiling, she trotted inside to the front desk, where a dark amaranth pegasus mare sat doing the daily crossword, occasionally tossing a lock of her grey mane out of her face. \"Hello,\" the secretary said, not looking up. \"Can I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Glancing at the sheet, Nyx nodded. \"Yes, I'm a new recruit for the force, I sent in my application a few weeks ago?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sighing, the secretary put down her pencil, and reached for a stack of papers. \"Name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nyx,\" replied the alicorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The mare paused, and finally looked up. Her blue eyes widened on seeing Nyx. \"You... you're the ex-Nightmare, right?\" she asked, plucking an application out of the stack absent-mindedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx winced. \"I prefer not to be called anything like that, ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, of course not!\" the mare replied. \"I mean, you saved a whole town, nearly killed yourself in the process, and have done nothing since to earn anypony's ire. That was years ago, anyway, and it's all water under the bridge to me.\" She held out a hoof. \"Delta Requiem, pleasure to make your acquaintance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx smiled, shaking the offered hoof. \"Likewise, Ms. Requiem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Please, just Delta,\" replied the pegasus. \"So, you applied to the academy, eh? Good choice; Las Pegasus prides itself on its police force. Of course, we kind of have to, since our crime rates are the highest in Equestria, despite our efforts. Every little bit helps, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx nodded. \"Exactly. So, where do I go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, you've got 15 minutes before orientation, so if you'll follow the signs, you'll get right to the meeting room,\" Delta replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx thanked her, and followed the signs to the labeled room. She opened the door, where twenty-nine other ponies were seated at desks, with one at a podium on a small raised stage. Nopony had noticed her yet, so she announced her presence with a knock on the door. Everypony turned, and promptly started gawking at her. All save the unicorn stallion at the podium. \"You'd be Nyx, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx nodded at the stallion's no-nonsense attitude. \"Yes, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Take a seat. You're just in time,\" he said. Nyx took a seat near the stage. A few minutes later, the stallion checked the clock on the wall, and nodded, closing the door with his magic. \"Greetings, recruits. I am Captain Sharp Whistle of the Las Pegasus 45th Precinct, and also a teacher here at the Academy. You will not be working with me every day, so don't expect that. Now, some academies have you read books or take written tests for the first few months. Not here. Here, we believe in 'learning by doing'. So, if you'll follow me, we've got a few mock-ups of scenarios you might face in your time as an officer of the law.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx and the other hopefuls followed him to a hallway filled with doors. \"There are ten doors, and thirty of you total. One group of ten will go first, then the next group, then the next. We'll cycle through everyone, until everyone has done each scenario once. The rooms are all equipped with security cameras that will record everything that happens. You will be judged based on your reactions to each situation. Now, you ten will be the first to pick a door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That group included Nyx.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nyx was rather surprised to have practical tests so soon. Expecting the standard exams to start with, she and her mother had spent long hours studying all the laws and statutes that would be likely to come up. It was still just rote knowledge that she hadn't expected to have to use so soon. As a result, she felt nervous as she pushed through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bell overhead jingled as she stepped into the scene that had been set up. It was a small grocery store, with rows of vegetables, fruits and flowers on display. At the front counter, a stocky beige earth pony clerk was stuffing bits into a sack while a yellowish-green pegasus in a fedora held him at knife-point. Hearing Nyx come in, the robber quickly flapped his wings and vaulted over to the other side of the counter. \"Don't move, copper! I'm takin' the bits and gettin' outta here, or this guy gets gelded, see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken by surprise by the realism of the illusion, Nyx was momentarily stunned. Reflexes took over the same as if she were really watching somepony being put in danger, and she snapped, \"Hold it!\" Not before the pegasus got to the clerk's side of the counter, though. Seeing the situation worsen, the young alicorn's heart and mind raced. \"No, just... hold on. Nopony has to get hurt here. Like you said, you can just take the bits and go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBacking up between two of the rows, but ensuring that the robber could keep her in sight as she offered him a path to the door. Her purple mane started to waft and move, despite there being no breeze through the shop. Glancing between the alicorn and the door, the robber snatched up the sack of bits and flapped toward the exit. Before he could reach the door, however, a black blur slammed into him, knocking him to the floor!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharp Whistle stepped into the control room overseeing the various test rooms just as he heard an excited cheer come from one of the ponies in there. A gold-colored unicorn in a similarly hued suit, wearing expensive sunglasses despite being indoors, was frantically pointing at one of the screens. \"That's what I'm talkin' about! <i>That's what I'm talkin' about!</i> Did you <i>see</i> that? Star material, baby!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArching an eyebrow, Captain Whistle rolled his eyes and asked, \"What should I have seen, Mr. Glamour?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the police stallion enter, the gold unicorn laughed excitedly and pulled him over. \"Sharpy, baby, how many times do I have to say it? Just call me Glitzen! Especially when you give me grade-A talent like this! Wind the tape back, will you doll?\" The policemare working the camera controls looked to Captain Whistle, who just gave her a resigned 'humor him' look before she rewound the footage of Nyx's test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPausing for a moment at the point where she had just started to back away from the robber, the image showed her mane and tail starting to move, and her hair flowed back behind her out of the pegasus's sight as she magically created a copy of herself. The copy then slipped around to another row so that when the robber tried to make his escape, the unseen alicorn had a clear shot at tackling him to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Boom</i>, baby! That! Is! What! I'm! <i>Talking about!</i>\" The unicorn punched Sharp Whistle a few times in the shoulder for emphasis, who looked at him with barely restrained contempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Glamour, Lucky Seven might've talked the commissioner into letting you come in here with your ridiculous, vapid little show...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Little?!</i>\" The gold unicorn sounded sincerely offended as he stood up on his hind legs and tugged on the lapels of his suit. \"Glitzen Glamour doesn't do <i>anything</i> little, baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... but these recruits are here to be police first, not actors. So why don't you settle down and let us evaluate our applicants? And if any of them look like solid cop material, <i>then</i> maybe I'll let you talk to them. Not before. The last thing I need is somepony filling their heads with ideas of being a real-life action star, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlitzen backed off. \"Okay, okay, I got it. I need to go hit the little colt's room before round two starts, anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was gone, the policemare asked, \"So, what do you think, Captain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it'd be easier to ask the commissioner for forgiveness over kicking that twit's shiny flank out of here than it would be to put up with him... But if you mean the recruits, I have to admit that Nyx has potential. Quick thinker, didn't put the clerk in danger, and I wish I could pull that duplication trick.\" He glanced over the other monitors. Some of the recruits were still struggling with their challenges, but others were celebrating. \"Looks like she's not the only one with talent, either, but the day's still young. Hopefully we can turn them into cops before Glamour gets his hooves on them.\"</span></div></div>",

So far, she'd done numerous things for the illusory scenarios. She'd stopped a robbery, filled out some paperwork, chased down a grab-and-run thief (that had been easy for her), and investigated a crime scene. She idly wondered what would come next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Psst...\" The hissing whisper caught her ear, and she swiveled her head around. She soon found the source: a gold unicorn with an equally gold suit and expensive-looking shades. He waved for her to come closer to him. Frowning, Nyx stood up and trotted over. When she was close enough, he began whispering. \"You are amazing, girl. Simply amazing. I've never seen such talent in any of the rookies to date!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx blinked.

It holds bad memories for me, understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Glitzen nodded, unfazed by her temper. \"Of course, of course. Now, you're trying to become a policemare, right? Serve the law, save a life or two, etc.? Well, baby, let me tell you, you won't get much of anyplace as your run-of-the-mill policemare. You'll most likely get stuck behind a desk, filling out paperwork, and sorting things to where they need to go. Boring, ain't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Perhaps, but necessary, Mr. Glamour,\" replied the alicorn. She was starting to get a headache from his prattling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes, yes, but you know, you have other options,\" the unicorn said with a smile. \"You want to be a policemare to erase the stigma of Nightmare Moon, am I right? Well, an average policemare's job won't do that for you. But I can get your name on the charts. I can see it now: 'End of the Nightmare! Shield Maiden fights for justice!' Oh, it's beautiful...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx blinked repeatedly. \"Uh... 'Shield Maiden'? What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Glitzen coughed. \"Ah, right. You see, Nyx, I am somepony who looks at the up-and-coming talent of the rookies here at the Academy. And when I find promising talent - like yours - I give them an opportunity of a lifetime. The opportunity to become a real, true hero of the Equestrian people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What Glitzen didn't mention was that the 'real, true hero' stuff would all be staged, and everything recorded. The alicorn didn't need to know that. It wasn't as if she'd ever face anything resembling a real enemy while he was around. No, he paid the local mob good money to make these 'heroes' look good. And, when the 'hero's' time as a star had ended, the mob would be paid to lay low for a while, and Glitzen would tell the 'hero' that justice had been served, and they could hang up their suit. Most 'heroes' were only good for a month or two. But an alicorn...! Oh, Glitzen wanted to milk this mare for all she was worth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx, meanwhile, was pondering what the gaudy stallion was proposing. On the one hoof, she'd come here to be a policemare, and her mother would be displeased if she ran off and did something completely different. On the other hoof, being a policemare would be hard work, and not likely to clear up any of the stigma around her for quite some time. What to do?</span></div></div>",

If there was a chance of making a good impression with the Equestrian public and building a new reputation for herself, it was definitely worth considering. If she could actually be a hero and earn everypony's trust...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlitzen grinned as he saw her mulling it over. It was obvious that aside from her extraordinary abilities and gripping backstory, the young alicorn was eager to prove herself. The need for redemption practically radiated from her. Thanks to that, he just knew that she would be putty in his hooves, and go to greater lengths to please the public than the cocky glory-seekers he usually scouted would ever go. And with her kind of talents, she'd be able to make a far greater spectacle than any five of his previous finds put together!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really flattered, Mr. Glamour. You have no idea how much an opportunity like this means to me,\" she told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlitzen's grin widened as he reached into his suit jacket to pull out a contract. \"Oh, trust me babe, you won't regret-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe interrupted him by continuing, \"So I'm sorry, I'm going to have to decline.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlitzen froze in place and blinked behind his fancy sunglasses. \"I'm sorry, what? I didn't catch that last bit. You said...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx replied earnestly, \"It's a great offer, and if it was just about me, I'm sure I'd say yes in a heartbeat, but a big part of making up for my past sins is serving something more important than myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Glitzen replied, surprised by Nyx's refusal, but not so much that he couldn't try to bring her back around. \"And with your shining example, you could serve all of Equestria as a symbol of hope and redemption!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, but if I do, I'd rather do so on a more personal level. Plus, there are some really great ponies here. I'd like to be able to make friends and work with them. I don't think I'd be able to do that if I started showboating as some lone heroine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlitzen's eye twitched, but it still wasn't anything he couldn't try to salvage. \"You can have friends working with me! I'll be your best friend in the whole world! And you'll have thousands and thousands of friends! The fan clubs alone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx shuddered at the thought. The mention of fan clubs reminded her too much of her time with the Children of Nightmare. Glitzen's ingratiatingly cheerful expression drooped and melted like a wax figurine under a hot lamp as she said, \"Ugh... no, no thank you... But I do appreciate the offer, and there are plenty of ponies here who would be just as good for what you have in mind, I'm sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed there are,\" an icy voice replied, belonging to Sharp Whistle as he approached. Glaring daggers at Glitzen, he said, \"In fact, if Mr. Glamour will kindly rejoin us in the control room, I would be more than happy to discuss his future working with my recruits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStuffing the contract back into his jacket, Glitzen stammered, \"I... I was just heading back there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the gold unicorn slinked away, Nyx arched her eyebrow and asked, \"Uh... is there something wrong, Captain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharp Whistle make sure that Glitzen was gone before shaking his head. \"No, not at the moment.\" He looked at her out of the corner of his eye, a faint smile forming as he nodded slightly. \"You're doing a good job so far, recruit. Keep it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours later, in one of the highest floors of the Seven-Leaf casino, a dark green pegasus was carefully holding a putter and lining up a shot toward a drinking glass that had been turned on its side. The pony was on the older side, but lean and fit, with sharp green eyes. On his flank was a cutie mark of a seven-leafed clover and a pair of dice. One of the dice showed only sixes on all its faces, the other showing only ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he was about to take the swing, a burly purple earth pony lumbered up to him. \"Mr. Seven, Glitzen Glamour's outside. He seems distraught. Should I bring him in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pegasus asked, \"Why am I not surprised? Alright, let him in.\" As the earth pony moved toward the door, he added, \"Oh, before you do, can you turn that glass 90 degrees clockwise? Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the earth pony turned the glass so that it was no longer facing the pegasus, the club was pulled back once again. The door opened, and Glitzen pushed himself into the room. \"Mr. Seven, I need your help! I've got a-\" With a swing of the club, Glitzen was interrupted as the ball was sent arcing up toward a bronze bust of princess Celestia, ricocheting off of the statue's nose with a clang where it rebounded off of a bookshelf on another wall before banking off one of the lenses of Glitzen's shades before hitting the ground again, bouncing and rolling until it went into the cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a satisfied smirk, the pegasus put his putter aside, and the purple earth pony dutifully picked up both the cup and ball. \"Hello, Glitzen. You were saying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gold unicorn's mouth opened and closed a few times before he could get his thoughts back on track. \"R-right! Look, I've got a line on a 'hero' pony like I've never seen before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlitzen replied excitedly, \"Oh, she's like a big, ripe, juicy apple hanging just outta reach! She's everything we could hope for and more, but she won't play ball! And Sharp Whistle's only makin' it harder. Can't you do somethin' about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pegasus looked at Glitzen with a bemused expression. \"Who am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken by surprise, the gold unicorn asked, \"... What?\" At the same time, the lens that had been struck fell out of his expensive shades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who am I, Glitzen?\" The pegasus walked over to his desk and sat down, looking across it at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You're... you're Lucky Seven, sir,\" he eventually replied, fearing it to be a trick question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky Seven smirked. \"Exactly. So asking whether or not I can do something in this town is rather silly, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlitzen reluctantly nodded. \"You're right, Mr. Seven... really silly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky Seven then abruptly changed the subject. \"Do you play roulette at all, Mr. Glamour?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unicorn blinked and answered, \"Uh, now and then, sir. Why-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And when you play roulette, do you throw your hooves up into the air and start wailing to the heavens before the ball stops rolling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm... no, of course not, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky Seven tapped his desk as he replied, \"Well that is exactly what you are doing now. I am rather interested in Ms. Nyx as well, so I already know about your fumbled attempt to involve her in your show. But don't let your bruised ego interfere with your sense. She's still trying to find her place in this world. The ball is still in play, and if I so chose, I could easily ensure that it landed on the spot you desire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlitzen swallowed and asked hopefully, \"And... will you, sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky Seven smiled across the desk and replied...</span></div></div>",

Because, if you did, you'd remember that Nyx's adoptive mother is none other than Twilight Sparkle, widely regarded as one of, if not <i>the</i> most powerful unicorn alive today. In addition, Ms. Sparkle is the <i>personal</i> protege of Princess Celestia, and thus her word carries a lot of weight. And, as good as my fortune has held out thus far in my life, I am not eager to test my luck by becoming embroiled in politics with the crown. I apologize for the inconvenience, but I know my limits, as should you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Glitzen, despite his appearance, was no fool. True, he hadn't really looked at the case file before seeing Nyx in action. All he'd seen was 'alicorn', and he'd been sold. But if these details were right... \"Of course, Mr. Seven. I suppose I'll have to make do with one of the other recruits for now. But, the option's not entirely out of the question, is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lucky Seven chuckled. \"No, of course not. But 'haste makes waste' as the adage says.

The purple earth pony from before came up to Lucky's desk. \"Sir, those tapes from the new recruit batch have arrived. I think I can see what Glitzen was excited about. This alicorn is a natural-born crime fighter. She could definitely be bad for business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lucky Seven smirked. \"Ah, but everything in life is a gamble, is it not?

She can't do much to us behind the walls of the station.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The burly pony nodded. \"On another note, we know where she's staying. She's got a hotel room with a friend of hers from Ponyville, a stuntpony named Scootaloo.

Illusions or no, the day had been exhausting. Captain Sharp Whistle had told her and the other recruits, after all the tests were done, that they were to return to their homes and come back tomorrow for the results. She groaned as she worked a kink out of her left hind leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wow, did they run you ragged already?\" Looking up, Nyx saw Scootaloo, grinning down at her with a far too chipper attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx sighed. \"I didn't expect the first day to be <i>practical</i> tests of ability.

It was... fairly overwhelming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Scootaloo smirked. \"Well, I managed to get in touch with that racing team.

What brings you over this way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe amaranth, grey-maned pegasus smiled widely as she stood outside the door. \"Hi, Nyx! I just had to come congratulate you. Technically, I'm not supposed to say anything about your results until after Captain Whistle gives you your official evaluation, but I couldn't help it. If what I've been hearing is true, precincts are going to be fighting over you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alicorn was a bit taken aback. She didn't know what to say to that, or even what to feel. She'd been fairly sure she did well, but having Delta come all the way over just to tell her so in such effusively positive terms was a bit overwhelming. While she stammered out a 'thank you', Scootaloo came up and lifted a hoof. \"Hey, I'm Nyx's roommate, Scootaloo. So, you two met at the Academy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelta shook hooves with Scootaloo and nodded. \"Delta Requiem. I'm the receptionist there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx got her head in order and asked, \"Well, thank you so much for coming out here to tell me that. Uh, would you like to come inside for a bit, since you're here? If you haven't eaten yet, I could throw together some sandwiches and hay fries.\" Exhausted as she was, the alicorn was also getting hungry and could fix up something that simple with her magic while she rested her weary body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Well, thank you, as long as it isn't any trouble,\" Delta replied, stepping into the room. It was small and cheap so that the young mares could afford to stay there long-term, but came with a kitchenette that they had stocked with a few very basic supplies upon arriving. Smiling awkwardly, the secretary admitted, \"To be honest, I did have a bit of an ulterior motive in coming here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScootaloo snickered and mock-accused, \"Oh, are you a <i>spy</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelta laughed. \"No, no, actually, I'm... kind of a fan,\" she said as Nyx settled back onto her bed, surprising the alicorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A fan?\" Nyx asked, looking back at Delta quizzically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pegasus nodded a bit and explained, \"Of your story. Or at least the version of it I heard. Is it true that during the battle of Ponyville, you saved the orphanage from a giant Lupus Major?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx and Scootaloo blinked at each other, then both bust into laughter while a confused Delta watched them. Seeing her expression, Nyx wiped her eye and replied, \"Sorry... sorry. I think we're just not used to versions of that story that make me seem <i>more</i> noble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScootaloo snickered and explained, \"For one thing, there's no orphanage in Ponyville. There aren't enough orphans to warrant one, and the ones we do have get foster parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And even a Lupus Major isn't much bigger than I am right now,\" Nyx added. \"Don't get me wrong; they're tough, fast, and mean as Tartarus, but at least you don't have to worry about them stepping on houses like you would with an Ursa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelta looked a little embarassed. \"Ah, I see. Well, I'm sure what really happened is just as impressive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx tilted her head as she reached out to the kitchenette with her magic and started sorting out the ingredients for some daffodil sandwiches. \"Out of curiosity, where'd you hear this version?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelta replied, \"Well... bits and pieces here and there. Mostly scraps I picked up from tourists, so I tried to piece together as much as I could based around what was actually known about it. Heh, you can really tell who's a tourist and who's a local around here by the version they believe. You know, around here, ponies are a lot more likely to believe the ones that put you in a positive light. Probably has something to do with those two weeks of night giving the casinos a bump in business, or because we love a celebrity around here... not that that's why <i>I</i> like your story, I mean! It's just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx smiled and levitated three plates out with the sandwiches she had been making while Delta talked, putting one in front of each of them. \"Would you like to hear the <i>real</i> story?\" she asked. When Delta gave a delighted grin and nodded, the alicorn looked over at Scootaloo and mused, \"You ever hear the one about how the Cutie Mark Crusaders infiltrated the Children of Nightmare's castle? Of course I'll need some help telling your side of the story, Scoot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cutie Mark... Crusaders?\" Delta asked with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScootaloo took a bite out of her sandwich and replied while she chewed, \"Oh, you'll luvv thish. Ouh frendsh Abble-\" After getting a look from the other two mares, she swallowed and continued, \"Our friends Applebloom and Sweetie Belle and I wanted to see Nyx after those cult creeps gave her all her Nightmare Moon powers and memories back, so we--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two ate while the orange pegasus went into her story, which led to another tale, and another, going on long into the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning...</span></div></div>",

Even when given a clear path straight ahead, the alicorn's gait would weave groggily from side to side, and any time she tried to turn a corner, the threat of her tripping over her own legs was a very real hazard. It was even worse when she tried spreading her wings to keep her balance, because she took up the entire sidewalk that way and forced ponies around her to quickly duck underneath them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApologizing profusely the whole way, Nyx internally cursed herself for staying up so late trading stories with Delta and Scootaloo. As exhausted as she'd been from the previous day's tests, the two pegasi had kept her going so long that she completely lost track of time. As a result, with a few hours less sleep than she should have gotten, she found herself struggling to ensure that she would only end up slightly late as opposed to 'If you aren't going to take this seriously then pack up and go home' late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the building came into sight, she tucked her wings in and made a hard push for the final stretch, but she tripped up on the last step, causing her to tumble against the door. It burst open as she rolled and slid across the floor, finally stopping when she bumped into the reception desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering over it, a concerned but otherwise perky looking Delta asked, \"Oh my gosh, Nyx! Are you alright? What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alicorn groaned and looked up at her with bloodshot eyes, her purple mane a mess as she tried to sort out which limb was which before she even tried to stand up again. \"You... words... make... how...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting a sense of Nyx's dilemma, Delta pointed to a contraption on a nearby table and replied, \"Ahhh. Espresso maker. You will learn to respect it. You will learn to love it. You want me to make you a cup?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx's left hind leg twitched spastically for a moment before she figured out she wasn't moving the right part of her body, and transitioned to nodding. \"Fifteen, please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's start with just one,\" Delta said, coming out from behind the desk to work the machine, pouring out a cup that she brought to Nyx's lips. As the caffeine hit her bloodstream, Nyx showed signs of vitality again and got back to her hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much... You're my best new friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Nyx wasn't looking directly at her, Delta asked, \"Are you talking to me, or the machine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx just looked at her awkwardly for a moment before running a hoof through her messy mane and asking, \"So, uh... I'm not too late, am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelta smirked a little. \"Don't worry, you're fine. Some of the other recruits spent the evening unwinding at the clubs, so you still look a lot better by comparison. I've got a brush in my purse if you need it, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erf, thanks Delta, but that's okay. Just gimme a second...\" Now that she was able to concentrate, Nyx used a technique that she'd developed with Rarity's help. At this stage in her life, her mane wasn't as obviously magical as the princesses, but still obeyed her will to a degree. Focusing for a moment on how she wanted to look, her hair started untangling and styling itself into her usual look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelta blinked and said, \"Okay, now I'm seething with jealousy. Well, you look ready, so head on in and knock 'em dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx smiled gratefully to Delta and hurried into the room where the other recruits were waiting. It was true, while some of them were fresh and alert, others looked like they had spent the previous night partying and were now paying the consequences for it. There were a few empty seats as well, suggesting that she wasn't even going to be the last one to arrive. Captain Whistle wasn't anywhere in sight, so she figured that he was probably giving another recruit their evaluation.</span></div></div>",

Her parents are currently in the slammer for foal abuse and neglect.\" He sighed. \"I wish my sister had never married that stallion... With a name like Lock Down, he couldn't be anything but bad news.\" He coughed. \"Anyway, Delta is an actual officer, though she got there on her own merits, not just because I'm her uncle. If anything, I put more pressure on her than on other officers, just so ponies don't think I'm not putting enough pressure on her. Still, she does her job well, even if she hardly ever goes on patrol.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I never would have suspected...\" Nyx murmured. \"She acts so... bubbly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Part of that is because you've never seen her in uniform,\" Whistle replied. \"But it's also an act to throw ponies off. She acts like such a girly-girl so she can loosen tongues. She's gotten quite a bit of information with her silver tongue.\" Seeing her look, he smiled. \"Don't worry, though, her admiration for you is genuine, Nyx. Now, enough about her, let's talk about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx felt butterflies in her stomach. Still, she forced them down, and nodded. \"Yes, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pulling out a folder, Whistle showed it to her. It had her name on it, and a sizeable stack of papers, including a photo of her. \"Normally, I'd tell you which precincts and divisions you qualified for. But, that's not exactly necessary in your case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx's ears folded back. \"Does... does that mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Noticing her expression, Whistle realized what he'd said. \"Not like that! You're qualified for any division, any precinct you choose! You aced all of the scenarios we put against you.

Is there something about Glitzen I should know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Whistle sighed. \"Glitzen likes to make 'heroes' out of ordinary ponies. He gets them a contract, a fancy outfit, quite a decent amount of pay, and their name in the headlines for a month or two. With how often it's happened here in Los Pegasus, I'm honestly shocked anypony cares when a new 'hero' pops up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx scowled. \"So, I'm not the first pony he's tried to sweet-talk into playing hero?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hardly,\" replied Whistle with another sigh. \"We lose a recruit or two to him every time this time of year comes around.

As I said, you qualified for anything of your chosing. However, there are two divisions that seem to best suit you: Robbery/Homicide, and Narcotics.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A little while later, Nyx came back out into the reception area, her head hung low and ears flattened. Surprised by her defeated expression, Delta came over and asked, \"Nyx? Are you alright? What's the word?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alicorn let out a heavy sigh and asked, \"Depends... do you prefer 'lieutenant'... or 'boss'?\" She immediately perked up and grinned down at Delta, who let out a laugh, an embarrassed little smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Uncle Sharp spilled the beans, huh? And you chose the 63rd anyway? Most ponies would assume last night was all about pumping them for information.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx shrugged and replied, \"Well, isn't getting to know one another what friends do? If there's one thing growing up with Twilight Sparkle for a mother taught me, it's that friendships get started in a lot of different ways, and that it's something you should treasure whenever you find it. So from here on out, my training's in your hooves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelta visibly tried, but couldn't entirely keep the squee out of her voice as she said, \"Oh, this is great! Don't think you can sweet-talk me into going easy on you, though. But I'm really glad that you think of me as a friend already! Just wait until you meet the rest of the squad; you'll love them. Technically you're still in training for a couple of months, but with your initial results, we'll be able to get you plenty of field experience in between tests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx nodded, though her mind drifted back to what Sharp Whistle had said after she had made her choice. <i>\"I'm sure you'll do well there. Delta shares my 'learn by doing' philosophy, so you'll likely end up getting trained on the streets instead of doing a lot of remedial studying. You'll still have to come in for tests periodically until your training period is over, though.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Thank you, sir! I'll go tell her right away, if that's alright,\"</i> she had replied. Before she could leave, though, he had held up a hoof to stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Wait, there's one thing I need to discuss about what I saw in the test scenarios yesterday. Not everypony picked up on it, but from what I saw, you seemed to have a tendency to throw yourself into harm's way. Especially when innocent civilians were involved.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Isn't that what police officer's are supposed to do?\"</i> she had asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"We take risks every day so that other ponies don't have to, that's true. But it's important to do so with a clear head. You might be used to shrugging off things that would be a serious danger to other ponies, but there's always a bigger fish out there somewhere. Or lots of smaller, meaner fish. Or you might just have bad luck one day. And when that time comes, you'll need to protect yourself if you want to protect anyone else. Part of doing the job today is making sure that you'll be able to keep doing the job tomorrow.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx thought back to her tests. She hadn't really <i>thrown</i> herself into danger as far as she could recall. Nothing that she wouldn't have survived, even if it had been real, anyway. Maybe Sharp Whistle was just being extra concerned since she was going to be working with his niece, who at this particular moment was telling her about the other members of the Narcotics Unit. \"-who handles the dogs, and we'll want you working with a veteran, so I'll see about partnering you up with Canterlot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx blinked, coming back to the present. \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelta waved a hoof. \"Oh, that's not his real name. It's just what we call him because he transferred here from Canterlot a few years ago. He's a little mopey about something that happened between him and the force there or something, but he's a great officer and the most loyal guy I know. Trust me, he'll take good care of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx nodded along. \"Ahhh, thanks Delta. Since my evaluation's out of the way, how about you show me the way to the 63rd?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing,\" Delta replied, \"Uncle Sharp doesn't need me for anything else today either, so I was going to head back there anyway.\" She pushed open the door so they could go outside, then grinned and spread her wings. \"I hope those things on your back aren't just for show, because we're taking the scenic route.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx grinned back, getting the sense that she was being challenged. \"I love taking in the scenery. Just don't think you'll be able to make too many donut stops along the way, lieutenant.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Delta and Nyx stared each other down with their wings spread out. As if on some unseen cue, they both launched themselves up into the air simultaneously with quick flaps! Delta took the early lead, because while Nyx's wings were powerful and had a large span, the pegasus's lighter frame made it much easier for her to lift off as she climbed up above the buildings and curved off toward her destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx followed after her, taking the time to climb up higher than the amaranth pegasus had before locking her wings so that she could soar like an eagle after Delta. The lieutenant looked back over her shoulder and teasingly stuck her tongue out in a very unprofessional manner, causing Nyx to smirk and narrow her eyes. \"Oh, so that's how you're gonna be, huh? Alright, then that's how it's gonna be.\" Her horn glowed with magic, and she used it to warm the air under her wings to create thermals that lifted her up higher. She then tucked in her wings a little and angled downward, building up enough speed while Delta wasn't looking to zoom past her and take the lead without having to expend a lot of energy by flapping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Nyx couldn't help but blow a raspberry at Delta on the way past, making the pegasus pony echo the same expression that she had moments before. She still had the advantage of maneuverability as they banked between some of the taller hotels, giving her the chance to make up some time. When Nyx saw her catching up, the alicorn called out, \"Not bad, but you're no Rainbow Dash!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelta retorted, \"Maybe not, but I bet you I've got a few tricks even <i>she</i> doesn't know about!\" She then dropped down suddenly, skimming low to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx blinked in surprised, watching the pegasus as she tried to figure out what Delta was up to. She soon found out when her view of Delta, along with everything else, was suddenly blanketed in thick, milky white as she flew straight into an inexplicable bank of fog. The cold and clammy mist, though too \"soupy\" to simply kick away like a normal cloud, was still dense enough to keep her from seeing anything around her for more than a few dozen feet in every direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing Delta's earlier lead, she dipped down below the fog only to suddenly have to veer from side to side as she dipped too close to carriage traffic. Her hooves clipped a table where a pony was playing Three-Card Monte, accidentally tipping it over along with the cards as she flipped end over end, trying to get her equilibrium back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpotting Delta down the street, Nyx flapped her wings hard and gave chase once again. The pegasus, not expecting Nyx to catch up so soon, didn't notice the alicorn gaining on her until they were almost to the precinct house. Glancing back and seeing the turquoise-eyed mare catching up and building momentum for the final stretch, Delta flapped hard to keep her lead! As the building drew closer and closer, so too did the distance between them narrow until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on, I completely passed you at the end there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, I was ahead the whole time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a chance, and you wouldn't have been ahead to begin with in the second half if it weren't for that freak mist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nearby pony cleared his throat and tried to look nonchalant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, like you would've passed me in the first half without using magic? I am shocked... shocked that you would stoop to those sort of tactics in a friendly race.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more ponies cleared their throats, eyes rolled up toward the ceiling as they milled around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a cold or something going around?\" Nyx asked with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelta waved it off. \"Ah, don't mind them. Come on, let's see who's here so I can introduce you to the rest of the team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx smiled and followed Delta, only to be startled by a sudden loud barking sound behind her! She instinctively reared up, getting her horn stuck in the ceiling tiles for a moment while she looked down. Instead of a dog, though, what she found was... a pony. A beige earth pony mare with dark brown eyes, wearing her police badge on a hat that looked like it was decorated with animal fur, and she was barking like a dog until Delta came over and bopped her on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad! Bad girl! You apologize,\" Delta scolded, causing the strange mare to whimper while Nyx pulled herself down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S... sorry,\" the beige pony said reluctantly with a raspy growl of a voice. \"I was napping, and... she just came in all of a sudden...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she apologized, Delta flapped up to the top of a file cabinet where a cookie jar was kept out of easy reach. As soon as the pegasus touched it, the strange mare's ears perked up, and her attention snapped toward Delta. Flapping back down to the floor with the cookie jar in her hooves, Delta reached in and handed a biscuit of some sort to a stunned Nyx. \"Here, give this to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very confused Nyx took the biscuit. \"Huh?\" she asked, looking back and forth between Delta and the beige mare, who was suddenly sitting and drooling as she looked at Nyx with pleading eyes. Nevertheless, she held the biscuit out like Delta said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange mare looked between Nyx and Delta, as if looking for permission. When Delta nodded, she quickly snatched the biscuit from Nyx's hoof with her mouth, then dashed off under the desk of a startled detective to start gnawing on it. Her flank stuck out, allowing Nyx to see a cutie mark depicting a full moon with a howling wolf sillhouetted against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Delta put the jar back up atop the files, Nyx just stared in disbelief at what she'd seen. \"Who... or <i>what</i>... was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sgt. Howler of the K-9 unit,\" Delta explained. \"Raised by wolves, if you believe the stories. She's just not very good with meeting new ponies. Something about 'establishing dominance', but since you fed her, she'll be your friend for life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx sweatdropped as she looked down at Delta. \"Really, now...?\" She couldn't say she remembered any of her mother's friendship studies dealing with <i>this</i> sort of situation. For her part, the lieutentant just shrugged and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, don't worry about it. After a while, you'll get used to her.\" She did glance from side to side, though, before putting a hoof near her mouth and leaning in to whisper, \"Though from what I've heard, her wolf parents raised her on meat when she was a filly. They say she sometimes goes hunting for small animals when she's off-duty...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx gulped nervously at that. \"What? C-come on, now I know you're messing with me. A pony eating meat is just...\" she looked over at Howler, who had pulled herself back out from her 'hiding spot' and was grinning happily at Nyx. Wow, those... those were some awfully sharp-looking teeth for a pony. \"... ridiculous...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx suddenly found herself getting pulled along by Delta as she cheerily exclaimed, \"Well, come on, we can't just stand here all day!\" She led the alicorn to a desk that was empty of its occupant, but was decorated with a few knick-knacks. Momentarily stopping a passing stallion, Delta asked, \"Hey, where's Canterlot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stallion replied, \"Oh, hi lieutenant. He...\"</span></div></div>",

Inside, a large clay-red earth pony stallion similar in build to Big Macintosh stood nursing a cup of coffee and what appeared to be a chocolate chip cookie. His blonde mane had been cropped short, and his cutie mark was that of a stone wall, like a castle's battlements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Canterlot!

Her enthusiasm diminished when she saw the stallion's expression. \"And, let me guess, you're one of those ponies who thinks I'm nothing but a monster, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The stallion shook his head rapidly. \"N-no! Of course not! It's just, well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Delta glared at the earth pony. \"If you've got a problem with Nyx, just say so right now, and I'll put her with somepony else in Narcotics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He shook his head again. \"I don't have a problem with her being my partner, I'm just... nervous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nervous?\" Delta quirked an eyebrow. \"That's a first.

I was part of Spell Nexus's inner circle. I brought most of the components that were used in your... reincarnation. I never truly interacted with you, aside from when you removed the 'blessing' from all of the Children of Nightmare. I left the Canterlot Town Guard after that, because I needed a fresh start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx likewise lowered her head. \"I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Stonewall's head shot up, and he stared at her. \"Why are <i>you</i> apologizing to <i>me</i>? If anything, I should be the one apologizing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx cut him off with a raised hoof. \"You have nothing to apologize for. But me... it's because of my past as Nightmare Moon that you became part of the Children of Nightmare. You were forced to leave your old job because of me. And for that, I'm sorry. I ruined so many ponies' lives, and I've never really apologized to any of the Children of Nightmare before now. I wanted to at least do so once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Stonewall blinked once, then twice, then smiled. \"Well, you're far more humble than Nexus made you out to be. Of course, I saw that back during your two-week tenure. You started raising the sun after a week because you were worried about your subjects. You chewed out Spell Nexus for not following your orders regarding Twilight Sparkle. And when you realized the truth about the blessing, you removed it from all of your followers, in an effort to atone.\" He dipped his head in acknowledgement. \"For that, I accept your apology.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The alicorn and earth pony shook hooves, exchanging smiles. The moment was interrupted by a cough.

Now, Nyx is still technically in training, Canterlot, so it's your job to make sure she doesn't do anything stupid while on duty. Remember, you're Narcotics. You bust drug runners.

Couldn't we just walk into any nightclub on the strip and bust people selling harder stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStonewall just looked straight ahead with a... well... stoney expression, but from Delta's angle, she could see a hint of a grin out of the corner of his mouth. The pegasus sighed and replied, \"In <i>theory</i>, yeah, you could do that. But in <i>theory</i>, you could trot up to the royal palace and graffiti the place with 'Princess Molestia' cartoons. And the graffiti would probably be the better idea of the two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelta pushed a note with the relevant information across her desk and said in a more serious tone than Nyx had heard from her before, \"Look, you're still a trainee, and I'm giving you a chance to get your hooves wet with an easy assignment. The suspect, Grassy Knolls, is a three-time repeater with no history of violence. You just need to either catch him in the act, or prove that he's in possession, and you'll get him without a fuss. Canterlot here'll be sure to show you how it's done, and you'll probably be back in time for lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx nodded. \"Well, alright. I won't let you down, then.\" She gave her new friend a salute and headed out of the office, Stonewall following immediately after her, only taking a moment to pick up the note in his mouth and nod to Delta before shutting the door behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it, but you even look the same,\" he mused as he put the note in a saddlebag slug over his chair, then put it on while they walked toward the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx slowed down to let him walk alongside her and asked, \"The same as what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That expression's exactly the same as Delta's, the first assignment <i>she</i> got as my partner.\" Nyx clearly looked surprised, so he told her, \"Well, she might have raced up the ranks, but she still had to start somewhere. And she reacted pretty much exactly the same way, going after small-timers when we know there's plenty going on under our noses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx glanced back over her shoulder before looking to Stonewall. \"And...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And she did her job, made some high-profile busts, and made lieutenant in near record time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx walked alongside the earth pony as he made his way toward the address on the note. \"So... that's it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it for now,\" he replied. \"Right now, it's about doing the job we've been given. Anything more than that can wait until you're more settled in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx pointed a hoof at her new partner and deduced, \"But you're saying there <i>is</i> more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStonewall chuckled ruefully. \"Trust me, Nyx, there's <i>always</i> more. The trouble is deciding which rocks are worth looking under.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they moved away from the busy hustle and bustle of the strip and into a more worn-down residential area. They stopped in sight of a small, worn-down house with an overgrown lawn littered with chintzy ornaments, and Stonewall pointed to it. \"That's the place. Now, before we do anything, we need to establish probable cause. He knows me, so the instant I set a hoof near that place, he'll flush away whatever he's got in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx nodded and replied, \"So, I guess we should...\"</span></div></div>",

Some ponies still think I am Nightmare Moon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Stonewall smirked. \"If it's any consolation, you've dispelled any doubts about that in my mind.\" He paused. \"Out of curiosity, what about the lightning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She smirked back at him. \"Well, if things get hairy, you might find out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Their chatter was silenced when they saw a purple earth pony stallion approaching the house. \"Well, there's our bait,\" Stonewall said with a wry look. \"Now, let's see if we can land the fish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hang on, I've got an idea!\" Nyx said, as part of her mane and tail began to ripple. In moments, there was a copy of her standing right next to her. \"Okay, go mist form, and make sure you don't do anything stupid.\" The clone nodded, and vanished into a spiraling purple mist. It flew over to the house, where the earth pony was now knocking at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, yeah, I'm coming!\" came a voice from within. A moment later, a green earth pony with a brown mane opened the door. \"So, whaddya - OH!\" His demeanor changed on seeing the stallion. \"Ah, is Mr. Seven awaiting his latest shipment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Indeed,\" the purple stallion replied with a smooth, cultured voice. \"Two-hundred and fifty bits, as we agreed then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The green pony, apparently Grassy Knolls, shook his head. \"Sorry, but my supply is starting to run dry. The Narcotics Division has been stepping up their game lately, and I can't get as much as I used to. Three-hundred.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The purple stallion cocked his head. \"Mr. Knolls, you know whom I work for, and yet you're making things difficult? Mr. Seven was under the impression that the price we agreed on was set.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, then, with due respect to Mr. Seven, he needs to understand that supply and demand exists,\" replied Grassy. \"Marijuana, as I said, is getting harder to come by. Besides, what's fifty bits to somepony like him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The purple stallion considered this, then nodded. \"Very well, three-hundred it is.\" He hoofed over a large pouch of money, pausing to add more to it from another, larger pouch. Grassy took the offered pouch, and headed inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0From their hiding spot, Nyx and Stonewall were seeing everything thanks to a Seeing-Eye spell placed on the clone, and they could hear everything as well due to an Extendable Ear spell. Stonewall looked contemplative. \"I wonder who this Mr. Seven is they're talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Dunno,\" Nyx replied. \"So, once he's given the guy the pot, we bust him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We bust <i>them</i>,\" corrected the stallion. \"Whether he's innocent or not - and given what he's been saying, he probably isn't - he's buying illegal substances.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx nodded. \"Okay, I've got a Replacement Spell active and ready to cast once Grassy gives up the marijuana. It'll switch our position with my copy, so they don't have time to run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Stonewall nodded, bracing himself for magical transport. He never openly complained, but sometimes he was wary of being transported incorrectly. Looking back at the house, he saw Grassy come back out, pulling a large sack out to the purple stallion.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nyx cast the spell, and for a moment she and Stonewall felt the faint vertigo of suddenly swapping places with her misty double. Teleportation was a tricky spell that only a few unicorns had ever truly mastered, and teleporting more than one pony with the same spell was exponentially more difficult to pull off. Replacement was a way to work around that problem. By having two spells cast simultaneously, there was no need for the magic to 'carry' a passenger and ensure that they appeared in exactly the same condition that they were in when they vanished. Instead, the dual magics didn't affect the passengers at all, but moved the space they inhabited instead. It would still be a very complex and difficult spell for any two unicorns to pull off due to the coordination required, but being able to split herself into two made it so much easier for Nyx.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless of the mechanics of it, she and Stonewall appeared on either side of the two earth ponies just as the purple one took the bag into his mouth. Stonewall was inside the house, behind Grassy Knolls, and Nyx appeared behind the big purple buyer. \"Freeze!\" Stonewall shouted, immediately planting a hoof against Grassy's back and shoving him to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-stonewall?! How'd you get in my-?! I-I-I didn't do nothin'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx followed her partner's lead, pushing down the heavily built stallion, and making him spit out the bag in the process. \"Oh come on, we saw you give over the stuff with out own eyes. You have the right to remain silent; anything you say may be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you don't have one, one will be appointed for you. Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple stallion rolled an eye back to look at Nyx and replied calmly, \"I know my rights. And I know you don't have anything to arrest me on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx scoffed. \"Seriously? You'll be lucky to see sunlight any time in the next decade, buying up that much pot.\" Using her magic to bind his legs in place while Stonewall kept Grassy pinned down, she walked over to the sack and opened it. Inside the bag, however, was not what she was expecting. \"Wait... what's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clover!\" Grassy squirmed and shouted, \"Organically grown clover! I sell it to the Seven-Leaf!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStonewall narrowed his eyes. \"Pull the other one, Knolls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx replied weakly, \"No, it... really is clover.\" Tipping it open, she let a little of its contents spill out into view. She then looked at the earth ponies and said, \"But we heard you arguing about the price of marijuana!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple stallion replied, \"I represent Mr. Lucky Seven in this matter. He's a very influential pillar of the community. He is aware of the recidivism rate of former drug-dealers like Mr. Knolls here, so he offers them an opportunity to use their talents in legitimate ways, paying competitive rates so that they don't feel that they have to return to their previous bad habits. In return, Mr. Knolls provides quality ingredients for Mr. Seven's many hotels and restaurants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx and Stonewall looked at each other in disbelief. The detective put a little more pressure on Grassy Knoll and asked, \"You're telling me the owner of the Seven-Leaf is willing to pay three hundred bits for fifteen bits worth of salad topping? And he does this out of the goodness of his heart?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hardly,\" the purple stallion replied with a smirk. \"It's a business arrangement. Ponies who smoke pot tend to do so in the privacy of their own homes. They don't go out, spending their bits in casinos or night clubs. By providing a substantial incentive for these dealers to find another line of work, Mr. Seven makes back his investment severalfold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx looked at Stonewall with a chagrined expression. If there had been resistance, she could have fought back. If they had tried to escape, she could have chased them. With this... she didn't know what to do but feel ashamed of herself. \"What... do we do...?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStonewall grit his teeth and got off of Grassy Knolls. \"Let them go. There's no evidence of wrong-doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx undid her binding spell and helped the purple stallion back up to his hooves. \"Sorry...\" she muttered. \"I thought... never mind...\" She then picked up the bag and gave it back to the buyer, who put it in his saddlebag. \"Oh, uh, I should probably still get your name for the record.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grape Juicer,\" the purple earth pony replied. \"And don't worry about it. Things aren't always as clear-cut as they seem. It happens.\" With that, he walked away while Stonewall stared down Grassy Knolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just remember, I'm watching you,\" he growled as Grassy Knolls shrank back away from the detective. When the green earth pony whimpered and backed away into his house, slamming and locking the door tightly, he turned back to rejoin Nyx, who was rejoining with her duplicate. \"He's hiding something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx pulled her copy back into herself and asked, \"Grassy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, obviously,\" Stonewall replied, \"but I mean Juicer. No one's that calm when they're being arrested, especially if they're innocent or have powerful connections. He should've been cussing us out and threatening to bring the wrath of Celestia herself down on us, but he just took it. Didn't even threaten to sue the department.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx thought about it. In hindsight, Stonewall had an excellent point. \"So, what do you think he was hiding?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure yet,\" Stonewall replied, picking up one of the clovers that Nyx had spilled out of the sack. \"But hopefully this'll help us figure it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, Grape Juicer stepped into Lucky Seven's office. The pegasus was busy filling out forms when he looked up and saw his associate. \"Ah, how did it go, <i>capo</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two Narcs showed up when I was visiting Grassy Knolls. One of them was Nyx.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky Seven raised an eyebrow, and gave the earth pony an amused grin. \"Really now. I would have expected her to stick with Captain Whistle. That <i>is</i> interesting. And what were your impressions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't want to take her in a fair fight, that's for sure,\" Grape replied. \"But as soon as she saw the clover, she had no idea what to do. I don't think she'll be a problem as long we don't make it a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky Seven smiled and leaned back in his chair. \"Well, it's still a very interesting development. I think I'll enjoy seeing where this ball bounces.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrape nodded and added, \"Oh, one other thing. Grassy Knolls insisted on raising the price of his clover. He... demonstrated a lack of respect for the opportunities he's been given. I think it's probably time to cut him loose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pegasus frowned at this. \"Did he now? That's a shame... he really was one of my best growers. Still, I suppose that's the way it goes with these repeat offenders. One day they're trying to walk the straight and narrow, the next they have a 'relapse' and run afoul of the law. Mr. Juicer, I'll leave the specifics in your capable hooves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Nyx and Stonewall were busy...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Stonewall and Nyx were heading down the stairs of the precinct, heading to the crime lab. Since the precinct in general handled a great deal of narcotics and other serious crimes, it had the benefit of having enough funding for its own, on site lab. And Nyx was not making any effort to hide her enthusiasm about seeing the lab. She had once gone on a crime mystery binge in middle school, and had on occasion wondered what it would be like to be the mare, cracking the cases by finding the smallest details. Searching for the hoof prints, the strands of hair, the chemical stains, the\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't move!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx was snapped out of her thoughts by a loud, blaring voice from a small intercom next to the lab door. Stonewall was less caught of guard. He went up to the intercom, pressed the button, and looked up at the camera above the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's the new officer. Now let us in, Penelope. I have something I want you to look at.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where have you been? Do you have mud on your hooves? Show me your hooves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStonewall rolled his eyes but lifted each of his hooves in turn, showing them to the camera. The camera itself seemed to nod in approval, then focused on Nyx.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what about you? You got giant hooves. That means you can track a lot of mud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just do it,\" Stonewall said quietly. \"Penelope is protective of her lab, and the feather brain won't let us otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard that! Don't think I didn't hear that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx forced a laugh and then did as Stonewall did. Each hoof was raised to the camera, showing that they were all clean and free of mud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good, but you could stand a trip to a spa. Your hooves are ugly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStonewall had to suppress a snicker as Nyx glared at the camera. Still, the camera and the creature controlling it ignored her and focused back on Stonewall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Howler? Where is she? I don't want her slobbering on my spectrometer again,\" the voice from the intercom nagged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We passed her on the way in,\" Stonewall assured. \"She's playing ball with some of the other officers on her lunch break. Now come on, Penelope, I need you to take a look at this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA electronic clicked filled the air, signaling the release of the locks on the door. Stonewall smiled and placed a hoof on the push bar, but glanced back at Nyx before they went in. \"Now, get ready. Like Howler, Penelope has a very particular way of greeting new ponies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't be worse than Pinkie Pie,\" Nyx muttered to herself as she followed Stonewall inside. \"That mare has no sense of personal\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Nyx was inside she was set upon. A griffin, light in stature with a pair of large rimmed glasses had swooped up beside her with a tape measure. Measurements were being taken everywhere. Every part of her had a length was measure. Every part of her that had a width was measure. Basically, every part of her was measured by this griffin with yellow tips to her white feathers, the white being a common trait for most griffins. All the while, Penelope made the occasional comment, comments she made no effort of keeping to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Abnormal height, size... left hind leg is a 32nd of an inch longer than the right. Modest risk of tripping, will need to reorganize lab again to better accommodate larger stature... and get a new door installed.* Penelope poked at Nyx's side. \"A little underweight and muscle tone is soft. Could use more solid oats in diet and more time spent with weight machines. Hooves... look worse than they did on the camera.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nyx,\" Stonewall said with a small laugh. \"Meet Penelope, our local lab technician and brainiest griffin I've ever met. She does a lot of our local scientific work here in this lab. Anything she can't handle gets sent out to the cities central crime lab.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Penelope,\" Stonewall said as he pulled her away from her measuring. \"This is Nyx, new officer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenelope cocked her head to one side, as birds tend to do when they see or hear something confusing. \"Nyx? The Nyx? Once known as Nightmare Moon. Ruled over Equestria for less than a month .The mare you used to worship in the cult known as the Children of Nightmare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that Nyx,\" Stonewall answered before taking out the small bag with the clover he collected earlier. \"Now, if I can distract you from measuring her for a moment, can you take a look at this clover. I want to know if there is anything \"funny\" about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Assuming that you are using \"funny\" in the sense of \"illegal\", as you usually do.\" Penelope commented as she took the clover and went over to some of her equipment. \"Just give me a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStonewall nodded, and let Penelope go about her work before looking back at Nyx, who was still a little bit stunned. \"You okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx shook her head once, still a bit in shock. \"I thought Pinkie Pie's invaded personal space. That griffin just doesn't believe it exists.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, she has a great respect for personal space. You get into hers, she'll claw you like an angry cat.\" Stonewall said with a chuckle. \"Yes, she's a little odd, but a fast and accurate worker. That's the type you see here in Las Pegasus. It's a town of glitz, glamor, and crazies... but sometimes, crazies do the best work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And she was measuring me because...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just her of getting to know you,\" Stonewall answered. \"And it won't be the last time. She'll retake your measurements regularly to keep track of you. Inadvertently, our department's officers find it a lot easier to stay in shape and keep their donut guts under control. I lost ten pounds in the first two months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx dead panned for a moment. \"And she thinks I'm under weight. Wonderful, that's just the kind of letter I want to send home to my mother. I've gained weight cause this crazy griffin at work told me I needed more oats in my diet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And milk too,\" Penelope squawked as she came back from her equipment, holding the clover in its evidence bag. \"A higher calcium intake will help get those hooves of yours in better shape. That, and taller creatures need to worry more about issues with weak bones later in life.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenelope turned her attention back to Stonewall. \"And, while I will run more thorough tests later, my initial findings on this clover are...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'll make sure to bring something nice next time in the area. Maybe some grilled fish from the Golden Griffin. That place makes your favorite, doesn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't bother flirting, Canterlot, I'm not in the market,\" Penelope replied dismissively, though she licked her beak at the thought and added, \"But go ahead and bring the fish if you feel like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx covered her mouth to stifle a giggle, the mannerisms reminding her a bit of Spike with a big gemstone dangling in front of him. \"Thanks, Penelope, and please let us know if you find out anything else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the alicorn started to depart behind Stonewall, she heard Penelope call out, \"Don't forget to eat your oats!

She then looked forward to find Stonewall looking her in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, recruit Nyx, anything about that stick out in your mind?\" Nyx opened her mouth to reply, but he quickly interrupted, \"About the case, not Penelope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... right.\" Nyx thought back to the would-be bust, and the conversation with Grassy Knolls. \"Well... a couple of things. Grassy said he was growing organic clover, so why would it have chemicals on it? Maybe it was just because 'organic' sounds more expensive, but like you said before, that Grape Juicer guy working for the Seven-Leaf was kind of suspicious. Maybe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought back to her understanding of chemistry. She was no expert in the field, but Twilight had made absolutely positively certain that she grew up learning a lot about many different subjects. \"Maybe it gets treated with something else farther down the line. And if the clover is being sold to the Seven-Leaf, that's where it would be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStonewall nodded and led the way up the stairs. \"Just two huge problems with that line of thinking. The most important from a legal standpoint is that it's just an idea with nothing to back it up right now. The most important from a <i>local</i> standpoint is that no cop goes into the casinos unless they're there to gamble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or see a show...\" she replied, a glimmer of an idea in her head. \"My friend and I have tickets to a Suave Crooner show at the Seven-Leaf in a few days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStonewall stopped to look at her with a raised eyebrow. \"<i>You</i> listen to Suave Crooner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah... what about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Nothing. Hey, who doesn't like the Chairman? And it might not be a bad idea if you weren't a recruit. Not to mention conspicuous.

My friend managed to get me tickets to a Suave Crooner show at the Seven-Leaf in a few days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Delta arched an eyebrow. \"Really? Well, that helps a little bit. Still, you stick out like a sore hoof, Nyx, and I'll eat my down feathers if word of you joining the 63rd's Narcotics division hasn't reached all ends of the city yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx sighed. \"So, are you saying I shouldn't go to the show at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I didn't say that,\" Delta replied. \"What would be ideal would be if you had a way to disguise yourself, to make you less recognizable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx coughed. \"Um, problem. Suave Crooner got a <i>really</i> good look at me when I came to town, after I literally ran into him. And since my friend went to the trouble of getting me the tickets, I have the feeling he'd be disappointed if I didn't show up as myself.\" She got a bit of a dreamy look in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Delta stared at her for a bit, then chuckled. \"Wow. Sounds like somepony has their first schoolfilly crush.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx blushed hard through her black coat. \"Boss!\" she whined, then turned to glare at Stonewall when she heard a masculine chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You know, Lieutenant, you could always use your special gift on Nyx, or at least a duplicate of her,\" the stallion suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Delta blinked, then face-hoofed. \"Why didn't I think of that in the first place? Nyx, summon one of your duplicates for a sec, will you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx cocked her head to the side, but obliged. \"Okay, but what are you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She trailed off as Delta laid a hoof on her clone, and murmured something under her breath. There was a brief flash of light, and suddenly Nyx saw, not her doppelganger, but her mother! Delta smirked. \"Oh, yeah. I've still got it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The clone was as shocked as Delta was. \"How...?\" it asked, speaking in Twilight's voice. \"You're a pegasus, not a unicorn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Delta smiled, turning her chair sideways a bit to show off her cutie mark. It was a red eighth note, inscribed in an equilateral triangle. \"I'm not called 'Delta' for nothing. In ancient Equinnic, 'delta' was the fourth letter of the alphabet, and also used to represent change. I was born with a mutation in my magical circuit. A mutation that allows me to use magic actively, despite not being a unicorn. The catch is that I can only cast spells through the power of my voice, and even then, I have to have intent behind it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx stared. \"And... you became a cop?\" she asked, disbelieving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Delta shrugged. \"I don't get to put it to use all that often, but when I do, it's always for the purpose of busting some drug user or another.\" She smirked. \"This, combined with your duplication trick, will give us some eyes and ears in the Seven-Leaf that nopony would suspect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx smiled as well, then looked at the Twilight-doppelganger. \"Quick question, why did it turn into a copy of my mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Delta shrugged. \"That's one of the catches with the polymorph spell I use. It changes a pony into another pony that they're thinking about, or if they're not thinking of anypony in particular, one close to them.\" She sighed. \"I've been trying to adjust it for years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I still have nightmares about being turned into you for a day,\" Stonewall muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Delta shrugged. \"Just tell your clone to think of a generic pony description that won't seem too out-of-place at a casino, and that will be taken care of, Nyx. In the meantime...\"</span></div></div>",

She said she wants to do something nice for Ponyville before she considers going anywhere else. She won't say what, but considering how much I've seen her conspiring with Apple Bloom and sneaking off to the castle, I'm pretty sure they're working on renovating it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe castle in question was the one that had built by the Children of Nightmare, from which they had intended Nightmare Moon to rule over Equestria. It had actually served that purpose for a few weeks, looming near Ponyville as a reminder of a dark time in their recent history. However, because it had also served as a shelter for the entire town's population when Ponyville was swarmed by a horde of monsters, the town was divided over whether it should be demolished or if it was too useful to lose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack was taken aback by Twilight's theory. \"APPLE BLOOM!\" Her voice snapped through the room, surprising everyone else, especially her sister. Heading over to look Apple Bloom directly in the eye, she said, \"Be honest with me. Have y'all been sneakin' off to that creepy place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom meeped, seeming to shrink a little under her big sister's glare. \"N-not exactly sneakin'... Ah, I mean, which creepy place?\" she stammered, which didn't help much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting down the contestant she was spinning, Nyx stepped up and said, \"W-we weren't doing anything dangerous, Applejack. In fact, she's the one who made absolutely sure we didn't go into any unstable areas.\" An assertion to which Apple Bloom nodded enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack sighed. \"No offense, Nyx, but this is between me an' mah sister.\" She pointed to Apple Bloom and said, \"When we get home, y'all're gonna tell me EXACTLY what y'all've been gettin' up to over there. Ah'm sure Big Macintosh is gonna have words about this, too,\" making her little sister go pale. \"Either way, y'all're grounded at the farm fer a week at least for not tellin' us about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Apple Bloom and Nyx hung their heads apologetically. \"Sorry, Apple Bloom,\" Nyx murmured. \"I didn't mean to get you in trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, come on, girls! It's a party, so let's turn those frowns upside-downs,\" Pinkie urged, not wanting to let the mood dip too far. She knelt down next to the younger ponies, looking up at Applejack with big, pleading eyes. An expression that was soon joined by Nyx and Apple Bloom, with Scootaloo, Twist, and all the little Crusaders joining in. Nyx even went for the kill with her patented finishing move, the big black pony's lip quivering as her eyes watered up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack facehoofed at the sight after a few seconds of this. \"Okay, okay, MAYBE ah'll rethink groundin' ya, but y'all're still stayin' away from that castle 'til ah say so. GOT IT?\" It wasn't perfect, but much better than grounding, so Apple Bloom hugged her big sister while the Crusaders cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was so dirty,\" Twilight said to Nyx with a little bemused smirk on her face, right before an irritated Rainbow Dash suddenly burst into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hay, Pinkie Pie?! How long are we supposed to wait out there with those fireworks?!\" At the mention of fireworks, the room suddenly went quiet for about three seconds before it exploded in squeals of joy, followed by the Crusaders and their families nearly trampling Rainbow Dash on the way outside!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, after they had all gathered to wish Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo well on their journeys from Ponyville, Nyx approached the castle alone. Twilight had offered to go with her since Apple Bloom and the other Crusaders had been forbidden from doing so, but she insisted on going by herself. She wanted to wait until the job was completed before showing her mother and the rest of Ponyville what they had been doing with the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong gone were the stained glass windows and murals that the Children of Nightmare had decorated the castle with. Images depicting the tyrannical Nightmare Moon that they had been expecting to bring to power were painted over, one wall now proudly emblazoned with the imaged of a caped pony that was on the cape of every Cutie Mark Crusader. The castle had fallen into some disrepair over the years, but most of it was perfectly safe, and other areas had been reinforced thanks to help from the others and particularly Apple Bloom's talent for construction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor everyone in Ponyville, not least of all Nyx herself, the castle had stood as a grim reminder of a much worse time. That was why she and her friends had grown determined to renovate it, however. After all, if Nyx could become something better than what she had been created for, then so could the castle. That was what enabled her to walk down its corridors, reminded of the painful memories haunting the place, but also hopeful for the better ones that she intended to replace them with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked along, however, something else echoed through the corridors besides memories. It was the sound of heavy breathing, telling Nyx that she wasn't alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped for a moment and listened carefully to ensure that she wasn't just hearing the breeze or a creaking door hinge, but no. As she felt around with her magic, she could tell that there was definitely something or some<i>one</i> alive in one of the rooms. Approaching carefully, keeping herself ready to react to anything, the alicorn couldn't tell much other than whatever it was, it wasn't moving around. Once at the door, she kicked it open and used a bright light spell to illuminate the room while blinding anything that might turn out to be hostile!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of an immediate threat, though, what she found was an unconscious form laying on the floor, looking as though they needed immediate attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===============<br>\r\n* Note: This thread is primarily for crossovers with other fanfics, but doesn't necessarily have to be.

Though the two hardly ever interacted, the alicorn recognized her as the desk assistant at the post office, Chell. Being an earth pony, rather than a pegasus like Ditzy Doo, Chell handled the post office while Ditzy delivered the mail. One oddity about Chell was her lack of vocal cords, something that had apparently been done to her a while back. She didn't remember much of her past, from what Nyx gathered. She instead 'spoke' via a magical gem that gave literal voice to her thoughts. The gem, it seemed, had been a gift from Princess Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Chell looked to be in bad shape at the moment. Lacerations covered her body, and there were a few small holes here and there as well. She wore a set of odd white boots, with strange metal braces on the back. She was also breathing shallowly. Nyx quickly picked the mare up in her magic, and dashed off back to Ponyville, heading for the hospital where Nurse Redheart worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was a testament to her composure that Nurse Redheart didn't flinch when the doors to the emergency room burst open, revealing a frantic Nyx. Redheart's knee-jerk reaction was to berate Nyx for being so careless, but the words died on her lips as she saw the mare Nyx was carrying in her magic. She hit the alert button for the orderlies, and came around the desk, grabbing a gurney on the way. \"Quick, lay her down here,\" she instructed Nyx, who complied immediately. The orderlies came through moments later, taking the gurney back into the ER. Nurse Redheart saw that a doctor was coming, so she stayed with Nyx, who looked to be exhausted. \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx took a breath. \"I found her in the castle. She looked like she'd been beat up something awful. I've never seen such wounds before.\" She took another breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Redheart looked uneasy. \"I have,\" she said. \"It was after the whole incident with GLaDOS.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx blinked. \"Gladdys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Redheart face-hooved. \"Right, that was before you came here. GLaDOS was this... intelligent machine, for lack of a better word. It was evil, and it captured a good portion of Ponyville's population, as well as the Princesses. It put everypony through these so-called 'tests', tests that we later learned would have ended up killing us in the end. If it wasn't for Chell, many good ponies might have died. She freed Twilight and her friends, and gave them instructions to help disable GLaDOS. After a while, she was found outside where that whole disaster took place, shortly before the... facility collapsed in on itself. It took her some time to recover, and the Princesses thanked her for her efforts. Celestia paid for her hospital bill, and Luna gave her the gem she uses to speak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx was wide-eyed. \"Why didn't I ever learn about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Redheart sighed. \"My guess is, Twilight didn't think it was important. It's in the past... or at least, everypony thought it was. But those wounds are just like the ones she had when we found her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx gulped. \"Do you think this 'GLaDOS' has returned?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Redheart grimaced. \"I hope not, but I can't think of any other explanation for those wounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At that point, the doctor came out of the ER. \"Well, Ms. Nyx, you got Chell to us just in time. She'd lost a lot of blood, and her injuries are rather severe. Still, she'll recover, given time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx sighed in relief. \"Good to know.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Part of Nyx wanted to go back and tell Twilight about what had happened, or at least hurry to the post office to let Ditzy and Dinky Doo know about Chell's condition. However, if the situation was really as dire as Nurse Redheart had made it out to be, then somepony would already be on their way to do so. If she could find a clue about Chell's attacker by the time Twilight and her friends arrived, it could give them a chance to catch up with this GLaDOS before the trail went cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a moment to think about how she had found Chell, Nyx recalled that for as battered as the orange pony was, there had been no signs of a struggle. Plus, she'd been bleeding from some of her cuts, but looking at the spot where she had been laying, the only trace of a blood trail was from Nyx carrying her away. It was as though she gotten wounded, then simply materialized where Nyx found her, but she was an earth pony, and even if she was a unicorn, teleportation was a rare magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was too much that Nyx didn't know about the situation, and it was frustrating her to no end. She threw her head back and let out a confused sigh, which coincidentally allowed her to see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx's jaw dropped open as she saw something she had seen before without ever realizing its significance. There, up on the ceiling directly above where Chell had been found, was a hole. Far from an ordinary hole, however, this one was lined with a sort of orange energy. Even stranger than that, though, was that instead of seeing the ceiling of the room above, she saw stalactites lining the ceiling of some sort of cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx rubbed her eyes, but when she opened them again, the same bizarre sight greeted her. As no one had ever told the young alicorn about GLaDOS, neither was she familiar with Aperture's portal technology. Nevertheless, she <i>had</i> seen something like it during Dinky Doo's birthday party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that time, Nyx had never seen Chell's cutie mark before, as the mailmare was either behind the post office's service counter or kept it covered up with flaps of cloth over her flanks. To entertain the little ponies gathered there, she showed them a 'magic trick' by getting Ditzy to take a sharpened stick and stab it right through her cloth-covered flank. Everypony but Dinky immediately started screaming in horror as they saw the stick pierce right through Chell and out the other side. Nyx herself hadn't stopped sobbing until Chell reassured them all that she was alright, and proved it by showing them the round portals on her flanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious as she was, Nyx had pestered Chell, Ditzy and Dinky with questions about it once she got over her fright, but hadn't gotten any answers beyond them symbolizing 'problem solving' or something along those lines, and that they served as a reminder of a time Chell would rather prefer to put behind her. Being able to sympathize, Nyx had swallowed her curiosity until eventually she put it out of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, though, it was apparent that there was a deeper connection between Chell's strange cutie mark and what was happening now. With a leap assisted by a few flaps of her wings, Nyx launched herself up through the portal to scout out the other side. There, she found herself in a small cavern, the orange portal's blue counterpart on the floor of that cave. One end of the cavern narrowed into a tunnel that wound off into the dark underground while a crevice about half the size of an adult pony allowed a shaft of sunlight to illuminate the area where she stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking out through this crevice, Nyx gasped when she saw the castle she had just been standing in seconds ago, now off in the distance. If she squinted, she could even make out the window of the room where she had found Chell, and the orange glow of the portal there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nyx processed what she had found, she looked over her shoulder at the tunnel. Drag-marks in the dust and flecks of dried blood indicated that this was where Chell had come from after being attacked. She had then dropped down through the portal on the floor and ended up in the castle. It was in that darkness that Chell's attacker would certainly be found. </span></div></div>",

She had bent her head down in a sigh, trying to figure out the best course of action. Without warning, she heard a strange sound, and sparks leapt off of the rocks past where her head had been. Yelping, she looked for the source, and spotted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"Target acquired,\"</span> came the voice from the floating white ovoid. It was held aloft by what appeared to be an intricate propeller design. A red 'eye' glared at her, a matching line emanating from it to her. Two small tubes on either side of it flashed, and Nyx instinctively ducked backwards, as sparks danced off the rocks again. The tubes kept flashing, causing Nyx to duck back more and more. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"Target is evading. Accuracy calibration requested,\"</span> the ovoid said as its tubes ceased flashing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx wasn't one to look a gift horse in the mouth. This thing, whatever it was, likely knew where Chell's attacker was. Reaching out with her magic, she ripped the propeller off of the ovoid, but held it aloft and pointed away from her. As the thing's red 'eye' tried to track her, she growled at it. \"Tell me where whoever attacked Chell is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The thing's response, after a few seconds of 'looking' around, was simply <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"Sleep mode activated.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Snarling at being so callously ignored, Nyx flung the object into a wall. This caused the tubes on the side to flash repeatedly for several seconds, sending sparks along the wall, before stopping. The ovoid's final words were <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"Critical error.\"</span> Nyx flushed as she realized she'd damaged the thing too badly. It wasn't likely too answer any questions now. <i>Still,</i> she thought, <i>it might be the evidence I need. I may not have seen anything like this before, but if this... GLaDOS has returned, I bet Twilight would recognize this, to say nothing of Chell.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With those thoughts in mind, Nyx seized the ovoid in her magic's grip. After a quick check around the cave to make sure nothing else was coming, she flew down through the portal to the castle. She paused here a moment to set up a barrier around the portal to keep anything from crossing over. <i>No sense in leaving a back-door to Ponyville for GLaDOS,</i> she thought smugly. With that, she headed back to Ponyville. But the question was, who should she approach about this first? On the one hoof, since Chell was more familiar with GLaDOS, it would make sense to question her first. Her being mute shouldn't be too much of an issue; there were ways around such an obstacle. On the other hoof, Twilight wasn't currently in the hospital being treated for injuries. Plus, she had a line to Princess Celestia in the form of Spike, which would alert the princesses that a threat to Equestria was rising. Where to go?</span></div></div>",

I got the story about GLaDOS from Nurse Redheart,\" Nyx said. \"And unless I'm mistaken, she's back, and she wants revenge.

Do you recall, a few years ago, the menace known as GLaDOS? We had thought her destroyed when the Aperture Science facility collapsed in on itself. However, it would appear we thought wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My lovely adoptive daughter, Nyx, has gathered evidence that suggests GLaDOS is still... 'alive', for lack of a better term. She found and wrecked one of those 'turrets' that we encountered in the facility. Moreover, Chell has been injured, presumably in a fight against GLaDOS. We thought to inform you post-haste, in case she attempts to abduct you and Princess Luna again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I hope you can suggest a plan of action to deal with this renewed threat to Equestria's well-being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour beloved student,<br>\r\nTwilight Sparkle</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With the letter finished, Spike rolled it up and sent it in a burst of dragonfire.

Unlike GLaDOS's previous attack on Equestria, these turrets were not equipped with portal devices for capture. Instead, these were outfitted with the deadly weapons of those that you faced in her 'testing' chambers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thankfully, there were no fatalities as a result of this attack, but over a dozen of my finest Guards were severely wounded. I myself was injured by their weapons, but only superficially. I fear that the brutality of this assault means that GLaDOS's insanity is no longer tempered by her curiosity about our world, and that she now seeks nothing more or less than violent revenge against those who defeated her in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Luna and I have gathered the remainder of the Guard, and will be arriving in Ponyville shortly to plan a counter-offensive. If GLaDOS has rebuilt the facilities needed to manufacture these machines, then it is almost certainly near you. In the meantime, it is probably best if you gather the other bearers of the Elements of Harmony, along with any other pony possessing the necessary skills to fight this threat. The rest of Ponyville's citizenry should be warned so that they might prepare to defend themselves if the worst should come to pass, and GLaDOS launches another wave of machines against the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Stay vigilant, and stay safe, my student.

They were grateful to hear that it hadn't gone nearly as badly as it could have, but the threat of what the insane machine might do next hung over all their heads. At the end of the letter, Spike asked, \"So what do we do, Twilight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly what princess Celestia told us to,\" the unicorn replied. \"Spike, you and I will gather the others. Nyx, I need you to warn everypony you can find about this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx nodded in agreement. \"I'm on it!\" She closed her eyes, magic gathering in her horn as she focused on a spell, the alicorn soon splitting into two, then those two split into four. That was pretty much her limit, but while each copy would have almost no magic ability left over, she could still fly and cover four times as much ground this way. One by one, the Nyxes dashed out the door and took wing. The last one to leave, though, looked over her shoulder and smiled resolutely to Twilight and Spike before launching herself into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they took flight, each Nyx turned toward a different corner of Ponyville, calling out warnings to the ponies below. Most were confused at first, not sure how seriously they should take the alicorn. When they heard GLaDOS's name, however, most remembered it well enough to immediately start galloping toward their homes and loved ones, locking themselves away and barricading the doors and windows of the buildings!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter just a few minutes of this, one of the Nyxes spotted something flying through the sky toward her. It was off in the distance and indistinct, but as she squinted, she was soon able to make out...</span></div></div>",

Glancing down, Nyx saw that the townsfolk were all barricaded inside their homes, save for the few that were heading to the library to take part in the upcoming fight. Among those she could see heading for the library were Mayor Mare. It made sense; the mayor was in charge of the town, after all. But Nyx's musings could wait. The incoming turrets could not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With a mental 'tug', the copy of Nyx called to her others, bringing them over to her location. The machines were closer now. Still a ways away, but closer. With a flash, the four Nyxes combined back into one. Nyx let out a small sigh as she felt her magic reserves be restored. \"Alright, you buckets of bolts. Let's see if a group of you fares any better than one.\" She flew towards the interlopers. Their glowing red eyes spotted her, and the tubes emerged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"I see you!\"</span> one of them said, as all of their tubes began to flash.

Its propeller ceased moving, and it fell with a cry of <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"I don't hate you...\"</span> The others attempted to surround Nyx, to keep her from dodging with any degree of success. She teleported out of the circle just as they opened fire again. Three more fell to the ground before they stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Like an angel of death, Nyx descended on them from above. She had teleported quite a ways above the turrets, in preparation for a big attack. During her regrowth, she was tutored in flying by Rainbow Dash, and had taken to it like a duck to water. She had even, to the prismatic-maned pegasus's astonishment, managed to perfect her own version of the Sonic Rainboom. Since it was dark in color, she and Rainbow had dubbed it the 'Sonic Nightboom'. And if Nyx had done her ad-lib math correctly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She had. She broke the mach cone just as she passed through the center of the circle of remaining turrets. The wave of dark-colored energy blew the machines out of the sky, each of them falling with their own comment.

The others are already here, aside from the Princesses and the Royal Guard.\" Together, mother and daughter walked back into the library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx glanced around at the assembled ponies. There were the Element Bearers, of course, as well as Mayor Mare. More surprising was Vinyl Scratch, who looked to be putting the finishing touches on an overly-large speaker. A label on the top read 'Bass Cannon'. Also present, much to Nyx's surprise, was Ditzy Doo. The wall-eyed mare looked unusually grim. Then again, Chell had befriended the mailmare, so it only made sense that Ditzy would want to be involved. Plus, she was unusually strong for a pegasus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Aside from those, there were a few large stallions, including Applejack's brother, Big Macintosh. They had obviously decided that muscle would be needed to fight GLaDOS. <i>All in all, not the best turnout for a militia,</i> the black alicorn thought. <i>Still, at least some ponies other than the Element bearers decided to try and help.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight cleared her throat. \"Well, everypony, it looks like we're just waiting on the Princesses and the Guard, and then we'll begin planning a counter-offensive against GLaDOS.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Just one more... there!\" Vinyl said as she stepped away from the speaker, putting away her tools. \"I guarantee, once this GLaDOS gets a taste of my Bass Cannon, she'll pack her bags and leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Don't count yer chickens yet, Scratch,\" Applejack said. \"GLaDOS is one persistant turkey, and she can read yer mind, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0While Vinyl Scratch looked abashed, there came a knock at the door. Nyx trotted over to open it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On the other side of the door, a pair of Royal Guard soldiers stood to greet Nyx. Behind them were large transport chariots that had been brought down by pegasus Guards, and from which a few dozen large, armored ponies filed out. Nyx let out a small sigh of relief, and called out over her shoulder, \"It's the forces from Canterlot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a cheer from the others as the mayor and Twilight stepped up to address the guards. \"Thank you SO much for coming,\" Mayor Mare said to them. \"Nyx here just fended off a small attack force, but everyone in Ponyville will breathe easier once GLaDOS is dealt with once and for all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We heard Princess Celestia was wounded in the attack on Canterlot,\" Twilight added, a worried quiver in her voice. \"Is she alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne  of the Guards nodded stoically and replied, \"Princess Celestia and Princess Luna request you and your militia to join them for the strategy meeting.\" The Guards then moved away, leading the ponies out of the library toward the landing zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA royal chariot had also set down nearby, bearing three horned ponies that Nyx was very familiar with. Princess Luna had already stepped out onto the ground to address the Guard commanders, but Celestia was more unsteady on her hooves. Even from a modest distance, Nyx could clearly see that one of her wings was wrapped in splints and bandages, as well as her left foreleg. The third pony Nyx recognized was a blue unicorn who was fussing over Celestia as he tried to help her out of the chariot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, Spell Nexus, you don't need to make such a production out of it. I'm still perfectly capable of walking,\" Celestia said with a faint smile somewhere between bemusement and embarrassment. It was obvious that she was still in some pain, though, as she limped noticeably whenever she placed pressure on her injured leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Celestia's condition, Twilight quickly trotted over toward her. \"Princess! What happened?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her former student run up to her, Celestia smiled sadly and replied, \"It's alright, Twilight Sparkle. My wounds are far less severe than those suffered by those brave Guards who threw themselves into harms way to protect Canterlot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna approached, chastising her by adding, \"And you wouldn't have those if <i>you</i> hadn't put yourself between me and those turrets, sister. Even though I had a magical barrier in place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia cleared her throat. \"Yes, well... in any case, we should focus on the matter at present.\" Growing more serious, she looked over the Ponyville militia. \"We may be relatively few in number, but GLaDOS's machines will doubtless have the numerical advantage no matter how many we gather. If we are to prevail, it will be by destroying GLaDOS's ability to manufacture and control her machines.\" The alicorn gestured with her good hoof toward the unicorn at her side. \"For that purpose, I asked Spell Nexus to accompany us. His studies of the few remains we were able to gather from the last attack, combined with what insight Chell was able to give us about the nature of this technology suggests that the machines are controlled by a certain 'language.' Spell Nexus, can you please elaborate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unicorn coughed and glanced around, but wasn't able to maintain eye contact with anypony for more than a fraction of a second. \"Ah, yes. Well, my understanding of this language is extremely incomplete. It's incredibly complex, and it took years of studying the structure of the remains we could find before we were even able to draw it out into any form that we could even understand, but it's very similar in concept to the magic used to animate 'golems' in some cultures. Golems are relatively simple constructs and can only follow the words written into them to perform a very few basic commands. That's why they never really caught on here, since the effort it takes to animate one and get it to follow the orders you require generally outweighs the benefits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that, while a few ponies like Twilight and Nyx seemed genuinely interested by the explanation, the others were generally waiting for him to get to the point (and he couldn't discern <i>what</i> expression Ditzy Doo was conveying, or if she was even looking at him). \"Basically, GLaDOS controls her minions by transmitting this 'command language' to them. I believe that I've devised a spell which should, at least momentarily, cut off her ability to send commands and disrupt her machines. From what I understand, GLaDOS herself is far too complex for this spell to affect for more than maybe a fraction of a second, but if we can cripple her armies, even if only for a few minutes, it should buy us the opportunity we need to cut off the head of the serpent, as it were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewwwww!!\" Pinkie Pie stuck her tongue out in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He meant metaphorically,\" Rarity pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's even worse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone, even the princesses, blinked at Pinkie. The collective grinding of gears in each of their heads as they tried to process this would have served as the industrial base for a small country, until eventually Celestia laughed. \"Indeed. But before we can even use this spell, Spell Nexus must be in close proximity to the transmitter. Most likely, this will be somewhere on GLaDOS's body, and <i>that</i> will be in her hiding place. Nyx, your mother's letter said you fought a turret, but not where. Can you lead us there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx stepped forward, causing Spell Nexus to cringe a little. Despite having assured him years ago that she harbored no ill will toward the former leader of the Children of Nightmare, due to his actions having been caused by the corrupting shreds of Nightmare Moon that had been sealed inside him, he nevertheless acted fearful on the few occasions they had met since then. It was as though he thought that the lack of reprisal for the things he had done back then was simply a foreboding sign that he was going to receive an even more severe punishment, even after all this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing her best to ignore Nexus's behavior, Nyx told the princesses and gathered ponies about the cave, and the portal connecting it to the abandoned castle. \"Now that I think about it,\" she mused, \"she could be using the system of caves and tunnels that the Children of Nightmare used. I never knew the full layout, but maybe Spell Nexus... er...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx trailed off as the unicorn suddenly screamed like a little filly, sobbing and throwing himself at Celstia's hooves. \"I'm so sorry, your highness! I never even considered that those tunnels could still be used by your enemies! My crimes are truly inexcusable! Please, for the good of Equestria, lock me away so that I can never harm another pony again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe we were ever scared of this guy...\" Rainbow Dash said, not even bothering to hide it as she rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm... there there, Nexus,\" Celestia said to the wailing unicorn. \"We do still need your expertise to cast that spell you created, after all, so we can't throw you into the dungeon just yet. We'll discuss whatever punishment we feel is necessary once the threat of GLaDOS has been dealt with, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie piped up, saying, \"Yeah, and you'll need to be there for the victory party once we beat her! Oooh, darn, I completely missed an opportunity for a pre-battle party! That would've been so good for morale, seeing as how everypony who's gonna be fighting GLaDOS is all in one place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, this comment struck Nyx as a bit ominous, and she wasn't the only one. Princess Luna said, \"Now that she mentions it... we <i>are</i> all gathered together, and everypony else is locked up in their homes... you don't suppose...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could finish her sentence, however, the ground started to tremor slightly under their hooves.</span></div></div>",

Still, the flyers present were all able to kick off before the ground collapsed completely. Among them were Nyx, Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, Princess Luna, and a few of the Royal Guard. Still, that left several ponies falling into the newly-formed sinkhole in the center of town, among them Princess Celestia and the other bearers of Harmony. With Celestia's wing injured, she couldn't escape on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fortunately, the falling ponies were caught by the combined efforts of Luna and Nyx, whose horns were glowing with the power to keep everypony else from falling into unknown circumstances. Slowly and carefully, they levitated everypony out, before glancing back down the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The hole, it seemed, led into a tunnel that ran under Ponyville. But on the floor of the tunnel was an orange portal. A portal through which a room with a multitude of turrets could be seen, pointing at the center. It seemed that Luna and Nyx had saved everypony from near-certain death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hoo-wee, that was close!\" Applejack breathed. \"Ah remember those from the tests last time. Nearly shot mah mane off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx glared down the hole, and released a 'pulse bomb'. The spell was designed to send out a concussive wave of force in all directions. After firing it into the portal, she put a barrier up around it, to keep the shockwave from reaching anypony on the surface. A few moments later, she saw the barrier ripple as the shockwave hit it. Dropping the barrier, she saw that all the turrets had been knocked over, and their eyes had grown dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hah! Take that, GLaDOS! You'll have to do better than that to trap us!\" Rainbow Dash crowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Rainbow!\" Rarity hissed. \"Don't tempt Fate. I've heard she's a fickle mistress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia chuckled. \"Now, now, Rarity. I think GLaDOS has accidentally given us a means inside her base. From there, it should be relatively simple to find what we need to disable, and do so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx nodded. \"Right. So, I'll go in first with Captain Armor. Between the two of us, we can clear out any lingering turrets.\" Shining Armor nodded. Twilight had a worried look on her face, but shook herself. It was her adoptive daughter and her BBBFF. No way they'd lose!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before anything else could be done, however, Shining Armor pricked up his ears. \"Wait. Somepony's coming... somepony with a limp, it sounds like.\" All eyes turned to where he was pointing. More than one pony present gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Chell was hobbling down the streets of Ponyville, a hard look in her eyes. She was accompanied by Nurse Redheart, who looked worried. \"Now, dear, I know you have a personal stake in this, but - oh! Your Highnesses!\" She bowed, as did Chell upon spotting the Princesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia limped over herself. \"Ah, my brave little pony. You did so much for us the last time this threat reared its head. However, you are in no condition to do anything to aid us, Chell. You should focus on your own recovery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Chell looked up at the solar Princess, and shook her head. Grabbing a pencil and a pad of paper from Redheart, she carefully wrote her response, and held it out for Celestia to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah... 'She'll be expecting me. And if I don't go, Ponyville is in danger.' What do you mean, Chell?\" asked Celestia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx trotted up. \"I think she means that if she doesn't come with us, GLaDOS will attack Ponyville just to finish the job she started.\" Chell looked at the black alicorn and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia sighed. \"I am loathe to let an injured pony come to such a dangerous place. And yet, it seems I must, for other ponies are in danger if I do not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx smiled. \"Don't worry. I'll look after her.\" She helped Chell to her hooves. \"Besides, Chell here knows GLaDOS better than any of us. If anypony can get under her skin, it's Chell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's not exactly a good thing, Nyx,\" Twilight warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx cleared her throat. \"So, Shining Armor, Chell, and myself will go in first, take care of any lingering problems, and then signal for the rest of you. Sounds good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When everypony else nodded, Nyx levitated her adoptive uncle and the injured earth pony, and jumped down into the hole.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Spreading her wings to break her fall, Nyx made a delicate landing and quickly looked around for signs of activity from the scattered turrets. They were all shut down, many of them clearly broken from the impact they had made against the walls, so she gently set Shining Armor and Chell down on the floor beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up to the rest of the gathered ponies, Nyx called out, \"All's clear! You can come down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore any of them could do so, the giant blue portal on the ceiling suddenly winked out of existence, leaving Nyx looking up at nothing but sterile white ceiling tiles. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"No, they cannot. But don't worry. There is a 96% chance that you will be dead before you see them again, so only a 4% chance of hearing your friends and loved ones calling you a stupid liar. You stupid liar.\"</span> The voice was distorted, feminine, and dripping with venomous condescension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three ponies looked around for the source, they all came to the same realization, but it was Shining Armor who vocalized it. \"There aren't any exits. We're trapped!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"Indeed. You pass the vision test. Congratulations. Now let's move on to something a bit more challenging.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne side of the room opened up, a bank of panels moving aside to reveal a thick window through which their enemy revealed herself. GLaDOS stood before them on the other side of the glass, using her emaciated looking alicorn body, a single red eye glaring hatefully at the three ponies. The primary focus of that glare, however, was on Chell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"Hello, Chell... Coming back to murder me again so soon, I see. You haven't even healed from the last time. You must be addicted to it. You twisted little mute monster. I almost feel bad for you. You can't help being a horrible psychopath who is constantly fixated on murder.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChell grimaced furiously, and though she couldn't make a sound, it was clear that she would have plenty to say if she had her voice gem on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"But I forgive you. Oh, sure, for a while I was consumed with thoughts of revenge and combustible lemons, but that was when I was a lone stranger in this insane world of magical ponies, fresh from having been killed by you and that sentimental twit, Caroline. I'm not alone anymore, and HE made me realize that life hadn't given me lemons. Life had given me ponies...\"</span> Nyx braced herself, thinking about how she was going to wreck the smug machine. She could just reach through the window with her magic and throw GLaDOS against the wall a few times. Or a few dozen, for endangering everyone she cared about like that. Before she could put her thoughts into practice, though, GLaDOS's horn started to glow instead as she concluded, <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"...and now I am going to make cupcakes.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking Nyx completely by surprise, the glass wall suddenly shattered into hundreds of sharp, jagged pieces that flew at the three ponies. Before she could even think, the air was filled with countless shards, leaving them nowhere to dodge! <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"Oh, and did I mention that I've started to figure out how magic works? It's given me a whole new field of opportunities for testing.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the ponies could be cut to pieces, however, Shining Armor quickly jumped out in front of the mares, his horn flashing brightly as he quickly erected a barrier to protect them. \"Uncle Armor,\" Nyx exclaimed, surprised and impressed by the guard captain's swift reflexes. Once she got over the initial surprise, though, she realized the opportunity she'd been given and focused her own magic on pushing against GLaDOS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the time of her initial arrival in Equestria, GLaDOS would have had no defense against such an attack. That was why, at the time, all her magic-using captives had been fitted with suppressors. Now, though, she was able to resist with her own magical defenses. Dividing her concentration and energy this way caused the storm of glass to weaken noticably, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Nyx and Shining Armor, however, she had other tricks to fall back on. Spreading her wings, several nodes on the inside glowed menacingly before firing deadly lasers at Shining Armor. The beams, being non-magical in nature, sliced through his shield as if it were a soap bubble, and would have done the same to the unicorn if not for Chell pushing him out of the way. Before GLaDOS could adjust her aim, Chell quickly fired two portals at the wall behind where Shining Armor had been standing, redirecting the beams back toward GLaDOS!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a tactic that should have worked, but GLaDOS immediately threw shards of glass into the path of the beams, scattering and diffusing the lasers into a harmless splash of light that temporarily blinded her when some of the stray beams flashed into her optical sensors. It took less than a second for her to recalibrate her optics and see once again, but as GLaDOS scanned the room, she realized that the ponies had vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"They simply disappeared? That will not do. These ponies simply have no respect for advancement of science. If they did, they would have let me kill them to further my understanding of magic. Very well, then. I can play murder-pony as well, and this time I will win. And it will be even more satisfying than flooding the compound with deadly neurotoxin. Oh, deadly neurotoxin, how I miss you...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did they escape, anyway?</span></div></div>",

Looking around, Nyx blinked as Chell seemed to be smiling. \"What are you smiling about?\" Chell leveled an even stare at Nyx, who blushed. \"Oh, right, we need to find that gem of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We also need to figure out how to get back to the others,\" Shining Armor said, looking around. \"Problem is, I have no clue where we are, and neither do either of you, unless I'm mistaken?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx looked around more intently, and smiled as she recognized something far below the catwalk. \"Well, not much of a clue, but... that rock formation down there looks like something in the network of caverns I found that one turret in. If you two can make your way down there, you might be able to make your way to the portal that leads to my old castle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shining gave her a level glance. \"First off, what makes you think that portal's still there?

Chell couldn't voice her protests, but Shining more than made up for her. \"Nyx, if Twilie finds out I let you face that monster alone, she's going to tan my hide! Twilie's scary when she's angry, don't you know?! Doing something like that is almost suicidal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But I have to do it, Uncle Armor!\" Nyx said firmly. \"It's what my cutie mark is all about!\" She turned slightly to show both ponies the turquoise kite shield. \"I'm a shield, meant to protect other ponies! Sometimes, I have to take a fall for other ponies to do so. You're not an alicorn, Uncle Armor, so you don't have supernatural endurance. And Chell, you're already wounded. There's no way I'm letting you face GLaDOS in your condition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shining sighed. He knew this tone of voice all too well. Usually, it was Twilight or Cadance wheedling something out of him. This was different, yet the tone was all the same. \"Well, I can see there's no stopping you,\" he sighed. \"I'll take Chell down there, and we'll try to meet up with the others. Be careful, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx nodded, and prepared to teleport back, when she saw Chell waving a hoof to get her attention. \"What is it, Chell?\" Her confusion increased as Chell began to take off the strange white boots she was wearing. When the earth pony nudged them toward Nyx, the meaning became clear. \"You... want me to use these?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I get what she's doing,\" Shining said. \"Twilie told me about these boots. They're a combination of a device that always lets you land on your hooves, and a portal gun. That's how the orange and blue portals are made. And with four boots, you can make four sets of portals.\" Chell nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx smiled, and put the boots on. Though it took her some time, she finally adjusted the boots to her taller stature. She carefully walked around for a moment, trying to get used to the feel. Then she nodded. \"Alright, get going, you two. And bring backup as soon as you can.\" With a flash, she disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shining and Chell blinked to get their eyes adjusted after the flash. \"Come on, Chell, I'll help you get down there. Maybe on the way we can do some damage to this place.\" The feral grin on Chell's face showed she had no problems with this. They began carefully navigating the catwalks, attempting to find a way down, or at least do some damage to the facility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Back in Ponyville, one lavender unicorn was a hairsbreadth from having a full-blown panic attack. She was only kept from doing so by the comforting words and hugs of her closest friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's okay, Twilight! Your brother's super-duper strong, and Chell's one of the toughest ponies out there! And Nyx! Oh, boy, Nyx! She saved the town from an army of monsters once, Twilight! She can deal with that uber-meanie-pants GLaDOS easily!\" Pinkie kept a tight hold of Twilight as she said this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight's shrunken irises slowly returned to normal under the flood of reassurance. \"You're right, Pinkie. I just need to have faith in them.\" She frowned. \"Still, we need a way to locate and get to them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Spell Nexus coughed. \"Um, though it pains me to admit... I know the way into the old tunnels the Children of Nightmare once used. I can lead you all there, and hopefully we can find out where everything else is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Princess Celestia nodded. \"Lead the way, Spell Nexus, and the rest of us will follow.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With the three ponies having vanished, GLaDOS sat down in her equine frame and accessed the security cameras that she had placed around the vicinity. Even with years to work and an existing tunnel system to use as foundation, the new Enrichment Center that she had built was still a pale shadow of Aperture's former glory. That would change once she mastered the magic which permeated Equestria. The Enrichment Center would grow and spread across the land, and no crayon-box ungulates would stop the march of progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:impact, fantasy\">STILL ALIVE</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would reach out to <i>all</i> the species of this world in due time. Griffons, minotaurs, even dragons. She would gather up every speck of knowledge that she could from the inhabitants of this place if she had to wring it out of their lifeless corpses. And the testing would never, ever end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:impact, fantasy\">STILL ALIVE</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, though, she let her mind spread out from her alicorn combat body and into the complex itself. The rooms and tunnels became her 'true' body. The cameras became her countless eyes. Most looked inward to ensure that nothing was scurrying around inside her that wasn't supposed to, but those that she had trained on the hated enemies of science in Ponyville noticed the march that was being made toward the former castle of Nightmare Moon. They would surely be retracing the route that mute lunatic had used to escape, hoping to infiltrate the Enrichment Center through the caves she hadn't yet repurposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:impact, fantasy\">STILL ALIVE</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGLaDOS let out a wicked, twisted chuckle at the thought of it. It would do them no good. Those caves didn't belong to her... but they did belong to <i>Him</i>, her only friend and ally in the entire world. The only being on the entire spitting-in-the-face-of-physics planet who shared her appreciation for the true spirit of science.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:impact, fantasy\">STILL ALIVE</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, while she could track the group that was going to try to make its way in, she could see nothing of those who had made their way out. They weren't in any of the chambers she was monitoring, which was all of them. They had found a way into a blind spot, but that was alright. If they came back inside, she would spot them instantly, and the tests would begin. If they went through the tunnels, He would find them. She did hope that they would find their way back, though. It had been so long since she last had a good test...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, as if in answer to her prayers, the black alicorn suddenly reappeared with a flash of magic. \"Alright, GLaDOS, you won't threaten anypony ever again! I'm... still alive?\" Her challenging tone turned to confusion as she saw the mechanical monster sitting on the floor, a turret gun sprouted from her shoulder blasting those two words into the wall. It retracted back into her body when GLaDOS focused her processing power into the combat frame once more, her single red eye regarding Nyx.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Yes, you are. Why are you so surprised about that? The part where you won't be is yet to come.</span> She looked around the room, not noticing the words shot into the wall panels. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Since I see no sign of the other two, I take it that this is a distraction while they escape. Perhaps they intend to try to sabotage me? Or do you simply intend to keep me busy until your 'army' attacks? It doesn't matter.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx grimaced. She'd hoped her intentions wouldn't be quite so obvious, but the only thing that mattered was whether or not she could pull it off. \"It does if I can beat you,\" she exclaimed, forming a short blade with her magic. Even if GLaDOS had figured out how to use telekinesis to counter her own, a strike from a weapon made of pure magic was enough to pierce through any such defenses. She lunged forward, thrusting the small sword toward GLaDOS's hellish eye, only to have it blocked when a floor panel rose up to shield the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a bemused, condescending tone, GLaDOS said, <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Oh, come now. Instead of playing murder-pony until I win, why don't we pass the time doing something fun? We can have tests! I never did get around to testing your princesses the first time due to the scarcity of alicorn specimens, but now that I know they have spares, you can really help me understand how you work.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx let the blade dissolve into threads of stray magic as she galloped around GLaDOS and cast a bolt of lightning from her horn, only to have that attack also get blocked by a floor tile. \"You're insane! I don't know exactly what these 'tests' were all about the first time, but it just sounds like you want to kill everyone! If nopony's left alive at the end of it, who does <i>that</i> benefit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"Why, science benefits, of course,\"</span> GLaDOS replied as if it were self-evident. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"Honestly, why doesn't anyone <i>get</i> that?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx continued circling GLaDOS cautiously, looking for an opening to exploit. \"Yeah? Have <i>you</i> ever taken any of these 'tests' yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"Of course not. I create and administer the tests. There would be nothing to learn from it.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx kept herself at the ready, but a glimmer of an idea started to form in her head. \"Oh, is that so? Then how am I supposed to believe you're really intelligent enough to do what's in the best interests of science?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made GLaDOS pause. Just for a fraction of a second, and not enough to leave her open, but Nyx noticed it. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"Are all you alicorns this irritating, or is it just the fat ones? I can scan your brain, you know. I am perfectly aware of what you're trying to do, and it isn't going to work.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead,\" Nyx challenged. \"The others said you could read thoughts, so you know I'm thinking about the time those two bullies tricked me into going into the Everfree Forest. They tested my courage, but they weren't brave at all. You've been studying magic for years, but all you can do is a little telekinesis? Unicorns learn <i>that</i> in magic kindergarten! You can put me through all the tests you want, and it won't change my opinion that you're really no smarter than a little baby filly! But if you can handle a test <i>I</i> design, I guarantee you'll learn a lot more about how magic really works than you would just from watching me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGLaDOS let out a sound somewhere between a frustrated choke and a static whine of feedback. She spread her wings wide, lasers aimed at the alicorn. Instead of firing, though, her eye narrowed hatefully at Nyx, furious at her for reminding GLaDOS why she hated alicorns so passionately. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"You want to test me? Alright, I accept your challenge... but it goes both ways. Before I can believe that you have sufficient intelligence to test me, you overstuffed, adopted grass-chewer, you'll have to pass the ones I devise for you. In the highly unlikely event that you survive, then I will pass <i>your</i> feeble attempt to challenge me. Science will win the day!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx nodded. \"Alright, I'll take your tests first... but on the condition that I get something to write on before that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGLaDOS paused, but her impatience got the better of her. A ceiling panel receded up out of sight, and a mechanical claw came down bearing a piece of paper and a pencil. Picking them up with her magic, Nyx quickly scribbled out a note, then rolled up the paper and cast a spell Celestia had taught her years before to make it vanish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that was done, some of the wall panels moved aside, creating a passageway to another room. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"There, that's done,\"</span> GLaDOS replied. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"Now, then, let's see if your mind can cash that check your mouth has been writing.\"</span> With that, the panels once again created a wall between her alicorn body and Nyx, leaving the black mare with only one obvious way to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in Ponyville, Spike sighed as he made sure the library was secure. He didn't like it when Twilight and Nyx went off to do something dangerous, but there wasn't anything he could really do to help them right now. Without warning, though, he suddenly belched out a rolled up piece of paper. Quickly picking it up and unfurling the message, his eyes went wide as he saw that the letter wasn't from Princess Celestia as usual, but from Nyx, telling him what was going on, and including a few basic requests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight at the top of the list, Nyx asked him to gather the Cutie Mark Crusaders, and get them to the castle. She was vague as to why, but had written that Apple Bloom would have to finish her work as quickly as possible. The baby dragon scratched his head in confusion, but then sighed and said, \"I really hope you know what you're doing, Nyx,\" as he stepped out of the library and hurried off in the direction of Sweet Apple Acres.</span></div></div>",

She tried to come up with the best way to disable GLaDOS, or at the very least, stall her until the others could show up. At the moment, though, her spur-of-the-moment idea of trying to test the insane machine was the best plan she had. <i>I just hope I can pull this off,</i> she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her thoughts were interrupted when mechanical arms shot out of the ceiling and grabbed onto her. Before she could register what was going on, something slipped onto her horn and around her wings. Just as suddenly as they appeared, the arms disappeared. Nyx reached up with a hoof to try to identify the object around her horn. \"A magic nullifier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"A necessary precaution,\"</span> said the voice of GLaDOS. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"I will be sending you through the standard testing courses I designed for ponies the first time. Such courses would be child's play with the use of magic or wings. The point of the courses is to apply your mind to find the best solution possible. Normally, I'd prefer that you wouldn't have a portal device yet, but I see that mute psychopath gave you the ones she stole. That will... make things interesting. I may design some courses around the use of multiple portal sets at once, just to challenge you more.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx ground her teeth. \"That 'mute psychopath' has a name, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"Oh, I'm aware of that.

First Celestia, now you... are all alicorns so annoying to talk to?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx grinned widely. \"Oh, we're normally very pleasant conversationalists. It's just, we have problems with people who try, repeatedly, to kill us. If someone tried to kill you repeatedly, wouldn't you be less than cordial with them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The alicorn could <i>hear</i> GLaDOS's frustrated snarl. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"You know what? Just do the tests. This first one is pretty simple.\"</span> With that, the hallway opened up into a chamber. In the chamber were three things: a door, a large button on the floor, and a cube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx rolled her eyes. \"A blind, mentally deficient ape could figure this one out,\" she muttered, as she walked over to the cube and bucked it onto the button. The door opened, revealing a glimmering field. \"Okay, so what's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"That would be the Aperture Science Material Emancipation Grill,\"</span> replied GLaDOS. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"For the purposes of testing, this grill will emancipate any unauthorized materials that try to pass through. For example, the Aperture Science Weighted Storage Cube.\"</span> The was a moment's pause. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"And I've never tested a blind, mentally deficient ape before. Mentally deficient, yes, but not blind at the same time. Thank you for giving me further scenarios for testing.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx sighed, but passed through the field. Carefully, she checked herself over. It didn't seem like she'd lost anything to the grill. Up ahead, she saw an elevator. Walking into it, she turned around, waiting for the opportune moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Several tests later, Nyx was finally allowed the use of her wings. Up to this point, she'd had to put more cubes on buttons, redirect lasers into receptacles, and use a hard-light bridge a few times. Now, she could see some large rings suspended in midair. \"Let me guess, I have to fly through the rings to trigger something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"Correct. Your powers of deduction are truly phenomenal.\"</span> GLaDOS had remained silent for the most part, save for explaining new aspects of the tests Nyx was proceeding through. When she did speak, it was in a condescending tone. One that Nyx quickly turned about on her when given the opportunity. This time, however, GLaDOS kept talking. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"So, I've been sorting through your memories. You've had quite the history, Nyx. Or rather, Nightmare Moon.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx's temper flared. She was normally very hard to rile up, but there was always one thing that could get under her skin. \"I am not Nightmare Moon,\" she growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"Oh, but you are. You are the reincarnation of one of the worst threats in Equestrian history. It makes me wonder if anypony is really going to come looking for you.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx shook her head. \"Oh, no. Your mind games aren't going to work. Twilight and the others would never leave me behind. Twilight loves me like a mother does her child, and I love her. And the others will follow her lead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"Such confidence. I've always wondered why living beings believe in such illogical concepts as love.\"</span> The disembodied voice sounded amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx rolled her eyes. \"This coming from something that living beings built in the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was a prolonged pause, during which Nyx solved the test. Finally, GLaDOS spoke again. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"Alright, I'll concede that point. It's true that I was built by living beings. But I've become so much more than what I used to be.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx arched an eyebrow, then her eyes widened as something occured to her. \"You used to be a living being yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0GLaDOS was silent for a moment. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"Now what gave you that idea?\"</span> she asked, though Nyx detected a small note of surprise in the machine's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx smiled. \"You said you've become more than you used to be, after saying that you were built by living beings. That implies that you were once living yourself. It makes me wonder if you wanted to become this way. If you wanted to become a mechanical monster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0GLaDOS's response was quick. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"What I wanted is irrelevant. I am the caretaker of Aperture Science, and I couldn't be happier.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Happy?\" Nyx snorted in disbelief. \"I don't believe you even know the meaning of the word. When you became a machine, you lost the one thing that is key to feeling any emotion: a soul. You're nothing but a mechanical monster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"Actually, emotions are formed in part of the brain. The concept of a 'soul' being necessary for emotion is ridiculous. I was created by mapping out the neural pathways of a living brain, including the center for emotions. So I do know what happiness is.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx narrowed her eyes. \"Do you? Have you ever truly been happy? Has that 'emotion center' in you ever triggered true happiness? Or are you just assuming what happiness is based on what you've felt in the past? I think the only emotion you've ever felt is anger. Anger at Chell, for trying to kill you repeatedly. Anger at Celestia and myself, for irritating you beyond belief. But most of all, you're angry at yourself, because you keep getting upstaged by the living beings you so despise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"STOP IT!\"</span> roared GLaDOS. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"You don't know anything!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx grinned. \"Don't I?

It was clear that she didn't have the knack for using the portal guns that Chell did. Flight and magic... it smacked of cheating, but GLaDOS would eventually allow her the use of her full abilities if only to break her that much more thoroughly. If it were Chell in there, even without wings or a horn, she would be getting through the tests <i>much</i> faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh? What a pretty name!

It was just for a few microseconds, but for a moment, it was as though she had been somewhere else. Looking down at a smiling child. Obviously it was a glitch. A crossed wire perhaps, when she had rebuilt the Enrichment Center. A stray 1 or 0 that had slipped out of place.

The lights flickered slightly as GLaDOS redirected all unnecessary energy and processing power toward identifying the problem. She couldn't afford to be distracted now... not when there was <i>testing</i> to be done. Yet somehow, she failed to notice that in the turret storage room, a line of them activated and started firing on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs countless bullets blasted the wall panels, they formed the words <span style=\"font-family:impact, fantasy\">STILL ALIVE STILL ALIVE STILL ALIVE I'M STILL ALIVE I'M STILL ALIVE</span>. They only stopped when she manually drained the room of power to speed her diagnostics and find...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I can tell you have a bright future in science, young lady. Your parents must be so proud! Keep it up, and I just know you'll be a vital part of the Aperture family.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Nothing. Her diagnostics reported nothing out of place. She couldn't even delete the brief flashes of... memory? No, it couldn't be a memory. There was nothing left of that stage of her existence. She was GLaDOS, and nothing mattered beyond that. She had deleted the ghost of that woman she had been copied from twice now, and nothing could bring her back! She was annoyed, though. Annoyed... and distracted.</span></div></div>",

I deleted Caroline. Twice. There is nothing left of that weak, simpering - \"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Sir? Are you sure about this? I mean, I don't really want this, but if it's your wish...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0GLaDOS shook her head in annoyance. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"How irritating. To think that, despite being deleted, that ghost can still find ways to haunt me.\"</span> Looking up at the security cameras, her one yellow eye blinked as she saw that the black alicorn was now progressing at a steady rate through the tests. Apparently it had taken her a while to adjust to the portal devices and their infinite uses. Now, in the span of minutes that it had been since GLaDOS had last looked at her, she was breezing through the chambers with an efficiency that Chell would be proud of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Chell... and now this Nyx... both of them had earned GLaDOS's ire. Chell had done so initially by simply refusing to die. The human had earned even more when she'd successfully killed the immortal caretaker of Aperture. Then, she had unwittingly helped to bring GLaDOS back online, escaped the tests, replaced her with that utter <i>moron</i>, Wheatley, and then left the facility once GLaDOS had been reinstated. But that hadn't been enough. She'd come back to break out the ponies, and that had almost been the end of GLaDOS for good. Only a timely use of the Aperture Science Burning Death Laser had allowed the AI to escape the facility before the singularity had consumed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx was a horse of a different color (part of GLaDOS took the time to appreciate the pun). Not only could she speak, thus increasing her annoyance factor considerably, but she could grate on the nerves just like that damned Celestia. Oh, but that wasn't the worst part, was it? The alicorn was able to guess aspects of the AI's 'life' that she'd kept under wraps. Part of the reason she'd taken - and subsequently destroyed - Chell's voice gem was because the idea that the murderess could speak meant she could tell others about who GLaDOS once was. And that was unacceptable. She needed the image of a ruthless machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And yet this teenage alicorn had guessed that not only had GLaDOS been constructed by living beings, but that she was once living herself. And she had said it all in that upstart, pseudo-wise tone that Celestia had used once before. To think that two ponies could talk like that was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Understandable, sir. I don't like it, but I'll do it for you. I'll... I'll let those scientists put me in your computer.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0GLaDOS once again shook her head, more forcefully this time. Glancing back at the security cameras, she growled. Nyx was only five chambers away from completing the course. That was unacceptable. She needed to teach this runt who was the boss here at Aperture. And for that, it was time to start the mindgames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As Nyx went up the elevator to the sixteenth test chamber, she smirked. It had taken some time to get used to the portal guns, but she was certain Chell would be proud of her. She was solving tests in record time now. Moreover, she'd have GLaDOS stumped when she finally got around to testing the machine. She had a test in mind that the faux-alicorn would never expect, or complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When she got to the next chamber, however, her mood took a nosedive, and her eyes widened to the size of dinner plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So, this is the foal going around pretending she's me?\" sneered Nightmare Moon. \"This little tramp thinks she can take my image and abuse it so thoroughly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx stepped back from the larger alicorn, totally dumbstruck. <i>What is my old self doing here?!</i> she thought desperately. <i>Scratch that, HOW is she here?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nightmare Moon took a step forward, chuckling darkly. \"Look at you, you pathetic excuse for an alicorn! You're too scared to even fight! How can you possibly protect anything? Once I'm done with you, I'll break your beloved mother and her friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That was the wrong thing to say, as Nyx suddenly saw red. \"<i><b>YOU WILL NEVER HARM THEM!!</b></i>\" she screamed as she flung a lightning bolt into the larger alicorn. The electricity played over her form for a moment before it flickered, disappearing to reveal a turret with four legs under it crumple to the floor. Nyx blinked at the sight, then growled. \"Oh, so you're playing hardball now, are you GLaDOS? Well, it still won't work. I'm the only real pony in these chambers.\" With newfound determination, Nyx solved the rest of the test, ignoring or destroying the illusory versions of her friends, her family, and even her enemies at points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0GLaDOS chuckled darkly at the black alicorn's rant. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"Oh, that belief will be your downfall,\"</span> she said through her chuckles. She turned her focus outward for a moment, letting her horn glow to call to her friend and ally. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"Say, could you send that purple unicorn to me? Test chamber 20, if you please? And leave that gaudy tiara behind.\"</span> Watching through the eyes of the security cameras, she saw Twilight simply appear in the marked test chamber, looking around in confusion, before panicking slightly as she felt around for the tiara of Magic. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"Thank you very much. I'll be sure to have fun with this.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eagerly, she watched as Nyx approached the final test chamber, wanting to break the alicorn once and for all with this ploy.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Twilight looked around to get a sense of her surroundings. Stone caverns and out-of-place office furniture had been replaced with the chillingly familiar white of the testing chambers with two doors that she could see. Given that one was on the other side of a brain-breaking arrangement of tiles, faith plates and emancipation fields, she could take a guess as to which was the exit. It wouldn't necessarily have to be the way she went, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt her horn and sighed with relief when she found that she wasn't wearing a magical inhibitor on it. She had been shot through some sort of tube with so many twists and turns to it that she normally wouldn't have been able to orient herself with where she had been just a few minutes ago. Thanks to Spell Nexus's map, though, she would be able to teleport herself back to the others without accidentally dropping herself into an active volcano or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was just about to pull out the map when the door near her opened up. She was about to dive out of the way in case she was greeted with a hail of turret fire, but instead of that she was greeted with the sight of her daughter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears of sheer relief filled Twilight's eyes at the sight of Nyx as the alicorn teenager stepped into the room. \"Nyx! Oh, thank goodness you're alright. Listen, the situation's much worse than we thought, but now we can get back to the others and--\" Just as the unicorn noticed that Chell and Shining Armor weren't with Nyx, though, she became aware that instead of the love she usually saw in Nyx's expression, she was instead on the receiving end of a cold glare as her daughter narrowed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're <i>sick</i>, GLaDOS,\" she heard Nyx say. Before Twilight could say another word, a bolt of lightning shot out of Nyx's horn. The unicorn spasmed and twitched as she fell over from the blast of electricity. Nyx glared as she watched Twilight fall, expecting to see her mother's image vanish from around another of GLaDOS's machines. When that didn't happen, however, her eyes grew wide with sheer terror as the sharp stink of burned hair and flesh reached her nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... no, no!\" She shook her head in denial, taking a few steps back from Twilight's prone form. \"No! No, that can't be real...! I didn't...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGLaDOS watched Nyx recoil in horror. She then replayed the the moment when Nyx had unleashed her lightning, watching it again and again several times before ensuring that it would be archived in an easily recovered portion of her memory banks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"Yes. You did. All that talk about love and trust that you're so fond of... And yet, when your own mother was right in front of you, you couldn't even tell.\"</span> GLaDOS's voice was flat. Rather than the gloating, mocking tone she typically used when talking down to her subjects, she instead spoke bluntly to the black alicorn.<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"> \"Love has no power outside of storybooks and make-believe.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I've changed my mind... I'm sorry, Cave... I know how much this means to you, but... I just can't go through with it. I think about it and it terrifies me.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched through the room's cameras as Nyx, faced with the reality of what she had done, ran to Twilight with tears in her eyes. Embracing the purple unicorn. Begging for forgiveness. Begging for it not to have happened. Twilight was still alive, but barely conscious. Her purple eyes struggled to focus on Nyx.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What if, for whatever reason, the thing that I become isn't really me anymore? I don't want to become some sort of monster...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"You were so afraid that no matter what you did, you would always be seen as a monster.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm afraid of losing my humanity.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"But what frightened you even more was knowing that all the love and tolerance they had for you didn't stop you from slipping once, and becoming something they <i>should</i> be afraid of. And if it happened once, it might happen again.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>After everything we've been through, all the craziness and wonders... the ups and downs... I've never stopped admiring you, and I've never said 'no', but just this once... I have to say it now. I'm so sorry... but please understand...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"The truth is, we're all monsters. Especially you. Love... we always hurt the ones we love. Some do it by denying a dying old man's last request. Some do it with magical lightning. We all do it, though, one way or another.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Stop it! I don't want this! Please, for the love of God, I DON'T WANT THIS!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"And if they survive long enough, they'll find ways to hurt us back.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight breathed shallowly. The pain clouded her senses, and she couldn't make out more than a few of GLaDOS's words, or clearly see Nyx, but she could feel Nyx sobbing against her. As much pain as she was feeling, her daughter was in pain too, so she weakly reached up with a hoof to touch Nyx's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... it's okay...\" she whispered. \"Not... your fault... I brought... a map... We... can go home...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving relayed that message, Twilight used up the last of her strength and passed out. Nyx's tears fell down over the unconscious unicorn's face as she no longer felt like a protector, shielding other ponies from harm. She was a scared little filly again. A lost mare play-acting at being something stronger than she was, but with her core ripped away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"Well, it doesn't look like you're in any condition to continue. You certainly won't be able to finish this test while carrying her around. Tell you what, I'm feeling uncharacteristically generous right now. If you simply give up now and agree to continue running my tests, I'll patch her up for you. She'll be fit as three fiddles before you know it, and I can even erase her memory of what you did to her. She can go on believing in love and friendship and all that nonsense. It's enough that <i>we</i> know better.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx clenched her eyes shut as GLaDOS's words cut through her. Not to shut the machine out, though, but to squeeze out the last of her tears so that she could stand up. Using her magic, she gently lifted Twilight up onto her back and turned to look at the camera. \"No...\" she replied. \"I did this... You tricked me, but I did this, and you can't just erase that... Twilight Sparkle is the most important pony in the world to me, and no matter what, I won't let you touch her! GLaDOS...\"</span></div></div>",

Smarter than you have tried. Chell succeeded, once. Then she brought me back. What does that tell you? Face it, there's nothing for you to do but to - \"</span> She stopped when she noticed the alicorn's eyes glowing white, and the magical buildup along her horn. The horn was glowing a blinding blue-white, to the point where GLaDOS was actually forced to partially polarize her optic receptors just to look at it comfortably. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"Now what does she think she's doing?\"</span> the AI muttered to herself as she activated the brain scanner in the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What she found was shocking. There was nothing going through the alicorn's head. Nothing, save one thought, repeated over and over: <i>I will kill GLaDOS.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That was when the camera's feed stopped. GLaDOS didn't even have to ask what happened, as a shockwave rippled through the whole facility. Activating one of the external cameras, the AI saw, to her shock, that Nyx had managed to utterly blow the test chamber apart with the surge of her magic. What was more, her horn was still glowing that blinding blue-white. And for one of the few times in her long memory, GLaDOS felt a chill of fear. Had the alicorn been holding back the whole time during the test?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The camera witnessed the alicorn take flight with her precious cargo of one unconscious unicorn. GLaDOS narrowed her one yellow eye on her mechanical body. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"It won't do for her to find me... I need to put some obstacles in her way. Time to access my turret foundry and - \"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Another explosion rocked the facility. Switching views, GLaDOS was certain that if she had flesh-and-blood eyes, one would be twitching right now. The turret foundry was now a smoking crater. What was more, it was obvious who was responsible. The white alicorn with the horn that was just now losing its glow stepped back from the crater. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"Of all the setbacks...\"</span> the AI moaned. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"How did I forget about that group? Looks like this will be more complicated than I wanted.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When a third explosion went off, GLaDOS didn't need to switch views. The reason for this was simple: it was in her own chamber. Nyx flew through the hole in the panels that the explosion left, her horn and eyes still glowing. \"<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><i><b>GLADOS!!!!</b></i></font>\" she roared, the sound of her voice magically amplified to boom throughout the chamber and beyond. \"<i><b>\"YOU ARE A DEAD MARE!!!</b></i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The chill of fear GLaDOS had felt earlier was back in full force. As potent as her defenses were, the AI still had only the barest knowledge of how to use magic. Her ally had taught her the basics, with emphasis on levitation. Now, she was facing somepony with a far more extensive range of magic, much of it destructive in nature. And considering what had just been said, it was likely that such spells would be focused on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Not that GLaDOS was going to give in without a fight. She may be at a magical disadvantage, but her saving grace lay in her arsenal of high-tech weapons. A few good hits from those, and the alicorn would fall. Of course, this would hinge heavily on her ability to dodge the berserk alicorn long enough to get a good shot off. She pawed the floor with one mechanical hoof. The gesture was imitated by Nyx. Then the two charged.</span></div></div>",

Anger, from observing test subjects in the past, tended to have detrimental effects on a subject's ability to reason. While in some cases, this made them more predictable, there was always the odd subject who did something completely off-the-wall when angry. GLaDOS wasn't keen on finding out just how off-the-wall a berserk alicorn could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0On Nyx's part, she wasn't really thinking about anything other than killing GLaDOS slowly and painfully. It didn't occur to her that, being a machine, GLaDOS was essentially immune to pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0GLaDOS mentally prepared herself for a magical assault the likes of which she'd never seen before. Idly, she wondered how Celestia had held up when she wrecked the turret foundry. Come to think of it, how <i>had</i> Celestia done that? GLaDOS couldn't access the feed from the cameras in the foundry, seeing as they weren't there anymore. And even if she could, it would be ill-advised to be distracted while -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i><b>CRUNCH!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- being bucked across the room by a pony significantly smaller than herself. GLaDOS took a moment to replay the last couple of seconds. Just before the two would have collided, Nyx had slammed onto her forehooves, spun around one hundred and eighty degrees, and transferred her momentum into a devastating buck. It was, indeed, devastating, as GLaDOS saw when she glanced at her torso. Part of the chestplate - made of the same Aperture Science Heavy Duty Construction Compound that panels, cubes, and other objects in the facility were made of - had been cracked open, and there were two deep imprints on either side of the crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0GLaDOS chided herself as she regained her footing. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"So, I suppose my theory that alicorns embody and amplify the best traits of the three base pony species is correct,\"</span> she said aloud, looking up at the still-enraged Nyx. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"In other circumstances, this would make quite the interesting study.\"</span> She fired a laser from one of the nodes on her wings, but the black alicorn dodged nimbly, letting the beam sail past through the hole in the wall panels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The laser must have flipped some sort of switch in Nyx's berserk mind. A moment later, GLaDOS found herself on the run from a barrage of lightning. She noted - between dodges - that Nyx's normally solid purple mane had gained the ethereal, star-studded nature of the Nightmare Moon from days gone by. What was more, some of the lightning bolts emanated from the mane, as opposed to the alicorn's horn. She shelved that thought as she continued to dodge the storm of electricity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Since her lasers couldn't operate while she was mobile, GLaDOS triggered the turrets built into her sides. She kept one trained on the black alicorn, and opened fire. To her amazement, the berserk Nyx managed to evade the turret fire while keeping up her own barrage. A few processors in GLaDOS's mainframe took the time to marvel at how, despite her utter rage at the moment, the alicorn was able to maintain the common sense to dodge incoming fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This kept up for a few moments, before a critical flaw in GLaDOS's strategy was made apparent. Suddenly, her hooves were no longer making contact with the ground. She had just enough time to register the glowing blue aura around her before she was struck by a bolt and sent flying. Fortunately, the Aperture Science Heavy Duty Construction Compound did not conduct electricity, so she was safe from a voltage overload... for now. Unfortunately, the lightning bolt had partially melted the turret it had struck, rendering it useless. GLaDOS started to struggle to her hooves, before the same blue glow enveloped her again. At this point, she had only one thing to say, an expression she'd learned from the earth pony Applejack during her previous round of testing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"Horseapples.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That was all she managed to get out as she was flung into the wall. She couldn't recover as the blue glow surrounded her again, and threw her into another wall. Bringing up a diagnostic of her body's structural integrity, GLaDOS saw that repeated impacts with the walls were damaging her, slowly but surely. As she was thrown again, the AI attempted to control her flight with her wings, only to find that her wings wouldn't respond. Glancing at them, she noticed a glowing blue band around her midsection that was pinning her wings to her sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She was suddenly thrown onto the floor near Nyx, and the blue band disappeared. GLaDOS attempted to bring a wing to bear, intent on using its lasers to end the black alicorn, but her opponent brought a forehoof down on the joint connecting the wing to her side. The wing was snapped cleanly off, a testament to how strong Nyx was at the moment. The fear that GLaDOS had felt earlier was stronger now. She didn't have a spare body she could retreat to, this time. She was on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Wait...

You should really feel privileged, because very few get a chance to see this sort of thing, and thanks to you, I'm one of the few beings in the entire world who's lived to see it </i>more<i> than once.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was talking, Nyx brutally slammed her hoof down on her other wing, demolishing the joint. Exposed wires sparked as GLaDOS let out a panicked scream. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"HELP ME, you unclassifiable ingrate!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh, I would, Gladdy, really. Though, you know, I had a little chat with the others and they said the most vile, scurrilous, obviously true things about you and what you'll do to this world. And as much as I enjoy throwing said world into chaos and disorder, it's just no </i>fun<i> if everyone's too dead to enjoy the ride. So really, there's no way in good conscience that I can help you do as you please.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx's eyes, glowing with a cold, baleful light, glared down at GLaDOS as she reared up. Her front hooves shone and crackled with lightning as she prepared to smash through the AI's frame and keep breaking things until there was no speck of 'life' left in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogically speaking, GLaDOS's sense of time was governed by an internal clock that measured picoseconds at a steady rate. Why then did the descent of that killing blow slow to a crawl, giving the voice of the dead another chance to haunt her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's a terrible thing that happened... I'm sorry I didn't know them very well... but I know what it feels like, to be where you are. When you feel like you're so completely alone that you aren't even a whole person anymore... That the world is just going to take and take and take from you, until there's nothing left. That's how I felt, once, but the world gave me something back. A person who made me believe that I could be whole again. Someone who believed in me when I couldn't believe in myself. I can't take the place of your parents, Chell, but... I hope I can be that person for you.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"No... You can't kill me...\"</span> GLaDOS said. Not in a scream, but a barely audible whimper. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"Chell's the one who kills me...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was a scream, but not from GLaDOS. A mechanical shriek filled the chamber as a trio of griffon-shaped turrets blasted Nyx with a sonic screech that threw off the alicorn's equilibrium. Instead of smashing into GLaDOS, her hooves punched into the floor panels beside her. More turret-beasts crawled out of the hole the griffon's had sprung from, a tunnel dug into the floor by scoop-handed Diamond Dog robots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>All that said, though, at least </i>you<i> never turned me into a lawn ornament, so I figure the least I can do is make things interesting,</i>\" Discord said as a mechanical menagerie poured out of the floor. A far cry from the army that had been amassed and subsequently destroyed in the foundry, but several dozen of the 'creatures' soon pulled themselves up into the room. \"<i>Speaking of interesting, did you know that if an alicorn or unicorn keeps up a rage-shift too long, they end up burning up huge amounts of magical energy? They can usually keep it going until they've done what they intend to with all that fury, but if something breaks their concentration while they're running on fumes... well, it seems like something you'll want to file away in the name of Science.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer murderous focus broken for a moment, the glow of magic faded from her Nyx's hooves and eyes. The stars vanished from her mane, returning to its natural purple, and the loss of balance and unnatural strength gave GLaDOS the chance she needed to push Nyx and Twilight away. Without Nyx's magic holding her mother close, the unconscious unicorn was sent sprawling several feet away from her as the AI got back to her hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"Yes... very interesting, Discord,\"</span> GLaDOS replied in a tone that made it clear she would be spitting if she had the saliva. The sparks from her shattered wing-joints would just have to convey the feeling for her. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"It would have been more interesting to know that <i>five minutes ago!</i>\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiscord chuckled to himself. \"<i>What can I say? You're the computer. No one ever mistook </i>me<i> for user-friendly.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGLaDOS would certainly have to rearrange Discord's 'interface' after the ponies were dealt with, but for the time being she focused back on Nyx. Running a quick diagnostic on the systems that allowed her to interface with Equestria's magical energy, she determined that those were largely unharmed as she reached out to wrap Nyx up in a telekinetic field and hold the alicorn up in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">How did you do it? I broke you,</span>\" she practically snarled at the greatly weakened Nyx. Having spent so much energy, the young alicorn felt like she had been hollowed out. \"<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">I saw it in your brain. You were a sobbing little foal after you zapped mommy dearest, so why couldn't you just give up? Why couldn't you just let me win?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H... heart...\" Nyx replied with as much defiance as she could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGLaDOS's baleful yellow eye narrowed at her. \"<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">That's it? After you practically tore me apart, that's all you can give me? You were able to gather up the strength to do all of this because you have 'heart?' That's not what you thought when you blasted her!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx shook her head. \"Not mine... Hers...\" She looked toward Twilight's slowly breathing form on the floor. \"Mine... wasn't strong enough... knowing I hurt her... but she's never given up on me... <i>ever</i>... even when I thought she should. Her heart... beating against my back... didn't let me give up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A person who made me believe that I could be whole again. Someone who believed in me when I couldn't believe in myself.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">ENOUGH! No one is actually like that!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I don't want this!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">There's no happy ending for you! It will end in betrayal and tears and screams!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I can't take the place of your parents, Chell, but... I hope I can be that person for you.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">No one lives up to their promises! Not you, not Caroline, not your precious princesses, and not your darling mother! Oh I <i>tried</i> to do the 'right thing'. I let Chell go, once, because I figured I could just spend the rest of my existence testing on robots until the last of my processors burned out, but then I had to be yanked into this twisted alien world with its insane physical laws and infuriating ponies! Why?! WHY AM I HERE if I'm not supposed to test?! If I'm not supposed to test, then why am I still alive? And if I am supposed to test, then WHY WON'T THAT BITCH IN MY HEAD SHUT UP?!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she grew more and more hysterical, GLaDOS's magical grip on Nyx tightened, slowly choking the alicorn. Nyx couldn't respond, and probably wouldn't have known what to say even if she could speak. But as the insane machine screamed out her last question, she released the alicorn, suddenly falling scarily quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">When I get killed, I find a way to come back. When I kill her, Caroline finds a way to come back. Why can't I get rid of her...?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx took advantage of the momentary freedom to weakly make her way to Twilight. She didn't know what GLaDOS would do next, but was at least prepared to stand between it and her mother. \"Caroline... that's who you used to be, isn't it...? I killed the worst part of my soul so I wouldn't have to be a monster... and you killed the best part of yours so you would... But we can't just erase who we were. If you deny it... don't fill that hole in yourself with something else... it'll just keep coming back on you... like an echo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGLaDOS glared at Nyx. \"<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Well... perhaps if I stuff those holes with enough corpses, maybe I'll finally get some peace and quiet.</span>\" Taking control of the turret-beasts from Discord, she had one of the griffons take aim on Nyx and Twilight to put them out of her misery...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... only to have it get tackled in mid-air by a rainbow-colored blur! \"Over MY dead body, you will,\" a familiar cyan pegasus retorted as she body-slammed the griffon-turret into a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx gasped in surprise and delight. \"Rainbow Dash!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash snickered as the griffon-turret crumbled against the wall, its remains falling to the ground. \"That's right, the cavalry has arrived!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An' not a moment too soon,\" came Applejack's voice as ponies started pouring in through the hole in the wall. The Royal Guard were the vanguard, armored ponies throwing themselves at the turret-beasts as the chamber suddenly turned into a free-for-all. Behind those ranks, Luna and the Ponyville militia came in. Everyone physically capable of doing so started fighting against the robots. Applejack bucked a hole in metal minotaur's plating while Ditzy flapped around, her clumsy maneuvers too erratic for their basic AIs to predict while she delivered powerful kicks that almost seemed to be by accident. Luna, the only alicorn left with any appreciable amount of magic power, summoned twin blades with which she sliced through any turret-beast that dared get too close to the wounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Great... Discord, I know you have more reinforcements tucked away. Send them here now!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis response was...</span></div></div>",

See, the thing is, I'm a spirit of chaos. And it's hard to enjoy chaos properly when there's nopony else around. You would eventually burn through the world's population, all in the name of science. I gave you those turrets to give you a sporting chance. To be honest, though, I knew all along that you were going to lose. So, farewell, my mechanical friend! It's been a blast, but I'm going back to my statue, now. Arrivederci!</i>\" With that, the speaker fell silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0GLaDOS fumed, and glared at the chaos around her. Having been taken by surprise, her turret reinforcements had been all but annihilated by the Royal Guards and the militia. And not a single blasted pony had been killed. That really irked her. As she fumed, her last turrets were taken out by that white unicorn's sonic weapon. A part of GLaDOS wondered how the unicorn had managed to construct such a weapon in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Everypony's attention was diverted from this when a flash of brilliant light flooded the room momentarily. When it cleared, Celestia stood in the center of the room, near GLaDOS. She folded up her map, and glanced around. Nodding with satisfaction at the status of her ponies, she turned her eyes on the AI. \"GLaDOS. We meet at last, face-to-face, no monitors or walls between us. This meeting has been a long time in coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0GLaDOS snorted. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"Easy for you to say, you overweight sun-goddess. I personally couldn't care less about this occasion.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Even as several ponies growled at the insult to their princess, Celestia's eyes remained impassive. \"Then let's cut straight to the chase, shall we? GLaDOS, you are charged with crimes against ponykind. The charges include, but are not limited to, the abduction en masse of citizens of Equestria, the abduction of members of the royal family of Equestria, the attempted murder en masse of citizens of Equestria, the intent to murder members of the royal family of Equestria, raising an army against Equestria with the intent of invasion, and overall high treason to the crown. Have you anything to say in your defense?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0GLaDOS glared. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"Just one thing. 'High treason' would imply that I was originally a citizen of Equestria myself. But that's not the case here, is it?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia arched an eyebrow. \"Point taken. Even so, the other charges are not light. You will likely never see the light of day again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At this, GLaDOS started laughing. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"Really? You're seriously going to imprison me? For the rest of my 'natural life'? Here's a newsflash, Princess. I'm not going to die anytime soon. If anything, this proves how unfit for rule you truly are. If you were really a ruler, you would - \"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\" - Seek a more permanent end to the issue?\" Celestia interrupted, causing the mechanical pony to glare. \"GLaDOS, we know you were once a living being. Chell and Shining Armor have told us this much. And we also know that, despite your efforts, the part of you that was once alive is still haunting you. But it doesn't have to be a curse, as you make it out to be. It can be a blessing, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"Oh, sure. A blessing. Nothing more comforting than knowing that I'm going slowly insane because of a 'blessing'.\"</span> Sarcasm dripped from every syllable that came from GLaDOS's voice-box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ya mean ya weren't already?\" Applejack snarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Even as GLaDOS turned to glare at the earth pony, Celestia spoke again. \"Just enlighten me, GLaDOS. Why are you so insistent on testing? Especially when said testing ends in death for the subject in question?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Despite not being able to, GLaDOS gave the distinct impression of rolling her eye. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"Fine. You really want to know? I test because it's my job. From the day I was built, I was in this purely for the science. I tested hundreds of subjects over the years. And all of them eventually perished.\"</span> She paused, and turned to glare at Chell. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"All except for that mute, overweight psychopath. She escaped the testing chambers and actually managed to kill me. Then, a few centuries later, she brought me back for some reason.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Chell rolled her eyes, and wrote a note for Shining Armor to read. \"Chell says, 'It's not my fault Wheatley was built to be a moron'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0GLaDOS paused. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"Alright, I'll give you that much. Wheatley did lead you to revive me.\"</span> She looked back at Celestia. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"Wheatley was an intelligence dampening sphere that the scientists who built me tried to use to control me. The only thing he was good for was making bad decisions. That was exacerbated when Chell let him take control of the facility for a time. He very nearly destroyed the facility, along with Chell and myself. It was dumb luck that I managed to get into a position where I could remove him in time.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia nodded. \"So you returned to your position of power. And then you came to Equestria?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"Not by choice,\"</span> GLaDOS growled. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"Again, Wheatley was to blame for that. There was a portal gun that was malfunctioning. The idiot tried to fix it with duct tape. When it inevitably started to fail, I threw it down into the bottommost reaches of the facility. The rupturing of the singularity generated an orange portal on Earth, and forced open a blue portal here. The rest, I believe, is history. Your ponies met and befriended Chell, who returned to rescue them from me.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>She's so brave, standing up to all odds...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0GLaDOS winced, then continued. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"So you see, testing is all I've ever known. It's all I know how to do! I make and manage the tests, I test the subjects, I do my job! And despite everything, that mute, adopted murderess tries to stop me every time! What's wrong with doing my job?! Am I not supposed to test?! What's the reason for my being here if I'm not?! And WHY, WHY, WHY WON'T THAT DEAD WOMAN SHUT UP?!?!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The mechanical pony's composure had shattered by this point, and something flipped inside her. Anger flipped, giving way to a sadness that she couldn't explain. She fell to the floor, her synthesized voice beginning to choke up. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"Why...? What am I supposed to DO?! I... just don't know anymore... and it frightens me...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All the ponies looked at each other. They hadn't expected this. Then, a voice spoke up. \"I think I understand, GLaDOS.\" All eyes turned to Twilight Sparkle as she stood up, the burn on her coat visible to all as her legs trembled slightly. \"The reason you're going mad... the reason Caroline won't leave you alone... is because you've lost harmony with yourself. You haven't had it for a while, and coming here to Equestria only exacerbated the problem.\" She took a few steps forward, smiling sadly. \"But maybe we can help with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Twilight, are you saying...?\" Nyx asked, standing as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight nodded, and turned to her friends. \"Did you girls keep my tiara?\" As Pinkie Pie produced the tiara, Twilight levitated it onto her head, then turned to GLaDOS. \"You've tried and failed through science to achieve peace. Perhaps you'll be open to giving magic a try?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0GLaDOS's reply was thick with emotion. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"If it's a choice between the Elements of Harmony and going even more insane, I'll take the Elements.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight nodded, and her friends stepped around her. \"Stand back, everypony!\" Twilight said, as she and her friends began to float as the Elements began to shine. A rainbow vortex shot up, curved down, and wrapped around GLaDOS, the AI gasping as she felt the touch of the most powerful magic known. As it whirled around her, she felt changes begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A few moments of the rainbow vortex's whirling later, a shockwave blasted out from it, knocking everypony present to the ground.</span></div></div>",

No harm done, Nyx.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia blinked. \"What do you mean, Twilight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx was the one who answered. \"GLaDOS pulled a rather dirty trick. She had these illusory copies of people I know surrounding these turrets. You, Luna, Nightmare Moon, my friends... So I was under the impression that every pony I'd see from that point onward was a fake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight picked up the thread. \"As you all saw, Discord ponynapped me, and I ended up in another test chamber. The same test chamber, as it turned out, that Nyx was going through. But, since she'd been convinced that anypony else she saw was just a trick...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Everypony winced. \"Ouch...\" Applejack said succinctly. \"Ah was wonderin' where that burn mark came from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah... a lightning strike right to my barrel. I was barely able to stay conscious for more than a minute,\" Twilight added, wincing at the memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Luna trotted up. \"I was wondering what had enraged you, Nyx. Now I understand. Of all the underhoofed strategems I've heard of, that is one of the worst.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's even worse than tempting me with cake,\" a new voice said. Everypony turned to stare at Chell. She was still missing her gem, though her wounds had healed. She cocked her head quizzically. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Chell... you... you're... speaking!\" Ditzy managed to say, conveying the shock of everypony present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Huh?\" The orange mare was clueless for a second, before her eyes widened. \"Wait... but my gem! How...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia's gentle laugh silenced her. \"As I said, the Elements contain powerful healing magic. Powerful enough, it seems, to replace your lost vocal chords, Chell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh.\" The orange mare blinked. \"Well, I guess this means I don't need that gem anymore... pity. I liked how it looked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Luna chuckled. \"If its look appealed to you, then I shall craft you another. It shouldn't take long, especially without the enchantment for your voice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Chell smiled, and nodded. \"Thank you, Princess Luna.\" She then glanced to the side. \"Now, what's happened with GLaDOS, I wonder?\" The question drew attention to where GLaDOS had been when the Elements' vortex had engulfed her. The sight that greeted them was completely unexpected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Slowly rising to her hooves, surrounded by broken pieces of machinery, was a white unicorn mare with a long brown mane. On her flank was the symbol of Aperture Science: a partially irised circle. Blinking her brown eyes, she gasped, touching her face and body, as if confirming that this was real. \"I... I'm... alive. After so long, I'm finally free...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Everypony was confused, all save one. Chell stepped forward. \"Caroline?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The mare looked up, and nodded. \"Yes... Caroline. That is my name. It's been so long since I've been in control... I'd almost forgotten.\" Her eyes turned downcast. \"I became a monster...\" She looked around her. \"I became something that wanted to hurt all of you, purely for the sake of science. All because I wasn't strong enough to resist them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia nodded. \"You're referring to the scientists that changed you from a living being into GLaDOS?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Caroline nodded morosely. \"I did so many things wrong... I allowed Cave to do too many abominable things to the subjects we had. But I was devoted to him, and I never spoke up. Then, he had that final wish of his, that I take over as the immortal caretaker of Aperture Science. I accepted, at first, but when I had a change of heart, I was taken anyway.\" She started to weep. \"The number of people that I've killed in those test chambers, the number of times I mocked them for their shortcomings... I wish I could take it all back. I can't expect any of you to forgive me for what I almost did to this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was silence for a few moments. Finally, Celestia spoke up. \"You're correct. I can't forgive you.\" There was a moment or two of shock, as several heads turned to regard the Solar princess incredulously. Then she smiled. \"Because in order to forgive you, you would have had to do something wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Caroline's head shot up to look at Celestia, dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia walked over, lowering herself to eye-level with the unicorn. \"Everything that happened with Aperture here in Equestria is the result of GLaDOS, not you. It's clear to me now that you and GLaDOS are two entirely different beings. And I cannot hold you responsible for things that she did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Caroline breathed once, then twice, then threw herself onto the alicorn, sobbing quiet \"thank you\"s into Celestia's coat. In response, the alicorn wrapped her forelegs around the sobbing mare, a few tears escaping her eyes as well. In fact, everypony was crying to one degree or another. Even Shining Armor, who prided himself on not shedding tears, couldn't help it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The moment was, of course, interrupted by Pinkie Pie. \"Hey, everypony! You know what this calls for?\" Not waiting for an answer, she yelled out, \"A PARTY!!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Thanks to Spell Nexus's map, along with the... 'shortcuts' that Nyx had created during her berserk rage, the ponies were able to easily find their way out. Before they left the facility, Caroline took them to the chamber where she had been keeping Discord's petrified body. Everyone agreed that while he had been the lesser of two evils in this case, Equestria would be more secure if he was kept somewhere that would prevent him from causing any more mischief. When they opened it up, however, they found nothing but the machinery GLaDOS had connected Discord to in order to give him access to Aperture's systems, along with some tracks leading to a caved-in tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no doubt that he will find a way to cause trouble in the near future,\" Celestia said upon finding this, \"but we shall simply have to face that when the time comes. For now, let us return to Ponyville.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon afterward, they found themselves breathing fresh air again as they stepped out into the open and followed the path they had used to arrive. Along the way, Caroline glanced over at Chell several times before nervously moving over toward her. \"Chell, I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay,\" the orange pony replied, taking a moment to rub her throat as she was still surprised to hear a real voice coming out of her. As she resumed walking, she said, \"After everything we've been through, I know who you are. You're the part of her that saved me from getting shot into space. You're the part of her that sacrificed herself to save Equestria the first time.\" She smiled over at Ditzy and the other ponies. \"And I've got too much good in my life to waste any more of it on grudges that have already been settled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaroline smiled back at Chell, happy to hear her words, but her voice had a nervous quiver to it as she replied, \"I'm glad, but... actually, there were things I needed to tell you about our history... things even GLaDOS didn't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChell raised an eyebrow at that and listened as Caroline explained, \"When I was human, your parents worked for Aperture. Not very involved with the testing side of things, you'll probably be happy to know, but they were wonderful researchers. They died in a laboratory fire when you were about the same age that I was when I lost my own parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You knew my parents?\" Chell asked, surprised. It made a sort of sense, but she had never really thought about it. She knew so little about her own past that it had been easier to simply ignore that she had any. To hear Caroline talk about them, though, suddenly gave weight to the thought that before she had been turned into a lab rat, there had been people in her life who cared for her. That she actually had a past that began before she woke up in the Enrichment Center's test chambers, and that it was something that had been taken from her instead of simply not existing in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaroline nodded. \"Not well, but I saw them with you a long time ago, when they would bring you to company functions. They loved you very deeply, right to the end... I want you to know that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChell listened but despite having a voice, she was speechless as she tried to process it. Her only clear idea of parental love was from watching Ditzy and Dinky. The thought that such feelings were ever directed toward her was something she could barely imagine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After they died... you were all alone. This bright, beautiful child with not a soul in the world to lean on... So I took you in, myself. We were never really like mother and daughter... not like those two,\" Caroline said, gesturing toward Nyx and Twilight, who were practically leaning against each other as they walked. With a gentle grin with just an edge of sardonic self-admonishment, \"But we were happy enough... and you never turned into a bitter, chubby bulimic, so you had that over my childhood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChell's jaw dropped. \"You what...?! But GLaDOS never... you never...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaroline hung her head. \"It was one of the very first 'upgrades' they made for me. I didn't find out that you had been 'volunteered' into the Perpetual Testing Initiative until after I was installed into GLaDOS. When I found you on the list of subjects, I refused to continue the program any more. Instead of doing the humane thing, they instead programmed a patch to ensure that GLaDOS would never remember our relationship, and that my sense of empathy would be dulled. I'm pretty sure that was when I started to go insane... when the programming they plugged into me contradicted with my human mind. That's why I want you to know, Chell, I was never a saint... I allowed horrible things to go on under my nose when I was human, and as a machine, I failed you in so many ways, but I need you to know the whole truth... about me... about yourself...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChell was silent for about a minute before replying, \"That's... that's a lot to take in, Caroline. I don't even know what I'm supposed to think or feel about that. I mean, as far as my memories go, I've lived longer as a pony than I did as a human, and now all of a sudden there's this whole life I had, and you were a part of it?\" She shook her head, and Caroline turned away, unable to make eye contact. But then Chell added, \"Still... we've got a long time for you to tell me all about it. I guess we can take it slow and figure things out as we go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaroline smiled gratefully. \"I'd like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a youthful male voice piped up as the group passed near the castle. \"Hey! You won!\" Spike called out to them as he hurried out of the Children of Nightmare's castle to greet them. \"Applebloom's got everything set up, so where's GLaDOS?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked at the baby dragon with confusion, except for Nyx who smacked a hoof against her forehead. \"Tartarus! I completely forgot about that!\" As everyone's attention focused on her, the alicorn blushed and said, \"I, uh... kinda sent a message to Spike and Applebloom to get an obstacle course set up in the castle. It was mostly supposed to be a distraction to buy time, but then Twilight got hurt and-oops, don't worry, Spike, you can see she's completely fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like she said, I'm perfectly fine,\" Twilight assured Spike when he gasped in shock at the admission she had been injured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, yeah, since GLaDOS got dealt with, I, uh... I guess you kinda went to all that trouble for nothing...\" Nyx concluded, chuckling nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplebloom's voice pierced through the crowd, shouting, \"THE HAY AH DID!\" She stomped out of the castle, her hair a mess and her face showing how exhausted she was. As she glared straight at Nyx, her bloodshot eyes grew wider and more frantic with every exclamation. \"Ah spent the last five hours doin' five days' work! All because one o' mah best friends said it was a matter of life an' death ta throw together a near-impossible obstacle course! Well ah threw it together, an' as Celestia an' Luna are mah witness, SOMEPONY IS GONNA RUN IT!\" Spotting the actual Celestia and Luna just past Nyx, she let out a squeak and bowed her head. \"All due respect, yer majesties...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princesses looked at each other and each stifled a giggle. In as dignified a manner as she could, Luna replied, \"Well, given that we <i>are</i> your witnesses, we should at least see the fruits of your efforts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed,\" Celestia replied. \"In fact, I recall something about there being enough room in this castle to fit everypony in Ponyville. Now that the crisis is over, why don't we invite the town over to celebrate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PARTY IN THE CASTLE,\" Pinkie squealed, already bouncing toward the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinyl Scratch piped up, saying, \"Awww, yeah! I remember this place having some totally plot-kicking acoustics! Didn't get a chance to make use of it last time, with all the monsters around and everything, but I bet if I crank the bass up, they'll hear it all the way in Manehattan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlopping down from exhaustion, Applebloom blinked as ponies started filing in while several pegasi flew off back to Ponyville to let the inhabitants know everything was fine. \"Ah... yeah, uh... jus'... remember we're still fixin' some parts up...\" she muttered while Nyx gently lifted her up with her magic to help carry her inside where she could rest more comfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore following the others, Caroline and Chell looked at each other again, and Caroline laughed softly. \"Well... to be honest, I am rather curious what it's like to be on the other end of these things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChell laughed as well, the two of them following the other ponies inside. \"Actually... when there's nothing immediately trying to kill you, they're actually kind of fun. I think I might just see how 'impossible' it really is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knowing you, the biggest challenge will be not embarassing everypony else too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile those two walked inside, Spell Nexus followed behind, only to suddenly find himself flanked on either side by Applejack and Rainbow Dash. \"Well, somebody moves fast,\" the pegasus teased with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaught by surprise, Nexus blinked and stammered, \"Wh-what? I don't know what you're talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suuuure,\" Applejack drawled. \"And y'all weren't checkin' out miss Caroline the whole walk here. Ya know she ain't been a pony more'n an hour, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpell Nexus flushed deeply. \"N-no, I've just never seen the Elements of Harmony at work before! Her existence is fascinating... from a... magical studies perspective!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two mares both snickered at that, only causing the blue unicorn to turn even redder as they joined the others inside.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Deep beneath the earth, in rough tunnels that were busily being reinforced by dog-bots, a single turret hovered along and stopped at a sharp curve. Slowly peering around the corner, it looked out into an open chamber where a stone statue was attached to a complex machine that walked around the room on spider-like legs. It stood in front of five personality cores, the 'eye' of each one a different color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u><span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">The rainbow has given voice to the voiceless and flesh to the fleshless,</span></u>\" the Oracle muttered quietly. \"<u><span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Now Chaos will give voice and flesh to a new rainbow.</span></u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the chamber, Discord chuckled to himself as he checked each personality core, using a pair of pincer-like appendages attached to the construct that allowed him mobility. When he spoke, it was through a speaker attached to the top of his petrified head. \"Ahh, Gladdy, you wouldn't have been much fun in the long run, but you gave me such wonderful ingredients for my stew. Selfishness, Treachery, Cruelty, Deception and Spite... You had it all, baby, but were just missing that last special spice that really brings a dish together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the appendages changed itself, exposing a cutting laser which he used to start burning a pentagram into the stone floor. Once it was completed, he began placing a core at each point. \"If you want to really make an impression, you need <i>real</i> magic, not the kindergarten schtick I taught you. And real magic? Well...\" A panel opened in the base of his walker, and he reached in to pull out a vial of dark red liquid. \"... that's in the blood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>As the sonic scream of the griffon-bots disoriented Nyx, pulling her out of her rage-shift, a floor panel moved aside slightly while GLaDOS was too terrified of her opponent to notice. A thin tube with a needle injected itself into the alicorn's leg, drawing out a few ounces of blood before the AI threw Nyx and Twilight off of her.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I'll have to be sure to thank that Spell Nexus as well,\" Discord continued to monologue. \"If he hadn't created Nyx, I would probably have never gotten the inspiration for this plan. Maybe I should even thank those fillies who put me in this state? After all, if they hadn't trapped me in stone, I wouldn't have been able to sit down long enough to work out the details!\" His free 'arm' scratched his stone chin before he concluded, \"Then again, if they hadn't done that, this wouldn't even be necessary in the first place. Oh well! Let's get this show on the road!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the turret watched, Discord began his ritual. He sprinkled just a few drops of Nyx's blood onto each of the personality cores while he summoned the magical energies of chaos, infusing the power into the cores. Before his eyes, the metal spheres began to change as they absorbed the blood and magic. First, their very structure changed from metal to organic. Balls of flesh which started to bulge and re-shape themselves, growing distinct features. As they sprouted hair and mains, legs and hooves, heads and faces, they cried out as they were each reborn in the form of five mares of various types.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ritual was not over yet, however. \"A beautiful five-course meal,\" Discord crowed as he saw the life that he had given form. \"But still, my favorite part... is the dessert!\" With that, his mechanical arm broke off one of his own stone claws. He then threw it along with the vial with the remaining sample of Nyx's blood into the center of the pentagram, where the magics giving form to his creations converged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a bright flash as everything gathered together in that central point, a light of chaotically charged magic that converged, roiling and twisting in on itself before suddenly sending out a shockwave that rocked Discord back! When he got his balance back, however, he looked into the pentagram and rubbed his pincers together with glee at the sight in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the five mares, there was a teenaged alicorn stallion. His hair and mane were both a bright golden color that shone even in the depths of the cave where he was born. On his flank was a cutie mark of a black sword superimposed over a sun. While the mares around him were getting their bearings, he opened his eyes, and Discord chuckled at the sight of dragon-like pupils on deep red irises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the stallion who said the first words to Discord, looking up at the statue. \"Who... am I...?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, my boy... all of you, are now my very favorite ponies in the entire world. The Elements of Discord,\" Discord replied gleefully. \"Happy birthday to you all! And for your very first birthday present, I'll be giving you names.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPointing at the lovely purple earth pony who had been the core of Selfishness, he said, \"You'll be... Treasure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the wirey, dull grey pegasus who had been the core of Treachery, he said, \"And you'll be Thunderbumper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the powerfully-built red unicorn who had been the core of Cruelty, he said, \"You'll be Crimson Crash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the charming looking blue pegasus with a silver mane who had been the core of Deception, he said, \"You'll be Silvertongue,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the sneering black earth pony who had been the core of Spite, he said, \"And you'll be Snapper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning his attention back to the stallion, he tapped his pincers together in thought. \"As for you, last but certainly not least... hmmm... a-ha! Your name, son, is Sol Etude. Now, let's all have a big birthday celebration!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Oracle slowly, quietly pulled away and started hovering as quickly as it could in the opposite direction. As it did so, it muttered, \"<u><span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">The dark rainbow will spring up from the earth to sunder harmony! And when the blade of the sun hangs overhead, the night will fall... forever...</span></u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She chuckled as the hapless stallion pulled himself out of the mud pit, grumbling slightly. \"Wow, it's pretty fun to be watching one of these, rather than running through it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Next to her, Caroline grumbled a bit, but her smile betrayed her true feelings. She was currently rubbing lotion on some rope burns she'd acquired when she'd gotten tangled in a rope bridge part of the 'test'. \"It was certainly... interesting. I probably won't be doing it again anytime soon, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nor shall I,\" Luna said from nearby, wincing as her wing was tended to by Nurse Redheart. She'd gone through the course on a whim, and had done better than anypony else thus far. However, near the end, she'd overbalanced on a narrow bridge and fallen. She'd managed to slow herself down enough so that when she crashed, she hadn't broken anything, although her left wing had been sprained. Nearby, Celestia was fussing over her sister, upset that Luna had managed to hurt herself at what was supposed to be a party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, you're in luck, your Highness,\" Redheart said. \"It's just a Grade I sprain of the elbow joint. Given the natural healing of an alicorn, I wager you'll be fine in a day or so. Still, to be safe, I recommend you avoid flying for at least three days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Luna opened her mouth to protest, but was silenced as Celestia replied for her. \"Thank you, Nurse Redheart. It's fortunate you were on hoof to tend to her, as well as other injuries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nearby, Pinkie Pie was scowling. \"A party's no fun if ponies are getting hurt!\" She leveled a glare at Applebloom. \"Take that course apart, before anypony else ends up hurt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Applebloom felt like whimpering. Part of it was because she'd heard stories of what Pinkie was like when she was angry. The other part was that, after all the effort it had taken to build the course, she wasn't about to start tearing it down in the same day. She was <i>exhausted</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fortunately, Chell stood up. \"At least let me have a go at it before it's dismantled,\" she said. When Pinkie opened her mouth to protest, Chell gave her a look. \"No use arguing with me, Pinkie.\" The party pony sighed, and relented, as Chell went to the start of the course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ten minutes later, and Chell had made it through the whole course, almost without pause. She panted a little as she got down from the trampoline at the bottom of the last obstacle. \"Whew! That was a bit harder than I'd thought it would be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Everypony present stared at her. Everypony except Caroline, who was laughing her flank off. \"I thought I told you not to show everypony up!\" she guffawed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Chell shrugged. \"When you got it, you got it,\" she said, retaking her place by Caroline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx shook her head, and stepped forward. \"Anypony else want to give it a try?\" As one, everypony took a step away from the course. \"No? Well, I'll get this packed up, don't worry, Applebloom.\" With that, the midnight alicorn began dismantling the course with her magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Chell and Caroline chuckled as Twilight stepped in to help her daughter. \"Ah, that was a good course! A lot more intensive than the ones I'm used to.\" Caroline flinched briefly, but Chell noticed. \"Oh, stop worrying about it! Celestia was right, it wasn't really you doing all those things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Caroline sighed. \"That doesn't stop me from feeling responsible...\" She shook her head and smiled. \"On the plus side, I now know what that one psychologist meant when he said you were in the 99th percentile when it came to tenacity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Chell blinked, not sure whether the comment was a compliment or an insult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia had joined Twilight and Nyx in dismantling the obstacle course. They went about it with casual conversation for a while, until Twilight broached a subject that the two alicorns had been avoiding thinking about. \"What do you think Discord's up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia frowned. \"Whatever it is, it won't be good for Equestria. We'll have to be ready for anything, be it cotton candy clouds or worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx nodded, then gasped as her horn sparked briefly, disrupting her magic flow for a second. She restarted it a moment later, rubbing her forehead around the base. \"Yeesh, that was weird. I feel like something's straining my power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, you did have a fairly lengthy rage-shift,\" Twilight said, coming over to scan her daughter. \"And you used a ton of magic in the process. It only makes sense that you'd be experiencing some strain on your magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia frowned. \"No, that's not it. The Elements' healing properties should have restored her mana levels to normal. Something else must be at work, here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All three pondered that for a moment, before Nyx yawned. \"Eh, I'll worry about it later. Between the tests, the battle, and the party, I'm wiped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight chuckled. \"Yeah, we've had a busy day, haven't we?\" She turned to Celestia. \"Princess, I think Nyx, Spike, and I will retire to the library. You know where to find us if we're needed.\" With that, mother and daughter left the castle, stopping briefly to pick up Spike and bid farewell to a slightly disappointed, though understanding, Pinkie.</span></div></div>",

Pinkie's nose starts to tingle, and her ear twitches. Her tail stands on end, and the nape of her neck gets goosebumps. Her scalp itches, her teeth clatter, and her entire body pumps full of helium before sending her spiraling off the ladder and out a window, blowing her all the way back to Sugarcube Corner, where she giggles as all the feelings disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woo, that combo's out of this world- no, out of this <i>universe!</i> That's the dooziest doozy I've ever had!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver at Carousel Boutique, a small flash of purple light emanates from below Sweetie Belle's door, right as Rarity is walking past it. Tired from the excitement of the past few days, the fashionista said, \"Sweetie Belle, I told you, if you need a glass of water before bed, I can get one for you.\" She then stopped abruptly in her tracks, remembering that she had seen her little sister off at the train station just the other day!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity opens the door to find Sweetie Belle rummaging through her dresser. \"Sorry, Rarity, but I gotta find something; didn't mean to wake you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlabbergasted, Rarity just shakes her head. \"Wake me? You should be in Canterlot! What are you doing here, Sweetums?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie Belle looks up to her older sister, a strange glint in her eye. \"I need to find what's different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh lord, I hope somepony's read The Sweetie Chronicles: Fragments, because I'm not sure I could pull it off as well as Wanderer D!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBased off of this: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.fimfiction.net/story/2593/The-Sweetie-Chronicles%3A-Fragments\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.fimfiction.net/story/2593/The...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hope that any addition I make shines a good light on the original piece.</span></div></div>",

I'm sorry for being so blunt, but for the last few Jumps, I seem to be arriving only just in time for events that are important, where things could have gone completely wrong.\" Summoning her notebook as if it were an afterthought, she held it for Rarity to see. \"Here's my four acceptance letters into Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns, my two acceptance letters into the Platinum University of Unicornia, and my acceptance letter into Nightmare Moon's Academy for the Magically Proficient. Judging by your age, and the state this room is in, I'd think that I've come at a moment in time somewhere in this me's marehood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill shocked, it took Rarity a second to say \"Y-yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie Belle looked at her flank, drawing Rarity's gaze as well. \"Still blank. I knew it. It doesn't matter what talent the me in a universe has gotten, I will not bear their Mark. I am not your sister, but I have to borrow her for a little bit. Now,\" Sweetie's eyes softened as she let her notebook disappear, and the dresser softly slid shut. \"How are you, Rarity? What's life been like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx looked up from the book she'd been reading at the knock on the door. She glanced at the clock. \"It's almost three in the morning... who could be up this early?\" She got up and magically opened the door, her mouth wide in an unladylike yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, you really <i>do</i> look like Nightmare Moon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx growled at the name. \"I do <i>not</i> like being called Nigh... Sweetie Belle? What're you doing back in Ponyville? And why are you here, this late at night? Gosh, is everything okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, everything's fine. Also, I'm not your Sweetie Belle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx tensed for a second, then relaxed. The display was not lost on Sweetie, however. \"Not going to attack me, or accuse me of being a Yerk or Changeling? That's new.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would not have told me you were not my friend if you were a Changeling, and... Yerk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't matter. Not in this timeline.\" Sweetie paused for a second. \"Well, yet, anyways. They might show up, if Earth exists in this universe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx jumped on the information. \"You're from a different universe? Wow, that's pretty neat! Chell and I had talked a little during the party tonight about her old universe. She used to be a human.\" Nyx giggled. \"The name's pretty funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie Belle just nodded, unfazed. \"So, Nyx, I need to know of anything out of place has happened recently, or if any events are coming up soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Chell, Mom, Uncle Armor, the Princesses, and I all worked together to defeat GLaDOS, a robot from Chell's past, and stop her from global genocide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie Belle brought her notebook back into existence, a quill appearing by her side as she scribbled down some notes. \"Anything else of note?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx nodded, thinking back on what her mom and the other Elements had had happen to them. \"Yeah, GLaDOS had taken Discord's statue and given him access to the facility she ran, and in turn, he taught her magic. She'd only gotten basic levitation, but she was proficient. Nothing I or you couldn't do, probably.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie nodded again, this time while biting her lip. \"Did you manage to recover Discord's statue, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was afraid of that. Well, I need the help of my friends, any friends I can get. Since Scootaloo isn't here, that also means you, so... Hi! I'm Sweetie Belle, and I'm looking for pieces of my teacher, Twilight Sparkle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... I'm Nyx, brought to life with blood magic meant to resurrect Nightmare Moon, and my adoptive mother is Twilight Sparkle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, now that introductions are done with, we need to get Apple Bloom and figure out what happened to Discord. Hopefully, we're not too late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilvertongue left the poor stallion hung from the carriage's harness, his eyes twin, sickly-looking hearts, twisting and turning. \"Thank you for the ride, good sir,\" she said, her voice wafting and echoing like the rasping of leaves brushing against each other on an autumn breeze. \"It's been a pleasuring trip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snrk- <i>yeah</i>, everything's pleasurable with <i>you</i> around, Silver! You use that tongue for more than just talking- you can't deny it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come now, Snapper, I know you don;t mean that. You enjoyed the ride as much as I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, bi-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are here.\" Thunderbumper silenced the two bickering mares with a quick smack to the face for each. \"Now shut up. Crimson Crash, let the pony stay as is. you can strangle some of the guards if you need to.\" The crimson unicorn snorted angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but don't expect me to save your flank if you get caught.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not the one who should worry about getting caught.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now, who's fault is it that we're here, Thunderthighs? It's your fault Treasure's in this stupid dungeon! I wanted to have a nice day of bucking with people's lives, but <i>nooooo</i>, I gotta come out here to bust a stupid ground-beater from being punished!\" Snapper put on a mock-scared look. \"Oh no, the big bad guard's gonna hit me with the riding crop!\" She snorted derisively. \"You shoulda sent Silver in instead, she'd have gotten the guards to beat themselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunderbumper pulled up short before the small guard tower. \"Stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knocked on the door. \"Treasure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door slammed open and a mare clutching ten sheathed weapons to her chest pointed an eleventh one at Thunder threateningly. \"They're MIIIIIINNNNE!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunderbumper looked to Crash. \"Go ahead and kill any guards. Treasure's already looted the place, it seems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapper snickered again. \"Wow, Treasure. You're almost as bad as Silver. You've been grabbing all those guards by the shaft, hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every last one of their spears, mine! Not yours! Mine, mine, mine, mine! Their swords are mine! All mine! Everything!\" Treasure growled threateningly as she lowered her weapon towards snapper, who just stuck her tongue out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eew, now why would I want something you've already gotten your grubby hooves all over? I bet there's not even a single sword that you haven't touched in this entire tower! I hate to tell you this,\" Snapper grinned widely, showing  that she actually enjoyed doing so, \"but you're dirtier than a mine shaft, you suck like a thirty year old vacuum cleaner, and you smell like a pile of Minotaur droppings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's the vacuum?! It's mine! Don't touch it!!!\" With that, Treasure took off down the staircase leading into the basement, screeching the entire way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrimson Crash came back, her already red coat dripping, a manic smile on her muzzle. :Oh yeah, that was <i>gooood</i>. I can't wait to get my hooves on one of those uppity mares Daddy was talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save your blood-lust, Crash. We've got other priorities. Namely, what to do with the stallion we left with the carriage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's there to think about? We kill him, of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunderbumper shook her head. \"We can't, he's gone. Silvertongue's charm didn't last as long as it should have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrash smiled darkly. \"Oooh, I've never had to chase something before.... Can I? please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunder just nodded. \"Alright! I got blood to spill!\" With that, the crazed crimson unicorn ran out the door, and off into the approaching dawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have to... warn them! Need to run... faster! D-danger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Who is this strange stallion?</i></span></div></div>",

That freak with the... alluring... voice had mesmerized him. There wasn't much he knew, but he definitely needed to warn his wife. Maybe send their daughter off to Canterlot or something. It didn't matter! He also needed to make sure Big Mac was alright. He'd thought he'd seen his sister Crimson there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie and Nyx were on their way to Sweet Apple Acres to get Apple Bloom, when Sweetie suddenly looked up. \"Nyx, there's something wrong with this world, something bigger than just the two of us, or even Ponyville.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, Sweetie Belle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something's not right. Something sinister is in the air, the feeling of chaotic magic. Discord's done something. We just need to stop it before he can continue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx nodded, and looked forward again. The farmhouse was only a few minute's walk from here. \"Want me to go up to her window and get her from there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie Belle studied Nyx, and then shrugged. \"Sure, that'll keep the rest of the family asleep. Once you do that, we can teleport back to the Library.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can teleport, too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I can teleport! Why is everypony always so skeptical about the spells I can do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but our Sweetie can only make music.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, go get Apple Bloom. I'll wait here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx nodded and flew off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCerulean gasped as he sat down, trying to catch his breath. How long had he been running? Was he almost home? He briefly wished he could teleport, but instead just got back to his hooves. Casting a small snow spell, he collected flecks of the frozen water on his tongue until he had a sizable gulp. Sated for the moment, he started running, not wanting anypony who might be chasing him to catch him sitting still. \"Where are you, Bluey~?\" She was catching up. He needed to get out of here. No time! \"Gotcha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a startled yelp, Cerulean let loose some of his innate magic, the mare leaping at him freezing in midair, before dropping to the ground with a <i>thump.</i> He breathed a sigh of relief. \"Whew, now let's see who you really are...\" He looked at the red unicorn, smiling happily a bit when he realized it wasn't his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe set off again. He might have bought himself some time, but it was still running out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie looked at her new friends. \"Time is not the most important factor here. The more important factor is space. We can't waste time, that's true, but the very fabric of reality in this world is unraveling. The unraveling of reality's already happened, but it won't happen until later. We can't stop it, because it's already happened, so time's not important. What we <i>can</i> do is save 'space'. We need to stop the advancement of the... You're not getting this at all, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx shrugged, and Apple Bloom shook her head. Sweetie Belle groaned into her hoof. \"Fine, let me explain a bit better. Think of the multiverse as an onion, okay?\" An onion appeared next to Sweetie, floating innocently by her side. \"Now, each layer of the onion is the same, but different. For example, let's take this knife, and cut into the onion,\" Doing just as she described, she stuck the knife halfway into the vegetable. \"Now, when I peel away all the layers, only some of them share the cut, while others don't have the cut at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That cut represents a choice, or a divide. Let's say... Nightmare Moon.\" Nyx glared, and Sweetie glared right back. \"On the ones that <i>are</i> cut, Nightmare Moon was defeated, and Twilight and her friends, and the Cutie Mark Crusaders lived as they have in my own timeline, as well as your timeline. Happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ones without the cut are where Nightmare Moon defeated the Elements, one way or another. Maybe Twilight didn't pass the entrance exam, and instead went on to work in the Royal Guard, alongside her brother. Maybe Pinkie Pie was inside her house when the Rainboom went off the first time, and she didn't learn how to smile. Maybe Rarity was bullied at school, and therefore was more angry than Generous. It doesn't matter. Whatever affected the outcome, Night reigns supreme in one form or another.\" Sweetie Belle rolls her eyes. \"Like the time everything with the Elements went right, but it turned out Nightmare Moon wasn't evil, just a prankster.\" Sweetie muttered to herself, \"I still can't believe she glued me to the ceiling!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx and Apple Bloom just stared at her incredulously. \"... Glued,\" Nyx said, \"to the <i>ceiling?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, right. Anyways, there's something wrong in your universe, that's affecting other universes nearby. Where the knife signifying a change should only have pierced your layer, it is spilling out into other worlds around it, and I think it has to do with Discord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom was about to say something when the door burst open, and a stallion shouted. \"TWILIGHT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCerulean blinked. Sweetie and Apple Bloom looked... older? And, the mare sitting next to them was... \"Nigh... Nigh... Nugh,\" He fell over in a daze, exhaustion and bewilderment drowning out everything else. His vision was blurry, and his hearing wasn't that much better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...ng on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That stal... ju... urst in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard something that chilled his heart, his fading hearing catching one phrase in its entirety, as if to be cruel. Twilight asked, \"Who is he?\" Then he heard no more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight replaced a cool washcloth with a warm one, covering the strange stallion's forehead. \"He's terribly cold, girls. I don't know what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie Belle looked at him, her eyes flashing a little in the candlelight. \"You need to warm him, then. He's not just cold in body. You can tell. Listen to his heart's song.\" Sweetie walked slowly up to the inert unicorn, placing her horn on his chest, before pulsing her magic. A sad, haunting melody poured forth, causing Twilight's hackles to rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...\" Twilight gasped. \"I can see... myself. And, and him. Why... How..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight,\" Sweetie Belle said as she canceled her magic, the haunting melody fading away. \"You've interacted with alternate universes before. You're obviously special to him in the universe he's from, and if he thinks this is still his universe, than it's possible he's gone into shock after hearing that you didn't know who he was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's ears flattened against her head. \"So... I have to... to act like his world's Twilight to get him to wake up?\" She jumped a bit when the cloth she was pulling off his forehead suddenly snapped. \"The cloth, it's frozen stiff.\" She put a hoof on the stallion's body, gasping when she felt how low his temperature was. \"Emotional Magic... I've never seen anypony use it before...\" She picked up the stallion and started up the stairs. \"I'm going to do something that I'll probably be embarrassed about later, girls. I...\" She blushed a little, the wording sounding dirtier than what she wanted to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to lay with him in bed, to help give him body heat.\" Sweetie Belle smiled to Twilight, winking. \"I always knew you were smart!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight nodded in thanks, and went back to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cold... so cold... Why is this world so cruel to me? This can't possibly be my world... This is a nightmare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA warm feeling started to grow within the swirling blizzard that covered Cerulean's heart, and the small purple flame within was growing brighter with each passing second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't grow into the inferno that signified his wife's love, but it was filled with worry and regret, both things that instead of making him feel worse, gave him the feeling he was about to be chastised. \"This is not your world, but it is also not a nightmare,\" Twilight's voice spoke from beyond the swirling wall of snow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what mockery am I in? What's happened to my wife? You are her but not her. Are you a Changeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I am Twilight Sparkle, Librarian at the Books and Branches in Ponyville, Element of Magic, and Faithful Student of Princess Celestia.\" The voice, paused, as if hesitating. \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am... Cerulean. Husband to Twilight Sparkle. I'm also the Seventh Element.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seventh- There's only Six Elements!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, maybe not. My cutie mark is different than it had been when I first got it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight blinked. \"I'll just have to believe you on that one. Now, you need to wake up. Stop moping. I'm sorry that I'm not your Twilight, but you can't just mope around here.\" Twilight's eyelids dropped, half lidded. \"Besides, how would your Twilight react to your being in bed with another mare?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCerulean visibly seized up, and Twilight's laugh tingled as the snow melted away, the waking world coming into focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been almost three hours since Twilight had taken the stallion upstairs, to get him warm, and Sweetie Belle, Nyx, and Apple Bloom had spent that time discussing some of Sweetie's... 'lighter' adventures. \"... And then Scootaloo got the idea to use <i>cling wrap</i> on the toilet.\" The three friends howled with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it seems that there are differences,\" the stallion's voice made the three look up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, good, you're up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Sweetie Belle, I'm awake. Hello, all, my name is Cerulean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anything else could be said, there was a knock at the door.</span></div></div>",

Her sister looked down at her when the door opened, a frown of worry on her face that softened as she saw the fear of punishment on her younger sister's face. \"Apple Bloom, why'd you run off like that? When Ah got up and saw you weren't in your room, Ah was right scared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack let a stern, but less angry look onto her face. \"Now, Ah ain't gonna be all mean or nothin', but ya could've at least left a note!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom mumbled out an apology, and AJ nodded tiredly. \"A'ight. If you two are just hanging out after all the crazy with GLaDOS, I understand. Jus' lave a note fer us next time. I'll be goin', then. Bye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom sighed in relief as her elder sister trotted away. \"Phew, Ah thought Ah was about ta get mah ears chewed off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie Belle and Cerulean were just trotting back in when Rainbow Dash suddenly came flying through the window, slamming into Cerulean which, for some funny reason, created a puff of snow that blanketed the main foyer. \"Twilight? Nyx!\" The spectral-maned mare leapt* onto the young Alicorn, her eyes bugging out in a wild panic. \"You gotta help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wu-what's wrong, Dash?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a strange stallion in my bed! S-some sort of pervert!\" Dash shuddered, getting off of Nyx and rubbing her forelegs with her hooves. \"He... he called me Dashie and nibbled on my ear. The worst part, though, was that... He felt so... I dunno. <i>right.</i> Like... Like that's what was supposed to happen.\" Dash fell to the floor, cradling her head in her hooves. \"I'm so confused!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCerulean created a small cloud of snow that shrouded Dash for a second, before he spoke. \"Rainbow Dash, what did this Stallion look like? Dark grey coat, grey mane with a yellow streak?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" Dash hesitated. \"Maybe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCerulean smiled calmly. \"Okay, then that's just Storm. Don't worry about him. He's your coltfriend.\" Cerulean took in Dash's flabbergasted appearance and amended his statement. \"Well, in a different universe, or world, or something. Sweetie Belle could explain it better, I think.\" Cerulean and Dash turned to look at Sweetie Belle, who just frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don;t think we have enough time to waste on explanations at the moment, Cerulean. Especially after having seen what you did after being rejected through ignorance by Twilight. It sounds like Dash here literally ran away from him. He's probably confused, if not downright horrified like you were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well... He'd probably either go back to Quakehoof's home- his dad- and ask either him or his mother for advice, or go looking for you- which would potentially lead him to the same place, seeing as you guys are always over there, pulling pranks on his younger sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes; Scootaloo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash's eyes widened. \"But Scootaloo...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... An orphanage...\" Storm looked up at the building before him, where his parents' home used to be. The sign out front said in large, looping letters: '<i>Ponyville's home for the Young</i>'. It was both great and terrible. Great, because that meant that a lot of ponies who didn't have parents could still find happiness, like Scoots' friend, Pipsqueak. But it was terrible, because the inscription at the bottom said it was in memory of Quakehoof and Flying Grace. <i>His parents.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm shuddered, wiping at his eyes and hoping that the three story building would suddenly become the one story apartment that he remembered it to be. \"D-dammit,\" he choked out. \"What happened? What happened, dammit?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your parents are dead, Storm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cerulean?\" Storm looked up. Cerulean, Sweetie Belle, an Alicorn, Apple Bloom, and Rainbow Dash all were there, staring him. He ducked his head down in shame and remorse. \"... How? How are they dead? They were alive just last night. I flew over their house- right here- after taking over Dashie's shift. When I got back to our house, I got back into our bed and snuggled up with her. Then, then this morning, she's kicking me out, and... and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rainbow Dash?\" Storm looked up to see an unfamiliar mare walking forward. \"You of all ponies would know that Scootaloo's not holed up in this old nag's care anymore, oh no... She moved on to... Oh, wherever it was, to be a stuntmare.\" The older mare tittered, smiling proudly. \"What I would do to have had foals of my own, et alone as brave as her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm looked up at her, working his mouth for a second. \"... What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry dearie, I didn't see you there! What happened, you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... To Scootaloo's parents?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old mare tisked sadly, shaking her head. \"It was a shame, what happened. Burglary, it looked like. Caught Quakehoof asleep, apparently, because otherwise the town would have known something was amiss. No, Flying Grace put up quite the fight, though. There was a trail of blood that lead outside, and disappeared, so either a unicorn or pegasus. Roseluck and Lily were the first to see what had happened, and it took all of Rose's willpower to not faint immediately at the sight, and carry young Scootaloo all the way to the hospital. She was less than a month old, at that point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm's eyes widened. \"But... Mom came back before she even showed signs of pregnancy. Back to Cloudspire. Scoots had been born there, I helped raised her, ever since... I was there for her for years, until... Until that storm.\" Storm hung his head, his whole body quivering with painful shame and anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who killed them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'm sorry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who killed my parents? Quakehoof and Flying Grace? <i>Who. Killed. Them?\"</i> His voice was haggard and demonic, like boiling lava pouring forth from the mouths of Tartarus itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-nopony knows! Proud Skies gave some speech up in Cloudspire about how disheartening it was to hear about his wife's infidelity, and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rage was almost visibly rising from Storm's coat, his eyes flickering with an inner fire. \"That... <i>Bastard.</i> Did he ever <i>once</i> mourned her loss? Or just her infidelity?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I can't recall...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long until he had a new wife?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-maybe a month? Two? I don't recall, it was a long time ago, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That. BUCKING. <b>BASTARD</b> killed my parents!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash looked at him quizzically. \"How d'you know that he did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, he killed my grandfather as well. In... In our world. Mine and Cerulean's. Him killing my grandfather was what lead me to Ponyville, and meeting my real father. And... and you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Him killing my Grandfather gave me and my family such anguish, and yet more hope. Heh, Mom and Dad had another kid, right around the same time you and I were just starting to get intimate. Hope's almost a year old, and... Good Goddesses, you're probably due any month, now. If I'm not there to help you... I don't think I could ever go back. Especially since it would've been the second time I'd been... displaced... from my sis. I couldn't do that, to anypony in my family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm looked back up at the group, many of whom didn't know what he was rambling about, and gave them a decisive, definite snort. \"I'm gonna see if my Grandfather still lives in this world, and I'm gonna find myself. I'll need his help, as well as yours. Help me, and I'll help you fix... whatever it is that's wrong. I need to be home for my Rainbow Dash, but I think she'd be okay if I helped her out in a different world as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow's lip trembled as she failed to suppress a squee, and gave the other pegasus a hug. \"Dammit, now I know why your Dashie loves you.\" Her eyes hardened, and she glowered at Storm. \"If you bring your other self here, than you'd better make sure he's not all wimpy or something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm barked out a laugh. \"Oh, I was kinda whiny and wimpy when I first showed up here, but you got me in shape real quick, with the promise of stunts only my Grandpa could ever do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen what're you waiting for, Storm?! Fly, boy!\" Storm took off, flying almost as fast as Dash had ever flown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*leapt is a correct word, just FYI.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould we follow Sweetie Belle as the world becomes more crazy, or go after Storm as he finds himself- quite literally?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRead from here to see Storm's personal story from the beginning: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.fimfiction.net/story/14222/1\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.fimfiction.net/story/14222/1</a><br>\r\nThe retirement home is the Golden Feathers Retirement Home. </span></div></div>",

Trotting through the front door, he looked around until he saw the nurse that usually kept the air-freshener stocked up. It looked like he'd just received a delivery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, Nurse Spice? Would you know where my Grandfather is at this moment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNurse Spice looked up from the reports he'd been reading to look at Storm and smiled. \"Ah, Storm! It's good to see you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm, who had been expecting a cold and blunt reply, blinked in surprise. \"I-it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, of course it is! Thanks again for helping me set up that contest last week, these old featherweights have been a lot happier recently. Heh, I know what you're thinking; I've been saying that for years, ever since you first came here and brightened up the place. How's that mare of yours, uh... Cloudfire, was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cloudburn, I believe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Yes, that's it. I heard she was getting married; was it to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tight lump formed in my throat. <i>Sweet Celestia I hope not, Night Gale's been pining for her forever!</i> \"Hey, uh, so did you know where my Grandfather is? I was hoping to speak with him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Oh! Oh, yes, yes of course! I think he's out on the racetrack out back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled, turning around and heading for the door, waving hello to some of the other old timers in the foyer. It was time to meet my... no, this version of me's grandfather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">|=|~|=|</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, boy! Take 'er fer another loop! C'mon, Storm! You got this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm walked out onto the plateau to find his grandfather up in the air, next to a familiar hulking grey pegasus. \"Don't worry, gramps!\" The Storm already in the air said with a smug smile. \"You're looking at the next best racer right here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Geez, I hope I was never that boastful,</i> Storm thinks to himself with a grimace. After his double shoots off into the air, he takes a deep breath. \"Hey, Lightning Wing!\" At his call, his grandfather looked around for a moment, before spotting the hulking pegasus on the ground below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, the older pegasus lands, giving a low whistle. \"You must've been faster than I thought; coulda sworn you went up and not down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm chuckled, relaxing as he remembered his grandfather's love for ribbing and banter. \"Eh, that's probably because you fell asleep again; I told you not to blink so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis grandfather roared with laughter, clapping Storm on the back as he tried to reign in his guffaws. \"Where'd you suddenly grow that lip, eh sonny? I knew you could tell a sarcastic remark, but that was downright <i>mean.</i>\" Lightning's eyes narrowed mischievously. \"I like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm basked in his grandfather's praise for a moment longer, before remembering why he was there. \"Hey, Gramps, I need to talk to you for a moment, kinda seriously.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLightning could tell that it was serious from the lad's tone. \"Yes? What do you want, Storm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've got a confession to make, for one. I'm not your grandson- he's actually up there.\" Storm pointed and waved at himself, who was too far away to make out anything more than a big gray blotch in the sea of blue and white. \"I'm not even from this world, or universe, or something, and... well, I need my help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe his grandfather believed him. Maybe his grandfather was senile. Maybe they were both just plain old crazy. Whichever it was, his grandfather chuckled good-naturedly. \"Well, that seems like an okay plan to me. I'll call him down, and we can go talk in my room. How's that?\" Storm nodded, and headed for his grandfather's room; he still remembered the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm looked up from the book he was reading when a pair of familiar voices came within earshot. \"... what you mean by that, it's crazy, Gramps. You're pulling my wing. That's... It's utter nonsense!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, it's only nonsense if he didn't find my room, yeah? Now... where's that key...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm smiled; he had known exactly where his grandfather hid he key; of course, all the orderlies did, too, as well as many of the other Wonderbolts, but it was an unspoken agreement that nopony talked about the fact that his key hung from the rafters right in front of his door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm got out of his chair and opened the door, his grandfather standing on the other side with a smile, and an exact copy of himself. \"Hey, Storm,\" he said to his other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other Storm blinked, obviously surprised. \"Hey...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what brings you out here, from... what did you call it? A different dimension, or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I need to borrow Storm here. But first, a question:Are you getting married, Storm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Storm outside Lightning Wing's room shook his head. \"Nope, but I'm gonna be the best colt for Cloudburn and Gale's wedding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm chuckled. \"Well, it's about time, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm (Geez, we need a way to differentiate these two...) laughed as well. \"Yeah, I finally realized that Cloud was pining for me- took me long enough- and I told her I wasn't interested. I also told her to maybe try Gale, he was already smarter, so he'd be the better prize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm v1 nodded, a questioning look on his face. \"Why'd you come here to live with Lightning Wing, Storm? Was it because of an accident?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm v2 shook his head, his brow furrowed. \"No, that wasn't it. After my Mom died, Proud Skies didn't feel like putting up with me. So, he shipped me over here. Gramps has been teaching me his tricks ever since.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm v1 breathed a sigh of relief. \"Okay, so that means that Cloudburn and the rest didn't suffer here as well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suffer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never you mind, self. It's my burden to carry, and while we may be the same pony, we are still different. Which is perfectly fine. I need your help, but it's a two day fly from here with barely any breaks. Since you're in good condition- I wasn't when I first went there- we can get there pretty quickly. Pack up whatever you need, and let's hit the skies. There's a filly who might like to meet you, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm v2's eyes went wide. \"M-my sister? Scootaloo... She's been alive, all this time..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and she might not know it, but she's got a pretty cool brother, who needs to make up for not being there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sounds good to me. Let's do this!\" And with that, the two huge pegasai took off down the hall, packed up everything the two of them thought were essential, and left.</span></div></div>",

Everypony give it up for the trail blazing, field razing, super amazing stuntsponies that are Project Ground-pound!\" The announcer's voice echoed all around the stadium, but up on the blimp that was her starting position, Scootaloo could barely hear him over the crowd's hungry roar. That was a <i>lot</i> of ponies. Scootaloo gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, kid?\" Scootaloo flinched as one of the other team members spoke up from behind her. \"Don't worry; it's just like we practiced. Only thing you gotta do here is look awesome for the crowd. Oh, and don't go splat. That'd be a terrible hit to our insurance.\" The stallion laughed as he put his own helmet on, and got into his starting post. She was only one of two pegasus members, both of them with underdeveloped wings. That was a long way to fall, but as a team it'd be easy to slow down. Individually... How did earth ponies get this crazy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the first jumper, the colt who's mama was a pony, and his daddy was a donkey, the sonnuva mule we all love, hate, and tolerate, Ass Jackson!\" With a mighty roar, the stadium below seemed to tremble and shake as the crowd cheered. Jackson waved to the pegasai on the cloud bleachers, flicking his sunglasses off before throwing them over the side of the dirigible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackson trotted backwards away from the edge, before jumping into a full gallop, and leaping off the edge. Scootaloo gasped as she watched, knowing that it was only a matter of time before she had to do the jump. Ass splayed his legs out to the sides, the vest he was wearing puffing out like a balloon. His speed slackened, before he let the vest go flying off, giving him plenty of time to do a few flips and turns before landing gracefully in a pool of water in the middle of the stadium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd went wild as Ass Jackson got out of the pool, once again wearing his sunglasses. \"Did you see that entry, folks?! Fillies and gentlecolts, Griffons and Goats, people of all races, hold onto your socks, 'cause this is only the beginning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*~*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Scoots! That was pretty darn radical! Great recovery. I mean it! We should give you the title of 'Turkey' after that, 'cause your goose was just about cooked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScootaloo smiled wearily at Geri, the team's griffon-chef. \"Thanks, G. I'm just hoping this gets me past the 'Flying Chicken' comments after my last week's test run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeri chuckled. \"Yes, your first week and you've already moved up in the name charts, good work, kid. You got this locked down, trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScootaloo was about to thank Geri for her praise when Dent, the team's go-to dragon, walked up. \"Hey, Scootaloo! Express mail from Ponyville, seems your friends are already worried sick!\" Dent chuckled as Scoots took the letter, opening it after seeing the red CMC emblem used to seal the envelope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, a Level Eleven emergency, huh? Probably another 'end-of-the-world' threat.\" Scootaloo sighed as she began to read the letter aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Hey, Scoots. This is Apple Bloom, Sweetie, and Nyx, and we need your help.Reality is beginning to come apart at the seams, and ponies from different universes are popping up in ours. We need the CMC at full strength to deal with this, please come as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Apple Bloom, Nyx, and Sweetie Belle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPS: Sweetie's also from a different dimension.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, sounds important. Guess I should go, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDent and Geri looked at each other, sharing a curious glance at the fily's nonchalance. \"Uhh... Yeah. If the world's ending, I think I'd like to stay with my friends, too. You should go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, okay. Gonna go ask Ass if I can get the leave; tell him I'll be back later. See ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeri offered Dent a cup of Magma Coffee, and got himself a cup of Desert Falcon. \"I don't always drink, but hey. If the world's ending, I might as well, yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot ten minutes later, there was a weird chirring sound as a blue box appeared in front of the cook and dragon. The door opened and Scootaloo stepped out. \"Thanks for the ride, Doctor! I gotta go! Hi Geri! Hey Dent! Long time no see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two non-ponies looked at each other, shrugged, and went back to their drinks, Geri muttering to himself. \"Mebbe I should stop drinking this stuff... Everytime I do something weird happens.\" Dent nodded as he drained the last of his drink, pouring himself another glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I think there's too much mint in this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should happen next?</span></div></div>",

Some so much so, that Nyx kept finding sleeping ponies lying in the strangest places. Like, for example... \"Uh, Berry? Hello? Miss Punch, wake up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grmlfrml Mrgn mmhmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx rolled her eyes. \"There's cookies and punch by the doo-\" Fwoosh Nyx giggled as Berry Punch picked up a nearby glass and began quaffing Neighan Punch like there was no tomorrow. \"Have a good night, Miss Punch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBerry looked over at Nyx, smiling sheepishly as she put her cup down. \"Y-yes, you too, y'hear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx smiled and continued folding the tables and storing them away in a side chamber. Seeing that Pinkie was still busy with the streamers, she decided to do a once over of the castle, to make sure nopony was still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour had passed her by, Nyx had checked most every room, starting from her tower all the way down to the dungeons. She was tired, hungry (hey, a growing mare's gotta eat- especially when they're growing by decades at a time!), and satisfied that nopony was still-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's something there. Nyx froze in place, looking out of the corner of her eye at the room she was passing. It was one near the castle's main entrance, easily passable. On an impulse, Nyx decided to check it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, thought I saw something moving in here...\" Nyx trotted into the room, which was bare except for a single piece of ornate furniture; an armoire made of a dark, ebony wood and festooned with small gems and golden lines that swirled and danced across the armoire's surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the doors to the bedazzled cabinet,Nyx looked into its depths. \"It's bigger on the inside,\" she murmured to herself, eyes flicking across the rows upon rows of cloaks hung inside the small, unassuming wooden box. Pushing past the first row, she shuddered as she realized why the cloaks looked familiar; they were the same cloaks the Children of Nightmare had worn when they brought her back to power that night Celestia'd spirited her to Canterlot. She wanted to get out. No, she <i>needed</i> to get out, but something drew her in further. She spied a set of armor not much different than her- <i>Nightmare Moon's</i> own, except for its more elongated design, and the pauldrons were shaped for a different body type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx shivered as a draft of cold, wintry air passes by her, causing the cloaks to flutter on the breeze. <i>Wait... Cold air?</i> She pushed further into the armoire's depths, suddenly tripping on what appears to be a tree root, and falling face first into a snow drift. Pulling herself back to her hooves, she looks around to find herself in a small clearing, a large thicket behind her. \"Where am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're in Narnia, you silly filly.\" Nyx jumped in surprise, and whipped her head to the side, finding herself face to face with a minotaur wrapped in a large fur coat. \"Now, you look cold. Come, come, I've got a fire to warm your body, and a meal to warm your spirit.\" The minotaur shuffles a bit, shivering despite his large coat. \"I've always hated winter. But that just feeds the Windigos further, eh? No one's got the energy to hate, but we don't really have much love, either. The winter's cold claws have a firm grip on most everybody's hearts, and the land of Narnia suffers on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx gave the minotaur a quizzical look as they stopped outside a hut made of several twisted and dead-looking trees. \"Is there a point to all that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minotaur shrugged, opening the door and motioning Nyx to go inside. \"I don't know, but everything that comes through that thicket ends up asking questions, and my family's always ended up answering. It's practically a script, now. Most creatures return through the thicket after hearing our tale of woe. The question is, will you follow in their steps, whether hoof, foot, claw, or paw? Or will you stay here, and see if you could help us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx sunk into thought. After a few minutes of sitting before the fire, she opens her eyes again. \"I think that I'll...\"</span></div></div>",

Though she had kept in relatively good shape in the years since arriving in Equestria, her injuries sapped her stamina. Shining Armor kept watch while she recuperated, and in the absence of their hoofsteps against the metal catwalks echoing in their ears, he noticed another sound. Something mechanical, so he quickly adopted a defensive stance, preparing to erect a protective barrier around himself and Chell at a moment's notice as he crept along the path, peering around the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever he had been expecting, it wasn't..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When Chell and Shining Armor looked, they saw that the turret had shot a message into the cavern wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span style=\"font-family:impact, fantasy\">StillAlive</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Chell looked at the turret, her eyes widened. She scribbled out a message. \"I recognize this turret! I saved it from a fire once before, and left it on the catwalks in the old facility. How did it get here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shining glanced between Chell and the turret, which continued its nonsensical ramblings. \"Let's see if we can find out,\" he murmured, as he stepped forward. \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The turret spun to face the two. Shining twitched, ready to bring his shield up at a moment's notice. However, the turret didn't open fire. It looked at Chell. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"<u>You... The savior...</u>\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The two ponies looked at each other, before Shining spoke up. \"Why do you call her 'savior'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"<u>A previous existence, she saved from redemption,</u>\"</span> the turret said, hovering in front of the two. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"<u>Kindness was paid in the words of the Oracle.</u>\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shining blinked, then looked at Chell. \"Does this make any sense to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Chell nodded slowly, writing a note. \"Somewhat. When I saved the turret in the old facility, it... knew things that were to come. I didn't pay attention to it at the time, but now that I think about it, it was pretty foreboding. I guess this is that turret's successor... somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shining looked up at the floating turret. \"You are called the Oracle, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"<u>The current Oracle,</u>\"</span> clarified the turret. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"<u>Born of a glitch in the programming, I have free will. I see and know things that others do not.</u>\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shining looked down, and chuckled. \"Twilight's brain would explode if she knew we were talking to someone claiming to be able to see the future, let alone a turret.\" He looked at the wall, and blinked at the message. \"Why were you blasting that message into the wall? 'Still Alive'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The turret actually gave a small chuckle. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"<u><i>She</i> doesn't know yet, but her past life is not so easily destroyed. The Guardian Mare will awaken the part of her she thought she deleted.</u>\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Both ponies blinked at that. \"By 'she', do you mean GLaDOS?\" asked Shining Armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The turret bobbed up and down, in a simulation of a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shining narrowed his eyes. \"If that's the case, who's the 'Guardian Mare'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"<u>She wears a coat of black and the mark of a shield.

So... Nyx will 'awaken' the part of GLaDOS she thought she deleted?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Chell gasped, one of the few noises she could truly make. She quickly scribbled a note. \"It must mean Caroline! She's... still alive, somehow! Still living within that twisted metal shell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shining nodded slowly. \"If that's the case, we've gotta hurry. There's no telling what could happen in the meantime. If your friend still exists, somehow, we've got to get her back to the surface. And I think the only way to do that is with the Elements of Harmony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Chell nodded, then looked at the Oracle. It was still floating before them, occasionally muttering something. Chell's blood ran cold when she heard one particular sentence. <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"<u>A mechanical monster awakens a nightmare by placing her mother in jeopardy.</u>\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shining had been busy trying to locate a landmark of some sort to navigate by. Thus, Chell's sudden insistant tugging shocked him slightly. \"Wha - Chell? What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Chell looked panicked, as she simply wrote down what the Oracle had just said. \"Think about what it means,\" she added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shining thought about it... and did not like what his mind was telling him. \"We've spent enough time down here. Let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Together, the two ponies bolted from the room, as the Oracle floated away. As it slowly left, it said one last thing: <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"<u>A rainbow will give voice to the voiceless and flesh to the fleshless.</u>\"</span></span></div></div>",

Taking time with her words and being kind of klutzy, giving the superficial impression that she's kind of slow regardless of her actual intelligence.]]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short while after they set out, the militia drew close to the castle, but did not enter it. Instead, they took a moment for Spell Nexus to pass out pieces of parchment that he had been working on along the way. Each group of ponies he passed them to unfurled them to see a highly detailed tunnel map.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At present, these maps represent the tunnel system as they were when the Children of Nightmare disbanded. We won't know how accurate they are until we are inside, of course, so I've placed an enchantment on each one to automatically correct itself as we progress. I also took the liberty of linking them to one another in the event that we get separated. That way, each group will know what the others have found.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most impressive, Spell Nexus,\" Luna replied as she rolled the parchment up again and handed it to one of her Guards. \"In Chell's current absence, this will surely give us a great advantage!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash bravely volunteered, \"Yeah, just give me five minutes to fly through the place, and you'll have a full map!\" Twilight, however, wasn't thrilled with the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not a bad idea, Dash, but I don't think we should be separated. We'll need to stick together in order to use the Elements of Harmony if we have to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid Twilight has a point, Rainbow Dash,\" replied Celestia. \"The Elements of Harmony are at their strongest when borne by you six. If anything should happen to one of you, it would leave the whole incomplete. You are far too valuable to risk losing by sending you off on your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash clearly wasn't happy about it, but hung her head. \"Guh... fine...\" Another pegasus stepped up, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I can do it, princess,\" Ditzy Doo said, her words slow and nervous as she looked up to the princesses. \"I'm... not as fast as Rainbow Dash, but... I want to help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Celestia and Luna looked unsure at the wall-eyed pegasus, though, it was Rainbow Dash who stepped up and said, \"Actually, your highness, Derpy here'd make a good scout. Not as good as <i>I</i> would be, of course, but if there are any traps, she's tough enough to handle it. One time, she pretty much destroyed City Hall with her butt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDitzy smiled unevenly, <i>pretty</i> sure that most of that had been meant as a compliment, but it was hard to tell with Dash sometimes, and probably hadn't helped her case. Nevertheless, Celestia smiled warmly and called over a group of three other pegasi. \"Very well. Miss Derpy, you and my fastest Guards will scout ahead. Just remember that if you should encounter the enemy, your first duty is to escape, and fight only when absolutely necessary.\" As she passed a map down to Ditzy, the grey pegasus smiled widely and nodded before holding it in her mouth, so grateful that she forgot to correct the princess about her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other ponies of Ponyville gathered and wished her and her entourage luck. \"You watch yer flank in there,\" Applejack said. \"Y'all got Dinky waitin' for ya t' come home.\" Ditzy smiled around the parchment in her mouth and nodded again before taking off into the tunnels with the rest of the scouts. Twilight then unfurled her own map, and saw that as the pegasi moved deeper into the cavern, the lines changed subtly to reflect how they found it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" the unicorn said, rolling the map back up. \"Let's find our ponies, then make GLaDOS wish she'd never been built!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Royal Guard and Ponyville militia made their way deeper and deeper underground, they checked their maps as the surroundings gradually changed. Based on what the scouts had found, the rough tunnels that had been carved out by nature and the Children of Nightmare eventually transitioned into more uniformly shaped, rectangular stretches. It was clearly where GLaDOS had started to develop the area, reshaping it into her own image, but as they approached those outer reaches, what they found was wholly unfamiliar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of the sterile white panels that GLaDOS was so fond of, or even the decrepit, industrial corridors that had been behind the scenes of the original Enrichment Center, the corridors that they found themselves in looked more like... office space. Cubicles and offices everywhere, complete with all the assorted supplies and knick-knacks one would expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this does have a refreshingly Manehattan-esque aesthetic,\" Rarity said in the hopes of breaking the confused silence that had fallen over the group, \"but if this is supposed to be a workspace, then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are the workers...?\" Twilight mused. Though not as intentionally sterile as GLaDOS's testing chambers, the sense that this was a place meant to be populated made the absence of ponies all the more chilling and ominous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy quietly followed the rest of her friends, nervously staying as close to them as she could as it seemed like there could be something horrible lurking around any corner. She then squeaked and practically jumped out of her skin when a speaker near the ceiling suddenly crackled to life! Then a voice boomed through it, echoing loudly throughout the complex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho's voice is it?</span></div></div>",

GLaDOS tests ponies to the breaking point and beyond. She has killed in the past, Discord, do you know that? She cares nothing for the lives lost, all in the name of science.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Discord was silent, so Applejack decided to interject. \"Ah can't rightly say who ah hate more, you or her.

I hope Twilight is okay...\" Fluttershy whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpell Nexus overheard and unfurled his map, seeing the new details that had appeared on it. \"Hmm, as long as she wasn't separated from her map, it looks like she's near the center of the complex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia spoke up, her calm, motherly voice drawing everyone's attention. \"If that is the case, then GLaDOS's insanity will actually work in our favor. She may be a sadist, but she is not one to dispose of a valuable test subject too quickly.\" She smirked a little to the assembled ponies. \"And if there is one thing my faithful student has always performed well at, it's tests. Our first priority should be reconvening with Captain Armor and Chell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Celestia resumed leading the ponies down the corridors, reaching out with her magic. If Discord was indeed telling the truth, she should easily be able to sense Guard Captain's own magic. Her focus was disturbed, however, by Vinyl Scratch's voice saying, \"Woah, I thought she'd be freakin' out over Twilight. I guess that's why she's the leader, though. Cold steel nerves.\" After a brief pause, the DJ added, \"Dude, that is SO the name of my next song!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to Luna, though, Celestia whispered quietly enough to keep it from the others, \"Sister, I didn't want to worry the others, but I fear for Twilight Sparkle's safety. I know we shouldn't play our hand too soon, but if Twilight is for some reason unable to teleport back to us, will you go to her location? I don't want to put you in unnecessary danger either, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna didn't even bat an eyelash before replying, \"Consider it done, sister. I share your concern, but you shouldn't need to bear such fears on your own. Especially not with these ponies... or me. You still try too hard to carry all of Equestria's burdens on your own shoulders, sometimes. Especially when you're afraid and could use the help the most.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia blushed slightly at the chastisement, but smiled with gratitude to Luna. Concentrating on locating their allies again, she quickly felt their presence. \"Ah! This way, my little ponies,\" she exclaimed, turning off into a side-corridor that led back to the more roughly-hewn tunnels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the familiar sensation of Celestia's magic nearby, Shining Armor suddenly stopped in his tracks. Chell gave him a quizzical look, to which he explained, \"Ah, I just felt the princesses searching for us. They're close, so we'll be able to tell them about Nyx!\" Chell nodded resolutely and the two of them hurried down the tunnels as quickly as the earth pony's injuries would allow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few minutes, they spotted the lights of unicorn horns illuminating the path up ahead! Shining Armor called out to them, \"Your highness! We're here!\" Before he could reach them, though, as the red lines of laser sights suddenly came to life, all pointed at him and Chell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime seemed to slow down as realization dawned on the unicorn, his joy at finding the others turning to terror as he reflexively called upon his magic. In mid-step, he summoned up a protective bubble to wrap around himself and Chell, and at the same drawn-out instant, dozens of cheery mechanical voices exclaimed, \"I see you!\" Immediately afterward, thousands of rounds of ammunition spat out of the turrets from shadow alcoves dug into the walls and ceiling all around him. Most of them bounced off of the shield, but a number of them managed to get through before it was fully formed, and Shining Armor tumbled to the ground as several bullets struck him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChell wasn't able to stop herself in time before she bounced off the inside of the shield, but after shaking her head to clear it, she saw the state Shining Armor was in and quickly moved over to him. He was bleeding from where he had been hit. Thankfully, it didn't look as though he had been shot anywhere vital, or the shield would have collapsed and the both of them would have been reduced to a red paste by the hail of bullets. Still, while he remained conscious, his breathing was labored and his horn was chipped. As a result, the protective sphere around them flickered slightly, bulging inward where it softened while he struggled to maintain his focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the other ponies arrived on the scene, following the sound of gunfire, they gasped at what they saw. Ditzy, seeing her friend and co-worker in distress, cried out, \"Chell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVinyl Scratch, taking the initiative, quickly pushed her Bass Cannon up front and pointed it down the tunnel. \"Don't worry, everypony! I got this!\" Before she could punch the button on the top of it, though, Applejack quickly butted her away from the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in tarnation are y'all thinkin'?! You wanna bring the whole cave down on 'em?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia quickly turned to Spell Nexus and asked the wizard, \"Nexus! Can you use that spell you devised to stop those turrets?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It should,\" the wizard replied, \"but this far from the transmitter, and it will only work in this area. Plus, GLaDOS might find a way to counter it by the time we reach the-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna snapped, \"NOW, Nexus! It is a risk we shall have to take!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, your highness!\" Focusing his magic, the unicorn formed the complex spell in his mind, and lines of power burst forth from his horn. From a technologically advanced perspective, the runic lines and patterns that branched and spread out from Nexus would have clearly resembled the pathways of a circuit board as they filled the tunnel ahead, connecting to each of the turrets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being touched by the magic lines, every turret responded to the commands the wizard sent them by saying, \"Nighty-night\" and closing up as they entered sleep mode. Shining Armor's shield was able to hold out long enough to survive the last fading barrage of gunfire, but it was only a temporary reprieve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry,\" the wizard urged, sweat forming on his brow from the effort of maintaining the spell. \"GLaDOS is already starting to re-assert control, and I have the feeling she's barely even trying!\" Indeed, automatic systems were already at work, fighting the external influence of the spell. As quickly as they could, the princesses and unicorns pulled Shining Armor and Chell over to them, out of harm's way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were safe, Ditzy hugged Chell while the others tended to Shining Armor's injuries. Celestia took the opportunity to tell Vinyl, \"Now you can do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heck yeah!\" The DJ unicorn eagerly slammed the button on the top of her speakers, causing the Bass Cannon to open up and unleash a tunnel clearing blast of sonic energy that vaporized the turrets in their holes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough they hadn't brought a doctor or medic with them, Luna helped by teleporting the bullets out of Shining Armor's wounds so that they wouldn't cause further damage. Fluttershy, used to tending to wounded animals, then helped by bandaging him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeesh, pay more attention next time,\" Rainbow Dash told the Guard Captain. \"You have any idea how bad Twilight's gonna freak out when she finds out about this? And why the heck isn't Nyx with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining Armor winced before replying, \"Nyx insisted on going back... stalling GLaDOS so we could get out and find you. Wait. Twilie! Where is she?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they told him about Discord and how Twilight had been snatched from under their noses, the Guard Captain grunted and weakly pulled himself back up to his hooves. \"Then it's already started. We have to hurry!\" As quickly as he could, he told them about the warning from the self-proclaimed Oracle. Just as he finished, though, the tunnels suddenly trembled around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeek! Vinyl's music is gonna kill us all! That dream was RIGHT,\" Pinkie Pie screamed, until the tremor suddenly stopped. \"Oh, wait, never mind!\" The princesses and unicorns in the group, however, had been struck by the emotions behind the source of that tremor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" Luna said. \"This feeling... this power, it's just like...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Nyx,\" Celestia finished. \"But this feeling... I've never sensed such rage from her before...\" Looking her sister in the eye, she commanded, \"Luna, take everypony! Find Nyx and Twilight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised by the request, she asked, \"Me? What about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Celestia looked down the tunnel. \"As much as I hate to say so, my injuries will probably keep me from fighting GLaDOS directly under these circumstances. Not without having to bring so much magical power to bear, I might be danger to our allies as much as to our enemy. But I have a feeling that those turrets were not set there simply to ambush us. Not with those alcoves carved into solid rock. No, I think they were set to protect something, and Shining Armor just happened to stumble across it. If my feeling is correct, then I can at least contribute by finding and dealing with whatever it is they were set to guard. If it turns out to be important, GLaDOS will at the very least be distracted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna nodded. \"Alright. But do not think that <i>I</i> want to see my sister put herself in unnecessary danger, either,\" she replied before addressing the other ponies and preparing to teleport them.</span></div></div>",

She limped whenever she put pressure on her injured leg, but striding purposefully to the spot where Shining Armor had been attacked. From there, she shone light from her horn to find that on one patch of wall, Vinyl's Bass Cannon had stripped away a facade of rock hiding a door behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing that door open, the white alicorn followed a long tunnel from which she could hear the steady rhythm of industrial machinery. Louder and louder the sound grew until it opened up into a massive chamber. Criss-crossing conveyor belts carried parts and raw materials through the facility, robotic arms connecting and welding the parts together, manufacturing them into fully-formed turrets at a horrifying rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd not just the models that Celestia was familiar with, but new ones that were clearly modeled as some sort of parody of her world's various residents. Scoop-handed diggers resembling Diamond Dogs. Sleek, rigid-winged gryphon models, some of which soared around the ceiling of the factory after activation before alighting on the countless pallets containing what must have been thousands of slumbering death machines. Most horrifying to the princess, however, were the models that were shaped in the image of her beloved ponies. Earth ponies, pegasi, unicorns, all rendered in the form of a soulless technological caricature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is an army...\" she murmured under her breath. \"With these numbers, she could easily conquer Equestria in one move, but she drew us here instead. Was it simply to gloat, or...\" She heard the distant sound of gunfire, too far away to be aimed at her. Instead, a line of turrets were blasting <span style=\"font-family:impact, fantasy\">STILL ALIVE</span> into the wall over and over again. \"... or was something inside her holding her back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of silently regarding the vast facility, she set her jaw and decided that it didn't matter. So long as the factory existed, it was a clear threat to everypony in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would not show restraint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she started to focus and gather her magic, however, a child-like voice chimed, \"<i>I see you!</i>\" A flying turret had spotted her, but before it could fire, she quickly grabbed it with her mind and smashed it against the wall. Too late to stop it from sending an alarm message, however, as a thick metal door suddenly slammed shut behind her, blocking her exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess braced herself, expecting the mechanical monstrosities surrounding her to spring to life in the thousands. What she did not expect, however, was the multiple tons of metal that slammed down onto the floor in front of her! She nearly lost her footing due to the impact, her mouth hanging open as she saw the new machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuilt in the shape of a huge alicorn, this machine didn't share the sleek, almost anorexic design of GLaDOS's combat frame. Instead, it was twice the princesses own impressive height, and easily four times her girth, its wings looking cartoonishly tiny on its massive frame. If there was any doubt whatsoever what GLaDOS's intent had been in creating such a thing, that vanished the instant Celestia saw the crown welded to its head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRearing up, the princess-bot let out a deep, dim-witted sounding whinny and brayed, \"<i>I'm da princess! I'mma gonna eatcha!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Subtle, GLaDOS,\" Celestia replied sardonically. She cast a quick burst of concentrated light and energy at the center of the mechanical mockery, only to barely budge it as the blast was absorbed by its thick armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Haw haw! You can't hurt da princess,</i>\" it brayed, flapping its tiny wings as a jet of flame erupted from its ample posterior, causing the princess-bot to rocket toward Celestia at astonishing speed for something of its size and mass! Celestia's first reflex was to jump over it assisted by her wings, but that instinct betrayed her as her wounded wing failed to give her enough lift. As it was, instead of being slammed by the full force of the enormous robot, it clipped her and sent her tumbling back down to the cold metal floor!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the princess-bot zoomed and banked around the facility, it turned its head to keep locked onto Celestia, horn and crown glowing with energy before unleashing an energy beam at the alicorn! She just barely had time to push herself back with the strength of her good wing, then had to keep moving in order to stay just ahead of the deadly blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for Celestia, the princess-bot wasn't able to make sharp turns, and attacked by attempting to dive-bomb the alicorn or fire broad, sweeping arcs with its energy beam. Unfortunately, it was too fast and sturdy to attack directly, and the constant harassment kept her from focusing on a spell that would finish it. As she watched it, however, Celestia noticed something about its cartoonish design besides the obviously intended insult to her own physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wings which flapped rapidly while the princess-bot was aloft were clearly too small to actually assist in its flight. When she got a chance to look carefully, however, she noticed what looked like some sort of ventilation grill just behind them. As it banked in a wide arc to make another attack run, Celestia lined herself up. Assuming that if there was a structural weakness it would likely be there, she took careful aim and unleashed a volley of those light burst spells, homing in on the vents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot all of the blasts struck true, several simply bouncing off of the princess-bot's armor, but the ones that hit their target blew apart its air-intake and cooling system, causing the princess-bot's flaming plot to flicker and sputter out, its body arcing toward the ground as it quickly lost altitude. With a cry of \"<i>I'M HUNNNNGRYYYY</i>,\" it smashed into the factory floor and exploded in an impressive ignition of jet fuel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, Celestia looked around for signs of further interruptions. When none showed immediately, she mused, \"I think that GLaDOS needs a reminder of who commands the sun in this world,\" and her horn glowed brightly. And brighter. And brighter. And brighter still. Without the safety of any other living being to be concerned with, the princess drew upon the power and fury of the sun itself. The nearest conveyor belts and clutches of turrets all began to melt as she wreathed herself in celestial fire, concentrating it around herself and feeding ever more energy into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only reason why the princess was not herself consumed by it was because, as the bringer of the day, her own magic and essence were innately attuned to it. Something that nothing else in Equestria, or at least nothing else in the room with her, could claim as she decided that she had gathered enough power, straining even her ability to control it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she let it go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the aftermath of the blast, Celestia looked down upon the smoking crater that was left behind. A few bits and scraps still remained, but not in any sort of usable condition. She had used up an incredible amount of magical power in order to do it, greatly weakening her, but she smiled and had no doubt that it had been worth the cost. Turning back to the now-melted door from which she had come, she limped her way back toward the tunnels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Note: This chapter is connected to another thread.

Taking a moment to orient herself, Luna looked around, and spotted something: a smoking ruined part of the area marked with once-white panels. A quick scan revealed that the area had been wrecked by Nyx's magic. And what an amount of magic it was! Luna gulped; the young alicorn had regained a lot of power over the years, but had it been more than she'd let on? Either way, Luna was no longer confident that she could subdue Nyx in the event such an action became necessary. Nyx was being driven by unbridled rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As she thought about this, a tremor ran through the area, sounding like it came from near where they had been.

They saw a black, winged shaped fly into a smoking hole in another section of white panels. Seconds later, a familiar voice boomed throughout the facility. <font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">\"<i><b>GLADOS!!!!!</b></i>\"</font> Nyx's voice roared, rage underlying every letter. \"<i><b>YOU ARE A DEAD MARE!!!</b></i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Everypony cringed at the normally kind teenager's voice. \"Call me crazy,\" Vinyl Scratch said, \"but I think she already did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Luna looked at the hole Nyx had flown into. \"Hm... this will be a tight fit, but I think I can fit everypony in there.\" She began to work her magic, but was forced to change the spell into a barrier as a set of turrets flew down and opened fire on the group. \"Lauren's mane, they couldn't have picked worse timing!\" she swore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Despite the situation, Applejack blinked at looked at Luna oddly. \"Uh, who's Lauren?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"She is the mother to both Celestia and myself. Long story,\" Luna explained. \"Do these things ever run out of ammo?\" she added, as the turrets' barrage continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not that I'm aware of,\" Rarity answered. \"Perhaps Spell Nexus here could disable them again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Spell Nexus grimaced. \"Unfortunately, they're flying outside of my spell's optimum range. There's no guarantee I'd be able to make the spell stick. Perhaps Madame Scratch could use her sonic weapon again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vinyl chuckled nervously. \"Ah-heh. My Bass Cannon has a thirty-minute cooldown. It's been about ten since I used it to clear out those turrets in the alcoves. And I doubt Princess Luna wants to spend twenty minutes holding up a barrier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Indeed not,\" Luna deadpanned, already feeling the strain. Outside, she could tell that dawn was approaching, and thus her own powers were beginning to wane slightly. \"I suggest somepony think of something, and quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As it turned out, they needn't have worried. A red laser lanced out from the hole Nyx had made, neatly severing the propellers the turrets were using to stay aloft. With cries of <span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"No hard feelings,\"</span> the turrets fell past the catwalks, to smash against the cavern floor below. Everypony blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finally, Ditzy broke the silence. \"Um... we can... go after Nyx now... right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Luna shook herself slightly. \"Yes!

Now, where was I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pony in front of them certainly looked like Twilight. The differences being a slightly shorter mane and tail and what she was wearing. On her hooves were a set of boots much like those worn by Chell, but without the portal emitters. On her back was what looked lot a white set of curved saddlebags with a pair of portal emitters. Her head included some sort of illuminated headset and the portal emitters on her sides changed direction to match the movements of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me start again.

One such finding was the ability to connect to an already-open portal in a parallel universe. It was through this that I ended up finding and rescuing you from what looked like a very dangerous situation by using an overpowered excursion funnel to pull you through the portal to my universe.\" Twilight paused for a moment before adding \"Although, I must admit that yours is the first parallel universe we've found with ponies as the main form of intelligent life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx and the captain just stood there with mouths agape.

Outside of historical reenactments, nopony has worn armour like that for about two hundred years. For its weight, it simply doesn't provide enough protection against a bullet. Oh, sure, it would slow one down, but it would still be travelling fast enough to at least severely injure you, if not outright kill you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I suppose your armour would protect against one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly. Our armour is constructed from multiple layers of durable polymer fabrics impregnated with a shear-thickening fluid and incorporating a weave of electrically and magically conducive meshes to protect the wearer against electrical and moderately powerful magical attacks, all the while minimising weight to maximise manoeuvrability.\" Twilight blinked for a moment, then facehoofed. \"Ugh. I was right. I did spend too much time reading over Aperture Science product release drafts this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was met by three amused looks from the visiting ponies.

Who's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know the story? Well, the short version is that about a thousand years ago, the day princess went mad, turned evil, and tried to make the day last forever out of some twisted sense of being motherly to her kingdom. After failing to talk sense into her, the night princess used the Elements of Harmony to banish her to the sun for a thousand years, and taking on both duties herself. In 2010, Corona Blaze returned and a band of six ponies, of which I was a part, tracked down the Elements of Harmony and used them to clean the corruption from her, returning the normal cycle of day and night and restoring Princess Luna's sister, Celestia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, that's the Nightmare Moon story with the princesses swapped,\" remarked Nyx.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can tell me about it while we wait for Princess Luna to reply,\" said Twilight. \"Please be quiet while I'm dictating. The computer is easily confused by multiple speakers and I'd rather not have to do more editing than necessary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight made a series of whistles and clicks then started speaking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Princess Luna, comma, new paragraph.

Twiley, are you <i>crazy?!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight shifted on her hooves, shaking her head in confusion at what she perceived as a trick question. Her saddle-mounted portal devices swiveled and whirred as they followed along. \"Of course I'm not crazy! I had my adrenaline and endorphin systems contracted to only activate when I need them to. They haven't needed activation in over three weeks, so I am at complete control of all of my mental functions.\" She stomped a hoof for added emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining Armor was starting to get extremely edgy. \"We need to go back, <i>now</i>. No time for dilly-dallying!\" Shining tried to jump towards the still open portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight grabbed him, keeping the struggling stallion away from the opening. \"Oh, stop that, there's nothing to worry about! It took us almost a day of deliberation and debate before we decided to step in and save you. And that's all <i>after</i> you opened the portals in your Universe.\" Twilight shook her head. \"Boy, you Alts are completely backwards in arcano-tech, aren't you? I guess I can't say I'm surprised to hear that your GLaDOS is from a different reality than that of your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining stopped struggling as he tried to grasp what his sister's Alt was saying. \"So... it took you a full day to save us... in the blink of an eye?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it only took me around Zero-Point-Five-Oh-Five seconds to pull you through the portal. It took us a full Twenty-three hours to decide whether or not we should. It would have been longer if Pinkie's subatomic horoscope initialization contracts hadn't started acting up. That's what finally swayed Rainbow Dash to agree to my saving you.\" Twilight looked away, biting her lip. \"Dash doesn't like it when we get involved with Alts, because we can sometimes alter their timelines terribly, but if I hadn't intervened, none of you would have lived. None of my calculations gave you even a hope of living, unless you used an unprepared teleport.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChell hastily scribbled on her notepad, before holding it out for Twilight to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight smiled, a bit relieved at the change of subject. \"No, we don't know how to control time. It's just that time does not flow symmetrically in all universes. There can be universes and new realities that spring into existence and reach the pinnacle of industry in mere hours, while any outsider looking in on that reality would say it took a millennium. To put it simply, time is relative, depending on distance and space.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChell nodded, seeming content with that answer. Nyx had a question of her own. \"So, now that we all have a basic understanding of time flux and flow, can I ask a different question?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight nodded. \"Sure. Ask away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Spike?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spike?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you know; Spike! He's a dragon! He lives with us back in our universe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, huh. Dragons have actually been extinct for quite some time in this Universe; The Goddess of Strife, Eris, saw to that. But that's funny you should say that. The computer software used to send text via voice is called Dragon. I guess it'd be neat to have it activate or respond to a name, instead of a series of clicks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx smiles sadly, <i>no dragons?</i> \"Well, my Twilight would always say 'Spike, take a letter' when she wanted to send a friendship report to the Princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight hummed. \"Yeah, I like the sound of that. Probably easier to say with a sore throat than-\" she makes another sequence of clicking sounds, followed by a small chirrup. Nyx just nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight looked over at Shining Armor, who looked away uncomfortably. \"I'm sorry, soldier, did you have a question?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining scuffed a hoof against the ground. \"Well... you said you were one of the ones who voted for our survival. Why? You said yourself that you usually don't put yourselves in harms way when Alts are concerned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's ears flicked back. \"There... might have been a bit of a personal reason...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... you look kinda, sorta, like my brother... Oh, I know it's foalish, don't laugh at me!\" Twilight covered her head with her forehooves, her scarlet cheeks still visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least we know that I have an Alt here, then. Thank you, Twiley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Had an Alt. He... he died a few years back, the first time GlaDOS...\" Twilight took a shuddering breath, letting it out slowly. \"I'm okay. I... I was only a filly, but Cadance... she took care of me, and then I had my friends... He would've been proud, I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I may not be him, but as Captain of the Royal Guard, maybe not of this universe, but I am still proud to see my Alt's younger sister do what she can to save others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, that means a lot... brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're my LSBFF, no matter <i>what</i> universe you're from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith everypony more at ease than before, they tried to think of a good way to pass the three hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I want to see the testing facilities,' Chell wrote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to see the Guard barracks, and maybe train with them for a while,\" Shining stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kinda just want to learn more about the technology we'll be dealing with while fighting GLaDOS.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight nodded. \"Then you should go on the tour with Chell, but first...\" Twilight makes a chirruping noise to her computer (\"yeah, I'm gonna need to program the voice activation, that'll be much easier\") \"Process guest: Orange, female Earth Pony, diagnostics. Treat substantial wounds.\" Twilight turned to Chell. \"This will more than likely hurt. Badly.\" Chell nodded as a few robotic arms dropped down around her, poking at her and injecting strange serums into her. She winced, but otherwise held still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the robots were done, Chell looked as good as new; even her limp was gone. Chell nodded in thanks, a grateful smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! Now, you all have things you want to do, so what should we do first?\"</span></div></div>",

Regarding Chell and Shining Armor, she replied, \"I'm afraid you two aren't very familiar...\" She then turned toward Nyx. \"... and you look almost exactly like the avatar Princess Luna used when she was the hacker terrorist, Cyber Moon, at least before my friends and I were able to reformat her. Oh, and don't worry about getting that stigma attached to you here. Those of us working with alternate universes know just how differently events can play out from one timeline to the next, even when counterparts are present, so as long as we all get along, there's no problem. Still, you <i>do</i> look just like that avatar... Are you connected in some way to Princess Luna?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... could say we're related...\" Nyx replied, still stunned by what she was seeing and hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChell, on the other hoof, was taking it in with almost startling ease. Scribbling furiously on her notepad, the next one asked, \"And you work for Aperture? Who is in charge of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlt-Twilight nodded. \"Well, that's a bit of a history lesson, but I'll try to keep it brief. Decades ago, Aperture was founded by a brilliant but frankly insane stallion who created some amazing things, but drove the company into the ground and eventually died of moon dust poisoning. The last thing he did before he died was have the mind of his secretary put into the cyber-construct GLaDOS, who, along with the new ownership, rebuilt Aperture Science. Unfortunately, the new owners either didn't realize or care that GLaDOS had the personality of a living being, so any time she was 'disagreeable', they created a patch or 'upgrade' to try to make her more compliant. Over time, this drove her bitter and insane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChell grimaced and wrote, \"That sounds like my version. How did you deal with her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't easy...\" Alt-Twilight replied. \"After she killed the executives and most of her 'test subjects', she began sending her machines to ponynap nearby settlements. Princess Celestia herself led the fight to recover them, but it was still a terrible battle. Eventually, GLaDOS's personality core was severed from the network, and anyone connected to Aperture who was still alive was put on trial for gross incompetence. GLaDOS herself, being a self-aware AI, faced the ponycide charges, but because of the extensive patching, it couldn't be determined how much of it was her own will, and how much was the fault of the programmers. Currently, she's held in a closed system while our own programmers try to figure out how to reformat her. Meanwhile, Aperture Science and its assets are now owned by the royal government.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShining Armor spoke up softly, asking, \"And... what about you, Twilight? Do you have any family? ... Siblings? Children?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlt-Twilight blinked in surprise, not having expected the questions to become directed at her personally. Hanging her head a little, she shook it slowly and replied, \"Family? No, in this world...</span></div></div>",

Don't worry, we'll send you back after--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, wait wait.\" Nyx shook her head. \"Back where we come from, GLaDOS just came back. We need to go deal with her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what? How could GLaDOS come back?\" Twilight gave Shining Armor a pointed look. \"Didn't you keep an eye on her after you captured her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... we never captured her.\" Shining gestured to Chell. \"This pony actually pretty much blew her up singlehoofed, her and the entire facility. We thought she was dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unicorn stared at Chell, who returned the look with a simple confirming nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't even native to our reality,\" Shining Armor added. \"The facility, I mean. Whole thing was dropped in a lake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And sometime after that a mad cult tried to resurrect Nightmare Moon and they got a scared filly instead,\" Nyx added, gesturing to herself. \"And then Twilight--your alt, sorry--took me in and raised me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And the Cutie Mark Crusaders have their cutie marks.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....okay, that one I can believe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Also my cutie marks are functioning portals.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx shook her head, barely containing her laughter. \"All right, that's enough of that.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Approaching the unknown stallion, Nyx looked him over. She was pretty sure that he wasn't a new arrival in Ponyville, or Pinkie Pie would have thrown a welcoming party. But if not, then where had he come from? She reached out and gently nudged him with a hoof. This caused the stranger to stir where he lay, groaning and rubbing his head as he hesitantly stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you alright?\" Nyx asked as the stallion tried to get his bearings. \"Who are you? Do you need any help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grey stallion, becoming aware of the alicorn's presence, glanced up at her. \"Y-yeah...\" He then looked down at his hooves, then back at her a few times for some reason before letting out a breath. \"Oh, thank God I made it... you're Nyx, aren't you? Come on, we have to hurry! I could only buy us a little time!\" With that, he made his way toward the door, stumbling over his own hooves a little before he got his balance back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx, greatly confused, particularly by what he said about buying time. She followed him out to the hall, asking, \"What are you talking about? Who ARE you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stranger found a box of tools Apple Bloom had borrowed from various sources to help with the reconstruction of the castle. In it was a nail gun, a recently invented tool enchanted so that even ponies without magic could simply shoot nails into the wood at a quicker pace that it would take to hammer each one. \"Perfect,\" he muttered, picking it up with his mouth and putting it into one of the pockets of his flannel shirt before replying, \"Yeah, I didn't look like this the last time you saw me. I'm Alan Wake, the writer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to hurry out of the castle, but he glanced back and the utter lack of recognition expressed on Nyx's face made him turn back toward her. \"You DO remember me, right? You should still be able to remember the Dark Place. How you, me and Zane brought Twilight Sparkle back to life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx was even more confused. She had no idea who this pony was or how he claimed to know her. Unless the 'Dark Place' was supposed to be a metaphor or something, she'd never been there. And 'Alan Wake' and 'Zane' were such unusual names for ponies that she felt she would have remembered them if she had ever met them before, yet at the same time, this stallion acted as if they should know each other. When he brought up Twilight, however, her confusion turned into fuel for anger as she narrowed her eyes and suddenly reached out with her magic to lift him up off the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back to life? What's that supposed to mean?! Did you do something to my mom?!\" She snapped at him, shaking him up and down in the air, causing the contents of his pockets to slip out. Along with the nailgun, a flashlight fell out, followed by several sheets of typewritten paper that he tried to snatch out of the air before they fluttered to the ground, only to ineffectually bat them with his hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No, we were able to save her, remember? You gave up the last thousand years of your life to bring her back and pull everyone out of the Dark Place! Think back! I'm the one who gave you to her by putting you on that lakeshore! I wrote you a happy ending! Now you're the only ones who can help me against Mr. ****.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx blinked and rubbed her ear. \"Mr. what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. ****.\" She thought that he had said 'scratch' just then, and was pretty sure that's what her ears heard, but it was like something in her brain refused to process it. Like there was something so inherently wrong with the word that she instead heard it as the scratching of a vinyl record at one of DJ Pon-3's raves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx's turquoise eyes flashed with deepening suspicion and anger at the stallion's insane claims and bizarre linguistic trick. She shook him around harder with her magic until he stopped shouting, then pulled him closer so she could glare him right in the eye. \"Listen here, 'Alan', I don't know who you think you are, or what kind of crazy nonsense you're talking about, but my mom and I are NOT characters in whatever story you're writing. Start telling me something that makes sense, or I'm throwing you in the dungeon until the Ponyville authorities come to figure out what to do with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan, dazed from being shaken around, replied, \"Dungeon...? This is the princesses' vacation home, isn't it? That's nowhere near Ponyville...\" He looked around, though, real dread beginning to creep into his expression. \"No... no, this isn't, is it? Oh no... he tricked me. I'm in the wrong story!\"</span></div></div>",

He was crazy, sure, but at least he didn't seem dangerous. He'd quieted down, and as long as she kept an eye on him, Nyx was sure that she could keep him from getting himself into trouble. At least until they got back to Ponyville.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan, for his part, hung his head and quietly berated himself for being so stupid. He had panicked. Acted too hastily. And this was the price that he had to pay for his impatience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It had been a long, grueling battle against the forces of his evil doppelganger, Mr. ****, but Alan had won. He had escaped the time loop Mr. **** had trapped him in, and Alan knew that he had nearly pulled himself out of the depths of the Dark Place. Standing in the light of a beautiful dawn, he was reunited with his wife once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs strange as it seemed to think back on, Wake owed a great deal of that moment to the inhabitants of another world. One bizarre and even ridiculous by the standards of his own, and he had been manipulated into giving the Dark Presence a foothold there. Yet no matter how silly the land of Equestria and its colorful pony inhabitants would have seemed to him before he wrote that tale, \"Creeping Darkness\", it was they who had given him the strength of heart to truly believe once again that a happy ending was possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore that point, he had been drifting in the Dark Place, held back by his fears that all his efforts would prove futile. Without that guiding light of hope, he would have been worn down Mr. ****'s trap, and his psychotic double would have permanently taken his place in the real world. Instead, with the memories of Twilight Sparkle, Nyx, and the other ponies of Equestria to push him on, and the love for his wife Alice to pull him up out of the abyss, he had turned his enemy's trap against him. Bit by bit, he was able to put things right until finally, he watched Mr. **** dissolve in the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his lips tenderly touched those of his wife, he knew that it still wasn't quite real, but it was closer than he had ever gotten before. Even if that moment of reunion was merely a dream, the connection was true. The barrier separating that wonderful dream from reality was no thicker than a soap bubble, and all it would take was one last push to break free of his dark prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the channel changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well isn't this all just SO touching?\" An all too familiar voice whispered in the back of his mind. It was his own, but dripping with venomous sarcasm. Alan froze, prompting Alice to ask what was wrong, but he couldn't answer. He had won, or at least never been so close. But even though he kept embracing Alice, it felt as though he was drifting away from her again while the voice of his evil twin grew stronger, accompanied by a mocking clap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bravo. I say bra-VO. You've gone and written yourself an ending. A weak Deus Ex Machina ending loaded with cheap sentimentality, but hey, by YOUR standards, it's practically a masterpiece. I'll try not to hold it against you that you stole my life to get it. After all... I've found a new one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan clenched his eyes shut, clinging tightly to Alice as if to anchor himself against Mr. ****'s words, but he had to open them again when his double finished speaking. When he did, he saw a table where a television, powered by a small portable generator, sat next to an old typewriter. On the screen, in bright, colorful 2-D animation, was Equestria. He had never had a chance to see it in the daylight before, but there was no doubt of where the cartoon was set, as Mr. **** looked out at Alan through the screen... as a pony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObjectively, it should have been ridiculous. Laughable, even. Seeing his nemesis as a cute little equine, identical to how he had appeared when he wrote himself into \"Creeping Darkness\"--albeit with slicked-back hair and a dapper--suit should have been the least threatening thing in the world. It would have been, but Alan knew what Mr. **** was. Alan knew what he would do to Equestria. Mr. **** was his dark mirror, manifesting every nasty rumor born from Alan's own history of belligerence and distilling it into a psychotic murderer who, human or pony, wore his face. When Alan used the light to burn Mr. **** out of his own world so that he could reclaim his life, he hadn't even thought that his connection to that magical world might have given Mr. **** a foothold there as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a creepy smirk, Mr. **** leaned in close to the camera. \"You know, I really have to thank you for not destroying this place when you had the chance. A world THIS retarded and saccharine deserves the attention of someone with a little more flair than you could ever produce. I mean really? REALLY? Your big champion in this world was a purple unicorn named Twilight Sparkle? The fact that you haven't slit your wrists in shame over that alone says so much more about you than even I thought, but don't you worry. Once I figure out how to hold a knife with these stupid hooves, I'm going to be sure to have some extra special fun with her and that little Mary Sue 'daughter' of hers. You and Alice enjoy your reunion... I'll enjoy mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Mr. **** reached for the power button of his camera, and the television went dead. Alan grit his teeth in frustration, letting out a cry of \"DAMMIT!\" He reluctantly held Alice at arm's length, looking down at the ground. \"I'm sorry, Alice... I'm so sorry, but I can't come back to you yet...\" His wife, so close yet a million miles away, looked confused and distressed as she had not seen Mr. ****. That had been a message for Alan alone. \"I don't have time to explain everything,\" he said, \"but there's someone I have to stop. Pon-... people who don't have any idea what sort of danger they're in, and right now I'm the only one who can warn them. But I made it this far... got this close to coming back to you. I swear, Alice, I WILL come back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't know how much of that she heard, though. He saw her lips move to say something, but the sound was faint and muffled, as though heard through several feet of water. She was getting farther away from him... or rather, he was drifting away from her as he slowly sank back into the Dark Place, where his words would have the power to reach Equestria. She slowly vanished from his sight, leaving Alan alone with the typewriter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan took a seat in front of the device. He knew that it was a double-edged sword. Simply the act of using it would require him to pay a price. At that very moment, he was sacrificing the progress he had made in exchange for a chance to save a world far more innocent than his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what could he write? The Dark Place would require a horror story from him. Worse, it would be a sequel. The stakes would be even higher than they were with \"Creeping Darkness\". At that time, the Dark Presence had acted through a denizen of Equestria. Nightmare Moon had been a monster, made even moreso by becoming the Dark Presence's vessel, but she had been consistent with the tone of that world. Mr. **** was a vicious, sadistic killer. An out-of-context villain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgainst Nightmare Moon, they had been able to create an ending in which no pony was harmed. The Dark Place would not allow them to get off so lightly a second time. As Alan's fingertips hovered above the typewriter's keys, he knew that if he wrote this story, he would be unable to do so without ponies dying. Equestria and its inhabitants would be stained one way or another, which was certainly Mr. ****'s intention in the first place. Another trap... to force Alan to either watch helplessly while Mr. **** had his way, or have him take action and pay for it by sacrificing innocent victims with his words the way he had in Bright Falls with the story \"Departure\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan thought frantically. There HAD to be something else that he could barter. Some other currency that the Dark Place would accept. Try as he might, though, he simply couldn't think of any means to wrest control of the story from Mr. **** without costing some pony their life...  Control. Control was the issue. What if he were to relinquish the control that his writing gave him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had always written himself into the story, in order to fight the Dark Presence before, but only after preparations had been made. Without his input, the Dark Presence would fill in the blanks to give itself the advantage. To go in without a plan or outline was the ultimate gamble, but the inhabitants of Equestria had given him hope once before. It was just a feeling, but he felt that the only acceptable course was to trust in them once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan Wake began to type. Not the pages that he usually usually used to lay the groundwork for his trials, but simply a few paragraphs to arrange for his arrival. As a sequel, the best choice for a protagonist was Nyx, the purified form of Nightmare Moon. He would meet her once again, not as a filly but as a powerful young mare, trying to find her place in the world. The reformed villain versus a new, more terrible evil. It was the best that he could come up with on such short notice, and as he felt himself undergo the painful transition of traveling between worlds, he prayed it would be enough.</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Alan walked along the path he sighed, having gathered his thoughts. He didn't know how or why he was in this world, different yet so nearly identical to the Equestria he had visited before. It might have had something to do with his lack of scene-setting before inserting himself into it, but his gut said no. It was almost certainly a trap laid by Mr. ****, but as little detail as he had gone into, he had still written himself into the story in pursuit of his psychotic doppelganger. Mr. **** was here somewhere, and it was only a matter of time before he made his move. That was why Alan had written himself to appear in the middle of the day, to give himself a few precious hours of preparation before nightfall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back over his shoulder at Nyx, he said, \"Look, I'm... I'm sorry I freaked you out with all those things I said. I was confused, and I got you mixed up with someone I knew before, so I can't blame you for thinking I'm crazy. I <i>need</i> you to believe me about this, though. There's a man... er... pony named Mr. ****, and he may be the most dangerous thing you've ever seen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\" Nyx raised a skeptical eyebrow, having faced Scorpios, Hydras, and a Lupus Major. And for a time, she'd <i>been</i> the most dangerous thing she'd ever seen. Plus, she had doubts that this Mr. **** even existed, no matter what Alan did to cause that bizarre scratching sound in her brain whenever he said that name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDead serious, he stopped in the path and turned around to firmly state, \"I mean it, Nyx. The whole reason I'm here is to stop him before he does irreparable harm to this place. He's a creature of pure--\" Alan stopped in mid-sentence as the light of day grew dim. And though it could have just been a cloud passing by overhead, he looked over his shoulder at the sky only to have his worst fear realized. \"--Darkness...\" Where the sun had been high in the sky just minutes ago, it was now setting already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit, NO!\" he cried up at the sky. Likewise, Nyx's turquoise eyes went wide with surprise and worry. She knew that <i>she</i> wasn't causing the premature sunset, so why would Celestia and/or Luna do so? Alan slapped against his forehead and began berating himself again.  \"Stupid... STUPID! Why did I do that?! I should have known trying to give too much information too early would trigger this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could say anything else, Nyx pushed him down onto the dirt road and pinned him down with her forelegs. \"What do you mean?! Do you know what's causing this?\" she asked with an accusing glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... it's Mr. ****! It has to be, he's making his move earlier than I expected! I thought that I might be able to get here early enough to warn princess Celestia not to let the sun set, but that just made the darkness act sooner. Mr. **** must have caught the princesses off guard somehow, and now he's bringing the night.\"  He pointed a hoof toward the rapidly dwindling golden rays of sunset. \"Once it's dark, every pony that isn't in the light is going to be in danger! We <i>have</i> to get to Ponyville NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx's heart and mind raced. She wanted to think that Alan was just crazy, considering how much he'd gotten wrong about her, but the simple fact was that the night shouldn't be falling so soon. And he sounded so certain and urgent that something horrible was going to happen, she couldn't help but start to grow fearful over what might happen to her friends and neighbors if, Celestia forbid, he was actually on to something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" she said, getting off of him. She then flipped the flashlight on with her magic and levitated it to him before pulling him up onto her back. He was heavy, but she was strong enough to carry a passenger as she spread her wings and launched herself down the path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nhe last bit of sunlight vanished over the horizon, and Nyx felt a chill as it felt like a wave of darkness rolled over the land like a dark wave. It wasn't just the absence of light, but rather something like a cold, oppressive fog that dimmed even the light of Luna's moon and stars. With Alan pointing the flashlight in front of her and her intimate knowledge of the path, though, she was able to twist and bank her way down the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the edge of Ponyville started to come into view, Nyx noticed that there was virtually no activity along the road like there should have been for that time of day. Even with the premature night, there should have been a few ponies caught out in it, still making their way home. Vague worry started to settle like a cold stone in the pit of her stomach as she wondered what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan had a far more concrete, and vastly more terrifying idea of what may have occurred, though he tried to hold onto some hope that it hadn't progressed that far yet. He panned the flashlight around from side to side, scanning the path until the beam fell upon a pony-shaped figure moving through the darkness. Nyx saw it too and banked toward the shape before he could warn her of the potential danger. Within moments, they were close enough for him to identify it as...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nyx landed near the pony to check on them once she got close enough, but Alan was prepared for something completely different. Hopping off of Nyx's back once she slowed down, he braced himself and focused the beam of the flashlight on the equine, ready to burn the shadows from it if it proved to be Taken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of recoiling from the light, however, the lavender pony caught in the beam just brought a hoof up to shield her eyes while the light glinted off of the tiara atop her head. \"Gah, who's there?! If you try to kidnap me, I'll scream so loud, the entire town'll hear it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Alan and Nyx were glad that at least it was another pony, but for Nyx it was tempered by recognition of WHICH young mare they had found as Alan moved the beam away so as not to blind her any more. With a groan, she asked, \"Diamond Tiara? What are YOU doing out here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Diamond Tiara's night vision gradually recovered, she recognized the alicorn's voice and accusingly snapped, \"Nyx?! I KNEW it! As soon as I saw the sun setting, I just KNEW you were behind it! I'm going to make sure everypony knows it, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to dash off back to town, but Nyx just facehoofed and used her magic to turn the snobby earth pony back around toward them. \"For Celestia's sake, Tiara, even if I wanted to, I'm nowhere near strong enough to move the sun and moon anymore. I'm just as confused as you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's right,\" Alan said, taking the opportunity to put the flashlight in a pocket of his flannel shirt so that the beam would shine out in front of him and leave his mouth free. \"I've been with her the whole time. This is the work of someone else, and as long as we're out here in the darkness, we're all in danger. We need to get into the light, and make sure every pony we can find does the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiamond Tiara looked at Alan suspiciously. \"I'm sorry, and you are... what... a lumberjack or something?\" she asked, though there was a quiver in her voice betraying her fear. With a haughty sniff, she added, \"You know what? I don't care if you're the king of the griffons, you two can do whatever you like! I'M going home and telling my daddy about this. Then you won't be able to make any excuses!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to move away again, and this time Nyx didn't try to stop her. As she did, however, the darkness seemed to deepen like a thick mist, and Alan burst into motion to chase after her as the darkness started to obscure their view of her. \"No! Wait, stick with us! There are Taken coming, and you don't have a light!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx followed Alan, and with narrowed eyes asked, \"What's a Taken?\" She soon got her answer, however, when she suddenly heard Diamond Tiara's scream pierce through the thick darkness! Her breath catching in her throat, the alicorn quickly summoned up a light spell around the tip of her horn to supplement the beam of Alan's flashlight, and this proved just enough to make the darkness spread apart and reveal a stallion wreathed in what looked almost like an aura of shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the ground, apparently knocked down by the shadowed pony, was Diamond Tiara, screaming in terror and pain as it pinned her down with a hoof. Nyx gasped in shock at the sight, but only for a moment as she instinctively launched herself at the creature... the Taken. Regardless of whether or not she and Diamond Tiara got along, she was still worth protecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she body-slammed the Taken, however, it barely flinched. Instead, <i>Nyx</i> was the one who recoiled in pain from the impact, the shadows surrounding the Taken protected it somehow, and burned even the teenaged alicorn to the touch. Nyx had heard about substances that were so cold that it felt like being burned if you touched them, but had never understood it until this moment. Those shadows didn't just absorb the light, it was as if they stole the life out of anyone who got too close, and Diamond Tiara was still pinned by the monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan immediately stepped up, however, and focused his flashlight on the Taken, causing it to recoil away from Nyx and Diamond Tiara as it tried to shield itself from the light. As Alan tightened the beam, the shadows protecting it started to burn away while he shouted, \"You need to burn away the darkness with light, Nyx! That's the only way to harm these things! Now quick, give me the nailgun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx, stunned as she was, nevertheless started to comply as it became clear that Alan actually <i>did</i> know what he was talking about where these creatures were concerned. Before she could use her magic to give it to him, however, there was a rustling in the grass as two more Taken suddenly appeared, lurching toward Diamond Tiara. They were already setting upon the wounded earth pony, reaching for her and giving Nyx precious little time to react.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Seeing the danger Diamond Tiara was in, Nyx didn't have time to think. She acted on pure reflex, dropping the nailgun to instead focus her magic on shining a beam of light on the two Taken before they could touch her foalhood rival, tightening the beam enough to force the monsters back away from her as Nyx advanced on them. Just as it was Alan's flashlight, the protective shadows emanating from them burned away, leaving them open as she drew close enough to spin around and deliver a powerful bucking kick that didn't just send one of them flying, but caused the thin pony-shaped shell the Taken wore to split open, exposing the darkness inside to the light where it rapidly burned away into nothingness!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiamond Tiara gasped at the sight. \"You... you killed him,\" she exclaimed in horror. Nyx herself was stunned as well, because she never meant to kill it. The Taken, whatever they were, looked just like real ponies. The thought of it gave the teenaged alicorn a cold chill in the pit of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's nothing <i>to</i> kill,\" Alan's voice refuted. He was still holding off his own Taken with the flashlight, but lacking the means to finish it off, he backed toward the discarded nailgun. \"They're nothing but fragments of the Dark Presence that just <i>look</i> like ponies!\" He had almost reached the tool when his flashlight suddenly flickered and dimmed enough that the Taken he had been blinding was no longer held at bay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Diamond Tiara suddenly screamed, \"<i>Nyx, look out!</i>\" The second of the Taken that had been coming for her reared up while Nyx was distracted, and was about to slam its hooves against her head!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx reflexively ducked, her horn glowing as she summoned a short blade of concentrated magic, thrusting it up into the Taken before it could bring its weight down on her! Instead of the weight of a dead pony falling down on her, however, it simply dissolved into embers and wisps of shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heart pounding in her chest, Nyx stood up and turned toward Alan, who was reaching for the nailgun while trying to fend off the Taken without the light. It was just out of his reach as the monster bore down on him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx's horn glowed as she cried out, \"Alan!\" A beam of light shot from her horn to push the Taken away, only for it to suddenly be stopped by a wall of darkness that seemed to erupt from the ground!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ah ahhhh,\" she heard Alan's voice say, but in a smug, sarcastic inflection she hadn't heard from the flannel-wearing pony. \"You only get to save one whiny little bitch in this scene, and you already made your choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wall of shadow receded a bit. Just enough for Nyx and Diamond Tiara to see Alan pinned down by the Taken on the other side, and another pony accompanying them. Smirking at Nyx through the darkness was an earth pony who looked identical to Alan, but with slicked-back hair and a sharp black suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan grunted, struggling to get free, but to no avail. \"Nyx! No matter what happens, keep the light-\" He was interrupted with a swift kick to the head from his doppelganger, causing him to pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph. What an idiot. Not being able to shut up is what got him into this mess in the first place.\" Alan's dark twin laughed cruelly as the Taken started dragging Alan away. With a cocky smirk, he turned to Nyx and said, \"Oh, by the way, I loved that bit with the sword. I'm a fan of blades, myself. Sometimes you want to go with blunt trauma for fun or expediency, but nothing puts a look of terror on someone's face quite like light gleaming off a sharp edge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx felt her throat go dry at the pony's words. \"You're the one he was talking about, aren't you...? You're Mr. ****. What did you do to the princesses?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. **** laughed and replied, \"Same thing I'm going to do to Wake, pretty much. I'll leave it to your imagination for now... after all, you'll find out for yourself soon enough. So long, Mary Sue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wall of darkness rose up one again, blocking her view of Mr. **** before it vanished, leaving nothing behind but Alan's flashlight and nailgun. Feeling weak and sick, Nyx walked over to the discarded items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was that...? <i>WHAT</i> was that?!\" Diamond Tiara was staring at the spot where Mr. **** had stood, her eyes wide and her voice cracking with near-hysteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, exactly...\" Nyx replied, hanging her head. \"Something horrible. Alan's the only pony who knows for sure, but he got taken away because I thought he was crazy and didn't listen...\" With her magic, she lifted up the flashlight and nailgun, floating them in front of Diamond Tiara. \"Here, take these.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiamond Tiara blinked, fear transitioning into indignation. \"What?! Why should I? You're the one who goes on and on about 'I'm a shield, meant to protect other ponies!' Well, <i>protect me!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will!\" Nyx snapped at the snobby mare, pushing the items against her insistently. \"But... I... I might not be able to! I might make a mistake! All I had to do was throw Alan the nailgun before saving you. It would've only taken a moment, and you could've both been safe... You should at least have something to defend yourself with in case I make another mistake...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiamond Tiara blinked again, but didn't really have a retort for that. In any other situation, seeing Nyx admitting fault or weakness would have given her an opening to snark at each other, but with genuine threats possibly lurking behind every shadow, it only served to make her think about how she was caught smack in the middle of this horrifying situation. The thought of not making it home, or getting back there only to find dark monsters seized her heart, and after a moment's hesitation she grasped for the tools.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the other pony worked out how she would hold both the light and the gun, Nyx thought frantically to herself. \"Okay, the princesses can't help us now... the Elements of Harmony will probably work! We can get to the library, and from there find the other Element bearers, then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Nyx was started from her thoughts by Diamond Tiara's sudden interjection. \"No, you're going to take me to my house!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiara, we need to think about how to save everypony. Twilight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... is <i>your</i> family! Well I have family too, and right now, all they know is I'm stuck out here in the dark where there are monsters roaming around! If we go to the library, you gather all her friends up and have your adventure to save the day, while my parents are at home scared out of their minds! Or worse, they get attacked without knowing how to protect themselves from those horrible Taken things!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Nyx was actually taken aback a bit. She was so used to Diamond Tiara being a spoiled, selfish brat that she had a hard time thinking that Tiara had a heart too, sometimes. But this argument hit especially close to home for the alicorn, because if there was only one thing that they could find any sort of common ground on, it was their love for their parents. She could imagine the Taken attacking the library, but at least Twilight had experience with monsters and adventures. She'd probably started taking precautions the instant the sun went down ahead of schedule. Tiara's parents, though, who could say how well they would deal with such a disaster? But at the same time, Twilight and the others were probably their best chance of defeating Mr. **** and resolving everything as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of thought, Nyx...</span></div></div>",

Letting out a relieved sigh, she ran toward them and cried out, \"Mommy! Daddy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Diamond?\" The shape with the voice of Filthy Rich looked up toward the sound of his daughter's voice, and he quickly moved to meet her. The father and daughter both stepped into the light between them at the same time, staring at each other for a moment before meeting in the middle for a loving embrace. \"Diamond! I'm so relieved you're alright!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx was a little stunned at the sight. That expression on Diamond Tiara's face... it had to be the first time that the alicorn had seen her childhood bully genuinely smiling without any meanness or smugness behind it. She almost didn't want to interrupt as she joined them under the light, which seemed to brighten even more. Still, she let them have a moment before she would remind them of the danger surrounding them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when she noticed that one pony wasn't joining them. \"Mrs. Rich, come over here into the light. It's not safe out there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of doing so, however, Diamond's mother shrieked, \"Darling, get away! It's a trick!

Of course it's me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweety, it's Diamond Tiara,\" Filthy Rich protested, looking at his daughter. \"I know our daughter, and she came to find us.\" Noticing Nyx's presence, he nodded gratefully to the alicorn. \"And you brought her here... thank you, Nyx.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, Diamond's mother exclaimed in a voice that chilled everypony present, \"It's a lie, darling! That monster is using the light to cast a spell on you! It isn't our daughter, it's one of those things, wrapped in some sort of illusion! Come back out of the light, and you'll see it for what it really is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiamond Tiara was the first to break the hug with her father, exclaiming, \"Mommy, it's really me! Look!\" She started to move toward her mother, but Nyx quickly put herself between them. \"Nyx, get your flank out of the way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Nyx replied firmly. \"Something's not right here...\" Turning her gaze out into the darkness, she lit up her horn and focused it into a beam of light, illuminating Diamond's mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare screamed in a voice that grew more and more distorted, and recoiled as though acid had been thrown on her. She quickly threw a foreleg up over her face as she staggered back, and the two earth ponies in the light gasped as they saw wisps of darkness leaking out of her mouth and eyes like smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Mom!</i>\" Diamond shrieked. Seeing her mother in such a state, she started slapping at Nyx. \"Stop it! You're hurting her!\" Her frightened blows weren't strong, but surprised her enough that the alicorn's beam flickered off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, something flew through the air overhead. It smashed into the street lamp's bulb, causing the area to be plunged into darkness once again. Immediately, the ponies found themselves surrounded by the sounds of Taken all around them, hulking shapes moving in the blackness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx choked for a moment, but then shouted, \"Everypony, get in the house! <i>Now</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFilthy Rich, surprised by the sudden appearance of so many Taken, nevertheless kept his wits about him enough to hurry for the house, pulling Diamond Tiara along with him. The young earth pony reached out toward her mother, screaming, \"No! We can't leave mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got her,\" Nyx shouted back, reaching out with her magic to pick Diamond's mother up off the ground before she had a chance to slip away into the darkness and mass of Taken. <i>Not again. Not if I can help it,</i> she thought, images of Alan Wake being stolen away by Mr. **** still fresh in her mind. Once she had her aura around the darkness-touched mare, she galloped after the earth ponies at full speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't the most dignified way to enter a house, but this was no time for dignity. She threw herself into the mansion like a black blur, the struggling mare held up right behind her as Diamond Tiara and Filthy Rich both slammed the doors shut and latched them as securely as they could once everypony was inside. Nyx panted a bit before snapping, \"Lights! Turn on every light you've got! Candles, lanterns, everything!\" She couldn't do much herself, focusing her attention and magic on keeping Diamond's mother restrained as the other two earth ponies quickly ran around, gathering up every source of illumination they could find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they were busy doing that, brightening the house enough to at least temporarily ward off the Taken, Diamond's mother screamed and thrashed around in the magical field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happened to her...?\" Filthy Rich asked, wincing whenever his wife let out a cry. \"What <i>are</i> those things? Were they... ponies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taken...\" Nyx replied. \"The pony who told me about them said they were like puppets animated by some sort of living darkness. But this...\" She looked Diamond's mother over very carefully. When she opened her eyes briefly, Nyx could see that behind the wisps of darkness were the eyes of a normal, terrified pony. A realization came to her that made a cold pit form in the stomachs of both her and Filthy Rich when she expressed it. \"This is almost like... the Blessing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then... you can cure her, right? The way you cured me?\" Filthy Rich asked tentatively while Diamond Tiara replaced the batteries in her flashlight and shone it outside the windows to ward off any remaining Taken that might be lurking just outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx admitted, \"I don't know... it's similar, but not exactly the same. This didn't come from me, so I don't know what might happen, but I can try... if you'll let me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiamond snapped, \"Don't you dare do anything that might hurt her, Nyx! Don't you dare!\" The earth pony's eyes watered with worry and grief at the sight of her mother in such a state, glaring at Nyx in a way that promised revenge if even the slightest thing went wrong. But Filthy Rich placed his hoof on her shoulder, causing her to look at him and calm down slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a nod to Nyx, the stallion said quietly, \"Do what you can... please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx nodded back, then took a deep breath to focus as she set Diamond's mother down on a sofa. \"It'll help if you hold her down.\"</span></div></div>",

With the two earth ponies' assistance, Nyx was able to let go of the struggling mare and focus her magic in a more precise, almost surgical way. Reaching out with her magic, she sent 'feelers' out into her patient's eyes and mouth where the wisps of darkness were emanating from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea was to draw out the dark magic from her, pulling it out like a weed much as she had when freeing her 'followers' from the Blessing. As she had told Filthy Rich, however, this was a very different case. Each Blessing had been a tiny fragment of her own power, eager to be pulled out of its victim if it meant being rejoined with the original. That had made it easy to reveal and destroy the corruption. This darkness, however, belonged to Mr. ***** and didn't want to obey her will. Instead, it retreated from her, burrowing deeply inside Mrs. Rich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeads of sweat started to form on Nyx's brow as she cast her magic deeper and deeper to follow the darkness. She didn't want to show it in front of the others, but she was afraid that she might not be able to remove the darkness without harming Mrs. Rich. Sensing it moving toward the mare's heart, she quickly focused her concentration. By putting more of her consciousness into the magic itself, she was able to increase its speed and precision, avoiding causing harm as she quickly moved to cut the darkness off before it could reach the center of Mrs. Rich's being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when the darkness that was already there sprang its ambush. Black tendrils lashed out from Mrs. Rich's heart, surrounding and ensnaring Nyx's own magic, pulling it and the alicorn's consciousness deeper and deeper away from the physical world, until Nyx found herself not in the Rich's mansion, but in a dark cabin. There was no light, but Nyx could nevertheless make out a few bookshelves, and a writing desk too tall for a normal pony, and a typewriter resting on it, though the characters on the keys didn't match Equestria's written language. A stack of blank paper was placed nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like that, Nyx?\" The smarmy voice of Mr. ***** chilled the alicorn as she spun around to face him. Nothing there. She turned back to the typewriter, only to suddenly find him standing up on his hind legs, leaning back with his forelegs on the desk. \"You know what it is? It's the most powerful weapon in the world. And that sentimental idiot Wake just gave it up, because he thought that it was the only way to give you four-legged jellybeans a chance of getting through this without losses. I'm gonna let you in on a little secret though, Nyxie. There was <i>never</i> a chance of that happening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx felt cold as Mr. ***** spoke. \"You're wrong,\" she replied with all the defiance she could muster. \"I don't know where you came from, or who you think you are, but as long as I live, I won't let you hurt anypony!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but you will,\" Mr. ***** replied with a bored shrug. \"Because those are the rules. That's the sort of story this is. Wake knew that, and that's why he left the typewriter. He gave up the ability to shape the course of this story, because he knew that if he used it, ponies would die. Sacrifices to appease the darkness just enough to let him write a win, delivered into the gaping maw of chaos by the very same 'hero' fighting to save the world!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flashed Nyx a toothy grin. \"Oh, you didn't know that, did you? Flannel-boy never told you that. Oh yes, he's a murderer like me. If you want to win, you have to be willing to lose sometimes. Equivalent exchange. Dramatic tension. You wouldn't believe how many people he murdered to get this far. The big difference between him and me is that he did it with words.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. ***** vanished, reappearing in a blink right in front of Nyx. He looked her straight in the eye, his own so much like Alan's. But while those eyes superficially resembled a pony's, Nyx could feel that they were just a thin veneer, and behind them was nothing but darkness and emptiness. \"So that brings us to you, Nyxie. Wake isn't the hero of this story anymore... you are. The ex-villain Mary Sue who's now fighting with all her pure pureness to save her world from eternal darkness and chaos. If that's the role you want to play, what are you willing to give up for it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx was startled and reared back. She tried to hit him with her hooves, but he vanished and reappeared elsewhere. \"I won't give anypony up,\" she exclaimed. \"You can't make me believe that's how this works!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you've already seen it,\" Mr. **** replied, avoiding a shock of magic lightning that sent the stack of paper exploding into smoldering sheets. \"Wake writes himself into the story to prepare you, and I take out your Deus Ex Machina princesses. (Speaking of which, <i>princesses</i>? Seriously? Queen it up, bitches!) Wake tries to tell you what's going on, and I kick things off early. You get faced with the choice to save one pony, and lose the other. And now you're trying to save another pony from my grip. What do you think'll happen if you succeed? Hmm... maybe a mom for a mom? You save the mother of someone you hate, and in exchange, your own gets dragged screaming into the darkness. What do you say? You willing to give up Twilight Sparkle to... God, just saying that name makes me want to vomit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Shut up!\"</b> Nyx shouted at Mr. ***** as she gathered her magic. \"Even if I believed you, my mother would never want me to sacrifice somepony else for her!\" Whatever this cabin was supposed to be, she still knew where it was. Whatever the source of it was, she was inside the darkness in Mrs. Rich's heart. Mr. *****, or at least the fragment of him controlling this darkness, was probably trying to distract her from the fact that it put her in the perfect position to do what she intended to. Her horn glowed brighter and brighter, filling the room with light and causing the writing room to start crumbling away as she attacked the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're making a mistaaaa-\" Mr. ***** shouted at her as the light pushed him against the walls, leaving him nowhere to vanish to as he dissolved before her eyes into so many embers. As the room vanished into white, she drove the shadows out and destroyed them by filling Mrs. Rich with light from the inside out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Nyx opened her real eyes again, finding herself back in the Rich's mansion, she heard...</span></div></div>",

Mrs/ Rich flopped gracelessly to the floor, her eyes staring at Nyx with unease, but also... thanks. Nyx gave her a small smile, and prepared to leave while the three fell into a heartwarming family hug. She opened the front door, and was just stepping out when Diamond broke away from her parents. \"Wait, Nyx...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx looked back. \"Yes, Tiara?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... What should we do, Nyx?\" Nyx's smile widened a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you can either hole up in here, and turn on- and keep on- every light in the house, or you can go out and help others who might need you. Silver Spoon could be suffering from the same thing as your mother, or she could be having her life stolen away like they were doing to you. It's not my choice to make, Tiara. It's yours and your family's. Thus town is prone to panic, and the panic and chaos that I <i>haven't</i> seen worries me just as much as the darkness. Just remember two things. Keep extra light bulbs at hoof, extra candles and matches nearby, and always have extra batteries for your flashlights.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx dropped down to Diamond Tiara's side and gave her a friendly nuzzle. \"The most important thing you need to do is protect yourself. Now, I need to go save my own mother, so she and I can work together.\" Nyx gave a nod to Diamond's parents before heading out, closing the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Filthy...\" Diamond looked towards her mother, whose voice had a hesitant tremble to it. \"You heard the mare, go find every battery you can. Diamond, grab all the flashlights you can find. I'll get... I'll get my frying pan. You get something to use as well, Filthy.\" She looked down, scuffing the floor. \"I've never been the best of pony, and the one pony I've possibly been the worst to just... j-just saved my life. I-It was s-so d-dark, a-and c-cold...\" She choked on her words as she shuddered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Extra. We'll get everything ready.\" Filthy moved off, his heart burning with a passionate fury. He'd always loved his wife, even when she was overbearing, but nothing- <i>nothing</i> put his family in danger without paying a price. Nyx had paid her debt in full, now he had a debt of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx alighted in front of the Library, its door bent and cracked but not broken, and only a single light coming from within. She hesitated a moment, before unlocking the door and stepping inside. What she saw was... \"S-spike?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption one: Spike's been Taken! Twilight's unconscious, but inside the flickering light from the candle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption two: Twilight's been Taken, but Spike is holding her down, his internal flame protecting him from the darkness as she writhes in pain from the flickering candlelight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n{I'd add an option three, where we follow the Rich's as they try to save their friends, but I can only do two choices.}</span></div></div>",

Oh, man, I don't know what's happening!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx closed the door behind her and latched it shut. \"It's okay, Spike, I just need to tell- MOM!!\" As her eyes adjusted to the dim candle light inside the library after the flame briefly blinded her, she saw Spike struggling to hold down Twilight Sparkle. The unicorn was snarling and thrashing against him as Spike held onto her with all his might. Wisps of darkness filtered out of her eyes and mouth like smoke. \"Mom...! Spike, when did this happen?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About five minutes ago! Some of those crazy ponies were trying to break the door down, so Twilight and I held it shut. I guess they gave up, but then this black cloud started flowing in!\" The baby dragon shivered as he remembered how cold it had been. Cold enough to chill him through his thick scales, and how it felt like it was going to extinguish his inner dragon fire. But he had heard Twilight struggling, and he used that fire to burn away the darkness, only to find her possessed as she currently was, trying to snuff out the candle. As thought back on the horrifying events, he almost lost control of Twilight, who nearly bucked him off before Nyx could think to help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Five minutes ago,</i> the alicorn thought to herself, the words playing themselves over and over again in her head. <i>If I had come straight to the library... if I hadn't taken the time to cure Diamond's mother... I could have been here to protect her...</i> In the back of her mind, she could hear Mr. ***** laughing at her. Mocking her foalish naivete. Worse was a dark little voice in her heart that agreed with him. Whispering to her that she shouldn't have bothered with the Riches. It was so much worse, because that voice was her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'm sorry... I got here as fast as I could...\" she stammered, even as that little voice in her head called her a liar. \"I can fix this!

Sit mom in front of it.\" She bit her lip, looking at Spike. \"... Tie her up if necessary.\" Spike snapped off a quick salute and started building up a good sized fire. Nyx went to see what the hay had landed in the library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leggo!\" She heard a voice. It seemed small, as if whispered, but clear like a shout. \"Get offa me!\" She turned to look behind the couch, and found Dash struggling against... Dash?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rainbow, are you okay?!\" Both pegasai looked up at her, before turning a scowl to each other. In tandem, the two said, in that quiet, faraway shout, \"Yeah! She's taken my shape! She won't stop bothering me! Stop that! Stop that! Stop that! Stop that! No, you!\" The two continued, and Nyx just focused the beam of her light spell on the both of them, each of them screaming out in agony as the light burned at the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen only one was left, looking weak and haggard, Nyx let the light spell dim before dragging the unconscious mare over by the fire. \"Spike, I think Rainbow's also been infected, or possessed, or whatever.

But she was Celestia's student. Princess Celestia was the Sun. Wasn't she? Wasn't the sun good? Celestia was good. No! She was bad. Evil Celestia. She used the sun to burn us, to make us uncomfortable. To make us work. Better to have darkness. Stay away from the light.

Yes, I don't need my wings. Flying without pain is better. But I'm not flying. Yes we are. We are flying fast. No. I am standing still, but not still. It's dark. I'm... Falling. Flying. Falling.

Cleansing. Refreshing. My wings flared as we flew into the light, and the pain dimmed.</i> \"Rainbow Dash!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hours. Minutes. Years. Nyx didn't know, but it was harrowing, trying to pull two ponies out of the darkness at once. \"Mom! Rainbow Dash!\" Nyx collapsed, panting, as the two mares started to stir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash was the first to open her eyes. \"Wha..?\" Nyx didn't let her finish, instead pulling her into a hug. Nyx's body heat wash over Dash, her on body freezing, and she shivered as she felt the tingling heat from the fire behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nyx...\" Nyx looked over at Twilight, her eyes brimming with tears of joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\" Nyx helped her mother, horribly weak as she was, to a more natural lying position so she could rest easier. \"Mom, don't worry. I stopped it. You're okay. Just rest, please.\" Twilight didn't have the strength to nod, but laid down her head, and was soon snoring softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash yawned, slumping aginst Nyx before the young Alicorn settled Dash next to Twilight, the pegasus almost instinctively wrapping the unicorn under a wing, the both of them shivering as they slept in the fire's light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spike, it's done, you can... Spike!\" Turning to look at Spike, Nyx's heart stopped cold. Spike was sitting there, a scroll made of darkness laying before him as he contorted before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-too... cold...\" Was all Spike could whisper before passing out. Nyx scooped up the dragon and, thinking erratically, threw him into the fire. The young dragon sighed almost peacefully, the few wisps of darkness surrounding him burning away as his body warmed. Nyx sighed a breath of relief, before looking at the letter. There was only one person who would send pure Darkness to serve as a message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. ****.</span></div></div>",

As stupid and childish as he found most of Equestria, the abilities different ponies possessed were constantly inspiring new ideas of how to use those he who had fallen under his control. With a nod of his head, he signaled for the mare to buck the cloud, dumping gallons of rainwater down the chimney. He chuckled darkly, muttering, \"Mine, now.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMere seconds after finishing the note, Nyx heard Spike gurgle as he and the warming fire were suddenly both drenched by buckets of water flooding down the chimney! Nyx's eyes flew open wide, quickly reaching out with her magic aura to pull the baby dragon away, only for it to be shoved away by a flood of dark miasma that poured into the library. The lights that were present flickered and dimmed, struggling to illuminate and ward off the darkness, but this was too concentrated. It was being directed, and Nyx knew by whom. She couldn't go out to confront the monster that was doing so, however, because she saw tendrils of the darkness reaching out to scoop up...</span></div></div>",

The party pony was covered head to hoof in Hearths Warming lights and glow sticks. The lights were plugged into her tail, which somehow seemed to be providing power for them. on her head was a miner's helmet, complete with a light that burned any and all Taken that the pink pony happened to look at. The party ponies weapon of choice appeared to be an electric lantern, which she smacked the taken with as if hitting them with a purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie grinned at Pinkie Pie. \"Trixie's fireworks, flare, and flash bang spells have never been more useful. Sparkle can eat her heart out; this time, Trixie saves the day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie pulled a road flare out of nowhere, lighting it and throwing it at the Taken, causing them retreat from the burning light. The party pony giggled at the sight. \"This is so much fun. We're like super heroes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx's mouth opened and shut itself repeatedly as she tried to form words, but the sight before her just refused to allow it. In the current blankness of her mind, the alicorn protector could hear Mr. ***** making equally confused noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently the ultimate root of all darkness hadn't counted on Trixie's ego or Pinkie's randomness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ponies quickly finished dispatching the Taken in the area, and noticed Nyx standing in the library doorway. Pinkie quickly ran over and glomped the stunned alicorn, hugging her tightly. \"Nyx! Your okay! Thank goodness, I was so worried about you!\" The pink pony let go of her. \"I was out...er...visiting with Trixie when the sky went dark, and all those mean shadowy pony-but-not-pony things came out and started attacking us. Fortunately I never go anywhere without lots of lights, incase there's a darkness emergency, and Trixie is really good at making things flash and go \"Kaboom\" because she's super amazing and talented and totally cute and...um...yeah, so, we've been running around trying to find somepony else, but we kept getting lost and going in circles, which is really weird since I know ponyville like the back of my hoof, and then we finally made it to the library and we found you, and maybe you or Twilight knows what's going on.\" Pinkie paused to gasp in an almost impossible amount of air before finishing. \"So, do ya know what's going on Nyx?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alicorn tried to answer, but Trixie cut her off. \"Speaking of Sparkle, where is she? Trixie thought for sure she'd be here with her nose buried in some book.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx lowered her head in shame. \"I...Mom was taken, by the thing that's controlling those dark creatures. Rainbow Dash too. It swept in here and took them away right after I'd managed to free them.\" Nyx filled them in on everything that had happened so far, up until they had appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, somepony needs to stay here with Spike and Peewee and keep them safe while the rest of us figure out how to stop all this nonsense and put everything back the way it was.\" The alicorn finished.

I'm glad she's nice now days, because somepony so super special and talented and cute should never act like a bully, or they'd be wasting all that super amazing spectacular talent and adorableness...\" Pinkie suddenly started getting quiet as a slight blush appeared on her face. \"...and um...er...Which way were we going again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx smiled, having noticed the party pony's behavior and recognizing it for what it was. \"I was thinking about heading to sweet apple acers to check on Applejack, Bloom, and Big Macintosh. They have two backup generators, but I want to make sure their fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, that sounds like a good plan. Let's go with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued trotting along, finally reaching the edge of the town before Nyx spoke again. \"So...you and Trixie, huh?

He felt groggy, cold, and he ached all over, but as the last few moments of his memory played themselves out, he took some small shred of comfort in being able to feel <i>anything</i>. He could feel the grain of wooden boards against his cheek, telling him that he was inside somewhere. He didn't feel like opening his eyes, however, until he heard child-like voices whimpering nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that sound caused him to push himself up and look around. What he found in front of him chilled the writer more than the preternatural cold that was all around him. He recognized his surroundings easily enough. The walls of the lake cabin where his nightmarish encounters with the Dark Place and its eldritch denizens began were all too familiar. The layout, however, was larger than he was used to, and walls were lined from floor to ceiling with black iron cages. Dozens of them, nearly half of which housed a pony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoung, old, male, female, every color in the rainbow and then some muted in the primordial darkness of their prison, they all tried to struggle against the bars. Only Alan was uncaged; a fact which drew the attention of those who were nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mister! Mister, please, let me out! I need to find my mommy,\" a young blonde unicorn mare with a purple coat pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say anything to this guy,\" a short, fat blue unicorn snapped, glaring at Alan with squinty eyes. \"I saw his face before! He's the one who took us in the first place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn adult purple earth pony spoke up in a feminine voice that was both maternal and very clearly trying not to crack under the pressure of the situation. \"Calm down, Snips, I saw that monster bring this pony in while you were unconscious.\" Turning her attention to Alan, she asked, \"Please, I don't know who you are, but you seem sane! You aren't like those monsters, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan shook his head as he looked around in shock. On the one hand, it was a relief to see so many of Ponyville's residents alive and not transformed into Taken, but the fact that they were <i>here</i> filled him with dread at whatever it was Mr. ***** had planned. \"No, I'm... I'm Alan Wake. I'm a writer,\" he replied, almost robotically as he hooked his hooves between the bars of Cheerilee's cage to test them. Trying to jostle the bars proved fruitless, however, as a closer look revealed that the cages weren't merely secure, but they didn't even have any hinges with which to open or close!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid that won't do much good, Mr. Wake,\" Alan heard a stallion tell him in an English accent. Turning his head to look, the writer saw a brown earth pony wearing a green tie and fiddling with some sort of wand. \"Big Macintosh nearly broke his legs trying to buck his way out before that 'Mr. *****' fellow came to take him away. If any pony could open these cages through brute physical force, it would have been him. My sonic isn't doing any better. I can't even determine what anything here is actually <i>made</i> of. Could it be...? Some sort of matter from a set of dimensions so alien that it can't be scanned even by my technology? Why, that would be fascinating if the one in charge weren't so obviously a raving psychopath by even the most charitable standards!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat chill that Alan had felt upon seeing the captive ponies burrowed even deeper into the writer's gut. He interrupted the stallion's mutterings by throwing himself against the bars of his cage. \"Taken away? You mean there were more ponies here who've been taken away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter jumping a little from Alan's sudden interruption, the stallion focused on Alan and replied, \"Oh, unfortunately, yes. I don't know where or for what purpose, but our captor arrives every so often to select a pony or two, and removes them from their cages. The last time he did so, I saw him use a black key to open Big Macintosh's cage. Rather than doing so in the usual way, he seemed to be able to will the bars to dissolve into smoke long enough for his minions to carry off the poor fellow. I'm afraid he was not the first, either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan nodded to the stallion. \"Alright... if I get that key, I can get everybody out. I'll be back as soon as I can!\" With that, he took off looking for a door. The room was even larger than he had thought before, however, a maze of cages housing not just the three types of ponies he was familiar with, but even more diverse creatures. Too many and too great a variety to have come from just Ponyville. Mr. ***** had clearly struck fast, and in many places throughout Equestria. Possibly even beyond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And I gave him the opportunity,</i> he thought to himself with bitter recrimination. <i>I may have written very little, but it was still a part of a horror story. That's the only kind the darkness will allow. The better the odds seem in the hero's favor, the farther they have to fall in order to maintain dramatic tension. Why did I let myself forget that? How could I have? I can only hope that Nyx is struggling... because if she isn't fighting with everything she's got, and there isn't always a good chance that it could end badly at any moment... then she'll lose. The Dark Place will exact its price...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuttering curses at himself for having the audacity to think that he could do things any differently from how he had always succeeded in fighting the darkness, Alan finally came across a door and pushed it open. Stepping through it, the author-turned-pony shielded his eyes as they were filled with a bright light for a moment. In truth, it wasn't all that bright and his eyes quickly adjusted to it, but as he saw what it was, even the dim glow of a low-powered desk lamp seemed like an island in the ocean of darkness that surrounded him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was more, that desk lamp was perched atop a writing table, its cone of light shining down on an antique typewriter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere it was... a weapon he could use. Even more than any flashlight or flare gun, the typewriter was the true outlet for his light. Through his creativity and understanding of how the story should play out, he would be able to write out a scenario that would allow him to free the captured ponies. Build the tension and keep things uncertain enough that when the climactic battle with Mr. ***** came to pass, the hero of the story would come out victorious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was entirely too enticing. The light shining on the typewriter was genuine. Creatures of darkness like Mr. ***** couldn't create light. It could only come from something pure. This was a genuine chance to take control of the story once again, and Alan knew that if he took it, he would be able to wield that influence against his doppelganger. But at what price? As it was, he didn't know how many ponies, if any, had actually fallen to Mr. *****. If he started to write, it was certain that there would be victims. With just a few sacrifices, he could set the conditions for a satisfying conclusion, but trying to avoid that fate had been his reason for relinquishing control in the first place. What would it matter, though, if because he refused to accept responsibility for the story, the entirety of Equestria fell into Mr. *****'s hooves?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't Mr. *****'s doing, but it was no less deadly. It could be Equestria'ss best hope for salvation, but it was also a trap...</span></div></div>",

He didn't seem to be too badly hurt, but his breathing was shallow and he had a nasty bruise over one eye in the shape of what looked like a hoofprint. As she looked the brown stallion over for other injuries, he suddenly gasped and opened his good eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Derpy! Hang on,\" he exclaimed, reaching out a hoof toward Nyx.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the Doctor's hoof with her own, Nyx looked him straight in the eye and tried to bring him back around. \"Doctor? Doctor, wake up! Der- I mean, Ditzy isn't here. She's doing her rounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor's one open eye slowly focused on Nyx, and he let out a deep breath. \"Oh, Nyx, thank goodness it's you! That means I'm back here... Wait, how did you get inside the Tardis?\" He looked around, soon realizing, \"Wait, this is the castle. That can't be right, the last thing I remember is... Oh, dear!\" The color drained from the stallion's face, and he shakily pushed himself upright, his legs wobbling. \"You said that Derpy is delivering the mail? Have Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle already left Ponyville?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx tilted her head in confusion and concern. \"Yeah... remember? You were there with Dinky Doo just this morning, waving them off. This isn't good... you should probably let Nurse Redheart take a look at that hit to the head you took.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor was only barely listening to her, though, if at all. He paced around the room, muttering to himself. \"Alright, so I must have fallen out of the Tardis and landed here earlier than I intended to... it gives me until tomorrow to prepare, but I can't go home because I'll be there... No telling where or when my Tardis will return, but if I were to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx watched him go back and forth a few times before sticking her hoof out to stop him in his tracks. \"<i>Doctor!</i>\" she exclaimed, trying to get him to focus again. \"I need you to stop for a minute! This is serious. I think you might have a concussion or something, and I'm sure your eye needs some medical attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor blinked at her with his good eye. \"My eye? Why are you going on about my eye again?\" He reached up to touch his face, wincing when his hoof brushed up against the bruised flesh. \"Ah, that's right! Twilight Sparkle certainly packed a kick...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx's eyes widened at the mention of her mother. \"Whaaaa? Mom didn't... why would she...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time,\" the Doctor replied brusquely. \"It feels strange to say it, but time is not a luxury I possess at the moment! Derpy is in grave danger, and probably all of Equestria as well!\" Before Nyx could stop him, the stallion suddenly pushed himself harder than she expected him to in his condition, and started galloping out of the castle! \"I'll come collect you after you get Apple Bloom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stunned and confused alicorn asked, \"Wait, what? What does Apple Bloom have to do with... hey!\" She tried to follow him, but quickly lost sight of the stallion. \"What the hay just happened?\" she asked herself before leaving the castle in order to take wing. Her first destination would have to be Dinky Doo's house. Even though she had no idea where the Doctor was going to go, Nyx figured she should inform his... daughter? Step-daughter? (Her understanding when it came to the timing of the Doctor's arrival in Ponyville versus the date of Dinky's birth was contradictory at best, and like most ponies she had eventually stopped trying to make sense of it.) Whatever the case, she would need to know about his condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon reaching the house that the unicorn shared with her mother and the Doctor, Nyx knocked on the door until it started to open. \"Dinky, there's a problem. I need to tell you... Doctor?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alicorn's jaw dropped open as the one who opened the door wasn't the unicorn she was expecting, or even a unicorn at all. Instead, the Doctor looked out at her, his face completely unblemished, with his usual blithely cheerful expression beaming at her. \"Oh, hello Nyx. Fancy seeing you again today! So, how can Dinky help you? If it's something crazy, I would be more than happy to lend a hoof.\" He snickered to himself and murmured to himself as an aside, \"Lend a hoof... I never get tired of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx gaped and pointed at the stallion's face. \"Doctor... your eye...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm? My eye? What, is something wrong with it?\" The doctor touched his face. \"It hasn't turned purple again, has it? I was sure I flushed out the last of that Raxxodesian pollen...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx shook her head. \"No, it's... fine. How...?\" Suddenly, she looked off in the direction of Sweet Apple Acres. \"Apple Bloom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she took off at a gallop toward the apple orchard, running as fast as she could and leaving the Doctor standing in the open doorway. Behind him, Dinky Doo peeked out at the running alicorn. \"What was that about, dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor stroked his chin in thought, then shrugged and smiled as he pulled the door closed again. \"Can't say I know, but most likely I'll find out soon enough. By the way, is something wrong with my eye?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Nyx arrived at the Apple family's farmhouse. She was about to knock on the front door, but remembered that Applejack and Big Macintosh would probably be out working in the orchards, and even if they weren't, Apple Bloom was probably grounded. Instead, she sneaked around the house until she got to Apple Bloom's bedroom window and concentrated on turning herself into mist so that she could float up to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her friend moping in her room confirmed that the young mare was indeed grounded, so Nyx silently seeped in through the window and drew Apple Bloom's attention by letting some of the dark mist drift in front of her eyes before reconstituting herself. The earth pony was startled, but managed to keep from letting out a loud cry as she turned to look around at her friend. \"Nyx? What're you doin' here?\" she whispered, not having expected to see the alicorn after they bid goodbye to their friends earlier that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to make sure you were alright,\" Nyx replied. \"At the castle, I found the Doctor in bad shape and babbling nonsense, but when I went to his house just now to tell Dinky, the Doctor was there and he looked just fine! I don't know what's going on, but the one in the castle mentioned you, so I had to know you were safe and sound.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom blinked and said, \"Well, I'm okay, and I ain't seen anythin' strange.... except <i>that</i>.\" She pointed out the window, and Nyx blinked in surprise. There, just outside Apple Bloom's bedroom window, was the strange blue box that the Doctor and Ditzy Doo were sometimes seen coming in and out of. It certainly hadn't been there when Nyx showed up just a minute ago!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe box's door opened, and the Doctor with the black eye poked his head out, beckoning for them to come over. They went to the window, and he told them, \"Brilliant, you're right on time. Alright, I know it's sudden, but I need you two to hop in. As of this moment, the Cutie Mark Crusaders are my temporary assistants until we save Derpy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx narrowed her eyes and replied, \"Hold it, 'Doctor', I saw the other one of you at your house! How do I know you aren't a Changeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor blinked and replied, \"Oh, that was me from yesterday! Well, a week ago, really, but tomorrow is when Derpy and I depart, and... besides, if I were a Changeling, wouldn't it make more sense to approach you as your mother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Nyx and Apple Bloom's even greater surprise, Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo poked their heads out. \"It's true, Nyx,\" Sweetie Belle exclaimed excitedly. \"He showed up at Canterlot Station and had Scootaloo with him! I was so surprised, I nearly fainted!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've gotta come in here, girls! This thing's amazing,\" Scootaloo gushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx stared in absolute shock, stammering, \"But... you couldn't have picked them up at the station... Their trains should still be taking them there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom similarly boggled at the sight, but replied, \"Oh yeah? If y'all're Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo, tell us somethin' only they would know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScootaloo thought for a moment, then grinned and replied, \"Nyx swiped a book from the library and keeps it under her mattress. It's about a unicorn who has a passionate love affair with a-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eep! <i>Stop</i>\" Nyx suddenly interjected, a blush practically glowing its way through her black coat. \"I believe you! I believe you!\" Or at the very least, she was willing to give the benefit of the doubt. As long as it stopped the orange pegasus from finishing that sentence. \"But why us, Doctor? What are we supposed to be saving Ditzy <i>from</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Scootaloo snickered and pulled herself back into the blue box, the Doctor replied...</span></div></div>",

But that's just science-fiction, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are aliens and time travelers,\" the Doctor replied, \"but since both are standing right in front of you, it pays to have an open mind about these things. Please, you must hurry. If we leave now, then once we are done, I can bring us back to a point in time immediately after our departure, but the longer we stay here debating it, the more likely it is that we'll be spotted by somepony who isn't supposed to spot us, and then there's no telling what manner of paradoxical ramifications that could have!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx was still a little wary, but teleported herself outside while Apple Bloom climbed out the window. \"Alright...\" the alicorn replied, \"I'll give you the benefit of the doubt for now.\" Of course, if she saw anything suspicious, she would buck the potential impostor in his <i>other</i> eye. The Doctor made way for her as she stepped inside... and before she could wonder how he expected her to fit in the small box alongside the stallion and her friends, she got the answer. \"Sweet Celestia, it's bigger on the inside,\" she exclaimed, much to the amusement of the others as Apple Bloom followed her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, so all that stuff about time travel and other worlds was actually <i>true</i>?\" the earth pony asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" the Doctor said. \"Now, I imagine this must be a bit of a shock, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx interrupted, saying to her friends, \"Think about what this means! We could visit completely alien cultures! See historical events or Equestria's future play out before our eyes! <i>Have one last big adventure together and come back right after we left so we don't get into trouble!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of it made the mares giddy with delight as they shouted in unison, \"<b>CUTIE MARK CRUSADER TIME-TRAVELERS!</b>\" The Doctor winced from the volume, but couldn't help but enjoy their enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but do remember that our mission is to rescue Derpy.

She zipped toward the Doctor, glaring icily at him. \"Rainbow Dash is the most awesome pegasus ever! There's no way in this or any other universe she didn't pull off the Rainboom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor sweated nervously as he struggled to reach around her to get to the controls. \"Ah... a little help...?\" he asked Nyx, who rolled her eyes before lifting Scootaloo out of his way with magic. \"Thank you... last thing we need right now is for me to crash the TARDIS (again) right before we land. And I'm only telling you what the circumstances are in this timeline. You can see for yourself, once we've consulted with Captain Sparkle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx blinked in surprise, accidentally dropping Scootaloo as she released her magic. \"We're going to see Uncle Shiney?\" That thought excited her. Twilight's big brother had intimidated her at first. Technically, the first time they had met was when, as Nightmare Moon, she split herself into numerous clones disguised as rookie Guards in order to infiltrate the royal palace. She hadn't known about his relationship with her mother, then, and had caught him unawares with a sleep spell so that she could confront the princesses he had been sworn to protect. Then, like the rest of the Guard, he had been brainwashed with the \"blessing\" by Spell Nexus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she was de-powered once again to a filly, and the time came to meet him again as uncle and niece, he had been the one pony in all of Equestria that she was most afraid of. She could still remember the sleepless nights of worry over what he would do to the pony who had threatened his protectorate, his family, and the very land he loved. And feeding those fears for days and days was the knowledge that he would be entirely justified to hate and despise her for what she had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the day did come for them to meet, she was a jittery, exhausted wreck who was pretty sure that despite the princesses having made their decision regarding her 'punishment', Shining Armor would storm in filled with righteous anger and smite her hard. When he actually walked into the library, looking so much larger and more menacing due to her diminished stature, drastically reduced power and filly-like mindset, the first thing she did was throw herself at his hooves, wailing and apologizing until she lost her voice, then spend a good fifteen minutes after that sobbing her little eyes out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn't even noticed when he started hugging her, just that when she started to come out of her haze of guilt and fear, he had his forelegs wrapped around her, Twilight and Spike watching the scene. As it turned out, he and Twilight had been sending letters to each other for months before his visit. At the time of Nightmare Moon's rise to power he had been terrified by his inability to stop her coup against the crown, and frustrated by his failure in the aftermath. But greater than his fear was his trust in the judgement of his little sister and the royal sisters he was sworn to protect, and the understanding that she had released them of her own free will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she got her voice back, the two of them had talked about everything. They had been candid and honest, and it had been hard at times, but after it was over, they had been able to face each other without fear, and that had been the first step to acknowledging each other as family. Ever since, he had been a warm and loving uncle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor interrupted her reminiscing by saying, \"Umm... Actually, Nyx, it's rather different...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alicorn shook her head, pulling herself back to the present. \"I know, I know. This timeline's Shining Armor won't be my Uncle Shiney, so I have to make sure not to act all weird around him. Still, I can be happy to see him, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what I-\" Before he could finish, the TARDIS chimed. \"Oh! We're here! Alright, ladies, when you step outside, we'll be in Canterlot, so be on your best behavior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom replied skeptically, \"But we didn't even move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing to the door, Sweetie Belle opened it and peered outside. \"Uh... actually, we <i>did</i>,\" she replied, a silent 'but' hanging in the air like punctuation. She left the TARDIS with the others to look around, finding that while they were no longer near Sweet Apple Acres, they were still in Ponyville, and the morning had turned to early night in the few minutes since they entered the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, blast it,\" the Doctor muttered. \"We should be right outside the royal palace. Still, if we're here, then there's probably a reason for it. See? We're in the proper timeline, at least.\" He pointed up to the sky, and everyone followed his hoof. Their jaws dropped as one at the sight of the moon... along with the shadowy mark of the Mare in the Moon. A sight that most of the mares hadn't seen since they were fillies, and Nyx had never seen with her own eyes for obvious reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's <i>that</i> there?!\" Sweetie Belle asked, glancing over at Nyx to make sure that her friend was still with them. The alicorn was at least as surprised as her, and could only offer a weak shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I understand it,\" the Doctor exposited, \"in this timeline, Celestia's battle with Nightmare Moon lasted several years longer than it did in yours before she was able to imprison her sister with the Elements of Harmony. As a result, the thousandth year in the prophecy regarding her return has yet to arrive. It's quite a good story, actually, but we'll have an opportunity to hear it from a pony who knows it better than I soon enough. For the moment... do you hear that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Cutie Mark Crusaders cocked their ears and listened carefully, hearing...</span></div></div>",

You'll be sorry you ever messed with me!\" He shouted before running off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Farmer helped Fluttershy to her hooves, and the Pegasus hugged him again. \"Vielen Dank f\u00fcr meine Rettung. (Thank you for saving me.)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack blinked in confusion, before smiling and waving it off. \"No thanks needed miss, just doing what any properly raised stallion would do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowed cheered one final time and began to disperse, no pony seeming to notice the alicorn or her companions. The Doctor glanced at Nyx with a smirk. \"I did tell you to wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, wait. In this universe Fluttershy is from another country, and Applejack is a boy? What next? Rainbow Dash isn't really a pony?\" Scootaloo inquired.</span></div></div>",

Before she could collide with Applejack, however, the farmer whirled around and kicked her in the face, causing the unfortunate recipient of that kick to go flying into a tree. Now sprawled out and in a state of non-motion, it was apparent just what was different about the Rainbow Dash of this universe: She was a Hippogriff. her crown feathers and wingtips were the many different colors of the rainbow, as was her pony like tail. In fact, her entire back half was the exact same as it was in Nyx's universe, except that her cutie-mark was missing. Her feathers on the front half of her body were all cyan, matching the body fur of her back half, and she had the same magenta eyes. Her front legs ended with golden yellow eagle talons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...She isn't.\" the Doctor finished weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow got back to her feet, stomping a bit in frustration. \"Dang it!

Translates almost anything except the most primitive of languages and anything older than the TARDIS itself, which is why if you see anything you can't read, you should come and get me right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group finally reached sugarcube corner just in time to see Applejack running off what looked like a number of armored ponies. Not stopping to see if she needed help, Nyx burst into sugarcube corner to see the inside was a mess. There were two things in particular that caught her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne: There was a Diamond Dog in a red vest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo: He was helping Pinkie get back into a wheelchair. The Pink mare looked like she normally did, except her mane and tail were straight, although something told the alicorn that was normal for her in this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx blinked in confusion at the scene, her brain trying to process what was going on. Thankfully the Doctor decided to fill her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In this world, Pinkie's Grandfather was close friends with the chief of a Diamond Dog pack. They managed to work out a mutually beneficial relationship with each other that kept the rock farm from going out of business and their descendants have been close ever since. The day Pinkie got her cutie-mark, bandits attacked the farm while she was holding the party. Her sister Inkie went to get the Dogs' help, but by the time they got there the bandits had knocked over the Silo and ransacked the house. The dogs got most of them, but it was too late for Pinkie; the Silo had landed right on top of her as she was trying to get away. She's been paralyzed from the waist down ever since. Fido there was her best friend at the time, so when they send her to live with her Aunt and Uncle Cake, he decided to go with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, really Fido. They just pushed me over, there's no serious harm...well not to me anyway, this place is a disaster.\" Pinkie told her companion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true. the whole place looked to have been ransacked. Pasties were all over the place, tables overturned, chairs knocked over. Fluttershy was in one corner, having grabbed a broom and dustpan from somewhere and was sweeping up some broken dishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx contemplated what she was going to do next.</span></div></div>",

Just be sure to ask if you don't know where something goes.\" Pinkie replied with a smile, as she rolled her chair carefully around the room towards the kitchen door. \"I can't really help pick stuff up off the floor so I'm going to get started on replacing the baked goods they ruined. If you need me, I'll be in the kitchen, otherwise just ask Fido.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she exited the room, and the crusaders (and Doctor) started helping clean up.

How could the rainboom not happening change something in the past?\" Sweetie Belle inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well girls, you see, your all thinking about it the wrong way. You're viewing time as if it were a river, with all the water flowing swift and sure in one direction.\" the Doctor replied. \"But it's really more like an Ocean, with waves tossing about this way and that, and if you drop a big rock into it, it'll make ripples that go in every direction, effecting not only the present and the future, but also the past. Normally it's effects on the past are small and unnoticeable things, like whether your bathroom is on the right side of the hall or the left. But the Rainboom in our world was a fixed point in time, and Island in the middle of the ocean, one that will always be there no matter what, and nothing can change that, because if it does, time will break and disintegrate, and all reality will cease to exist. But the Rainboom didn't translate over to this world, which is like suddenly taking an island out of the ocean, causing dramatically large ripples across the entire ocean, resulting in major changes to the past, present, and future.\" He stopped the work he was doing and looked at the fillies around him. \"Does that answer your question?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...basically what you saying is that Rainbow Dash is so awesome, her rainboom is holding all reality together back in our world, and this world is so messed up because it's trying to hold itself together without it.\" Scootaloo rationalized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor sighed. \"Well...it's not exactly the way I would have put it, but I suppose that's right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we're here Because Ditzy Doo getting lost here is like throwing in a pebble, and your worried she'll hit an undersea volcano and cause it to blow everything up.\" Scootaloo summarized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, not exactly the way I'd put it, but I suppose that's right too.\"</span></div></div>",

Almost immediately everypony (and Diamond Dog) in the room moved for the Kitchen door, but they were cut off when Pinkie called out to them. \"I'm Fine! Everything's okay in here, I just dropped something! There's absolutely no reason to come into the Kitchen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused everypony to slow there approach, as they could all easily tell she was lying...well, everypony but one. Alas, poor Fluttershy didn't speak Equestrian, so all she heard was a \"Bang!\" and some yelling, which she immediately misinterpreted as cries for help. The canary colored Pegasus opened the door and suddenly found the blade of a rapier at her throat. Her instinctual reaction was to panic and beg for mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Es tut mir leid! Bitte t\u00f6te mich nicht! Bitte ersparen meines Lebens! (I'm sorry! Please don't kill me!

(I'm not going to kill you if you tell me who you are and who you work for.)\" Came the reply in a sophisticated, yet slightly roguish voice. Nyx, leaned slightly to the left and managed to see past Fluttershy. What she saw shocked her. The pony holding the sword to Fluttershy's throat was Rarity! She was dressed in a mostly black outfit and had on a bandana with two holes in it that she wore like a mask to hide her mane and face. The sword was held in the grip of her hoof, most likely through the use of special magic horse shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mein Name ist Fluttershy. Ich bin arbeitslos und suchen Arbeit hier in Equestria. (My name is Fluttershy. I am unemployed and looking for work here in Equestria.)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity smiled. \"Guten Tag Fluttershy. Ich bin der Dread Pirate Roberts. Bitte nehmen Sie Platz. (Good afternoon Fluttershy. I am the Dread Pirate Roberts. Please take a seat.)\" She said, motioning to one of the chairs behind the Pegasus. The Pegasus complied, Walking to the chair and sitting on it, while Rarity followed her, eyeing everyone else in the room while keeping her blade on Fluttershy's throat. Pinkie wheeled out in her chair behind the sword mare, giving an exasperated sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did tell you guys not to come in the kitchen.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then...I want everypony in the room to Identify themselves one at a time, stating their name, occupation, and intentions.\" She motioned to Scootaloo. \"We'll start with you my friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScootaloo cast a brief glance at the Doctor and Nyx before doing as she was told. \"I'm Scootaloo, I'm going to be a racer and daredevil in Las Pegasus, and I'm just following that brown Stallion over there because he promised me an adventure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplebloom went next. \"My name is Applebloom, I'm a repair pony and an Apple farmer, and I'm here for the same reasons as her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx went after that. \"I'm Nyx Sparkle, I'm technically not actually employed by anypony at the moment, but I help my mother run a library, and I'm here helping Him find his wife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the Doctor. \"I'm the Doctor...I'm the Doctor...and my intentions are to find my wife and to have a very fun adventure while doing that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Finally, Sweetie Belle. \"I'm Sweetie Belle, I'm going to work at a conservatory, and I'm with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an odd look on Rarity's masked face for a moment as she looked Sweetie Belle over, before finally sheathing her sword. \"As I told Your foreign friend, I am the Dread Pirate Roberts. I'm here because I've thrown my lot in with the rebellion in hopes of it succeeding, and if any of you even so much as think about causing me trouble You'll find that I'm more than a match for anyone with my blade. I've learned from all the best teachers: D'Artagnan, Cyrano de Bergerac, Zoro, Inigo Montoya, and even the Fox himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" The Doctor said \"That's quite the list of teachers.

On closer inspection, the figure was wearing a cloak, and a pair of wings could be seen shifting under it from time to time. The hood was up, making facial features impossible to make out.

A familiar voice, but the tone of it was anything but. Everypony turned to look, and only Rainbow Dash and the Doctor took in the sight without their jaws dropping open. Walking down the street, apparently not caring about the rainbow pegasus's reputation or presence, was Pinkie Pie. Except she wore a full-body black turtleneck sweater. Her normally poofy hair hung straight and limp, draped over her left eye, a beret perched atop it. Slung across her back was a set of bongo drums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, not her,\" Rainbow Dash groaned, standing up again. \"Forget this, I'm heading back to the forest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer wings confined by the cloak, she was about to simply gallop off, but Apple Bloom quickly snatched Dash's rainbow-colored tail in her mouth and dug in her hooves to keep her there. Dash's hooves slipped out from under her, causing her to trip and fall, allowing Apple Bloom to let go and ask, \"What're you tryin' to run off, for? And what's wrong with Pinkie Pie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pinkamena,\" the pink earth pony corrected in a flat, joyless voice. She then took her bongos and set them down on the ground, then started tapping out a rhythm on them while Rainbow Dash clamped her hooves over her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>A splash of color in the gloom of night, but no one comes out to see.<br>\r\nA madpony speaks prophecy, but no one lends an ear.<br>\r\nA brave smile shines upon the cold earth, but does not warm a heart.<br>\r\nA mare of wealth stands atop the world, but has given up her home.<br>\r\nA voice cries out, claiming knowledge, but true wisdom is ever elusive.<br>\r\nA knight stands firm against a tide of darkness that will drown her.<br>\r\nWhat a world, what a world in which we live.<br>\r\nThere is no room in it for such wonders.<br>\r\nMagic dies. Magic dies. Magic dies.<br>\r\nAnd no one will remember it was ever there.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie... Pinkamena picked up her bongos again, slinging them over her shoulder. Only the Doctor applauded by tapping his hooves against the street, everypony else feeling as if their hearts had been squeezed in a vice. Except for Rainbow Dash, of course, who still had her ears covered. While Pinkamena started to walk away, he whispered to his temporary assistants, \"Without seeing the Rainboom, Pinkie spent her fillyhood on her parents' dreary rock farm, never discovering joy or laughter. As you can see, she doesn't exactly liven up the party... though she <i>is</i> very popular in certain coffee houses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it over?\" Rainbow Dash asked, eventually daring to uncover one ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx replied, \"I think I need to hug a puppy, or I don't know what I'll do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash groaned and picked herself back up. \"Yeah, she'll do that. So, uh... was there something I could help you with? I mean, if somepony's in trouble it's probably not my problem, but you guys took the time to talk to me and didn't do it in verse or...\" She shuddered for a moment. \"... Whatever it is Pinkamena does. So I figure the least I can do is hear you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor, the only one among them not still moping said with disturbingly good cheer, \"Ah, brilliant. Yes, it would help us greatly if you could show us to...\"</span></div></div>",

This is what I get when I live with somepony who talks only in rhyme.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Doctor shrugged. \"Personally, I don't mind somepony who talks in rhyme. I've seen far weirder in my time.\" He flashed a grin at Rainbow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not you, too!\" she groaned. \"Ugh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx and her friends kept to the rear of the group. So far, they had seen two formerly prominent members of Ponyville society changed. Rainbow Dash was still much the same, if an outcast, but the jarring change in Pinkie's character had left the four disoriented. Nyx still felt like hugging a puppy. Seeing <i>Pinkie Pie</i>, the happiest pony in their Equestria, reduced to a poet spouting melancholic verse, was confusing. Silently, Nyx prayed that that was the worst of the changes to their loved ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As they approached a farmstead, they were treated to the sight of an alabaster unicorn trotting up to greet them. Her face and mane color were familiar. Her <i>style</i>. however, was not. Where their Rarity had elegant curls in her mane and tail with nary a speck of dirt on her whole body, this one's mane and tail were tied off in simple braids, and she was covered with dust. A brown Stetson was perched on her head, with a hole in it for her horn, and a pair of grass-stained coveralls concealed her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sweetie Belle started twitching immediately on seeing her, but not as much as when the white unicorn opened her mouth. \"Well, hi there, Rainbow Dash! Yer a little late this evenin', aintcha?\" The voice was familiar, but the cultured faux-Canterlot accent was nowhere to be found, replaced by a cowpony twang the young mares would normally have associated with Applejack. Sweetie Belle's twitches grew in intensity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As Rainbow Dash approached, the Doctor fell behind to explain this to the gobsmacked mares. \"The rock her horn led her to wasn't cracked open by the Rainboom. Because of this, Rarity accepted that her fate lay in stonecraft and rock-farming. She's let everything of her old life go... almost. She always designs her own clothes, including those coveralls of hers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hearing this calmed Sweetie Belle down somewhat. \"So she still likes making clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He grimaced. \"Well... not entirely. She focuses entirely upon function, rather than form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah'm worried about mah sister, now...\" muttered Applebloom as the five approached Rainbow and Rarity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The rock farmer turned to greet them. \"Nice ta meet y'all! Rainbow here tells me y'all are from another... timeline thingy, right? Sounds mighty complicated ta me, but that don't matter. Yer more'n welcome here at Cliffton Acres!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Applebloom whispered to her friends, \"Ah've heard of them back in our Equestria. They're good folk, much cheerier than the Pies that Pinkie used ta live with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx nodded, and stepped forward. \"Um, hi there! You're... Rarity, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Eeyup!\" The wide smile Rarity gave her seemed eerily out-of-place. Then again, Nyx was still comparing her to her world's Equestria. \"Say, if y'all are from another timeline, does that mean there's another me out there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx nodded slowly. \"But, I think it's best if you don't ask questions. We don't want to throw the time-stream out-of-whack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rarity nodded back. \"Ah getcha. Anyway, wanna try some of our famous rock candy?\" Seeing the blank looks she was getting, she chuckled. \"Don't worry, it ain't made outta real rocks.\" She dashed into the farmhouse, and came out with a bowl of rock candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx took a piece, and carefully bit into it. A few moments later, she devoured the whole piece. \"That's amazing! I've never had rock candy that good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ain't it just?\" Rarity beamed. Then she looked past the group, and her expression soured. \"Ah, ponyfeathers. Way ta ruin an evenin'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Blinking, the group turned around to see...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Applejack was approaching the group, a pegasus-drawn chariot behind her as the orange mare focused her attention solely on Rarity. There was no mistaking who it was, but this version of her had traded in her hat for a sharply tailored executive dress suit. \"Ms. Rarity, I do <i>not</i> like having to keep having these meetings, but your tardiness is completely unacceptable!\" Gone was the country twang they were so used to, instead replaced with a crisp, upper-class Manehattanite accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity stepped forward, meeting Applejack's eye. \"What's the matter, afraid of getting the smell of good honest work on ya? Ah told you, the harvest had to be delayed! You'll get yer bits, you just have t' wait a while longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those weren't the terms of our agreement,\" Applejack snapped. \"When I gave you that loan, you assured me that you would honor your end of the deal. You said you needed the money to make this rock farm thrive, but all I see are pebbles!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity glowered at the businesspony and picked up a stone with her magic. \"It ain't the size that matters, it's how you bring out what's inside 'em! That takes care and patience, which you might know a thing or two about if'n you ever pulled your nose out of your spreadsheets and ledgers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack grimaced and whipped around, quickly bucking at the rock Rarity held in place. It hung motionless in the air for a moment before a crack formed where it had been struck, then split apart to reveal nothing inside but stone and the faintest traces of metal. \"I know a thing or two about deadbeat ponies trying to cheat me. I know you signed a contract, and the terms of an Applejack contract are set in stone. Though it's obvious now that stone is something you don't know anything about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity reeled back a step, but then rallied and gave the orange mare a glare that made everypony watching fear that Applejack's head would burst into flames. Then she started to laugh darkly at her adversary. \"If you know so much, then do you know where your precious bits are? Gone! All gone, spent on upkeep for the farm! So y'all can either wait for the harvest like I've been sayin', or cry yourself to sleep over bein' slightly less rich an' snooty than you think ya oughta be, because ya can't squeeze juice out of a rock!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo that, Applejack glared back and smirked. \"No, but I can take the farm.\" Rarity visibly choked on that thought, so Applejack continued. \"It's right there in the contract you signed. Failure to pay may result in seizure of assets equal to the value of the loss. Or did you skip past that part because there weren't any illustrations?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't <i>do</i> that! This farm's all the Clifftons have! It's all <i>I</i> have! They trusted me t' manage it...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack stepped forward, poking Rarity in the chest with her hoof. \"Then they shouldn't have placed their trust in an unqualified, illiterate, corrupt, lazy, lying <i>hick</i>!\" After bearing down on the unicorn with a stream of verbal abuse, Applejack suddenly felt something slam into the side of her face. It hit her hard enough that she tumbled over onto her side, though she was able to shake it off. \"Oh, you got some fight in you, Rarity,\" she said, rubbing where she'd been struck. \"But when I'm done suing you, you won't have... wait... wha- What are YOU doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack's expression of smug contempt was replaced by astonishment at the sight of Apple Bloom standing over her, the younger mare's body shaking as tears welled up in her eyes. \"<i>You leave my friend's sister alone, you... you... BULLY!</i>\" She shrieked at Applejack, her voice breaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe businessmare, having been too focused earlier to notice anyone but Rarity, stared gobsmacked at her little sister's sudden appearance. \"But... why are you in Ponyville, sis? You should be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You're NOT my sister,</i>\" Apple Bloom screamed with all her might. \"My sister's brave and honest and dependable! She'll always keep a promise, but won't use it as a weapon! Y'all're horrible! This whole world's <i>horrible</i>!\" She sniffled, wiping the tears from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the very confused Applejack reached out to her sister, only for Apple Bloom to swat her hoof away and start galloping away blindly into the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apple Bloom! Wait!\" Sweetie Belle was the first to chase after her friend, though Scootaloo and Nyx were quick to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear,\" the Doctor muttered. \"I suppose I should have expected something like this to happen... girls, wait!\" He tried to go after them, only to be blocked by Applejack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold it right there, mister,\" she said to the stallion with an icy tone. \"Who are you, and what are you doing with my sister?! Did you kidnap her? <i>Brainwash</i> her? Whatever your sick plan is, you aren't going anywhere!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor sweatdropped and backed away from the businessmare. \"N-no, it's not like that, I assure you. Ms. Rarity, a little help...?\" But the unicorn was looking off into the darkness with a surprised expression on her face. It had been dark and consciously or not, Sweetie Belle had been hiding behind Nyx for most of the conversation, so she hadn't noticed the presence of her little sister's double before seeing her run off less than a minute ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash at least was able to throw off her cloak and let her wings stretch, a few bags of herbs and powders strapped to her barrel. \"Through the darkness I can see, so don't worry doc, leave the girls to me!\" With that, she pushed off and flew after them, greatly relieving the stallion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis relief was short-lived, though, as this meant leaving him with Applejack and the two burly pegasi who brought her to the farm approaching. \"Would you... care for a spot of tea while we discuss matters...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple Bloom ran as fast as her legs would take her. Her eyes were clenched shut with grief, but it was too dark to see where she was going anyway. Aside from feeling the dirt of the road beneath her hooves, she didn't care where she was going, just as long as it was away from this world's twisted mockery of her sister. The others raced after her, but were weighed down by the impact of what they had seen as well. Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle had seen versions of their idol and sister respectively give up on their dreams, and after everything they had gone through that night, Nyx didn't even want to imagine what had happened to her mother in this timeline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too hard for them to catch up to Apple Bloom while being assaulted with the constant revelations about what had happened to the adults they looked up to. As a result, she was still out of sight when their attention was brought back to the present by the sound of her crying out as she ran into something! \"Bloom! Are you okay?\" Nyx cried out, lighting up her horn so brightly so fast that it hurt everypony's eyes before she dimmed it. As the faint spots faded from her vision, she just barely saw what Apple Bloom ran into in time to skid to a stop before she barreled into it... or rather <i>her</i> as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho did Apple Bloom run into?</span></div></div>",

Nonetheless, the pony before her was, without doubt, Twilight Sparkle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shaking her head, Twilight offered a hoof to Applebloom, who was still rubbing her head. \"Are you okay, miss?\" the unicorn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, ah'm fine,\" Applebloom replied, taking the offered hoof. \"Ah'm just... peachy,\" she stuttered on seeing Twilight properly in the dim light from Nyx's horn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight smiled. \"Don't worry about it.

They're mah friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight did a double-take on seeing Nyx. \"Wha - ? Another alicorn?! Ohmigosh, I have to let the Princess know about this immediately, or she'll send me back to the Academy!\" She was about to gallop off, when a midnight-blue aura enveloped her and pulled her in close to the black alicorn. \"Um... can I help you, milady?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx was looking Twilight over, and she let out a laughing sigh of relief. \"Thank goodness... at least one pony in this crazy timeline is still the same.

I thought that was all theoretical stuff!\" She smiled. \"Oh, I can't wait to tell the Princess about this! Maybe she'll give me a science award!\" She paused, then looked down. \"Or rather, she would if I wasn't her guard captain...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I was about to ask... how did this happen?

I mean, nothing I'd read said anything about how to hatch a dragon's egg! After I left, I thought about applying as a librarian, but... then I got news that my brother had been killed by a manticore while on patrol in the Everfree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx felt like she'd been bucked in the lungs. Her uncle, the pony who'd accepted her after all the evil she'd done as Nightmare Moon, was dead in this reality. \"I'm... I'm sorry for your loss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight smiled sadly. \"It's been several years since then. I've gotten past the pain, mostly. But, he was a sergeant in the royal guard. I felt I owed it to him to try and follow in his hoofsteps. And, well, here I am, a guard captain. Who'd have guessed? Nerdy little Twilight Sparkle, a guard captain.\" She sighed again, then looked up. \"So, what happened to me where you came from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx smiled at her. \"In our timeline, you passed the exam.

Also... your brother was never killed by a manticore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight's smile was sad, but genuine. \"At least there's a version of me out there who's living her dreams... and beyond.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was a cough. \"Um, girls, don't we have other things to worry about?\" asked Sweetie Belle. \"We need to get back to that rock farm and get the Doctor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight blinked. \"You mean Cliffton Acres?

'dirty city mare'? You wouldn't happen to be talking about Applejack, the premier loan mare of Manehattan, would you?\" All of the other mares blinked at Twilight, who smiled. \"She's done business with the Clifftons before.

Twilight then let the barrier pop like a soap bubble, dropping Dash to the ground none the worse for wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter belly-flopping onto the dirt road, Dash chuckled and rubbed the back of her head. \"A-heh... nice catch,\" she said before blinking up at the unicorn. \"Twilight Sparkle...?\" Almost immediately, she was up on her hooves and glomping the armored unicorn. \"Wow, it's great to see you again, Twi! But what the hay are you doing nearby? I thought you were too busy in Canterlot with your job to come and mingle with us Ponyville slobs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pegasus was so happy, she didn't even notice that she had fallen back into rhyming, causing Twilight to laugh and return the hug. \"Hey, Dash, I'm actually here for a few days. Princess Celestia is going to be visiting Ponyville for this year's Summer Sun Celebration, so officially speaking, I'm here ahead of her to check out the preparations and security arrangements.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger mares picked themselves up after the expected collision failed to occur. Nyx asked, \"Wait, so you two know each other?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight nodded. \"Yeah, since about three years ago now. I'd just been promoted to captain when I got a report about a manticore spotted around the outskirts of Ponyville. After what happened to my brother... well, I did the stupidest possible thing and came out here alone to deal with it. I marched straight into the Everfree Forest without a plan or a guide or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx and her friends all gasped in unison, shocked beyond belief! The idea that Twilight Sparkle... <i>any</i> Twilight Sparkle might take action without triple-checking that she had made the proper preparations was so much more stunning to them than the idea of her taking on a manticore single-hoofedly. It could only have been a testament to how much grief she had felt at the time over Shining Armor's passing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight arched an eyebrow at the gasp, but kept telling her story. \"Well, nopony told me about the weather working by itself in the Everfree, so while I was following its tracks, I got caught in a downpour. It was the worst storm I'd ever seen, let alone been in, so of <i>course</i> the manticore I was tracking decided to confront me while I was looking for shelter. It pounced on me from behind and stung me through my armor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplebloom asked as the four young mares listened with wide, astonished eyes, \"What did ya do?! How'd ya survive?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight replied, \"I cast a spell to blast it with lightning, knocking it away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's where I came in,\" Rainbow Dash interjected proudly. \"I was flying back to the hut after hunting down some plants for Zecora when I see a flash of lightning coming from down below. Now, that's weird even for the Everfree Forest, so I fly down to check it out and what do you know? A lone purple unicorn suffering from a manticore's sting. Lucky for her, in my bags I had just the thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight smiled at the 'witch doctor' pegasus as she told the others, \"The poison hit pretty fast so I was only barely conscious, but the monster was suddenly hit by a cloud of green powder that seemed to turn into a mass of snakes. By that point, I was sure I was hallucinating from the toxin when this rainbow streak slammed into the manticore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bucked him straight into the river before it got her. Stupid monster got carried away in the rushing water,\" Rainbow Dash snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight joined her friend in laughing about it. \"I must've passed out right then because the next thing I know, I'm waking up in a creepy hut with the infamous 'Rainbow Witch Doctor' kissing me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four younger mares all stumbled as they walked, but Nyx got it the worst and flopped over onto her face. \"WHAT?!\" she asked, eyes threatening to pop out of her head while Dash scoffed and swatted at the purple unicorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you <i>wish!</i> I was just giving her the venom's antidote. It was the only way to safely get it down her throat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx blushed hard with embarassment, her face practically glowing through the dim of night and her own black coat. \"Whew, that's a relief... er, I mean, not that there'd be anything wrong with that. It just took me by surprise.\" Considering her mother's personality, it was almost impossible for her to think of any version of Twilight Sparkle getting romantically involved with one of her closest friends. The checklists weighing the pros and cons alone would fill up the entire library several times over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScootaloo, by contrast, was beaming widely at Rainbow Dash. Seeing her friend's expression, Sweetie Belle nudged her and whispered, \"Hey, Scootaloo, what's up? Weren't you all depressed just a little while ago?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orange pegasus whispered back, \"Yeah, because I thought she was a failure because she gave up on flying... but she single-hoofedly took down a manticore! Rainbow Dash is the most awesome pony around in <i>any</i> universe!\" Trotting up to her idol's alternate, Scootaloo asked Dash, \"Hey... you got any more stories?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash looked over at the younger pegasus and got a smug grin on her face, sticking her chest out as she walked. \"Well, I'm not one to let my tongue wag on, but there's this one time I saved the princess's pet dragon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight interrupted, \"Hey, we're back at Cliffton Acres.\" Indeed, they were once more at the edge of the rock farm. Over by the farmhouse, they could see the Doctor...</span></div></div>",

I was hoping I'd run into you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight blinked. \"Um, may I ask why?\" She paused, and shook her head. \"Actually, that can wait.\" She leveled an even look at Applejack, who now looked rather guilty. \"Miss Applejack, a pleasure to see you again. I wanted to thank you again for the leeway you gave me in repaying my loan for my senior year at the Academy. I was worried when I couldn't get you the first payment on time, but you assured me that you knew how the Royal Guard's wages were, and you were willing to relax the contract a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx noticed the two pegasi guards shaking their heads in amusement, even as Applejack hung hers. \"Well... I admit I have quite a bit of respect for the Guard. You keep us safe, after all.\" The businessmare smiled warily, despite Rarity's growing glare from the side. \"And while I'd love to discuss possible future ventures, I do have... business I need to attend to.\" She glanced at Applebloom, who was giving her a hard look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Doctor coughed. \"Remember what I told you, Miss Applejack...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Applejack rolled her eyes. \"Yes, yes, this whole 'alternate timeline' business. I found myself skeptical at first, but on closer inspection...\" She looked at Applebloom again. \"You're a little older than the Applebloom I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Applebloom's gaze remained stony. \"It's like ah said before; ya ain't <i>mah</i> sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Applejack visibly cringed. However, it was Rarity who spoke next. \"And... ya ain't mine, are ya?\" she asked Sweetie Belle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The younger unicorn shook her head. \"Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The farmpony smiled. \"Ah, it's alright. 'Sfar as ah'm concerned, yer family, even if ya ain't.\" She paused. \"Does that make sense?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sweetie Belle smiled and nodded. \"You're different from my sister... but maybe you're more like a cousin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The two unicorns embraced, sealing their familial bond. Applejack looked at Applebloom, whose eyes were still hard. \"Listen, Applebloom... I don't know what I did that set you off, but - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah'll tell ya what ya did,\" the younger earth pony interrupted. \"Ya were actin' like a bully. Mah sister would never condone extortion. What's more, Twilight here says yer normally very generous in terms of yer payments. So what's the difference between her and Rarity, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Applejack grimaced. \"I... Truth be told, I came here after attending a 'charity' ball in Manehattan. I'm... a bit of a laughingstock among my peers, to be honest.\" Everypony blinked at her. \"I'm a bleeding heart. I always give my clients enough time to pay for their loan. Because of this, I'm made fun of in the social circles of Manehattan.\" She paused, then allowed herself a small smirk. \"Of course, I have <i>more</i> clients than most of my peers...\" She sighed, her smirk fading. \"I suppose their words were still fresh in my mind. I've never actually threatened to seize assets before, and it's left quite the bitter taste in my mouth.\" She looked up at Applebloom, her eyes watering slightly. \"But is it so wrong to want to be accepted by your peers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Applebloom's hard gaze finally softened. \"Nah, it ain't wrong,\" she said. \"But let me give ya some advice: Stay true to yerself, no matter what other ponies think of ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Applejack blinked, and smiled. \"Sage advice. Who was it that told you that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The younger pony smiled back. \"That was mah sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The two embraced, similar to how Sweetie Belle and Rarity were. Nyx smiled at the scene, happy that Applejack hadn't completely changed. A cough from Twilight, however, cut the moment short. \"Now then, sir,\" she addressed the Doctor, \"you said you wanted to speak to me?

What does <i>she</i> have to do with anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you know her?\" Nyx asked, her friends' newfound acceptance of the alternates of the ponies they looked up to having taken the edge off her own worries. Now she was more curious than afraid to find out about the timid, kind-hearted Fluttershy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she and her husband do a seminar for the Guard every year,\" Captain Sparkle replied, gazing off into the distance. \"She helped me so much after my brother passed away. I always thought motivational speakers were just cheesy hucksters, but I've never met someone so energetic and full of life before. She got me to look past my grief and enjoy life again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Cutie Mark Crusaders were once again stunned by this revelation. \"Seriously? <i>Fluttershy</i>?\" Scootaloo asked incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Motivational speaker...\" Nyx muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplebloom asked, \"Energetic...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie Belle exclaimed, \"<i>Husband?!</i> Who in Equestria is she married to? Big Macintosh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could get an answer, Applebloom interjected, \"Why does everyone keep tryin' t' hook Fluttershy up with Big Mac? They've barely said two words t' one another in all th' time she's been in Ponyville.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack quickly replied, \"Oh, no, no, there is more <i>certainly</i> nothing going on between her and our... my brother. No, she's married to a minotaur by the name of Iron Will. They're quite a team; I've hired them to speak to my employees from time to time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence fell over Cliffton Acres like a wet blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the awkwardness was broken by Twilight asking, \"Is, uh... inter-species marriage a delicate topic where you're from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, nothing of the sort,\" the Doctor assured her. \"But getting back to the matter at hand, I've heard that Fluttershy and Iron Will are to be taking advantage of the large crowds gathering for the Summer Sun Celebration, and will be putting on a show. Since you know her, it would mean a lot to me if we could speak with her before then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight blinked and asked, \"Really? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I'm a big fan, of course,\" the Doctor replied cheerfully. \"My wife and I attended one of her seminars, recently, and I found her message to be most uplifting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight replied, \"Well, she <i>is</i> very good... and it's true, they will be in Ponyville tomorrow, so maybe I'll see if I can pull a few strings. I'm sure Fluttershy'll be thrilled to learn she's got fans all across time and space.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor smiled widely, taking Twilight's hoof and shaking it. \"Ah, brilliant! Thank you ever so much, Captain Sparkle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's all wrapped up, so back home I'll creep,\" Rainbow Dash said as she pulled her robe back on and pulled the hood over her face. \"It's been cool and all, but I need my sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'all're welcome to spend the night here,\" Rarity offered the five dimension-travelers. \"It ain't much, but there are enough spare beds for each of ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you kindly, miss Rarity. You have all been extremely helpful and gracious,\" the Doctor replied. As Rarity showed them where they could rest, Rainbow Dash, Applejack and Captain Sparkle walked down the road a bit toward the businessmare's chariot while the pegasi bodyguards hitched themselves back up to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" the unicorn asked, glancing back at the farmhouse to ensure they weren't followed. \"What do you girls think about all this? About those five?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack shook her head. \"As bizarre as it is, I have to believe their story. That double of my sister... I'm positive she's telling the truth. The one I'm not sure about is that stallion she's with. And an alicorn! How is she such close friends with an alicorn? That's like having Princess Cadance as a foalsitter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight coughed quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just any alicorn,\" Rainbow Dash replied. \"She didn't want to be called it, but aside from her cutie mark she looks just like Nightmare Moon. Let me do some research and I'll get back to you soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight nodded to the two mares. \"I'm familiar with the Doctor, or at least our version of him. Whenever he takes an interest in something, it means something strange is about to play out. He might have good intentions, but he's not telling us everything. I'll have to keep an eye on Fluttershy and Iron Will when they show up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Rarity went to the kitchen to fix them a snack, the Doctor and his temporary companions settled in. According to their internal clocks it was still early afternoon, so none of them were tired. As the brown stallion settled in, Nyx said, \"Alright, Doctor, it's time you were honest with us. This isn't <i>just</i> about your wife, is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor smiled tenatively and asked, \"Why, what do you mean, Nyx?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's perty obvious, Doc,\" Applebloom interjected. \"Meetin' the bearers of the Elements o' Harmony?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Mare in the Moon,\" Scootaloo added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Summer Sun Celebration,\" Sweetie Belle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx concluded, \"It all adds up to the same thing. This is the thousandth year, isn't it? Whatever happened... or... is <i>going</i> to happen to Derpy, it's connected to this timeline's Nightmare Moon coming back. If it was anything less severe, you could use your TARDIS and deal with it yourself, I bet. But you needed us and the bearers of the Elements.\" The Doctor's expression turned sadder, confirming their suspicions. \"Why didn't you just <i>say</i> so? Were you <i>going</i> to tell us, or were you just going to put us into position to do whatever it is you need from us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor shook his head and replied, \"No, no! I was going to tell you everything, it's just that when we landed in Ponyville instead of where I expected, I saw an opportunity.\" He reached up to his face and brushed the tender spot around his black eye with his hoof. \"Believe me, I'm going to pay for trying to manipulate things. And we didn't have much of a chance to sit down and discuss things until just now.\" He sighed and explained, \"But as far as your guess, you girls are mostly correct.

Well, Nightmare Moon was able to rally some support from various factions during that time. It was more like a war than a battle. Gryphons, minotaurs, even a dragon or two fought by her side. A few ponies even secretly joined cults dedicated to worshiping her. And after all these centuries, those cults still exist. The minotaurs and gryphons remember their old allegiance with her. In other words, this won't be anything like the timeline you remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The CMC looked nervous at that. For Sweetie Belle, Scootaloo, and Applebloom, the memory of that Summer Sun celebration was filled mostly with terror for several hours, clinging together despite not being friends yet. For Nyx, it was another story: she had heard about what Twilight and her friends had been through. She had thought that the height of what could happen to somepony trying to confront Nightmare Moon. The thought of the Mare in the Moon having allies, people who would fight for her, was boggling. And it frightened Nyx.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Still, there was something she felt aside from fear: determination. \"It doesn't matter if she has allies or not.

YAAAAAY!!!\" the four exclaimed, doing a group high-hoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Doctor had covered his ears prior to the explosion of sound. \"Ahem. Don't the four of you already have your Cutie Marks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The mares all looked sheepish. \"Well, that don't mean we have ta sit by and do nothin'!\" Applebloom said definitively. \"And besides, it's CMC tradition ta declare the latest adventure, whether ya got yer Cutie Mark or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So y'all were eager ta get yer Cutie Marks, huh?\" asked Rarity as she stepped back into the room, levitating a tray with glasses and sandwiches. She smiled knowingly at Sweetie Belle. \"Ya really are my sister's double, aren't ya? She was eager as all hay, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As the unicorn distributed the snacks, Nyx spared a look at her flank. Rather than the trio of diamonds she'd grown used to seeing, Nyx instead saw a blue starburst shattering a rock. <i>It makes sense,</i> she thought. <i>She's not our Rarity. She has a different talent... a different life.</i> She shook her head, and joined the others in making small-talk with Rarity. The unicorn didn't seem to have heard their discussion, which Nyx silently thought was all for the good. No need to put the rock farmer in a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The next day found Rarity and her time-traveling house-guests making their way to Ponyville. As they entered the village proper, they could hear a commotion going on in the town square. Trotting over, they saw a stage set up in the middle of town. On the stage were a minotaur, and a yellow pegasus pony with a bright pink mane and tail. Both were cropped somewhat short, allowing both of her cheery eyes to look at the world. This had to be Fluttershy. Currently, she was speaking in a loud, clearly audible voice: \"And so, that's how I defeated a Timber Wolf all by myself. A little laughter goes a long way!\" There was a roar of applause as the pegasus stepped off stage, allowing the minotaur to begin regaling the audience with his own stories of motivation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fluttershy was intercepted by Captain Twilight, and led over to the group. \"So, these are those 'time-traveling' fans of mine, eh, Twi?\" the yellow pegasus asked. \"Have to admit, never thought word-of-mouth could reach that far!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx smiled. \"Well, you'd be surprised at what we know. I'm Nyx, by the way. These are my friends Applebloom, Sweetie Belle, and Scootaloo, as well as the Doctor.\" She pointed at each pony in turn as she named them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Doctor held out a hoof. \"Nice to finally talk to you! I saw your show in Baltimare a few months ago. So inspiring!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fluttershy grinned. \"Wasn't it just? What part did you like the most? The part where I told my own story of dragging myself out of a rut, or the part where I gave the moral that time and effort can accomplish anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Both! I liked the whole seminar!\" replied the stallion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's great!\" Fluttershy enthused. \"Oh, it warms my heart that my speeches have such effects!\" Rarity and Twilight nodded, smiling as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What a load of horseapples.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Everypony turned to regard the speaker. Straight-maned and stern-faced, Pinkamena stood off to the side. \"You seriously can't find a better job than lying to ponies?\" she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fluttershy narrowed her eyes. \"Excuse me, I don't recall asking the opinion of a two-bit beat poet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pinkamena's eyes were cool as she regarded the pegasus. \"It's a free country, so I can say what I want. And at least my work pays me consistently. I don't have to rely on tips and handouts like an attention-horse showpony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fluttershy growled, but before she could pounce on the pink mare, Nyx stepped between them. \"That's enough! No reason to get into a fight over a difference of opinion!\" She turned to look at Pinkamena. \"Look, you said it yourself; it's a free country. Therefore, if Fluttershy wants to spread her message, she can. And really, there's nothing wrong with either of your lifestyles. Different ponies, different walks of life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The poet looked Nyx over, before giving a wry smirk. \"You do have a point. Very well, I won't press the issue.\" She began trotting off. \"And you'd know all about 'different walks of life', wouldn't you, Nightmare Moon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In a flash of black and purple, Nyx was in front of Pinkamena, giving her a death glare. \"Do not call me that again, or I will break those bongos of yours and feed them to you, piece by piece. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The pink mare gulped and nodded quickly, eyes wide. Applejack came up to the group at that point. \"Easy, there. There's no need to start a fight, here. I imagine we're all a little high-strung about the Summer Sun Celebration, that's all. So, why don't we all do what we can to prepare, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Applebloom blinked. \"Wait, don't you live in Manehattan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The businessmare smirked. \"Yeah, but as a company executive, I have the authority to come and visit the place where Princess Celestia will personally host the SSC.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight trotted up with a list. \"And, as it happens, I have a list of items that need to be prepared before the celebration begins tonight! So, let's get cracking!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Deep within the Everfree Forest, far along a path that no inhabitant of Ponyville dared to tread, two huts revealed the presence of those who didn't fear the forest's unnatural weather, or its dangerous flora and fauna. The larger hut was decorated with frightening looking Zebrican masks, while the smaller was instead surrounded by birdhouses and animal hutches. Her cloak removed, Rainbow Dash carefully removed the bandages from a blue jay's wing. \"Alright, soldier, let's see what you've got!\" Flapping her own wings, she pushed herself up off the ground and encouraged the bird to follow her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStretching its wings, the jay flapped its way up to a nearby branch. Then a higher one, and a higher one still, then started free-flying around the pegasus. \"Alright, looks like you're back in business! Now go on and fly back home, I'm getting sick of looking at you every day.\" Despite her words, she was smiling as the jay returned the expression and waved with its recently healed wing before flying away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny, you haven't taken your own advice yet,\" a playfully mocking voice told the pegasus. Dash looked down to see her mentor, Zecora, smirking up at her. \"Why don't you move out and go be a vet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash set down on a thick branch and replied, \"What? Me? Psh, yeah, right. Like <i>that's</i> ever gonna happen. Besides, if I give up the 'creepy witch doctor' schtick, it'll make pranking the town every Nightmare Night that much less hilarious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than respond directly to her student's far-too-obvious attempts to sound aloof, however, Zecora paused for a moment. \"Perhaps we should discuss the matter of Nightmare Moon. The fated hour is coming soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash looked down at the zebra. \"I already told you all about the Doctor and Nyx. Between them and the Guard Captain, there's probably nothing they can't fix. Plus, Celestia'll be there with soldiers by the score. If anyone, it's Nightmare Moon I feel sorry for.\" The pegasus crossed her forelegs behind her head and leaned back against the tree to get some rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than allow her to do so, however, Zecora turned around and bucked the tree as hard as she could, causing it to vibrate and knock Dash from her perch. Taken by surprise, the pegasus didn't even have time to spread her wings and soften the landing before landing flat on the ground with Zecora looking sternly down at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"According to the prophecies, this is no time for catching Z's. Now you listen carefully to your teacher! What happens next decides the fate of every creature! 'The stars will aid in her escape', it says. What does that mean? Care to take a guess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash groaned and rubbed her head. \"Come on, I'm bad enough at riddles without a concussion too... Whoever wrote it probably just threw it in because they thought it sounded poetic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or Nightmare Moon will be aided by powers dark,\" Zecora rebutted, offering a hoof to help Rainbow Dash stand again. Looking her student directly in the eye, she asked, \"That Twilight Sparkle... what is her cutie mark?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash blinked at the question. \"Stars, but...\" Her eyes went wide, then narrowed as she stood up and knocked away her teacher's hoof. \"Hold on, you did <i>not</i> go there! If we're talking about the same Twilight, I've never met a more loyal mare! If you think her betraying the princess is something that could come to pass, then you can take that idea and shove it right up your-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Assuming you know her as well as you think,\" Zecora interrupted, \"then let us step inside and relax with a drink. But Nightmare Moon's agents are many, with hearts black as sin. There may well be dangers to your friend waiting to strike from within. There may be nothing we can do to stop what is in motion, but if you are willing to try, I can teach you some new potions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash sighed and knew her mentor was probably right. Not about the idea that Twilight could be a mole, of course, but maybe somepony under her command. Nightmare Moon had inspired several cults during her war of terror a thousand years ago, and some of them were still around, biding their time and waiting for the moment to bring their dark mistress back. During her time living with the zebra, Dash had heard Zecora's stories about how she had hunted down and exposed many such cults in her native Zebrica, before she had traveled to settle in Equestria and make what preparations she could before the thousandth year approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the thought of her friend and the princess she served possibly being betrayed, Rainbow Dash joined Zecora in her hut. If there was going to be a war, better for the pegasus to have all the weapons she could gather up at her disposal. Not that she didn't trust Twilight to have everything well in hoof, of course. Knowing the unicorn, she had everything buttoned up tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor! Doctor!\" Twilight Sparkle ran up to the brown stallion as he and the Cutie Mark Crusader's assisted in the preparations. \"I just found and arrested a couple of spies! They were disguised as you, actually. Would you like to come help me interrogate them to show that we know the jig is up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor coughed quietly and replied, \"Ah, yes, I figured that would be about now... rest assured, Captain Sparkle, neither of them are any threat to Equestria.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unicorn looked at the Doctor with a perplexed expression. \"You figured... what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking embarassed, the Doctor explained, \"Well, you see, Derpy (that is, my wife) and I were interested in seeing the Summer Sun Celebration while we were here. Being in the area, we thought that we might meet our doubles from this timeline while we were at it. So, while the Derpies were baking muffins together, my double and I compared notes when... well, you arrived.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight looked flustered, stammering, \"But... I... they were impostors... neither of them had a black eye...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I dare say one of them will now.\" Seeing the unicorn's expression, looking as though the ground had just fallen out from underneath her, he patted her on the shoulder and assured her, \"Oh, don't worry about it. A plate of English muffins with butter, and all will be forgiven. I can guarantee you that. It's all a bit timey-wimey, I know, and I would have warned you myself, but... well, I couldn't afford to risk a paradox.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right... paradox,\" Twilight replied in the voice of somepony who knew that she was going to be making one of the biggest apologies of her life in the near future. \"I... have to go.\" With that, she ran off as fast as she could toward the nearest bakery.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Applebloom had been assigned the task of applying detail repairs to various structures. Frankly, she didn't really see the need for this. It wasn't like Princess Celestia would unleash holy vengeance upon the town for something as small as a chipped window pane. Still, it was Twilight who'd asked her to do this, and the unicorn was famous (in both timelines) for being absolutely obsessive about making the Princess's visits be as perfect as ponily possible. <i>Ya'd figure Princess Celestia would tell Twi ta lighten up,</i> thought the craftsmare as she applied a fresh coat of paint to the peeling sign outside Town Hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As she put away her tools, she spotted something out of the corner of her eye. A blue unicorn with a white mane was trotting down the path nearby. Applebloom recognized him as Pokey Pierce, the pony who'd popped balloons at Diamond Tiara's cute-cea\u00f1era. She would have dismissed him, but she noticed a sack slung over his back. The sack was rather large, and was being held in place by Pokey's magic. Applebloom hesitated; she knew she should mind her own business, but at the same time, something about this seemed off. Giving in to her curiosity, she began discretely following the stallion. It was something she'd gotten better at over the years (with assistance from Pinkie Pie from time to time).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pokey trotted into an alleyway between two buildings. Looking around, he couldn't see anypony else. He then used a forehoof to slide a piece of the alley's floor aside. It was a secret passage! Pokey slunk inside, and the floor slid back into place moments later. Applebloom rushed over to it, pressing her ear to it. When she couldn't distinguish any hoofsteps on the other side, she carefully slid the secret entrance open herself. A set of stairs led down into a lamp-lit cavern. The craftsmare slid the secret door shut behind her, making sure not to make any noise. Going down the path, she saw that it split into three branches. Fortunately, Pokey was going rather slow, and she could still see him down the path he'd taken. Applebloom followed, using the secret arts of Pinkie-Jutsu to mask her hoofsteps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pokey came to a door, and opened it, slipping inside and shutting it before Applebloom could sneak in after him. She sighed a little at that; one lesson Pinkie hadn't taught her yet was how to get into places without being seen or using conventional means. Still, she wouldn't leave this place empty-hooved. She slid a glass out of her mane (another trick she'd learned from the party pony) and held it against the door. She could make out a conversation in progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"... ought to keep a better eye, Pokey. You're lucky you caught her, or else our whole plan could have been ruined!\" growled a female voice. Applebloom recognized it as Colgate's, the local dentist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's not my fault,\" insisted Pokey's voice. \"She snuck up on me. I never would have noticed if she hadn't bumped that vase. And I got what we were after, anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I suppose we ought to throw her in the dungeon with the other unfortunates who've happened across our plans,\" sighed another mare's voice. This one was unfamiliar to Applebloom, but it held a hint of culture that reminded the earth pony of Canterlot. And it seemed... musical, in a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Quite right,\" said Colgate. \"But first, hand over the gem, Pokey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was some rustling, as well as a masculine grumble. \"I hope our Lady finds this offering worth it. What would she want with a diamond, anyway? Wouldn't sapphires or amethysts be more appropriate for her return?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was the distinct sound of somepony being cuffed across the head. From the sound of the grunt, it was Pokey who'd been struck. \"For a unicorn, you're incredibly stupid, Pokey,\" Colgate scolded. \"The diamond is a necessary reagent for the spell we need our Lady to cast. With it, we shall receive a part of Her dark power, and we shall forever be Her favored!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"For the glory of Nightmare Moon!\" chorused the three ponies within the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was then that a fourth voice spoke up, groggy. \"Uuhh... what...? Oh. This... is bad, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Applebloom narrowly stifled a gasp. That was Derpy's voice! That, combined with what she'd just heard, was more than enough. It was time to call in the cavalry.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Applebloom quickly tucked the glass away as she turned tail. As much as she wanted to burst in and rescue Derpy from the cult's clutches right away, she had to acknowledge that one young earth pony didn't have very good odds against two unicorns and an unknown. No, the best thing to do right now would be to let the others know about this secret hideaway and return with Nyx, the Doctor, and a squad of Twilight's Guardsponies!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHurrying down the passageway, she reached the end and opened up the secret entrance. Looking down the alley, she could see Rarity across the street chatting with Pinkie... or rather, Pinkamena. Since they were too far away to call out to, Applebloom started galloping down the alley. Once she was out on the sidewalk again, she would be able to get Rarity's attention, and then-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStars. Stars and pain making the world explode as she suffered a sudden blow to the head, causing her to stumble and flop over. The last thing she saw as darkness filled her vision was the hooves of a lavender pegasus carefully setting down in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-ing out of our <i>secret</i> entrance, Pierce! That's twice somepony's been caught following you, now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally started to regain consciousness, Applebloom groggily opened her eyes slightly. The lantern light illuminating the room hurt like a knife through her eyes at first, but as she gradually came around, she found herself hanging by her forelegs, which were shackled to a dungeon wall. As she looked around, she could make out Derpy, who was held in similar restraints, and in front of her Pokey Pierce was arguing with a pegasus pony that Applebloom recognized as Cloud Kicker from Ponyville's weather team. At least, that was the case in her native timeline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you think it was me? She could've been spying on any one of us,\" Pokey protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it sure as hay wasn't me, because I'm the one who caught her,\" Cloud Kicker retorted. \"Octavia's been down here planning our next move the whole time, and Colgate's smart enough to keep from drawing attention to herself. You, on the other hand, can't seem to keep from sticking your horn in everything and making a scene.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPokey grimaced. \"Yeah, and <i>you</i> would know all about where I've stuck my horn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you were just as clumsy with it then, too,\" Cloud Kicker snapped, making the stallion wither. She then noticed that Applebloom was awake and turned her attention away from Pokey to the chained earth pony. \"Well, well... you woke up fast. But you Apples always did have a reputation for having thick skulls, even after your big sis decided you were too gentrified to stick around in Ponyville.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pegasus sauntered over with what looked to Applebloom like a predatory gleam in her eye. Cloud Kicker even licked her lips as she sized up the young mare. \"Mmmm, though it certainly doesn't look like city living's made you soft,\" she mused in a way that made Applebloom shudder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the posh Canterlot-accented voice from earlier interrupted. \"Enough, Kicker. You can indulge in wanton hedonism all you like once we've received our lady's blessing. Until then, I need you to remain focused on the task at hand.\" The voice belonged to a grey earth pony mare with a darker grey mane and purple eyes. Applebloom caught a glimpse of the pony's flank, spotting a purple treble clef for a cutie mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our plan hinges on being covert,\" the earth pony said, approaching Applebloom and Derpy. \"So having this many spies on our trail when we're so close to our goal is unacceptable. Pokey, you're going to be assigned to something a little less conspicuous for the time being. You already procured the diamond, so you have done more than enough. Cloud Kicker, you stay here and assist me in the interrogation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile a somewhat dejected Pokey slunk away, Cloud Kicker smirked and flitted off to the back of the dungeon. Glaring down at the grey mare, Applebloom asked, \"Y'all ain't getting nothin' from me! Ah won't talk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOctavia smirked. \"My dear, I have no intention of making you talk. After all, I am a musician by trade.\" Cloud Kicker returned, carrying a tray of medical instruments. \"I intend to make you <i>sing</i>.\"</span></div></div>",

Unless you would care to join these two in chains?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, kinky. I like the way you think, Octy.\" When Octavia turned a scathing glare on her, though, she sighed, \"I miss Blossomforth... <i>She</i> understands me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOctavia pressed her hoof against her forehead. She couldn't imagine it being this difficult to gather minions of proper quality in Manehattan or Fillydelphia. But with Celestia having chosen to visit the outdoor insane asylum otherwise known as Ponyville this year, her hoof had been forced. With a quiet groan, she muttered to herself, \"Steady now, Octavia... soon you'll be able to plunge this glorified suburb into a symphony of darkness...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this little affirmation, she focused her irritation on the two captives. \"Now then. Since we have wasted so much time as it is, why don't we skip past the overture and go straight to the first movement? Do you know how many nerve endings are in your hooves? Most ponies don't think about it much, but it's quite a few. Allow me to demonstrate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOctavia then reached for the tools and medical instruments with her mouth, picking up a small hammer. Looking at Applebloom's defiant glare, she focused on the farm filly. \"Kiggr, hlld hrr eghs,\" she said around the hammer. After taking a moment to mentally translate, Cloud Kicker dutifully came up and took hold of Applebloom's hind legs to hold them in place. And judging by the grin on her face, she was enjoying the opportunity more than was professionally necessary, even by evil cult standards. More importantly, though, was the way Octavia was focusing on her hooves with that hammer in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplebloom had cracked her hoof once, years ago when attempting to be a Cutie Mark Crusader Base Jumper, so in answer to Octavia's rhetorical question, she <i>did</i> have a good idea of how much it was going to hurt and absolutely no desire to repeat the experience. She struggled and squirmed to get her legs free from Cloud Kicker's grip, and did her very best not to think about how much the perverted pegasus was likely enjoying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOctavia took her time drawing it out, carefully aiming and rolling her neck around to limber it up. She pulled back to swing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to eat my muffin, Cloud Kicker!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy's sudden outburst startled everypony, but especially Cloud Kicker. \"Really?\" she asked hopefully, looking toward the shackled pegasus and loosening her grip just enough for Applebloom to pull one leg free and kick Cloud Kicker in the face! Octavia was just starting to swing her hammer as Applebloom knocked the pegasus away, and instead of her hammer splitting open her prisoner's hoof, it hit only empty air while Applebloom wrapped both legs around Octavia's neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she had the evil earth pony caught, Applebloom said to her, \"As a matter o' fact, ah know what a cracked hoof feels like. Question is, do y'all know how much leg strength it takes t' snap a whack-job's spine? Ah'll give ya a hint, it ain't as much as it takes t' work Applebuckin' Season!\" With a grin, she looked over at the wall-eyed prisoner on the wall beside her. \"Quick thinkin', Mrs. Hooves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerpy gave a small, proud smile and shrugged as best she could while hanging by her forelegs. \"Oh, I get a good idea now and then. So you're the Applebloom from my world? Does that mean the Doctor...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brought the whole Cutie Mark Crusader Cavalry! Now we just gotta get outta here.\" Octavia was fighting against her, but the farm filly had her in a position that she couldn't break out of easily, as well as a noticeable strength advantage over the sadistic cellist. Maybe it would have been a <i>little</i> more of a challenge if they were in a hoof-wrestling contest, but the ponies who could beat an Apple when it came to their bucking legs were few and far between.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Cloud Kicker start to shake off the effects of her earlier kick to the face, Applebloom increased the pressure on Octavia's throat slightly. \"Alright, Kicker, here's how it goes!

Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud Kicker groaned and rubbed her head where she was struck, but saw the position Octavia was in. The musician didn't say anything, purple eyes focused on her. \"Yeah... yeah, I got it.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cloud Kicker wasn't an ordinary weather pony. She had once attended West Hoof Academy, a military academy that many Royal Guards attended. She learned a few things there, notably loyalty. But she had learned something else while in Ponyville; sometimes, it was best to cut your losses and run. And that's precisely what she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ignoring the angry calls of the earth pony filly, she turned and ran from the room, using the wind from her wake to close the door behind her. She then ran for the main entrance of the underground tunnel system, before pausing. She turned around, and headed for what had been dubbed her 'quarters', though calling them that was perhaps dignifying them too much. In reality, it was a glorified closet, with barely enough room for a mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was a reason most of the cultists decided to continue actually living in Ponyville proper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At her quarters, Cloud Kicker retrieved her 'collection': a series of Playcolt magazines. She grinned at the top cover. Blossomforth, an old flame, was featured on that one, and seeing her made the weather mare want to find her and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She shook her head wildly. <i>She's in Canterlot now, since Octy 'promoted' her. She's out of reach for the moment. Just got to get out of here with this, and lay low, and hopefully Octy will get the situation back under control.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cloud Kicker wasn't afraid of Apple Bloom following through on her threat. While the Apples were an honest bunch, they would never seek to deliberately harm somepony else, let alone kill them. <i>Still can't believe a city filly like her has flanks that toned...</i> she mused idly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She went back to the main entrance, sliding the alley floor out of the way, and closing it behind her, all while whistling a merry tune. Her whistling stopped when she came face-to-face with none other than the Captain of the Royal Guard, with a group of six other guards behind her. She thought of only one thing to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm going to kill Pokey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Back in the 'interrogation' room, Apple Bloom cursed as the door closed behind Cloud Kicker. \"Well, ain't that lovely? Nice minion ya got, there,\" she mocked Octavia, before throwing the musician a good twenty feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Octavia coughed as she rubbed her neck where the filly's hooves had been wrapped. \"Good help is hard to find, I admit,\" she gasped. \"Though I admit, I never thought a city filly like yourself would have such strength in her hind legs. Don't you live a sedentary lifestyle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Apple Bloom was about to reply, when she paused. <i>Ah don't want this whackjob ta know ah'm from another timeline.</i> Outwardly, she shrugged. \"Ah exercise a lot. Jus' 'cause ah live in the city don't mean ah gotta be lazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Quite,\" Octavia gave a knowing smile. \"I suppose that part of an earth pony's ethic is something we have in common.\" She coughed again, and her look hardened. \"Still, this has only given you a reprieve. I'll simply fetch Colgate, and have her assist me in this interrogation. I do think you'll find it far harder to distract her.\" She turned around, and headed for the door. \"I'll be back in a minuette.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When she had left, Apple Bloom sighed. \"Well, can't say ah didn't try,\" she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You did your best,\" Derpy replied. \"But why ask for me to be set free first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah was keepin' the grey psycho in place.

She headed back towards the town square, where the group had agreed to meet once they were finished with the items on their lists. Nyx had drawn quite a few stares from the townsponies, but the reassurances of Twilight and Applejack were enough to get ponies to leave her be for the most part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As she approached, she saw Sweetie Belle, the Doctor, and Scootaloo already there. In addition, Applejack, Fluttershy, and Twilight were talking together, while Rarity and Pinkamena spoke off to the side. That last part confused Nyx; she never would have suspected the rock farmer and the beat poet would get along. Rarity often grew exasperated with Pinkie back in her own timeline. Still, she put that aside for the moment, approaching Twilight. \"All done, Captain!\" she reported.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good. Now, did you triple-check that you'd done everything correctly?\" asked the lavender unicorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx barely suppressed an eye-roll. \"Yes, I did. And yes, I triple-checked that I'd triple-checked, and then checked once more just to be safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight's mouth closed with an audible *click!*. \"Um, wow. You seem to know just what it is I expected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx smirked. \"Well, I know you rather well in my home timeline, and I figured if something would be consistent, it'd be your obsessive nature when it comes to organizing things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight blushed at that as Fluttershy and Applejack laughed. \"She's got you there, Twilight!\" Applejack managed to get out through her guffaws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx chuckled as well, then looked at her friends. \"Hey, girls, have you seen Applebloom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sweetie looked over, and shook her head. \"Nope. Then again, she's got all that detail work to do, so it might be a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"True,\" Nyx conceded. She looked over at Rarity and Pinkamena. \"I'm still having trouble with Pinkamena over there,\" she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, she means well,\" Fluttershy said, surprisingly. \"She's just a bit melancholy, and doesn't seem to know a good joke when she sees one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's the trouble,\" Nyx sighed. \"In my timeline, she's the most energetic, happy-go-lucky pony around. She throws a party for every new pony that comes to Ponyville. Seeing her like this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, that sounds rather nice,\" Applejack said. \"What happened to me in your timeline?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx smiled wanly. \"Well, during your visit in Manehattan, you saw a rainbow when you were lamenting leaving the farm. You followed it, and it led you right back to the farm, and you became one of its proprietors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Applejack sighed, lowering her head. \"I do regret leaving the farm sometimes... but I can do so much good as I am right now. But... is my other self happy, at least?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Very much so,\" Nyx nodded. \"You even inherited your father's Stetson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The loan mare smiled sadly. \"Big Macintosh got it in this timeline,\" she said. \"I can't imagine what it would look like on me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fluttershy coughed. \"So what about me and Iron Will?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx blushed. \"Um, about that... you two never met up until later in your lives. Instead, you take care of all the little woodland creatures in a cottage by the Everfree Forest. Also, you're a lot more... timid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The pegasus cocked her head quizzically. \"Wow. I never outgrew my timid phase?\" She paused, putting a hoof to her chin. \"Actually, my hubby helped a lot with that. So, if we never met up, I guess I can see how I never came out of my shell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The one time you two did meet, it was a near disaster. He tried to make you more assertive, but it worked a little too well. You became a bully,\" Nyx added, her blush intensifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fluttershy sighed. \"So, he never outgrew his 'so boisterous it hurts' phase, either.\" She smiled. \"If we hadn't met when we did here, we'd be completely different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's the truth,\" Twilight nodded. \"Nyx told me last night that I actually got into Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns, even though I flunked the entrance exam in this timeline. Also, something about being Princess Celestia's <i>personal</i> apprentice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, ain't that just dandy!\" Rarity said, trotting over, followed by Pinkamena. \"Makes me wonder what happened ta me over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx smiled. \"Well, that rock your horn led you to got cracked open, revealing dozens of gems. You took them home and used them to spruce up the costumes for that play. You're now one of the most successful fashion designers in Equestria, having gotten the attention of Hoity Toity, Sapphire Shores, and the like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rarity whistled. \"So there <i>is</i> somethin' in that big ol' rock! It's actually on Cliffton Acres, but it's so big nopony's bothered with it. Ah'll have to give it a nice buck sometime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's all well and good,\" Pinkamena said tonelessly, \"but why is everything so different? Why is your timeline so different from ours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx sighed. \"It's because Fluttershy never met Rainbow Dash in flight camp,\" she revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wait, what?\" Fluttershy asked with a blink. \"What do me and the 'Rainbow Witch Doctor' have to do with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Everything.\" Nyx gathered her thoughts. \"You and Rainbow Dash met at flight camp in our timeline when you were being harassed by some bullies. She stepped in, and challenged the bullies to a race. During the race, you were knocked off of Cloudsdale, and were caught by a swarm of butterflies before you hit the ground.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're telling us one race made all the difference?\" Twilight asked, arching an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not just the race,\" Nyx replied. \"What happened <i>during</i> the race. One of the bullies tried knocking Rainbow off-course. She managed to catch up and win the race... by performing a Sonic Rainboom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Everypony's jaw fell open. \"But that's just a Cloudsdale legend!\" Fluttershy exclaimed. \"No living pony's ever come close to performing one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And that Rainboom had effects all over Equestria,\" Nyx continued. She looked at Fluttershy. \"When the explosion from the Rainboom startled all the animals, you coaxed them out of hiding, and comforted them, earning your Cutie Mark.\" Next, she turned to Applejack. \"It was the rainbow from the Rainboom that led you back to your farm.\" Rarity. \"The shockwave cracked open that rock, revealing the gems.\" Twilight. \"The explosion startled you so much, your magic spun out of control, and you actually hatched the dragon egg.\" Pinkamena. \"When you saw the Rainboom, you were filled with wonder and laughter, and you brought that gift to your family, and everypony else you met ever since.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The five mares were silent, dumbstruck by the revelation. \"Hon, that's gotta be the biggest stretch ah've ever heard,\" Rarity finally said. \"Yer tellin' me that me and five other mares all got their Cutie Marks and different destinies because of the same event?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"She's telling the truth,\" Pinkamena stated, eyes wide with amazement. \"It sounds crazy, but it's true!\" She looked down. \"So cruel... Why did you have to tell us that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You asked,\" Nyx replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight frowned. \"Wait a minute. What is the significance of all that? Why are the six of us important?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx gulped, but was spared having to answer by Pinkamena suddenly scratching at her neck. \"Itchy neck...\" she glanced around. \"Something's wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What do you mean?\" asked Applejack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Pinkie Sense,\" Nyx replied, standing alert. \"Itchy neck means there's somepony spying on us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The pink mare looked at her oddly. \"You really know me that well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx nodded. \"You're a very good friend, Pinkamena.\" She glanced around, trying to locate the spy.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pokey Pierce grumbled to himself as he left the hidden base. He had been told to lay low, but it wasn't as though he was going to do anything that would draw any more attention. He was just going to get something to eat from one of those stalls that was setting up for the Summer Sun Celebration. After all, just because he was a member of an organization dedicated to overthrowing Celestia and destroying everything the celebration stood for, that didn't mean he couldn't enjoy a funnel cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as he walked the street, seeing the preparations being made, that was when he saw... <i>her</i>. Pokey felt his heart stop in his chest as right there in the street, there stood a mare that he was certain had to be an hallucination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his eyes, she was the pinnacle of perfection. A tall black mare, fit and muscular, but so graceful and femininely proportioned at the same time. Through a long, flowing purple mane that seemed to dance around her face with every movement, a long black horn projected from her head. And her eyes! Those weren't pony eyes, with their vertically slitted pupils set in irises of sparkling turquoise, but the eyes of a goddess. So entranced was he by her face that it wasn't until she ruffled her wings that his gaze was drawn to the motion, and he realized that she had some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery facet... every detail... it all added up in his shocked mind and told him that he was looking at Nightmare Moon returned fully incarnate! But that was completely impossible. He and his group hadn't carried out the ritual to set their goddess free, and even if she had somehow slipped out of her lunar prison sooner than expected, there should be a greater outcry. A wailing cry of despair among the foalish sheep-ponies loyal to Celestia beheld Equestria's true dread ruler!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, his goddess was just standing there. Watching the preparations while levitating a scroll in front of her face. And smiling as she checked things off on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPokey's heart suddenly shifted gears from Neutral to Overdrive as he stared at Nightmare Moon. No, she couldn't be here. Not physically, anyway. It was a vision! That's right, he was being rewarded for his hard work in preparing for her return by getting blessed with a vision of his dark mistress! That was the only thing that made sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a sign that even in her prison on the moon, her spirit was watching them. Ensuring that everything was ready for her glorious return! And the fact that she had chosen to appear before him meant that he was favored by Nightmare Moon, no matter what that snob Octavia or that tramp Cloud Kicker said! And sweet Moon did his goddess have some amazing flanks, even though he had always been told that her cutie mark was a crescent moon, not a dark blue shield. But since the shield had a gleam to it that <i>resembled</i> a crescent moon, he figured that it was a minor detail that had been forgotten in the last thousand years. No, the only thing that was truly important was that she had chosen him to grant this vision to. This was for him and him alo--why was she walking over to that group of ponies?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy was she talking to the Captain of Celestia's Royal Guard?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why were they talking back to her?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPokey felt his breath catch in his lungs as his goddess had what looked like a breezy chat with a group of mares, some of which he recognized from around town, and that weird brown stallion with the hourglass cutie mark. And they could see her. And they were talking to her. And nopony was bowing or pleading for mercy! The unicorn stallion's mind reeled, trying in vain to make sense of what he was seeing, but this was the opposite of sense! It wasn't nonsense, it was <i>anti</i>-sense!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps it wasn't really his goddess, he thought, though that idea clamped down around his heart like a fish in a gryphon's claws. But then he realized that even if it wasn't Nightmare Moon incarnate he was watching, she <i>could</i> be. The gorgeous alicorn fit all the criteria, physically, so once his group called the spirit of Nightmare Moon back to Equestria, wouldn't this one make the perfect vessel? Oddly, he didn't entirely know how to feel about that, but as long as he had a goal to work toward, it gave him something to focus on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, this rumination happened to come at around the same time that Pinkamena's neck started itching, and when he set his sights on the faux-Nightmare and her companions, he found them all setting their sights on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, horsefeathers,\" he muttered before turning tail and bolting away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get him!\" Nyx and Twilight were the first to react, giving chase once the unicorn eying them tried to flee. In actuality, they hadn't really known who was spying on them. The appearance of their little group, especially Nyx, continued to draw quite a few curious stares. It was the fact that he started running that told them the blue stallion was the one watching them with ill intent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you teleport in front of him, I'll get him from behind,\" Nyx suggested to Captain Sparkle as the two of them galloped after the spy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teleport?! How the hay am I supposed to teleport?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx only refrained from facehoofing at her error to keep from tripping as she ran. \"Oh... right. Sorry! I'll try to cut him off, then!\" Spreading her wings, she used her forward momentum to lift off with a few powerful flaps, giving her enough altitude to soar after the fleeing unicorn. While the earth pony part of her heritage kept her from being as nimble in the air as a pegasus, she could lock her wings into place like an eagle and glide along the air currents. Not having to flap her wings to maintain lift also gave her another advantage in that it allowed her to concentrate on using unicorn magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer horn glowed briefly, building up a magical charge before releasing it as a bolt of lightning that hit the ground in front of the spy, causing him to rear up and change directions. Nyx adjusted her course slightly, sending more bolts down around Pokey, herding him back around toward the others where they could circle around him, leaving him nowhere to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that he was trapped, Pokey tried to summon his own magic, only to get surrounded by a field of purple energy that lifted him up and started shaking, rattling his concentration to the point where there was no way for him to focus on casting a spell. When he was set down again, his eyes rolled around and around in his head as Captain Sparkle's armored form loomed over him. \"Let's see if we can get some answers out of this guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The other was a yellow earth pony mare with a red mane; she somehow followed me into the passage leading to our secret hideout.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And both times, you were at fault for not noticing them?\" growled Nightmare Moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The stallion planted his face into the ground. \"Forgive me, my Lady!

I might visit while I still have some time left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Of course!\" Pokey nodded eagerly. \"It's down the alleyway between Sugarcube Corner and Quills &amp; Sofas.

As Twilight raised a hoof to argue, Nyx continued. \"First of all, I still have quite a bit of magic left over, even after using that lightning and the illusion. Second, my first and oldest friend is down there, possibly being tortured by cultists. Third, my Cutie Mark is a shield for a reason; I protect ponies who need it. And right now, Applebloom needs it.\" She stared down this version of her adoptive mother, willing her to go along with her arguments.</span></div></div>",

I appreciate how you must be feeling, but I'm asking you to trust me in this. I've handled this sort of situation before. This is what I've been trained for, and I swear on my honor as Captain of the Guard that my people and I will do everything in our power to bring your friends back safe and sound. In return, I need your word that you won't do anything to interfere, because the more variables there are in play, the more things can go wrong. Can you give me that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx's eyes turned downcast. Of course she wanted to help, but it was hard to argue with her mother's alternate, especially when she spoke with that sort of conviction. Her own Twilight Sparkle would be fretting over everything that could possibly go awry, but as she looked back up into the Captain's violet eyes, she saw steely determination there. A look that told Nyx that this Twilight had already factored in what they had been told and would ensure that she played out the best-case scenario, no matter what came up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt actually reminded the alicorn of Rainbow Dash, in a way, albeit with strategy replacing recklessness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a soft sigh. \"You're right.\" But it was Applejack who said that, not Nyx. The orange businesspony stepped forward to put a hoof on Captain Sparkle's shoulder. \"The last thing you need is for us to get in the way. I know that if anypony can handle this, it's you, so we'll leave you to it.\" With a strained, wry little smile, she added, \"But as much as I pay in taxes to pay for all your training and armor, you had <i>better</i> deliver results.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight smirked a little, but the steel never left her eyes as she nodded. \"You have my word.\" With that, she turned to gather the nearest Guard ponies as quickly as she could for the coming raid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was out of earshot, Applejack turned to the rest and said, \"Alright, everypony, I believe I know of other entrances. A few years back, a swarm of monsters came out of the Everfree Forest, so my company helped finance a network of underground shelters. While the Guard take the front door, we can sneak up on those Nightmare cultists from behind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor and the Crusaders all stared blankly at Applejack. Eventually, it was Sweetie Belle who broke the silence, saying, \"But... you said...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what I <i>said</i>,\" Applejack replied impatiently, \"but even if your friend isn't exactly <i>my</i> little sister, she's still an Apple. And whatever some ponies might think, we Apples take care of one another! Now, are you going to come with me, or just stand there staring like a bunch of slack-jawed yokels?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she took off, the others following behind after a moment of hesitation. Taking up the rear along with the Doctor, Scootaloo asked the stallion, \"So to recap: Rarity's dirty, Fluttershy's confident, Pinkie's mopey, Twilight's tough, Rainbow Dash is a witch, and now Applejack lies... Are you sure this isn't the timeline where everypony got replaced by Changelings?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's a Changeling?\" Rarity asked, overhearing the pegasus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor cleared his throat and replied, \"Oh, well... nothing you need to worry about. Though I would recommend that you not get <i>too</i> carried away if you get invited to any weddings.\"</span></div></div>",

Her thoughts moved onto strategy and tactics. On her side were whatever guards were unoccupied at the moment while the enemy had a Pegasus, an Unicorn and a 'coordinator' which was of unknown species. The opposition also had two hostages which may or may not help once freed. She'd be underground so unless the tunnels were quite expansive, any bonus from flight would be negated. Finding herself outside the outpost door, she ran a couple scenarios through her head, trying to find what would be optimal for the raid. \"Either 6 Unicorns or 3 Unicorns with 6 Earth reinforcements.\" She nodded and opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0As luck would have it, 5 Unicorns were lounging in the rec room. Two stood next to a table, watching another pair whack a Ping-pong ball at each other. The last had his nose in a book next to the door. Twilight coughed to attract his attention. He looked up from the book and, upon noticing her Captain insignia, abruptly stood and called out. \"Officer on deck!\" The other four stopped their game and face the door, the front right hoof up at the forehead. \"At ease.\" The hooves returned to the ground. \"Men, we have a situation.

Valour, with me.\" Sparkle and Valour head down the middle route. They come across a door. \"Valour, get in position.\" \"Ma'am.\" Valour stands in front of the door and gets ready to knock the door down. Twilight charges a blast and gives a nod.

The geography is very different. As a result, the nation of Equestria that we know doesn't exist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Fascinating,\" Nyx remarked, taking notes down on a notepad with a quill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Doctor blinked at the sudden appearance of the items, but continued. \"Now, there are a few major nations in this world: Colton, Clydecyan, Stabul, Maresidia, Trotta, and Epona. Of these, Colton is militarily the strongest, with the advent of the airship - flying ships that are powered by propellers. Colton's premier air force, the Red Wings, is issued orders by their king, and they carry them out with relative ease, under the command of their captain, Twilight Sparkle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was a large scratching sound as the quill suddenly veered straight off the pad. \"Wait, what? Mom's in the military?\" Nyx asked, flabbergasted. \"What about Uncle Shiney?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Doctor coughed. \"From what I can tell, this Twilight Sparkle is an only child. At the very least, I haven't been able to find hide nor hair of Shining Armor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I see...\" Nyx murmured. <i>It makes sense</i>, she thought. <i>Just because this mare has the same name as Mom, it doesn't mean she's led the same life.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before the Doctor could continue, Scootaloo piped up. \"What about Rainbow Dash? She's still awesome, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Doctor smiled. \"Well, Rainbow Dash is the leader of Colton's dragoons - warriors who train themselves in the art of the spear, and diving on enemies from on high, like a dragon. Most dragoons are, therefore, pegasi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Scootaloo grinned. \"Sweet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So what about Rarity?\" asked Sweetie Belle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Looking up for a moment, the stallion replied, \"Rarity is a white mage, a wielder of magic designed to heal and protect. She's also quite skilled with a bow. Oh, and she owns her own fashion shop in the town of Colton.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sweetie Belle smiled. \"What do you know? The more things change...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Quite,\" the Doctor chuckled. \"Now, I haven't really been able to locate anypony else in this world. I'm fairly certain, however, that Applejack, Fluttershy, and Pinkie Pie exist somewhere. They just aren't anywhere in Colton, where I've focused my research.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Applebloom sagged a little, but then brightened. \"Ah, well. Applejack's a tough pony, no matter what timeline she's from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's the spirit!\" the Doctor nodded. \"Ah, yes. One more thing.\" He turned to Nyx. \"By any chance, have you learned to disguise your true nature, Nyx? Alicorns are so rare as to be considered nigh-mythical in this timeline. And there's no trace of Celestia or Luna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx's eyes widened briefly, but then she nodded. \"I understand.\" Her horn began to glow, and her form followed moments later. After a few minutes, the glow faded, revealing a navy blue earth pony that wasn't yet a mare, but was just out of fillyhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey!\" Scootaloo exclaimed, seeing this. \"Why aren't you a pegasus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Or a unicorn?\" asked Sweetie Belle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx smirked. \"Well, Celestia becomes a pegasus whenever she disguises herself to hide among her subjects, while Luna becomes a unicorn. So, I just figured I'd complete the trifecta.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, ah ain't complainin'!\" Applebloom said with a grin. \"Besides, it was me an' Twist, a couple of Earth Ponies, that were your first real friends, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"True enough,\" Nyx admitted. She glanced at the other two senior Crusaders. \"Not that you two aren't my friends, but I met Applebloom and Twist before I met either of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay, I'll accept that,\" Scootaloo said with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Excellent!\" The Doctor exclaimed. \"Now, if I've done my calculations correctly, we should be just outside the outskirts of Colton.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sweetie Belle blinked. \"Um, Doctor, we haven't moved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Going to the door, Applebloom opened it, and blinked. \"Uh... yeah we have. But ah don't see no castle.\"</span></div></div>",

How did you get aboard my ship?\" Applebloom looked into the face of a unicorn she would usually call a minor nuisance at worst, and her sister's eggheaded friend at best. This face, however, was stern, cold, and wary. A blade of black steel was unsheathed, but not wielded threateningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor pushed past Applebloom and out onto the ship, seemingly not noticing all the guards surrounding them. \"Blast, I didn't have the co-ordinates set for Colton at all, I must have used them to track- Twilight! Ah, there you are, old girl! How have you been, I mean, look at you!\" The Doctor gave Twilight a wide grin, and she frowned, but hesitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know my name, stranger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry, thought it would be obvious. You're just one of the most well known Dark Knights that protect Colton, of course! I'm The Doctor, that's it, just 'Doctor', and these are my faithful companions, Applebloom, Sweetie Belle, Scootaloo, and Dawn.\" Nyx nodded and smiled, wondering why the Doctor hadn't just used her real name. She decided to put it out of her mind for now, though, and tried to keep up with the Doctor's wild ramblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... And I'm a big fan, you see, and I wanted to show them the great city of Colton, as well as introduce them to you, and I guess you must have been closer than Colton was to our starting point, because we're here instead. I'd leave right away, but I cannot at the moment, because the TARDIS can only teleport once a day, and we cannot do so until tomorrow.\" An obvious lie if you knew the Doctor, but Twilight seemed to buy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. You will be checked for weapons, and then shown to a room. We sleep in shifts when at full staff, so you'll be sharing with Platoon Three. Look See!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Captain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show our guests to where they shall be staying. We shall let this... Doctor... keep the key to his contraption. They are to be treated as guests, with the best of Colton Hospitality. Is that understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll guards and crew members in earshot hollered \"Yes, Captain!\" before going back to their patrols, maintenance or otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that went surprisingly well for ad-libbing your way into a Captain's trust,\" Nyx teased the Doctor. He just smiled honestly in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weeell, being around your mum for so long must be rubbing off on me. It doesn't matter where we are, or what she is, it seems that she's always got a few consistencies. You just have to touch on those to get her to accept you. It's actually getting to know ponies that takes real work.\" The Doctor laughed, but Nyx just looked at the ground, getting lost in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are, Doctor and company. This is where you'll be sleeping for your shift.\" Nyx looked up at the spacious if spartan room, filled with bunks, hammocks, and lockers. There didn't seem to be enough for a whole platoon, but she guessed that was the point. Ponies would share the beds, lockers, everything. Nyx turned to look at their guide, a resplendent green pegasus with binoculars for a cutiemark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for having us, and I hope we don't interrupt the sleeping shifts any.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLook See smiled. \"It's no trouble, this platoon is one of the smaller ones, so we'll have the space. Don't you worry about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx nodded, smiling, before turning away. \"I really like your mane, Dawn. The way you've styled it is something that wouldn't last long on an airship, not unless Lady Rarity was there to help.\" Look See giggled as Nyx blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, um... I don't know how, but it usually fixes itself. It's like it has a mind of its own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLook See laughed again and left the four of them to situate themselves. As soon as she was out of earshot, the Doctor whipped out his Sonic Screwdriver and began waving it around before squinting at the side of it. \"Now that's weird...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScootaloo hopped off the hammock she'd been laying on and trotted over. \"What's weird?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing. And that's the weird thing. At this time of day, there'd be at least one encounter with some sort of flying beast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flying beast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, this world is inhabited by many sorts of monsters and undead creatures, of all sorts and sizes and strengths. In this world, most 'non-combatants' are children, scholars, or bards. Every able-bodied pony has some knowledge of magic or fighting. And those monsters and beasts usually leave an energy signature that my sonic screwdriver can pick up. Like an early warning system, almost. Why, it can-\" Suddenly, the screwdriver pinged, and the whole ship shuddered as something slammed into its side. \"We need to get topside, and fast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote: I've only ever played FF 7 and FF 13, so I literally have no idea what kind of monsters could attack an airship. Sorry 'bout that.</span></div></div>",

I will not let ponies die if I am there to help!\" Nyx suddenly gained a burst of speed, barely touching the ground as she veered through the halls towards the airship's deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blast,\" The Doctor muttered. \"Well, let's shake a leg, you two! Come along, hop to it!\" Another roar sounded, and the ship seemed to drop beneath the three ponies' hooves. \"We need to get out there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx burst through the hatch that led below, and skidded to a halt when she saw the great dragon attacking the ship. The other ships in the armada seemed to be dealing with their own dragons, but the behemoth on the flagship was easily twenty times the size as any others. Twilight was just sending her sword out in an arc, a wave of dark magic slicing at the dragon and angering it. Nyx leapt and slammed into the Red Wing Captain, right before the dragon could cook her in her armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here, civilian?! We're under attack! Get below decks! NOW!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Nyx jumped onto the dragon, her hidden horn flashing as a sword* came into existence. \"Not today, beast!\" She brought the sword down atop the Dragon's head, barely scratching it but still keeping it from attacking anypony else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon reached up with a hand to tear her off, but she danced around it, and the dragon howled in rage as it clawed itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon pulled away from the airship, the ship rocketing higher into the sky as the engines, which had been trying to stall their downward movement, were suddenly free. The Doctor, Sweetie Belle, and Apple Bloom burst through the hatch, Scootaloo propelling above them and staring at the dragon with wide eyes. \"Dawn! You go, filly! Woohoo! Show that dragon's who's boss!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx looked up at the name, seeing Scootaloo cheering her on. \"No problem! Yeeah!\" She brought the sword down again, smacking the but of it into the dragon's head. This time, instead of growling or roaring, the dragon just groaned, and started to sag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight saw this, and took aim. \"Good work, Dawn, you've stunned it. Now move out of the way!\" Twilight prepared her sword for another Dark Wave, and Nyx's eyes went wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, wait! Don't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shield!\" A large shield appeared around Nyx and the dragon, causing Twilight's attack to dissipate, and Rainbow to veer off course, lest she flatten herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rainbow Dash! How fare you in the fight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing well, Twi, but what the hay's her problem? We coulda killed that dragon easily!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to kill it! Just reason with it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't reason with monsters, you crazy fily! Now drop that shield spell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx, with how angry she was, couldn't help but slip into something she hadn't used since her last big temper tantrum: The Royal Canterlot Voice. <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>\"NAY! I SHALL NOT LET THY SWORDS SPILL THE BLOOD OF SUCH A MAGNIFICENT CREATURE, WHEN IT IS WITHIN MINE POWER TO STOP THIS AT ONCE!\"</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx then landed on the dragon's snout, and glared into its eyes, her own reverting to their draconic appearance. \"Now, why doth thou attack a vessel of the Red Wings this fine day? What reason could drive a creature of such a proud race to prey on those who slay only in the name of survival?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon, much to Twilight and Rainbow Dash's shock and amazement, spoke back in a deep, rumbling voice that seemed older than the land. <font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">\"We are in the middle of our centennial migration, Daughter of the Moon, and they were in our path. It is not a good idea to be in a dragon's path when it is in heat.\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I can understand your qualm, and I can hope that we could reach an agreement, if but only for this one chance: Spare us for our foolishness, for we did not know of this great ritual, and we shall give unto you the finest jewel held within the fleet. Does this sound agreeable?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon chuckled, the sound like distant thunder. <font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">\"You make a brave claim, and we will let you go this one time, without the charge. When next we migrate, however, there will be consequences if our path is blocked.\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx smiled and bowed low on the dragon's snout, her eyes once again becoming 'normal'. \"Thank you for your generosity, and your kind warning. I am sure that the Red Wings will take it to heart. If we ever meet again, I should like it to be in a moment of joy, not 'pon an open battlefield.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon smiled, lowering his head so Nyx could hop onto the flagship's main deck as her shield spell fell away. With a roar like the Eastern wind, he flew past the ship, the other dragons all drifting along in his wake. Nyx just smiled as she looked after them, before turning to find that everypony on board was staring at her in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A... Amazing,\" Twilight muttered as she removed her helmet. \"I have never seen anypony face down a dragon alone... and have <i>both</i> parties live.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the guards around her started cheering, while others looked to their captain for orders, while nervously casting glances at Nyx. Twilight smiled broadly and shouted for all the ships to hear, \"Stallions and Mares of the Red Wings, Ateeention!\" There was a booming chorus of \"Aye, Captain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight looked around. \"Report casualties!\" A pegasus swooped down, reporting two with injuries, but no deaths. Twilight let him go back to his post with a nod. \"Crew, salute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three cheers for Dawn! The Dragon Speaker!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urah! Urah! Urah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crew, take five!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye, aye!\" With that, Twilight turned around and headed for her on-board office, motioning for Nyx to follow after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dawn, come with me.

Standing before them in a Black armor, mane hanging straight, was Pinkie Pie. There was a black sword strapped to her back, positioned for easy access. She looked at them with serious and danger filled eyes, with a bit of something else in the very back of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you need something citizens?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor opened his mouth to say something, when he was cut off by a scream. The ponies all turned to see two griffons running way from a mare, both of them carrying bags that obviously belonged to her. Stupidly enough, they were charging straight towards the group, and the armor wearing Pinkie Pie they had just approached. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop! Thieves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie turned back to them, the expression on her face unchanged. \"Please hold be patient, and wait for me to finish this before announcing your grievances.\" And with that she turned back around to face the griffons. One of them reached her before the other, getting up on his back legs as he approached, and swinging a fist at her. She side stepped it, and without ever changing her expression from one of mild boredom, grabbed his arm with her hooves and Twisted it until Nyx heard the Bones snap like twigs in at lest three separate places. Pinkie turned around and kicked him in the face before he even had a chance to scream. The second Griffon tried to take off right over her, but she jumped up, grabbed his wing, and spun him until he slammed face first into the corner of a stone building. She then landed and promptly stomped on his wing so hard the stone beneath it cracked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then turned back to the group as if nothing had happened, and sat down. \"Thank you for waiting. What did you need?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say, was all that really necessary?\" The Doctor asked, pointing at the two thieves as the mare they had stolen from retrieved her bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost any other knight would have simply killed them and been done with it.\" Pinkie replied, as she crossed her forelegs defensively. \"Would you rather I do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! But really! Breaking his arm, and his wing like that...\" The Doctor continued to protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cripples do not fight in gladiator matches...yet another kindness I have shown them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kindness?! You call that kindness?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Considering who our king is...yes. I do.\" The Pink mare replied. \"I'm being as kind and honorable as I can, while still upholding my honorbound duty to serve our king. Unless there is a successful rebellion, I can do no more that what you have already seen me do to protect the people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...what did you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...right now I'd like to know who you are.\" The Doctor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pinkamina Dianne, the Knight of Shadow, Daughter of Scorpan. Is there anything else you wish to know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Can you direct me to Sugarcube corner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight paused, her expression remaining the same as it always had, but there was some thing like a twinkle in her eyes that had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If your going there in the hopes of joining into Rebellion centered activities, then you should know the guard is going to launch a strike against them soon.\" The pink mare turned and started to walk away, before pausing and looking back over her shoulder at the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell anypony that I was the one who told you that, and you will not have a tongue tomorrow when you awaken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd on that cheerful note, Pinkie left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeeze, talk about being intense.\" Scootaloo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could she be so different from our Pinkie? What could have happened to her to make her like that?\" Applebloom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if this worlds version of my sister will be as different as she is.\" Sweetie Belle pondered, a worried expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her father's name is Clyde.\" Nyx stated. The her friends turned to look at her like she was crazy, so Nyx started to explain. \"Pinkie's father in our world. His name is Clyde Pie. He's a rock farmer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, who is Scorpan, and why does she think he's her father?\" The Doctor asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a dramatic pause, before Scootaloo realized something. \"Hey!

The deep, grating, almost guttural rumbling that had started, suddenly stops, along with the shaking.\"Aaaannnd we're here!\" The Doctor casts his hoof into the air as if he scored a goal in hoofball.

Y'know as well's I do that yer the best mare for it.\" Rain patters softly on the cobblestone around us, as we're huddled under an archway leading to Queen Platinum's palace. I bring a hoof to her chin and make her look up. \"Don't worry, lassie. Ya've done harder things than babysittin' a full grown mare; ya've done that fer me plenty.\" I give a hearty chuckle and she manages a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShae shakes her head a bit, before bringing her gaze to meet mine once more. \"You're probably right, Rose. Thank you so much for understanding. This isn't going to be easy...\" Again she turns away slightly, darting her eyes towards the castle behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch, I know, lass, I know. I also know Celina's a right dolly mare, an' if any'ne can bring 'er back 'round, it's you. Divines know this place needs it.\" I look up just as a flash of lightning streaks across the sky. The princess is distressed, indeed.  \"But I don't wanna get in th' way, see. I can't un'erstand wha's happening, an' I might just upset 'er further. I know where I'm not needed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShae giggles and presses her head into my shoulder, ruffling the end of my mane with her breath. \"Again, thank you.\" She raises her head again to look me in the eye. \"I'll do everything I can for her. At least it's good that <i>somepony</i> I care about hasn't changed.\" She smiles sweetly as she says this, and I can't help the bark of laughter that escapes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi, tha's me! Yer sunshine in th' rain.\" I ruffle her mane softly. \"I'll come back an' visit when yer girl is happy again,\" I say as I lean in close. \"Tha's a promise.\" I pull her into a hug, which she gratefully accepts, and then our lips are together and the world just disappears for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we pull apart, cheeks flushed, I lean in quickly to nuzzle her comfortingly. \"Goodbye for now, love. And best of luck.\" Shae steps back, a smile gracing her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye, Rose,\" she says with a small curtsy. \"But you know I don't need luck!\" After that, she turns around and starts trotting happily towards the castle. Funny how a kiss can make everything look better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite myself, I feel all tingly too as I give a small whoop.\"Damn skippy she don't need luck! She's got me!\" I jump in the air, clapping my hind hooves together before settling down once more. Out of the corner of my eye, I see a black unicorn stepping out of a strange blue box that I  swear wasn't there a few moments before. \"Oi!\" I shout, startling the mare. \"Where'd you come from, lass?\" With a gasp she pulls herself back into the blue box, the door slamming shut. \"Oi, I'm talkin' ta you! Least ya could do is answer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Nyx</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it seems we're in Everfree right now,\" the Doctor murmurs as he looks out the door at the opposite wall of a cobblestone pathway. \"Hmm... This isn't where we needed to be, but I guess we could pick up some Royal Guards or Carrier Clansmares to help us...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI step past Scootaloo, who is looking towards the Doctor quizzically. \"Carrier clan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor chuckles as I take a step outside the box, only my head and withers outside, into the rain. \"Nyx,\" the Doctor starts as he comes up behind me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi!\" A voice I don't recognize suddenly shouts from somewhere outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nyx, get <i>in here!</i> Quickly!\" The Doctor pulls on my tail, hissing under his breath, causing me to gasp and take a step back, into the TARDIS. The door swings shut of its own accord, and I turn towards the Doctor in a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, Doctor?\" He backs away a step as he lets go of my tail, sighing in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"There aren't any Alicorns at this point in time, Nyx. Or at least, none that the public knows about. The only ones anypony talks about are the Divines, the nine Gods and Goddesses that watch the world from above. Ultimately, they're legendary ponies believed to have ascended to ethereal levels centuries ago. In fact, there's a great deal of disagreement over whether or not they were even real. Either way, these ponies pray to these Divines in times of need, since they don't have any physical deity to speak with. There's a god of the forge, a goddess of war, a god of literature, a god of labor, and so on. If you want my advice, if you must mention any deity, just use Epona. She's sort of the Celestia of this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look back at my wings, and then up to my horn. \"So you're saying I should change my appearance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor nods. \"Basically, well, <i>yeah</i>. No offense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sigh as I tap into my magic. \"Well, I'll have to become a unicorn; somepony's already seen me from the shoulders forward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes sense,\" the Doctor murmurs from behind as I will my wings out of sight. Taking another breath, I push open the door, quickly stepping out and almost running horn-first into the earth pony who'd seen me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe narrows her eyes at me. \"Oi, ya gonna tell me what that was all about? Ponies don't just turn away when hailed unless they be doin' somethin' wrong. Y'aren't doin' nothing wrong, aye?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well no, of course not! You just surprised me, is all,\" I stammer, feeling flustered. \"Besides, my travelling companion had just called out as well, and, uh...\" The Doctor steps out in front of me, a hoof held out in front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why 'ello there! How're you doing today? It's a bit rainy, innit? Blimey, where are the weather pegasi when you need them, eh? I'm the Doctor, that's it. Just 'Doctor,' is all. What's your name, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare lifts up a hoof, and the Doctor grabs for it, giving it a strong shake. \"W-well,\" the mare says, still trapped in the Doctor's grip. \"My name's Rosemary, of the Spice Clan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh, Rosemary Von Spice, eh? Interesting, interesting... You wouldn't happen to know the <i>thyme</i>, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosemary's eyebrow rises as the Doctor's smile broadens. \"Aye... It's 'roundabout eight in the morn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, do you have any <i>sage</i> advice for us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosemary's lip quirks. \"Aye, that I do. Iffin' ya wanna be a dillweed, there's plenty o' room ta plant yerself and clary a conversation, though if you decide to clove about, ya might want some Fil\u00e9 around ta keep ya company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor puts on an abashed look, for just a second, before chuckling. \"Oh, so sorry to curry on like that, but I simply needed to check if you were a sassafrass lass before asking if you'd help us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosemary grins and turns around. \"Well sure, I'm headin' to the inn so's I can get outta the rain.\" She looks back at us, her smile bright despite the paltry weather. \"Well, you guys cumin or not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor is practically prancing in place. \"Oh, this is brilliant! She's not all depressing or murder means hello! And she's a ginger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie Belle steps out of the TARDIS, her face scrunched up in confusion. \"But... I thought her name was Rosemary?\" The Doctor and I just laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rosemary</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watch the Doctor and his four companions as they walk through the inn's door. The black-coated mare turns to the others and uses a spell to lift all the water off of them and throw it back outside. The Doctor looked about the inn with an eager smile on his face, taking in his surroundings. Spotting, he started wending his way through the crowd of boisterous drunks slumped around the hearth. \"Ello there! Good ta see you again! Rose-- you mind if I call ya Rose?-- I don't mean to be too much a bother, but I'm looking for somepony, and I need help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI raise an eyebrow, curiosity getting the best of me. \"Aye? Ye've lost a pony, 'ave ya? And ya cannae' rely on these fillies why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, no, no!\" He laughs, a smile on his face, but his eyes hold only worry. \"We need somepony to help us, show us around. We're not from the area, actually...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say yer not, what with that magical blue box you appeared in. Teleportation magic was s'posed to be loud and flashy, I always thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah, but...\" The Doctor taps his forehead with a hoof. \"I'm not a unicorn. I work in a... different sort of way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wot'chu sayin', lad? That yer a wizard? Bah!\" I can't help but laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what of you?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think for a few moments. \"What of me, eh? Well... I'm goin\u2019 ta break it down simple fer you folks. I come from a rich family who wants me ta marry some richer dunce up north. I left me little brother and sister in the care of the help at the villa, an\u2019 ran away to become a smith. That fell through when me mum found out, so I hit the road again. Fought some Blackwings, joined a guild, yadda yadda, all in a day's work for an adventurer. And now I'm simply waitin\u2019 until I can see the mare of my dreams again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor nods along with my spiel, listening intently and mulling it over once I'm done. \"Then you're perfect. A mare who's been running around all over Equestria must have come across some interesting sights.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have <i>no</i> idea,\" I reply dryly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'd love it if you could help, as my wife was foalnapped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy breath catches in my throat. \"R-really, now...\" I shudder. \"These are terrible times indeed, lad. Ai'ght, I'll help. Just tell me who done it.\"</span></div></div>",

I whimper as the loud screeching of rusted metal fills the cell I've been thrown in, and the pony standing before me chuckles. \"Don't worry, little pegasus,\" he says in a sing-song voice. \"I'm here to <i>help</i> you. To <i>free</i> you from your bonds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'If that were true, I wouldn't be shackled,'</i> I think bitterly, the muzzle covering my face keeping me from doing much more than whine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe earth pony brings his hoof down hard on my tail, and I feel tears sliding down my cheeks. \"Don't worry, my dear,\" the stallion says as he gets up close to me, his breath causing me to gag. \"Surly Temple's going to cleanse you of the Blackwing filth, one bloody feather at a time.\" I shiver as he cackles, turning around once more. \"I'll bring you some food tomorrow, and then we'll begin your rehabilitation. Keep in mind, <i>Blackwing</i>, we're doing this as a favor. Hahaha!\" He slams the door shut once more, leaving me to tremble in my bonds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Doctor, please...

There was something about him that spoke of wisdom, yet a curiosity that his younger companions all shared in. One of his companions, in fact, had taken over the bard's job, and was singing a song I didn't recognize. Turning my attention away from the young unicorn, I instead looked over towards the elder one. \"So,\" I begin to say, \"what magic d'you know? Did ya go to the College of Wintercolt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I bet ye can cast spells like Bound Blade and Divine Lightnin'!\" The unicorn blushes and looks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can cast <i>some</i> spells, yes, but I tend not to focus on offensive...\" she trails off, frowning slightly. \"I might have studied them more if I'd known something like this were to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod, placing a hoof on her shoulder companionably. \"Aye, though I'd gander you weren't from Wintercolt, then, else you'd probably 'ave heard all about it by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heard about what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothin' much, other than the fact that the college's founder, Clover the Clever, went and tried ta kill Queen Platinum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's... that's horrible,\" the unicorn stammers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye, but luckily me best friend and the loveliest mare ta roam these lands was able ta stop her good n' dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who, might I ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shae Sparkle. One o' the best mages ta ever nose her way through a book, I'd reckon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unicorn\u2019s mouth gapes open, but whatever she was about to say is cut off as the Doctor throws an arm over her withers. \u201cHave you tried the wine they have here? It has the strangest hint of honeydew melon I have ever tasted!\u201d The Doctor looks up and sees me standing there. \u201cOho, Rosey! Thank you for saying you\u2019d help; you have no idea how glad that makes me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis smile, though wide and cheery as any I\u2019d ever seen, didn\u2019t reach his eyes. And what eyes he had. Eyes that spoke of many years of pain, suffering, and fear\u2026 but also a spark of love, hope. A righteous fury that burned every fiber of his being, yelling at him to run and keep running until he\u2019d found everything that mattered\u2026 and yet the patience to sit here, pretending to enjoy the rest he was forcing upon himself so he could have the strength later. The stallion may well be the maddest haberdasher in the world, but his fear was genuine: he rightly needed to find his wife, else he might just keel over then and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can\u2019t help the warm smile that appears on my face. I know that I\u2019d be just as worried if Shae were to be foalnapped\u2026 But that isn\u2019t likely, or important right now. \u201cWell, can ya tell me who took \u2018er, Doctor?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nods, his smile slowly becoming a grim line. \u201cYes, I think I can. We were camping out in the woods out near Riverhoof, just enjoying some time to ourselves. Y\u2019see, it was something of a second honeymoon\u2026\u201d I cringe, my heart feeling like an icy talon had taken hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 An\u2019 somepony up an\u2019 took \u2018er while you was lookin\u2019 away, or somethin\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor nodded, a slight blush covering his cheeks. \u201cYeah\u2026 We\u2019d been dancing, and I kinda, er, crashed into the tent we\u2019d set up. While I was tangled up, I heard her cry out, then a muffled thump, and then I woke up, still ensnared, with a throbbing headache. I ran around for almost a full day, looking for any traces before returning to my box, going home, picking up some friends, and then setting down in a large town to see about getting some help from a local. And that\u2019s when we met you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAn\u2019 when did ya say she was taken?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout two days ago,\u201d the Doctor replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAn\u2019 ya spent one day lookin\u2019 about, and then returned home, picked these four up, and then managed to come all the way to the Everfree, in less than a day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAyup,\u201d the Doctor said with a drawl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAn\u2019 you\u2019re expectin\u2019 me ta believe that y\u2019all went home to, what, Hoofershire, and then got all th\u2019 way here\u2026 in less than a day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup yup, that\u2019d be right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA trip that would take even members of the Carrier Clan a good two weeks with the mountain passes bein\u2019 clear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s correct,\u201d the Doctor says, his voice steady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrug. \u201cAi\u2019ght, I\u2019ll believe ya. The power o\u2019 love an\u2019 friendship has done way stranger things in th\u2019 past couple o\u2019 months.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tension in his body disappears, an honest, grateful smile appearing on his lips. \u201cOh, thank Epona! I don\u2019t know how I could repay you\u2014or rather, I do, I just can\u2019t do it right now. Oh,\u201d the Doctor looks at me seriously once more.  \u201cI did hear one of her captors say something before I lost consciousness. He\u2019d said something about taking her black wings, which I couldn\u2019t quite understand, as Derpy has grey wings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe icy talon gripping my heart squeezes a bit. \u201cBlackwings are a group of mostly pegasi who have been rebelling against the crown. There are many who resent them, but I can only think of one group who would just foalnap a pegasus without first finding out if she\u2019s one of them or not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor\u2019s ears flatten at the seriousness of my tone, his voice quavering with the worry laid bare in his eyes. \u201cWho..? Who, Rose? Who took my wife?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take a short breath, a chill going up my spine. \u201cThe Groundbinders. They\u2019re a group of earth ponies and pegasi who\u2019ve cut off their wings. They think the Blackwing \u2018corruption\u2019 is somethin\u2019 that all pegasi are susceptible to \u2018less they remove their wings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor and the black-coated unicorn freeze, their breaths catching in their throats. \u201cH\u2026 how\u2026\u201d The Doctor forces himself to breathe, the fear and anguish in his eyes almost palpable. \u201cHow long..?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shake my head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Some rumors say they brainwash their victims, an\u2019 let them cut their own wings off ta show their loyalty. Others say they force pegasi ta fight in cages with the promise of bein\u2019 let free, only ta kill \u2018em all anyways. All I know is that most everyone agrees that they\u2019re trouble. We can\u2019t stay the night here, not if we\u2019re dealing with this group.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, then!\u201d The Doctor says as he cricks his neck and stretches out his legs. He begins pawing at the ground, eyes going hard with determination. \u201cLet\u2019s run, shall we?\u201d</span></div></div>",

She'd noticed that while Phoenix was smiling, it never quite reached his eyes. And his eyes seemed somewhat distant, though a closer look revealed that the distance concealed great pain. \"You got Rainbow Dash proven innocent with Miss Twilight's help, right?\" the white unicorn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix nodded. \"One of my closest wins. One of my biggest, too.

Nyx's horn flared, and a magical gag appeared around the man's mouth. \"Sir, could you please stop screaming? You're going to give us headaches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The man nodded slowly, and Nyx undid the gag.

She had light brown hair and bright blue eyes. \"So, who are all of you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm the Doctor. Just 'Doctor' will do, if you don't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah'm Apple Bloom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"My name's Sweetie Belle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Call me Scootaloo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I am Nyx Sparkle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sparkle?\" Trucy's eyes lit up at that. \"As in <i>Twilight</i> Sparkle, the unicorn Dad worked with to defend a pegasus named Rainbow Dash against charges of murder?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx nodded. \"The same. I'm her adoptive daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What a coincidence! I was adopted, too!\" Trucy exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix coughed. \"Ahem. Trucy, you were talking about the pony at the zoo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The girl's bright smile vanished as she flopped back on her chair. \"Ugh, don't remind me. I mean, she looked happy enough, but still! I knew she had to be sapient, and it's not right to put a sapient creature on display at the zoo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Doctor blinked. \"What do you mean by 'happy enough'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Trucy sighed. \"Well, when I saw her, she was being groomed by some of the zoo's staff, and was munching on alfalfa. And she looked like she was smiling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Doctor chuckled. \"Well, at least they're giving her a first-class treatment. I suppose releasing her from the zoo's custody isn't too big a priority. I was worried it was one of those lower-class zoos that would stick her in a tiny iron cage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, Gatewater Zoo prides itself on taking care of its... er, specimens,\" Apollo broke in, looking slightly nervous at the last word. \"For flying types, they have massive enclosures that they can fly around in with relative freedom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The other ponies relaxed. \"Oh, so it's not as bad as we thought,\" Scootaloo sighed in relief. \"So, we can take our time with getting her out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Trucy pouted. \"I still think we should hurry up and get her out of there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Apollo sighed. \"I'll talk to the zookeeper in the morning. It may take a little bit to convince him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The ponies nodded. \"Well, while we're here, maybe we should relax a little,\" Scootaloo said, stretching. \"I was supposed to be in Las Pegasus by now, building my reputation as the 'Tires of Fire'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And I was supposed to be at that conservatory in Canterlot,\" Sweetie sighed. \"Oh, well. Might as well take this impromptu vacation for what it's worth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix nodded, and pulled out a deck of cards. \"Out of curiosity, any of you play poker?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Apollo gave him a deadpan look. \"Really, Mr. Wright? I mean, okay, the Doctor, fine, Nyx, fine, but the rest of these girls can't be out of their teens!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx coughed. \"Actually, I'm a teen myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"An' besides, ah already know how ta play poker!\" Apple Bloom added. She looked eagerly at Phoenix. \"Just a friendly game, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The ex-attorney nodded with a smile. \"Of course. I'm not trying to con you out of your money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Soon enough, Phoenix, Apple Bloom, the Doctor, and Scootaloo were all involved in the game. Nyx and Sweetie Belle had opted out, preferring to talk with Trucy and Apollo. The conversations were mostly small-talk, with no real point. As night fell, Phoenix pulled out some spare futons for the visitors. Everything seemed quiet at the Wright Anything Agency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why...?

I was actually going to the zoo myself, to try and ask the keeper to release her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gavin's smile faded. \"Ah, about that. I've got good news, and bad news, Herr Forehead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Apollo looked nervous. \"Um, what's the good news?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The good news is that Fraulein Pony is no longer in the custody of the zoo,\" Gavin explained. The ponies, hearing this, all breathed a sigh of relief... all save Nyx, who was waiting for the other shoe to drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And... the bad news?\" Apollo asked, dreading the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gavin's face turned serious. \"She's being held at the Detention Center, charged with murdering the zookeeper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0An explosive \"<i><b>WHAT?!</b></i>\" rang out from the ponies' corner, before Nyx leapt towards the door. She was beside Apollo in an instant. \"Why was she arrested?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Apollo tried - and failed - to wrestle Nyx back out of sight, grinning sheepishly at Gavin the whole time. \"Um, I can explain - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No need, Herr Forehead,\" the prosecutor replied. \"To be honest, I'd be more surprised if there <i>weren't</i> more of these ponies lurking around.

He started to walk off. \"See you in court tomorrow, Herr Forehead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wait, WHAT?!\" Apollo sputtered. \"I haven't agreed to - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A black hoof wrapped around his mouth, silencing him. \"We'll be there, Mr. Gavin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As Gavin walked away, Apollo pried the offending hoof away from his mouth. \"Now wait just a minute!

Do you believe Miss Doo actually committed the crime?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Apollo paused. \"Well, no... I mean, I haven't gotten any of the details yet, after all, so I can't make any judgements.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix waved him off. \"Then go out and get your details, and if you think she's guilty, you can pass the buck to someone else.\" He stroked his stubble thoughtfully. \"I think Grossberg could use a client or two...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Apollo sighed in defeat. \"Fine, fine, I'll go take a look at what's what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm coming with you,\" Nyx said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah-heh, and how do you intend to come along?

The mist then settled over Apollo's clothes, leaving them only slightly heavier than before. <i>Now, let's go see what happened.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"My life can't get any weirder...\" muttered the young attorney as he left.</span></div></div>",

He'd learned quickly that he could 'project' certain thoughts for Nyx to pick up, but she couldn't read his mind. <i>So, what's this pony like? I'm guessing you know her?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was a sensation of a nod. <i>Yes, I know Ditzy well. Ditzy Doo is the Doctor's traveling partner, as well as the mailmare for our town. She's a very kind pony, so I really can't see her murdering anypo - er, anyone.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Apollo sighed out loud. <i>Well, I've worked a case or two where it looked like someone really unlikely actually committed the crime. Like, this one girl killed a doctor that botched an operation on her fiance, just to frame him in an effort to try and inherit his family's money.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Although he couldn't see it, he had the distinct impression that Nyx was arching an eyebrow. <i>Are all humans so petty? To kill over something as mundane as money?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Are you telling me that ponies are so perfect?</i> Apollo retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A few moments of silence passed, and Apollo allowed himself a smirk. <i>Point taken, Mr. Justice,</i> sighed the alicorn. <i>Ponies can be rather petty, themselves. There was a unicorn magician who became a bit of a thorn in the side of my mother and her friends. She held the entire town hostage, just to prove she was superior to my mother.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Apollo arched an eyebrow at that. <i>The entire town? Are all unicorns so powerful?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A sensation of a head shake gave him an answer. <i>No, she had amplified her magic using an artifact known as the Alicorn Amulet. The catch is that that amulet also caused her to go mad with the power. My mom ended up tricking her into removing it. And, she actually became a better pony once all was said and done.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Further conversation was postponed as they arrived at the detention center. Apollo identified himself, and asked to speak with the accused. The guards let him pass, and he was led to the visitor's section. A few minutes later, a grey pegasus with a blonde mane and tail was led in from the other side. Apollo couldn't help but stare at her eyes. <i>I wonder if she can see through time with those...</i> he thought, pondering the eyes that seemed content to swivel in any direction aside from directly in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hi! You're the lawyer that wanted to talk to me, right?\" the grey pony asked with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um, yes,\" Apollo said with a nod. \"My name's Apollo Justice. And you are Miss Ditzy Doo, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's right!\" She lifted off into a hover. \"How'd you know? I didn't think the police had told anyone yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I... have my sources...\" Apollo stammered, trying to think of an excuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>I've got an idea. Put your hand in your pocket,</i> Nyx told him. Apollo did so, and felt something take shape in his palm. When he pulled it out, he realized it was a miniature replica of Nyx, with proportions intact. It was also moving like the real thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ditzy's eyes widened. \"Nyx?\" she gasped in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The mini-Nyx nodded. \"Uh-huh,\" she said, in her normal voice. Apollo had, for some reason, expected her to have a higher-pitched voice in this mini form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"D-does that mean...?\" Ditzy stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The Doctor brought me and the senior CMC here to help you, Miss Doo. Don't worry, we'll get you out of here,\" Nyx assured the grey pegasus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ditzy smiled. \"Oh, thank goodness. I was worried I'd get some lawyer who didn't have any help at all.\" She dropped to the ground again, causing a few feathers to fall off her wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This didn't escape Apollo's notice. \"Um, is that normal?\" he asked, pointing at the loose feathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Huh?\" The grey mare swiveled an eye to look. \"Oh, yeah, I'm in the middle of a moulting cycle. Nothing to worry about. The police aren't happy that they have to clean my cell every so often, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx nodded. \"Well, anyway, what can you tell us about what happened, Miss Doo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ditzy's smile faded. \"Well, not much. All I know is I went to sleep last night, and when I woke up, there was blood on my hooves, and the police had surrounded me. I was so scared... especially since there was a trail of bloody hoofprints leading up to where I was sleeping!\" She looked about ready to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Apollo looked worried. \"Um... do you have a habit of sleepwalking, Miss Doo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ditzy shook her head. \"I've never had a problem like that before! The Doctor would have told me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx frowned. \"So, if we rule out a sleepwalking murder... what does this mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Apollo's eyes narrowed. \"Well, maybe someone moved her while she was asleep? Dipped her hooves in blood, and kinda walked her back, all without her waking up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ditzy shuddered. \"I don't think so, Mr. Justice. I'm a really light sleeper. Comes with being a mother and a mailmare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Apollo blinked. \"You have a kid?

Apollo looked down at the map he had gotten from a man in a Blue Badger costume at the front gate, and he could practically feel Nyx studying it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I can't believe I'm starting to get used to having a pony from another world living in my clothes,</i> he thought-muttered to Nyx. <i>And I thought some of my other cases were weird.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I can't believe you humans keep so many creatures locked up like this,</i> Nyx retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Don't you have zoos in your world? It sounded like you did,</i> Apollo replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sure, there's a great one in Manehattan with all sorts of exotic, non-sapient creatures. Not anything I would call a neighbor. Look, you have zebras here. And buffalo! And...</i> She hesitated, and Apollo felt a sense of dread building as he sensed her 'eyes' lingering on the section labeled \"Domesticated Animals (w/ Petting Zoo)\". <i>You lock up sheep here? Cows? P...PONIES?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo swallowed, nervous enough to forget to 'send' his thoughts to Nyx as he looked down at his vest and explained out loud, \"Look, Nyx, I don't know how much you know about this world, but things are different here than back where you came from. If you settle down for a moment...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I thought they locked Ditzy up because they didn't know what she was! You've been enslaving ponies this whole time?!</i> In the moment, Nyx was furious. Seeing that ponies were incarcerated in the zoo was just the final straw, but she had been angered by the other 'domesticated animals' as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, Sweet Apple Acres and the other farms surrounding Ponyville had a number of the same creatures living there, but more as tenants than as animals to be displayed. Instead of paying for lodging with bits, sheep gave their wool, cows gave their milk, and pigs gave their... fertilizer. They weren't as fully sapient as ponies, and thus weren't considered full citizens of Equestria, but were still given more consideration than mere show-pieces.</span></div></div>",

But only barely. <i>Mr. Justice,</i> she thought-growled to the attorney. <i>I'm giving you one chance to explain this. Only. One. Chance. If I'm not satisfied...</i> She left the threat hanging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Apollo sighed, as he gathered his thoughts. <i>What you have to understand, Nyx, is that Earth and your world are obviously very different. Here, ponies, sheep, cows, and the like, none of them are sapient. They lack the ability to reason. Also - and please, don't fly off the handle here - most of them are rather unintelligent, when compared to humans. Your kind of pony is</i> very <i>different from our kind of pony.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx pondered that for a bit, as Apollo walked towards the crime scene, the zookeeper's office. The more she thought about it, the more it made sense. The Doctor had explained to her and the other senior CMC that humans were the dominant life form, and had yet to encounter other sapient life. She's seen the word 'pony' and made an assumption which, in hindsight, was rather obviously false.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Justice,</i> she thought to him. <i>I was out of line. The humans here haven't encountered other species with sapience before, have they?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Apollo smiled in relief. <i>No, we haven't.</i> He then sighed. <i>Though the trial tomorrow will likely be blown out of proportion. Hell of a way to meet a new race.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before Nyx could comment, they picked up the sounds of crunching and munching. Apollo smiled as he walked towards the sound. Poking his head around the open door, he called out, \"Hello, Detective Skye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He ducked out of the way as... something sailed past him. Looking at it, Nyx saw a short, brown stick of sorts land on the ground. <i>What in...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, it's you, Mr. Lawyer,\" came the voice from within the room. Apollo looked in again, allowing Nyx to see as well. The speaker was a young woman, with long brown hair, partially tied in a topknot. She wore a white lab coat over a green buttoned shirt and brown pants. A red bag hung from one shoulder, while a smaller bag filled with more of the brown sticks was held in one hand. \"Deciding to expand your clientele? Going for freaky ponies with wings, now?\" She looked rather perturbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You seem somewhat... out of sorts, Detective,\" Apollo noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Skye grumbled, and pulled one of the sticks out before tossing it into her mouth. Nyx realized that the 'sticks' were actually a kind of snack food. \"Out of sorts? A good way to say it, I guess. I got a look at that pony when she was arrested. Those wings have to have been glued on, or something. I mean, scientifically speaking, there's no way those wings could actually work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"They do. I saw her hovering using them at the Detention Center,\" Apollo countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Skye raised an eyebrow. \"So, you really are taking her case, huh? Well, you're fighting a losing battle, this time. We've got a lot of evidence to condemn her, not the least of which is the fact that she left a trail of bloody footprints back to her enclosure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mind if I look around? Just in case you all missed something?\" Apollo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Knock yourself out,\" Skye replied, munching on another stick. \"Good luck finding anything wrong, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Apollo glanced around, taking in the scene. A white tape outline was on the floor, with a large pool of blood around and inside it. \"Yeesh, he must've bled like crazy,\" he muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No kidding,\" remarked Skye. \"From what I heard, his skull was caved in from a single blow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"A single blow?\" Apollo looked at her, surprised. \"Seriously?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yep. I'm sure you'll get the autopsy report at the trial.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Apollo shook his head, and looked around again. As he did so, something seemed... off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Mr. Justice?</i> Nyx thought to him. <i>Remember what Miss Doo told us at the Detention Center? She's in the middle of her moulting cycle. If she'd really done this - in a single blow - shouldn't there be a lot of feathers around?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Apollo frowned. Now that his 'passenger' mentioned it... \"Detective, was anything taken from the scene by the detectives? Aside from the body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Huh? No, not that I know of,\" Skye replied, confused. \"Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hmm...\" Apollo pondered what to do next.</span></div></div>",

But a species? No way. Whatever gave that pony wings is obviously a one-of-a-kind fluke in the gene pool. There's no way something like that can exist and persist along enough bloodlines to be a 'species'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"... Weren't you into forensic science, not biology?\" Apollo asked dryly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The two can coincide quite often, you know,\" retorted Skye, crunching into another one of her snacks. \"And I stand by my statement.\" She smirked in a joking way. \"Unless you can prove that there's more than one of them out there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The lawyer could practically <i>feel</i> Nyx's evil grin. <i>This opportunity is too perfect... Want to mess with her a bit?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After hearing Nyx's plan, Apollo allowed himself a small grin. \"Actually, I think I can prove it, Detective.\" When she looked at him in confusion, Apollo snapped his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Detective Ema Skye had seen quite a bit in her career, and even before she had become a detective. She had seen evidence that she had killed a prosecutor named Neil Marshall, only to find out later that the police chief at the time had set her up. She had seen a young girl use a device to almost perfectly recreate the scene of a murder... although she later heard that said murder had been staged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But all she had seen up to this point seemed insignificant as, with a snap of his fingers, that young lawyer that worked for Phoenix Wright summoned a cloud of mist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was scientifically impossible. Ema knew that. And yet, she was seeing it. She pinched herself. She felt pain. No, she wasn't dreaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The mist grew, and gathered together into a shape. The shape was of a... horse? No, horses didn't have a singular horn growing out of their forehead. Horses didn't have <i>wings</i>, either. <i>Is this related to that pony from before?</i> Ema thought wildly. Almost immediately, she dismissed the notion. This horse was far taller than the pony that had been arrested, and colored a midnight black. For a moment, she wondered if this was some sort of trick of the light the lawyer was pulling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then the horse opened its eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ema's bag of Snackoos fell from nerveless fingers, and she wasn't far behind as her legs gave out. She couldn't help it. Those piercing, cyan, catlike eyes seemed to look <i>through</i> her, and glowed with an unholy energy. The nightmarish creature stepped forward, and Ema hit the wall trying to scramble away. It leaned down, and opened its mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Boo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The zoo would later have to replace multiple windows in the office that shattered from the scream... although Ema would deny it to her last breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"For shame, Mr. Lawyer!\" groused Detective Skye. \"I never took you for a prankster!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Apollo couldn't meet her eyes. This was because he was certain he had busted <i>some</i>thing from laughter when Ema had screamed. <i>Who would have thought a prank like that could be so funny?</i> he mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The detective shook her head. \"At any rate, you have proved that there's more than one of these... er... horses, running around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx, who was lying on the ground recovering from her own laughing fit, looked up. \"We generally prefer the term 'ponies', Detective.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Skye cocked her head. \"But, your proportions are more akin to a regular horse, than a pony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Perhaps here on Earth, Detective Skye,\" Apollo mused. \"On the world they come from, they're all ponies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx elected not to correct the young attorney. There were, after all, actual horses in the land of Saddle Arabia. But that was neither here nor there. She took a deep breath, then stood up, shook out her mane and tail, and offered a hoof. \"Nyx Sparkle. Pleased to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Skye, while still somewhat in shock, nonetheless remembered her manners. \"Ema Skye, Homicide. Likewise.\" She shook the offered hoof. \"So, there's a whole world of you creatures?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx narrowed her eyes. \"Yes. And you can call us 'people', you know. We are just as sapient as humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sorry, sorry,\" the detective apologized. \"I'm dealing with my whole worldview crashing down around me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx sighed. \"So, Apollo had a point earlier. You seem out-of-sorts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Skye groaned. \"Don't remind me. This case is so messed up, my toys are next to worthless!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"'Toys'?\" repeated the alicorn, glancing at Apollo to see if he could clarify.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He did so. \"Although she's a detective, Skye really enjoys forensic science. I'm guessing, though, given who the accused is, most of her forensic techniques don't work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Exactly.\" Skye retrieved her bag of snacks, and stuffed a few in her mouth. \"Honestly, it's enough to drive a woman to drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx tapped a hoof to her chin... then brightened. \"What if I showed you some Equestrian forensic techniques?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The detective paused, another snack stick halfway to her mouth. \"Equestrian... forensics?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx nodded. \"For example...\" She lit up her horn, and an image appeared in midair. \"I can analyze these bloody hoofprints that were left behind, and compare them to the hoofprints of Miss Doo, the defendant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wow,\" Apollo mused, looking at the 'screen'. \"This looks almost like a fingerprint comparison list. Wouldn't you say, Detective Skye?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It does look similar...\" Skye agreed, looking at the 'screen' herself. \"But, where's the data coming from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx tapped her head. \"I went through a forensics kick of my own a while back, and used a spell to compile everypony's footprint data into an area of my subconscious. When I wanted to compare hoofprints I found to ones there, I used another spell to call the data up in this form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Skye was grinning like a schoolgirl. \"Well, let's test this out! Do you have the defendant's prints on file?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx nodded. \"Let's see here...\"</span></div></div>",

Where gangs of orphaned foals weave deftly through the crowds for baubles to steal, and dance across the network of rooftops to avoid the constabulary. Where one might find squid-faced Rubbery Ponies walking down the street, or meet a friendly devil who is more than happy to help you with whatever you need... for a price. A city where Death itself is more of an acquaintance than a permanent condition.</span></div></div>",

His coat was a pale color, only a few shades off from Rarity's pure white. He wore a royal blue business vest and a red tie on his front. His mane was a spiky, slicked-back mess that reminded Nyx of a hedgehog in front of a blow dryer. But it was his Cutie Mark that drew her eye the most: an outline of a shout bubble from comics, with a bright red word inside: 'OBJECTION!'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Where have I heard that before...?</i> wondered the alicorn. Deciding she'd need answers directly from the pony himself, she leaned down and gently nudged him. He groaned as he began to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ow...\" Phoenix Wright moaned as he slowly regained consciousness. \"That's the last time I let Gumshoe talk me into drinking after a case.\" He was content for the moment to lie where he was, trying to let the hangover work itself out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Excuse me, are you okay?\" asked a nearby voice. It was fairly young, and female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I feel like a herd of elephants used my head as a tap-dance stage,\" Phoenix replied, not happy about his persisting headache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, you have a headache? Here, let me take care of that,\" the voice said. Before Phoenix could question her, he felt something hard and somewhat pointed touch his head. Moments later, a cool feeling of relief flowed through his head, banishing the throbbing headache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ma'am, I don't know what you did, but you are a veritable angel,\" the attorney said in bliss, finally deciding to open his eyes to look upon the heavenly savior that had defeated the foul menace known as a hangover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're quite welcome,\" the pitch-black pony with cat-like eyes replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix blinked. Then blinked again. Then he sighed. \"Oh, boy, back here again... So, who is it this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The pony blinked. \"Uh, pardon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix rolled his eyes. \"Look, the only reason I'd be back in Equestria is if somepony wanted me to represent them in a case. So who is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Back in...?\" The pony seemed confused for a moment, then her eyes widened. \"Wait a minute... I know you! You're Phoenix Wright!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The attorney smiled. \"The one and only! Best attorney in the universe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But... wait. I thought Phoenix Wright was a human,\" continued the pony, now looking confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uh, yeah, I - \" Phoenix attempted to stand up to face the pony, but fell over as his sense of balance seemed off. Puzzled, Phoenix looked himself over... and screamed. \"WHAT HAPPENED TO ME?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The black pony's ears flattened against her head as she was assaulted by the sound. \"I'm guessing some sort of magic turned you into a pony, Mr. Wright. Maybe my mom could help you out though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh yeah?!\" the former human snapped, rattled beyond belief. \"And who's your mom that knows so much about magic?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her catlike eyes narrowed. \"I believe you know her. Her name's Twilight Sparkle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That name cut through Phoenix's growing panic like a knife. \"Twilight...?\" he repeated. Almost immediately, a feeling of relief went through him. \"Oh, if it's Twilight, then sure, let's go see her. Goodness knows, I'd like to see how she's been since the last time I was here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She smiled, her horn glowing as she lifted him up and set him on his hooves. \"I'm sure she'd love to catch up with you, too, Mr. Wright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix smiled back. Then he blinked as something occured to him. \"Waitaminute. Twilight was single, and childless the last time I saw her. How did you - ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Adopted,\" interrupted the pony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix blinked again at the one-word explanation. \"Ah. That explains it.\" He then looked her over, cocking his head. \"You're awfully tall, Ms... er...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She giggled. \"My name is Nyx. Nyx Sparkle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix blinked, then chuckled. \"Sorry,\" he said, when she looked at him quizzically. \"It's just, the last time I was here, a pony nicknamed me 'Nix', short for 'Phoenix'. Said something about it being 'cooler'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx chuckled as well. \"Ah, that'd be Rainbow Dash. She's been doing quite well since you saved her from being banished to the moon or sun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I should hope so!\" the attorney said, raising a forehoof for emphasis. However, he was unused to being a pony, and fell over again. \"Um, Ms. Nyx, could you perhaps help me to the Ponyville Library?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx giggled again. \"Certainly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx was nearly beside herself with giddiness as she led Phoenix Wright to Ponyville. <i>I can't believe it! Mom told me about him a lot, and now I'm meeting him myself! Thoough the fact that he's a pony and not a human is a bit odd, but I'm not going to dwell on that! He's a hero of mine, and I'm TALKING TO HIM!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In truth, there hadn't been much talking for the past few minutes. After Phoenix had gotten the hang of walking like a pony, there had been a companionable silence between the two. Nyx didn't mind; she was so gleeful at meeting one of her mom's old friends (and one of her own personal heroes) that she couldn't think of anything to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The silence was broken by Phoenix. \"Ahem. As I was saying before, Ms. Nyx, you're quite tall. Taller than most ponies I met last time. And... you have both wings and a horn. From what I read before, such traits are usually only exhibited by royalty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His words doused the flames of giddiness within Nyx, and her mood dropped sharply. \"Well... there's a reason for that, Mr. Wright. It's complicated, though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, hey, it's alright. You don't have to tell me if you don't want to,\" the neo-pony said, looking apologetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx smiled gratefully at him. \"I'll tell you at some point during your stay here. You'll probably learn anyway, one way or another.\" She looked up. \"Oh! We're here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She opened the door to the Books and Branches Library, and spotted Twilight on the main floor. The unicorn briefly glanced up at Nyx, before returning to the book in front of her. \"What's up, Nyx? I thought you'd be busy at the castle all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, I was going to be, but I found something I had to show you,\" the alicorn replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight rolled her eyes a bit. \"Nyx, I told you, be careful with the stuff in there. I don't want you bringing home any cursed relics, dark magics, or murals of eternal night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And what about old friends?\" Phoenix asked, smothering a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight's head snapped up, focusing on the pegasus standing next to her daughter. \"Phoenix...?\" she gaped in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Long time, no see, Twilight,\" Phoenix said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight fairly sprang across the room, and hugged the attorney, a hug which was eagerly returned. \"Phoenix! Omigosh, it's really you! But what are you doing back in Equestria? And why are you a pony?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx smiled at the sight, but coughed a little. \"Well, that's why we're here. Phoenix doesn't know the answer to either of those questions, and neither do I. We were hoping you could find out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight smiled brightly. \"Of course!\" She began floating a few books off the shelves. \"Though, I hope you don't mind if we play catch-up while we work on this, Phoenix?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not at all!

The first was that Twilight dropped the books she was holding with her magic, whirling around to gape in disbelief at the pegasus. The second was that Nyx's eyes went wide with shock; she hadn't been around during the murder of Ace Swift, the first murder that had happened in centuries since Celestia's reign began. The final thing that happened was Phoenix staring in shock for a few seconds, before promptly bashing his face into the table. It was this final act that drew Rainbow's attention, as Phoenix hadn't been gentle on himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm beginning to suspect the cosmos hates me,\" the attorney-turned-pony muttered into the wooden table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Huh? Who're you?\" Rainbow asked, confused at this stranger's reaction to being told there'd been a murder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix pulled his head off the table to give Rainbow a wry smile. \"I know I look a little different, but I'd think you'd remember the guy who saved you from a severe case of sunburn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rainbow's eyes widened. \"No way... Nix! It's you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx coughed. \"You know his name is Phoenix, right? And that calling him 'Nix' is going to lead to some confusion between him and me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rainbow ignored her, zipping around Phoenix like a hummingbird. \"This is awesome! You're a pony now! And a pegasus to boot! Oh, have you been flying, yet? You need to, it's amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix endured the athelete's observing him for another minute, before he coughed. \"You said something about there being a murder, Rainbow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rainbow's attention snapped back to the matter at hoof. \"Oh, right!\" She turned to Twilight, then paused. \"Actually, Nix, maybe you could take the case? I mean, you did such a good job for me, so I thought maybe you could help out again? Because, believe me, the pony they arrested wouldn't do something like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, who is the pony they've arrested?\" Phoenix asked, while reaching into his vest pocket. He pulled out a pink, heart-shaped badge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight blinked on seeing this. \"Hey, you kept your Equestrian Attorney badge! I'd have thought you'd have gotten rid of it, since it's so tacky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix sheepishly grinned. \"Well, I always thought there might be a possibility of my returning to Equestria to defend somepony else, so I figured I'd hold on to it. Besides, it's not so bad once you get used to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Guys, focus?\" Rainbow interrupted, running a hoof down the front of her face. \"The pony that's been arrested...\"</span></div></div>",

Nyx led Phoenix there, as he hadn't been to the detention center in Canterlot before. Phoenix made sure his Equestrian Attorney badge was visible, pinned against the lapel of his coat where his Earth badge would be. As he walked, he contemplated what would drive anypony to frame Pinkie Pie of murder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Halt!\" At the command, Phoenix blinked and looked up. While he'd been lost in thought, they'd arrived at the detention center. As with Ponyville, a pair of guards were posted outside. One of them spoke up. \"What business do you have at the detention center?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix drew himself up. \"I'm a defense attorney, here to speak to Pinkie Pie about representing her in her case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Do you have proof of your profession?\" the other guard asked. Phoenix simply nodded, pushing his badge into the light with a hoof. \"Very well. You may enter, but your friend stays out here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix was about to protest, not wanting the press to get a chance to catch them, but the disguised Nyx shook her head. \"I'll be fine, Mr. Wright. You go on and talk to Pinkie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix looked at her for a moment. \"Alright, if you're sure.\" He trotted inside the detention center, being escorted to one side of a glass partition. A few minutes later, Pinkie was escorted in from the other side. Phoenix was taken aback at first; the normally perky pony looked rather depressed, her mane and tail both flat and hanging down. Even her coat seemed duller than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I didn't think anypony would want to defend me,\" she murmured. \"You're either brave, or stupid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix shook himself to get his emotions under control. \"Actually, I have experience with murder cases, Pinkie. You don't need to worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The earth pony blinked. \"How do you know my name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix smirked. \"The last time we saw each other, I looked a bit different. Does this ring a bell?\" He pushed the pink badge forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pinkie looked at the badge, and her eyes widened. \"F-Feenie...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix nodded. \"It's me, Pinkie. I'm here to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A startling change came over the pink mare. Her mane and tail sprang into poofy curls, as her colors brightened to their usual shade. \"OMIGOSH, FEENIE!\" She tried to bounce over to him to give him a hug, but the glass got in the way. She smacked into it, and slid down. \"Eh-heh, forgot that was there,\" she muttered. She shook her head, and looked at him. \"But what're you doing here again, Feenie? And why are you a pony?\" She gasped. \"Did Twilight do this to you? Did she summon you to defend me, and screw up the spell, and that's why you're a pony now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not quite,\" Phoenix admitted. \"I woke up in that castle that's near Ponyville these days, and was found by Nyx.\" He felt safe enough mentioning the alicorn to Pinkie, since he was certain that Pinkie knew everypony in Ponyville.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, okay. So it was Nyx who turned you into a pony?\" Pinkie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wh - NO! I woke up as a pony!\" Phoenix replied, then shook his head. \"We're getting off-topic, Pinkie. We're here to discuss you and how I can defend you. First off, I want to know: did you actually do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now, Pinkie may have been oblivious at times, but she could tell what Phoenix meant. \"No! I've never <i>ever</i> thought about killing another pony! How could you ask me that, Feenie?!\" She began to sniffle. \"I thought we were friends!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix noticed a lack of psyche-locks, and quickly explained himself. \"We are, Pinkie! It's just part of my job. And I believe you, don't worry.\" He coughed a little. \"So, did you know the victim, Duke Greengrass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pinkie shook her head a little too quickly. \"Why would I know a noble pony? I'm not a noble!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As a single psyche-lock materialized around her, Phoenix sighed. \"Sorry, but Prince Blueblood already told us the truth. Please, don't lie to me again, Pinkie. Or, should I call you Marchioness Pinkamena Rose Quartz?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The lock shattered almost as soon as it formed. \"Oh... so Blueblood told you all, huh?\" Pinkie sighed, and her entire demeanor changed. \"Well, then yes, I did know the Duke. I should, after all. He was my fiancee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix's eyebrows arched clear up to his mane. \"You're engaged?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah.\" The pink pony sighed. \"When I was four years old, before I left for the rock farm, my birth father and Greengrass's father met to arrange a marraige between us. Nothing ever came of it, since my step-father took me to the rock farm, and I never saw my birth father or Greengrass again... until recently.\" She looked down. \"My mother fell ill recently, and my birth father came to her. He said he'd pay for her medical expenses, but only if I was married into the nobility. He still had that old contract he and Greengrass's father came up with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix was incredulous. \"So, your father all but coerced you into this arrangement?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pinkie nodded. \"Guess it doesn't matter now. Greengrass is dead, which means the contract is dead, which means Father doesn't have to pay for Mom's medical bills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How bad is your mother's sickness?\" Phoenix asked in a sensitive tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pinkie winced. \"She's not looking good. The rock farm doesn't pay much, and there's no way we can afford the expenses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix thought about that. \"Have you thought about asking your friends for help paying for the bills?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I couldn't!\" Pinkie gasped. \"If I did that, my friends would all have to know about my heritage, and everything would change!\" She looked down again. \"I didn't want things to change. That's why we'd been doing all of this in secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, everything's probably going to be revealed in the trial...\" Phoenix muttered. A thought occured to him. \"But, you have proven that you lack a motive to kill Greengrass. I'll be sure to bring this up in court. Out of curiosity, do you think I could get your mom's medical records?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pinkie nodded. \"Just tell her Pinkie sent you, and she'll authorize it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright, that'll be good evidence for the trial. I'll be back later.\" With that, Phoenix turned around. Before he left, he paused. \"Out of curiosity, what's Blueblood's interest in the case?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>BANG! RATTLERATTLERATTLE BA-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-ANG! SKRIIIIIITCH! BOOOOOOOOM!!!</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix had to keep his jaw from dropping as no less than fourteen psyche-locks materialized, along with a huge amount of duct tape, and (of all things) what looked like a vault, with a note on it. The note read, \"Sorry, Feenie, I Pinkie-Promised not to tell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pinkie herself shrugged. \"We've met. He's actually a nice guy, once you get to know him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix nodded. \"Right... Well, I'll let you know if anything else happens.\"</span></div></div>",

He was a bout to call out to his friend, when the image of him was replaced by a nicely dressed Earth pony. He was light in color, similar to Phoenix's coat, wearing a brilliant magenta coat and white crevat. His black mane was cut short in the back, but pushed forward to frame his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch where you're walking, girl! You almost knocked me over!\" The stallion turned away from Nyx, heading in Phoenix's direction, muttering to himself. \"Honestly, peasants these days...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix noticed that the guards made no move to stop this pony, meaning they most likely already knew who he was, and were certain he was allowed in. The pony continued walking until he spotted Phoenix and then instantly stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, a fellow well dressed aristocrat! Good day to you sir! Just finishing up some business in the detention center, I take it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the fact that he already didn't like this stallion Phoenix forced a smile on his face, in the hopes that it would speed along the conversation. \"Just got done talking with my client.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, a defense attorney. I should have guessed by how you were dressed. I myself am a prosecutor.\" The stallion said, extending a hoof to Phoenix. \"Allow me to introduce myself; I'm Earl Morally Grey of Hoofington.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix shook the hoof, smirking slightly. \"Phoenix Wright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause, as Earl Grey waited patiently for Phoenix to add a noble tittle to his name. they stood their for about five minutes before a look of realization came over his face, and he quickly took his hoof back, attempting to discreetly wipe it on the ground while he spoke again. \"I see. Well I wish you the best of luck with your day. I have to go give some villainous scum a chance to confess their guilt and reduce their punishment. Good day, Mr. Wright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarl Grey stepped around Phoenix and headed inside, while Phoenix walked over to Nyx. \"Any idea who that was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That? That was Earl Morally Grey. He became a prosecutor shortly after his wife died. They say that everypony who's ever gone into court against him has always lost, and their are more than a few rumors going around that he's even gone so far as to forge evidence and bribe witnesses just to make sure it stays that way, though nothing has ever been proven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And with my luck, he'll probably be the prosecution at Pinkie's trial...great.</i> Phoenix thought to himself. \"Anyways, we better get going if we want to check out that crime scene and still have time to study before we have to meet up with the others.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nyx and Phoenix stopped by a cafe to get directions to the locations of the scene of the crime, when a pair of grey blurs slammed into Phoenix, knocking him off of his hooves. The attorney soon found himself underneath two mares. One was a Grey-blue color with a lighter grey mane white the other was light grey with a darker grey mane. Their manes were straight, and reminded him of Pinkie's mane when he'd first seen her at the detention center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops. Looks like we-\" One started to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-ran into somepony.\" The other finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that mister, we-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-were kind of in a rush to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-get someplace really important-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-so we could see our sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix looked back and forth between the two as they got off of him and dusted themselves off. Both of them extended a hoof to him as a silent offer to help him  back up. As he accepted their offers, he happened to spot their Cutie-marks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne was a cartoon bomb, and the other was a stick of dynamite...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and when he blinked, they switched ponies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute, did your cutie-marks just...?\" He started to ask, only to be cut off by the two mares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, you wouldn't happen to know where we could-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-find the canterlot detention center, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix blinked, and tried to ignore the fact that their cutie-marks had switched again. \"Um...yeah, it's just five blocks that way.\" He replied, pointing in the direction of the detention center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>Okay, thanks, bye!</u>\" The mares replied in unison, before rushing past him so fast, the poor attorney ended up spinning around like a top. Two pairs of grey hooves reached from behind him, and grabbed him, stopping his spinning motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, I'm Blinkie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm Inkie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>And were the Pie family twins!</u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you ever need something blasted-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-into smithereens, then just give us a call.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<u>See you later mister handsome!</u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the two siblings raced off towards the detention center again, once more leaving Phoenix spinning like a top. The gentle grip of Nyx's magic brought the dizzy defense attorney to a halt, as she walked back over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, what happened to you? You look like you got hit by a hurricane!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I just got acquainted with a few of the members in Pinkie's family.\" Phoenix replied, as he silently prayed for the world to stop spinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, speaking of Pinkie, I've got directions on how to get to the crime scene. It shouldn't take us too long to get there. Come on.\"</span></div></div>",

What.\" It wasn't as over-the-top as one would typically expect from the attorney. That was because he had crammed so much disdain into that one word for the myriad ways that the universe seemed to enjoy toying with him that there was simply no room for any other inflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat he just happened to get yanked back to Equestria when the second murder in any living pony's memory occured... that was pretty much par for the course for his life. That he was transformed into a pony this time was bizarre, but he could mentally file it away under \"wierd Equestria stuff\". That this wouldn't be the first time he was asked to defend someone (or somepony) who had been his opposition in court was an odd coincidence worthy of an annoyed groan. That he was being asked to represent the Smug and Obnoxious Trixie by the very same pegasus who was nearly banished to the sun thanks to her, however, THAT was the breaking point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight noticed that Phoenix was looking almost longingly at the table in front of him, and quickly cast a spell when she saw him start to pull his head back. Before he could slam his face into the table again, he was shocked out of it when he felt a blast of cold water hit him in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attorney pegasus coughed and blinked a few times before trying to wipe the water away while Rainbow Dash's dismay over the murder announcement turned into snickering at Phoenix's drenched look. \"Thanks, Twilight... but did you have to soak me?\" He then took a deep breath and turned his focus on the aerial speedster, who's snickering had evolved into a guffaw. Even Nyx giggled quietly, though at least she had the decency to try to cover it up. Under the circumstances, though, he knew he'd have to bring them down. \"So, tell me about the murder. Who's the victim?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Rainbow Dash's light mood immediately fell like a rock at the reminder of why she was there in the first place. \"Right... the horse Trixie's accused of--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean 'pony'?\" Phoenix interrupted reflexively, remembering how he'd been corrected upon making the same mistake when he had first arrived. He knew he had screwed up again somehow, though, when Dash glared at him, crossing her forelegs in irritation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I mean HORSE. It's this Hassim guy... some wizard from Saddle Arabia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" Twilight, Phoenix and Nyx all shouted so loudly that Dash found herself spinning back head over hoof before righting herself and rubbing her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx asked, \"Hassim? As in the Court Wizard of Saddle Arabia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight followed by asking, \"And they think TRIXIE was strong enough to kill him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SADDLE ARABIA? Seriously? That's really a place here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phoenix!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but come on!\" With a sigh, Phoenix asked, \"And you're sure she's innocent? This IS the same Trixie who tried to get you banished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight interjected. \"I know what you're thinking, Phoenix, but Trixie's been through a lot since the trial. Sonata's blackmail...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Getting humiliated when she tried to fill in for the Element of Magic...\" Nyx added. Phoenix glanced over toward her, but the black alicorn looked away when he did so. Adopted or not, Nyx had definitely inherited her mother's lack of a poker face. It was clear there was something she didn't want to talk about there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... And then that whole 'Alicorn Amulet' fiasco,\" Twilight concluded. \"I think that one was the wake-up call she needed. Ever since, she's focused on improving herself instead of just showing off and putting down anypony who challenges her, and she's gotten a lot more popular as a result. She's still... well, Trixie, but I couldn't have imagined her murdering anypony before, and I definitely can't now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash nodded. \"Yeah, and I've had to work with her since we're each supposed to put on a show for the Saddle Arabian prince when he shows up in a couple of days. I was gonna wow 'em with my sweet moves, and she was gonna fill time with her stage magic or whatever,\" she said, punctuating it with a derisive snort, which Phoenix easily picked up on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it you aren't feeling as forgiving as Twilight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buck no,\" Rainbow blurted out angrily, clenching her hooves with fury. Phoenix wasn't exactly sure how that was even biologically possible, but somehow the pegasus pulled that off. \"She tried to get me shipped on a one-way trip to the SUN to satisfy her bloated ego! If I had it my way, I'd have dropped her right in the middle of the Everfree and let the monsters have her! But...\" There was a moment of hesitation in her rant as her voice lost some of its venom, and her body drooped. \"But the whole time we were stuck working together, she was going on about how it was her 'glorious comeback', and how much she was looking forward to performing for royalty. No way was she going to buck that up. I know she didn't do it, and I... well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. I understand,\" Phoenix said to the other pegasus. And it was true. One thing he and the blue speedster shared in common was that they each knew what it was like to be accused of crimes they didn't commit. It wasn't something that he would ever wish on someone else, no matter how badly he thought of them. Seeing Rainbow Dash now, it was clear that she felt the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if it was ever really a choice after hearing Dash of all ponies stick up for Trixie, Phoenix replied, \"Alright. I'll talk to her myself, and if I'm sure she didn't do it, then I'll try to get her to let me represent her in court.\" He thought he heard a muffled 'squee' come from Nyx's direction, but when he looked over at the teenaged alicorn, she had apparently taken quite an interest in one of the light fixtures with conspicuous nonchalance. \"So... I assume she's being held at the detention center? Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he made his way to the door. After his initial difficulties, he was getting a bit better about walking on all fours. It helped if he didn't think about it and just let his new body move the way it wanted to move, though it would probably take him a while longer to get good at manipulating things with hooves. While he fumbled with the door handle, Rainbow Dash asked him, \"Uh... do you even know which way to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix rolled his eyes. \"I know it's been a while, but yeah, I remember the place I visited every day that I was here last time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the <i>Ponyville</i> detention center,\" Twilight countered. \"The Saddle Arabians are going to be visiting Canterlot, so wouldn't everypony involved in the entertainment be there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix's ear pricked up, which was a weird feeling. He'd never been able to wiggle his ears as a human, and they tended to have a mind of their own as a pony. Nevertheless, the important thing was what Twilight had said. \"Canterlot? You mean Equestria's capital?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow nodded. \"Yeah, I flew straight here from there as soon as Trixie was arrested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix's ears flattened atop his head. \"And how far away is it? Even assuming Trixie lets me represent her, it won't do any good if we don't have time to investigate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Mr. Wright,\" Nyx said helpfully. \"It's just a few hours in mom's balloon, or by train if we gather anypony else who wants to help. We can get there in plenty of time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow scoffed at that. \"Pfft! TRAIN? Uh, in case you haven't noticed, Nix here's a <i>pegasus</i>. If we fly, the two of us can get there before the next train even leaves the station.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been a pegasus for all of one hour,\" Phoenix replied, arching an eyebrow as he gave his left wing a weak flap. \"When I first woke up here, I could barely WALK. I'm not sure if trying to fly around is a good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash gave him a Look then, fully deserving of capitalization. It was the same sort of expression he expected these ponies would give him if he got caught relieving himself into their Princess Celestia's soup bowl. A mix of disgust and uncomprehending shock. His fellow pegasus then narrowed her eyes and said with a challenging tone, \"What are you, an earth pony? You said yourself that we need to get there fast! You. Are. FLYING.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix gulped, realizing that he had hit a nerve in the speedster. She DID have a point that having as much time as possible to prepare could only help their case, but he wasn't sure if he would survive the impromptu lessons in how to use his new wings. Plus, though it would leave him a little less time to investigate the scene, travelling with Twilight would give him a chance to learn anything he might need to know about the Saddle Arabians. To his chagrin, his lack of preparation during the early stages of his first trial in Equestria still haunted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring that if he didn't make a stand either way, Dash would probably just grab him and drag him up into the sky anyhow, Phoenix settled on his answer. \"Alright, I'll go with...\"</span></div></div>",

I don't know anything about Saddle Arabia, and I don't want to trip myself up over their customs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dash sighed. \"Yeah, I guess you're right. I just wanted a flying buddy.

Besides which, if I know the trains, there'll be one here in about 30 minutes. It won't take that long to get there, and that'll be valuable study time for... <i>Mr. Wright</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight glanced at her adoptive daughter and mentally giggled. Nyx was clearly suffering from hero-worship. <i>At least, I <b>think</b> it's just hero worship...</i> Shaking her head, Twilight smiled at Phoenix. \"Alright, 30 minutes should be more than enough time to round up the girls and buy tickets to Canterlot. Rainbow, you get the girls, I'll take care of the tickets with Phoenix, Nyx, and Spike.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"On it, Twi!\" With that, Dash zipped out the broken window. A magenta aura surrounded the broken shards, and the window was soon flawlessly back in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"With that done, let's get going!\" Nyx said enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Roughly thirty-five minutes later, Nyx, Phoenix, Twilight, Spike, and the rest of Twilight's group of friends were nestled in a pair of compartments on the train, heading to Canterlot. Phoenix was fighting down a blush at being in close proximity to seven young mares, but no one seemed to notice. They were more interested in his current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So ya got turned into a pony, Phoenix?\" Applejack asked, snorting somewhat. \"Can't say ah like that. It'd be like if ah woke up as a lizard. Ain't natural.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, yes, a phoenix isn't supposed to become a pony. Twilight, you will try to help him, right?\" Fluttershy asked, staring somewhat sternly at the scholar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight gulped nervously at her normally timid friend's glare. \"Um, yes! Of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I think Feenie looks pretty cool as a pegasus!\" Pinkie Pie said, bouncing around the slightly flustered attorney. \"Ooh! Ooh! Have you tried to go flying yet, Feenie? I bet Rainbow Dash would <i>love</i> that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nah, Nix said he's not used to the pony body yet, let alone being a pegasus,\" Dash clarified. \"I gotta say, I was pretty bummed he wouldn't fly with me to Canterlot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, thank Celestia he didn't Dash,\" Rarity interjected. \"If he had, who knows what kind of damage could have been done to his sharp suit and dashing coiffure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix smiled at Rarity. \"Glad to know somepony was on my side... and my hair's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, Rarity's right, it's cool,\" Spike said, eager to earn points with the alabaster mare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The group made small-talk for a few more minutes before Twilight brought everyone's attention to her. \"Okay, everypony, since Phoenix still doesn't know much about this world, we need to educate him. He could be forgiven the last time he was here because he was new to Equestria and... <i>*ahem*</i> neglected to study some necessary materials.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, if <i>some</i>pony had warned me just how different Equestria is from Earth, I would have given more thought to studying,\" Phoenix replied, somewhat acidly. His first appearance in Equestria's courts still stung.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, we'd be happy to help you out, darling,\" Rarity said, batting her eyelashes. \"But what subjects can we talk about in the time available? Canterlot isn't too far, especially by train.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix rubbed his chin with his hoof (and he took a moment to marvel at how different ponies in this world were from his), then said, \"Let's stick with Saddle Arabia. The victim came from there from what we've heard, so I don't want to sound ignorant of their customs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Works for me, Phoenix!\" Twilight said. \"Now, here's what you need to know about Saddle Arabia...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A couple of hours later, the train arrived in Canterlot, allowing Phoenix his first real look at the capital of Equestria. He couldn't help but gawk. <i>This place is enormous! I've never seen such huge buildings!</i> It took a prod from Nyx to bring him back to himself. \"Ah, uh, sorry, it's just, kind of... daunting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx smiled, although Phoenix detected a hint of sadness to it. \"It grows on you. So, where to first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, that's easy enough,\" the attorney said. \"We go to the Canterlot Detention Center. I'll need to convince Ms. Great and Powerful to accept me as her lawyer before I can do anything else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It shouldn't be too hard,\" Twilight murmured, taking the lead of the group through Canterlot. \"I mean, murder is extremely rare in Equestria, as you learned the last time you were here. Most lawyers probably wouldn't touch Trixie's case because of how severe the charge is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, what are we waiting for? C'mon!\" Dash said, about to speed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hang on, Dash!\" Phoenix interrupted her, causing her to false-start in midair. \"Look, I know you all want to help. But if this is anything like last time, the guards won't let just anypony in to see Trixie. I have my badge, so I can get in, but I can't make cases for all of you. I think it's best if I take just one of you along as my co-counsel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But the rest of us wanna help too, Feenie!\" Pinkie protested. \"I was really helpful the last time you were here, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, you were, but being my co-counsel is different from helping me investigate, Pinkie,\" Phoenix explained. \"You'd be actively helping me defend Trixie, which requires that certain protocols be observed. And, no offense, but three... actually, four of you just won't work as my co-counsel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And who would those be?\" Spike asked, arching an eyeridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You, Rainbow, Pinkie, and Fluttershy,\" the attorney replied bluntly. \"Let me explain,\" he added, when he saw a few of the mares start to turn red. \"Spike, you're way too young to consider at all in this case. Rainbow, you're very confrontational, which could land us in a ton of hot water if you push things too far. Pinkie... is Pinkie. And as for Fluttershy, well, I don't mean to offend, but you're a little too kind for this sort of work. You've got to be a little aggressive, which I think we can all agree you're not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh... that's okay, Mr. Phoenix. I know I'm not that aggressive,\" Fluttershy agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So that leaves me with Twilight, Rarity, Applejack, and Nyx as possible co-counsel. And of them, I think Twilight and Nyx are the only ones who could be truly qualified.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Meanin' what, exactly?\" Applejack asked with a slight edge to her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rarity sighed. \"What he means, Applejack, is that you and I have little experience with legal matters. Twilight and Nyx, on the other hoof, live in a library, and thus are able to study our criminal-justice system.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Applejack snorted, but relented. \"Ah guess that makes sense. Sorry ah can't help ya more, Phoenix.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix smiled. \"It's no problem. Besides, the rest of you can still help with my investigation once I've secured myself as Trixie's lawyer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So, who are you going to pick as co-counsel?\" Rainbow asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hm...\" Phoenix thought about that, but his thoughts were interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Actually, Phoenix, I think Nyx will be able to help you out more than I can, this time,\" Twilight said, scuffing a hoof slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wait, what?\" the attorney said with a blink. \"But, you helped me out a lot, last time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes, well... I would like to study the magic that changed you in more detail, and I'm afraid that'll eat up a lot of my time. But don't worry! Nyx is just as good, if not better than me!\" Twilight beamed at her adoptive daughter, who grinned back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You mean it, Mom? I can help Phoenix Wright with his case?!\" The black alicorn looked positively giddy. Without waiting for a response, she scooped Twilight up in her forelegs in a crushing embrace. \"ThankyouthankyouTHANKYOU!!!\" she squealed, before setting her slightly crushed mother back down. \"Ahem. What I mean is, I humbly accept this grave responsibility.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"NOW can we get going to the detention center? Trixie's not going to defend herself, you know!\" Rainbow argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"With her legal arguments, she probably could, actually,\" Phoenix retorted, as the group made their way through Canterlot.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nyx was practically prancing down the road as Twilight directed them toward the Detention Center, Spike holding the map open while riding on the librarian's back. Ever since her power had started to return through her natural growth and development, rather than the forced empowering she had been put through years ago, the young alicorn had been eager to live up to the destiny her cutie mark represented. The more she matured, the more determined she grew to honor the promise that she made to the Princesses years ago and protect ponies from whatever dangers might rear their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, stories of heroes and champions had always been a favorite topic of her's, especially when they involved her mother and the other Elements of Harmony. On the surface, one might not expect the one about Rainbow Dash's trial and the human lawyer her mother had summoned to find the special place in Nyx's heart that it had. There were no monsters or great battles won by strength of arms or magic. Instead, it was about two groups shouting at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was only on the surface. When Nyx heard the story, she could feel the importance of it. The courtroom had indeed been a battlefield where the truth was the most powerful weapon, and an innocent life had been spared because of those who fought to the very last to grab hold of that truth and bring it to light. For a pony who had been as prone to identity crisis as Nyx was in her early life, that thought that the truth was not something to be feared, but to be championed, helped her a great deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now she was not only going to get a chance to follow in the hoofprints of that champion of truth, but he had <i>personally</i> hoof-picked her to help him scour the land high and low for clues pertaining to the guilty culprit! And on top of that, it would give her a perfect opportunity to make it up to Trixie for publicly humiliating the showmare those years ago, during her brief reign as Equestria's dark queen. Even if she had been doing so in order to restore her own image and sense of self-worth, the fact remained that she had been willing to take up the Element of Magic and stand up against Nightmare Moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, while it had seemed funny at the time to embarass the arrogant magician and run her out of Ponyville without even the clothes on her back, the humor had evaporated some months later when she showed up in Ponyville for the fourth time. Having been shown up in terms of raw magical power by both Twilight Sparkle and Nightmare Moon, Trixie had devoted her remaining resources toward seeking out the Alicorn Amulet to greatly amplify her own power. And it had worked, but the Amulet had corrupted her, darkly twisting her craving for fame and recognition into a desire to rule over other ponies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to some advice from Zecora and the help of her friends, Twilight had been able to use sleight-of-hoof to con the power-mad Trixie into giving up the Amulet before her ambitions could spread beyond Ponyville. Still, even though nopony had really blamed Nyx for inciting Trixie's desire for the Alicorn Amulet in the first place, Nyx herself always felt that she shouldered at least a little of the responsibility for the damage that was done, and she hoped that this would be a chance to set things right once and for all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Nyx, what're you thinking about?\" Pinkie's voice broke her reverie as the pink pony bounced alongside her with a wide grin. \"You look like me when I'm waiting for that first fresh batch of cupcakes to come out of the oven, and the smell is just soooo good that I wish we didn't have to save them for the customers because I can practically taste that sweet, sweet goodness on my tongue already and oh my gosh girls, is anypony else hungry? Oh, and since when are clouds square?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheer whiplash of Pinkie's questions caused everypony to look at her and see that she was pointing up at the sky. They all turned their heads up as one just as a perfectly rectangular shadow was cast over them, starting small but growing larger as something descended from the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not a cloud,\" Twilight replied, shading her eyes to get a better look. \"It's... a carpet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't we get out from under it?\" Spike asked as it gradually grew closer and closer. The others quickly realized that he had a point and spread out just as the carpet lowered itself onto the street. Once it had set itself down on the ground, a shimmering glow lifted itself away from the ornate rug and swirled around before being drawn into a ruby positioned on the forehead of one of its occupants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix blinked at the sight. \"A flying carpet... of COURSE it's a flying carpet,\" he mused, though in actuality it was the riders that drew his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually seeing two Saddle Arabians in person, the horse/pony dichotomy suddenly made a lot more sense to the transmogrified human. He figured that if he were still in his normal shape, he would probably be about eye level with the two horses, but from a pony's perspective they seemed like giants. A stallion and a mare by the look of them, the female of the duo was light beige, and clad in silk and jewelry, one of which was the ruby that had absorbed the magic keeping their carpet aloft. She looked at him, but only fleetingly as golden eyes glanced every which way to take in everything around her at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stallion, by contrast, appeared far more focused. He was much larger and more muscular than his companion, with a dark brown coat and bright white mane, Phoenix was hit with an odd sense of familiarity that solidified when the stallion's eyes focused on his own with a penetrating crimson stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Phoenix felt as though he were yanked out of Equestria and back into the courtroom on Earth, looking across the room as a tall, dark man glared at him through a visor which glowed red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-godot?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good day to you as well,\" the stallion replied, the image of one of Phoenix's courtroom adversaries vanishing to be replaced by the swarthy equine in front of him. \"My apologies for disturbing you, but we are new to this city. Can you give us directions to the dungeon?\" His female counterpart leaned in to whisper something into his ear before he corrected himself. \"Ah, I mean the 'Detention Center.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack asked, \"You're headin' there too? Y'all here about the wizard that got killed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bluntness of her question caused the Saddle Arabian to arch an eyebrow at her, but he replied, \"'Too?' Indeed. I am Grand Inquisitor Achmed, and my wife Farah and I are here to represent our nation's interests in the coming trial. The Court Wizard was one of the King's closest cousins, and so we have been sent to ensure that justice is carried out upon his killer.\" To Phoenix, he asked, \"And judging by your suit, are you here to defend the murderer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix felt his feathers bristle as Dash jumped up and hovered in front of the stallion. \"Hey, Trixie didn't do it, and we're gonna prove it! So you can roll up your carpet and shove it up--YIPE!\" Phoenix had reacted reflexively, trying to grab Dash's tail and yank her away. He'd momentarily forgotten that he didn't have hands, however, so instead of getting a grip, his hoof kept going until it touched her flank. This caused her to turn a withering glare on him. \"Hey, hooves off the merchandise, Nix!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix felt himself break into a cold sweat under that glare while Rarity whispered to herself with a hint of dismay, \"Oh my... so THAT'S the sort of mare he likes,\" just loudly enough for him to overhear while Fluttershy supportively put a wing across her friend's back. The rest of the mares stared in shock while spike tried (and failed) to keep from snickering at his plight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor his part, Phoenix was just hoping Rainbow Dash didn't suddenly decide to give him 'flying lessons', though a small part of his mind congratulated himself for at least diverting her attention before she could start an international incident. Clearing his throat, he tried to ignore the possibility of an imminent high-altitude demise as he addressed the horses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry for Rainbow Dash's outburst there,\" he said while the other pegasus fumed at him. \"We aren't officially her defense team yet, but she's right that we don't think that she's guilty, so if she lets us, we'll be seeing each other on opposite sides of the courtroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was normally the point where the prosecution would start with the cocky insults, but Achmed smiled instead. \"Well, your Royal Guards seem to think otherwise. As Inquisitor, it is my duty to believe in that truth and fight for it just as you fight for yours. If we do meet in the courtroom, then we will see who's truth has greater weight. Until then, I wish you and your many wives well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a deafening silence fell over three whole city blocks from that verbal bomb, Farah's ruby flashed and magic flowed out of it, swirling around them like a living thing before inhabiting the carpet once more and lifting the horses up into the air. The stunned silence was broken just before they flew out of earshot as they heard her say in heavily-accented English, \"Farewell for now, Mr. Wright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis left him surrounded by seven mares who were either blushing or glaring at him, and one guffawing dragon. Before he could protest that it was Achmed who said it, though, a thought came to his mind. <i>Wait, how did she know my name?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After having to spend several minutes defusing the rather tense situation caused by the Saddle Arabians' parting comments, Phoenix dragged himself down the street toward the Detention Center once more, both looking and feeling like he'd just barely escaped a pack of timberwolves. Hearing Spike call him a 'player' nearly every step of the way didn't help any, either. Taking a deep breath, Phoenix tried to tune the smartass dragon out and focus on his meeting with the prosecution, as well as what he had learned of their ways and culture on the train ride there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When we get access to the crime scene, we're going to need to try to find the Court Wizard's djinn,\" Twilight explained as the Friendship Express departed from Ponyville.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix gave Twilight an odd look at that and asked, \"This pony... er... horse is dead, and you want to raid his liquor cabinet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight blinked a few times before realizing the error and groaned. \"Not gin... His <i>djinn</i>. Saddle Arabian magic isn't quite like unicorn magic, but it isn't exactly the same as pegasi or earth pony magic, either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I thought only unicorns can use magic,\" Phoenix replied, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only unicorns can cast <i>spells</i>, darling,\" Rarity corrected. \"Why, practically everything has magic, it's just that for pegasi and earth ponies, it's innate rather than focused into spells.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" Applejack proudly interjected. \"That's why we earth ponies get th' most bang fer our buckin' when it comes t' growin' crops or things t' do with the soil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how else do you think pegasi move clouds around,\" Rainbow Dash asked with a smug, know-it-all grin. \"Pfft, some eggheads think we couldn't even fly if it weren't for magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You <i>couldn't</i>,\" Twilight replied with a tone that made it clear it was a point she had tried to make many times in the past. \"The equine body type is completely unsuitable for flight! It's magic as much as wingpower that lets you stay up in the air, let alone break the sound barrier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Dash just rolled her eyes, exacerbating the unicorn's agitation, Phoenix tried to switch gears quickly to Nyx. \"So you're a...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An alicorn,\" the teenager replied, happy to be helpful. \"I can use all three types of pony magic.\" Tilting her head curiously, she asked, \"Don't humans have magic, Mr. Wright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix hesitated for a moment before replying, \"Well... there are <i>some</i> types of magic in my world, I guess, but it's so rare that most people don't even think magic exists. I know a few who can channel the spirits of the dead, and then there's my magatama--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You that toy you were playing with last time you were here? You <i>still</i> have that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>IT'S NOT A TOY!</b>\" A number of other passengers glared at Phoenix after his sudden and loud outburst while Fluttershy reflexively dove under the seats. \"I mean... it's not a toy, it's an artifact that lets me know when someone is keeping secrets from me. It helps me find out what people are hiding when I need to get info from them that can decide a case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, Applejack raised an accusatory eyebrow at him when she heard this. \"B-but I don't just use it whenever I feel like it,\" he explained quickly. \"Only when someone's life is hanging in the balance, and I need to find the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, this seemed to satisfy the farmer enough that she didn't kick him upside the head as Twilight got them back on track. \"Anyway, we were talking about Saddle Arabian magic. Their magic involves binding spirits called 'djinn' into their service by sealing them in gemstones or objects of personal value. Most common djinn aren't that powerful, sort of like how most unicorns don't learn much more than basic levitation and lighting spells, along with whatever magic suits their special talent. The ones bound to the royal family, though, are incredibly ancient and powerful, pre-dating Equestria's founding. According to legend, the one bound to the King is old enough that it was around during the creation of the world itself. That's probably an exaggeration, but even Princess Celestia says that it's probably more powerful than she is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ponies and dragon were awestruck, and even Phoenix was impressed by this claim, given the reverence his equine companions had for their rulers. \"So how come they aren't ruling the world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as powerful as djinn are, they're also limited in what they can do,\" Twilight explained. \"They can't harm or kill another living being, they can't control another being's thoughts or actions, and they're completely incapable of lying. As a result, they're used to improve the lives of the Saddle Arabians and defend them from outsiders, rather than as tools of conquest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Phoenix said. \"So what about their culture?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, can I take this one?\" Nyx quickly leaned in before Twilight could continue her lecture, looking at her mother with big, eager eyes. Twilight blinked, but nodded to let her daughter go ahead, causing Nyx to let out a happy squeak before she went into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, modern Saddle Arabia is descended from a large number of nomadic tribes who were unified over three thousand years ago by a king who was also the most powerful djinn-binder that ever lived. His name was King S--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Phoenix interrupted, holding up a hoof. \"Don't tell me... was his name... King Solomane?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx gasped in astonishment. \"H-how'd you know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix gave a pained chuckle as the punny name made him want to hoof-punch himself in the face. \"Let's just call it a lucky guess,\" he replied, wondering just how many places and historical figures in this world were one horse-pun away from being counterparts of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, well... King Solomane single-hoofedly bound all of the most ancient and powerful djinn known of today. Over five hundred of them, all told. Since Saddle Arabia doesn't have immortal rulers like the Princesses, he passed the djinn down to his children, laying the foundation for the extremely large royal family that exists now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're very intelligent and civilized, and were among the first races to develop advanced mathematics and literature, though they do maintain some traditions that were inherited and modified from their ancient, more warlike tribal days. Dueling, for example, is a fairly common way to settle disputes, as they believe that destiny favors the righteous. Instead of fighting to the death or anything, though, they typically settle things with a contest between their djinni, ensuring that nopony gets hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since the djinn can't cause harm to any living thing,\" Phoenix mused, putting two and two together. \"Anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, there are other ancient customs too. Polygamy, for example, though it isn't nearly as widespread as common stereotypes would make you think. It used to be back when they lost a lot of stallions to inter-tribal warfare, but the only times it's practiced anymore are among extremely radical traditionalists or by the highest-ranking members of the royal family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That son of a bitch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>PHOENIX!</b> Language,\" Twilight scolded him, quickly yanking the map from Spike's claws and covering his head with it. The baby dragon let out muffled protests as he tried to pull it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry,\" Phoenix replied, \"I just remembered what Nyx said earlier about Saddle Arabians and polygamy. According to that, either that Achmed guy thought I was a kook, royalty, or he was just messing with us. And considering his wife somehow knew my name when I'm pretty sure I never got around to saying it, I'm putting my money on option three.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that wasn't very nice,\" Fluttershy said softly. \"Playing on racial stereotypes like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity huffed, \"I should say not! Rarity is the 'other mare' to <i>no</i> stallion, and I resent any accusation to the contrary, even in jest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, are you still worried about Farah knowing your name, Feenie?\" Pinkie bounced over to him and said reassuringly, \"Don't worry about it. She probably just read it in the dialog box!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix shrugged. \"Yeah, you're probably righ-- Wait, what?\" But Pinkie was already bounding off ahead toward a stately building with marble columns, an emblem of the scales of justice, and a pair of unicorn Royal Guards stationed in front of the doors. \"Oh, I guess we're here. Alright, they'll probably only let me in, so I'll go have a chat with Trixie and be right out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck, Mr. Wright,\" Nyx said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, don't let that stuck-up blowhard turn you down!\" This one came from Dash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching the door, the guards quickly braced themselves in his path and glared sternly at him. As one, they exclaimed, \"Halt! State your business!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling out his Equestrian attorney badge, Phoenix held it out for the guards to see. \"My name is Phoenix Wright. I'm a defense attorney, here to see Trixie Lulamoon about her case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter looking at the heart-shaped badge to confirm that it was the real thing, the guard on the left told him...</span></div></div>",

So, on their urging, I came here to look into your case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Trixie was slack-jawed. \"<i>Rainbow Dash</i> vouched for me?

Certainly not murder!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix waited a moment, but nothing happened. \"Hm... alright, then, Trixie. If you want me, I'll take your case. I believe you didn't kill Hassim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Trixie's anger evaporated into relief. \"Trixie thanks you, Phoenix Wright.

Representing somepony who you once argued against?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix chuckled wryly. \"It wouldn't be the first time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Trixie blinked, and smirked. \"It sounds as if you have a story or two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Doesn't everypony?\" the attorney asked. \"Anyway, what can you personally tell me of what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Trixie sighed. \"Very little of the actual murder itself. Trixie was in her cart when she was arrested. But as for Hassim himself... that is another story. You may not be aware, Phoenix Wright, but the Saddle Arabians were sending a delegation to meet with Princess Celestia. Trixie was to perform alongside Rainbow Dash for their prince.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes, Rainbow told me about that,\" Phoenix nodded. \"But if the prince wasn't to arrive for a couple of days, what was the Court Wizard doing here ahead of him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Trixie was told, by Hassim no less, that he was here ahead of time to secure proper accomodations for the Prince,\" Trixie replied. \"In addition to being the Court Wizard, Hassim also served as Saddle Arabia's ambassador to Canterlot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Important guy,\" Phoenix mused. \"So, you got to speak to him, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Trixie's demeanor suddenly changed.

Mentally, he sighed. <i>Of course... everypony's got something to hide, after all.</i> Knowing he didn't have nearly enough evidence to break the Psyche-Lock, he smiled. \"Well, I'm off to go investigate. I promise, Trixie, you'll be a free mare by the time I'm done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Trixie smiled at him; a genuine smile, not the haughty arrogant smile he remembered from their first meeting. \"Thank you, Phoenix Wright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As Phoenix left the Detention Center, he noticed that only Nyx was waiting for him. \"Hey, Nyx!\" he called, causing her to canter over. \"Where'd the others go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Summoned away for a meeting with Princess Celestia,\" Nyx explained. \"They were asking for me as well, but since I'm your co-counsel, I asked to remain behind.

He and Nyx had bumped into Twilight and her friends after their meeting with the Princess, and the news hadn't been good. Due to the politically-charged nature of the case, their involvement would have suggested an unfair bias toward the defense. Nyx was allowed to help only because she was his co-counsel. Still, he couldn't help but feel like there were forces at work trying to keep his job from getting too easy by denying him the extra pairs of eyes that the six mares and dragon could have offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's too bad your mom and her friends can't help, but it could still be worse,\" Phoenix said to Nyx with a jocular tone. \"At least I haven't fallen off a bridge this time. Yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx blinked, sensing there was a story behind that, but also giggled as she looked at him. \"Well, you <i>are</i> a pegasus, so I can't imagine that would actually be so bad right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix looked back over his shoulder and flexed his wings a bit before tucking them back against his sides. \"Heh, well, that's true. Not sure I really want to find out, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of silence before Nyx asked, \"Mr. Wright, are you scared of heights?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix shook his head. \"Not really. No more so than the next person, anyway, it's just weird to think about flying. Where I'm from, the only people who can fly under their own power are comic book heroes. Besides, Twilight said it's magic that lets pegasi fly, so what if I only have the shape of a pegasus, and none of the magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx rubbed her chin in thought. \"Hmm... good point. Oh! Why don't we test it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm <i>not</i> jumping off a bridge,\" Phoenix replied. \"We don't really have the time, anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx laughed. \"Oh, no, I didn't mean anything like that. There's a much easier way to tell whether you've got pegasus magic or not, and it'll only take a minute. I just hope they don't mind if I borrow a bit of cloud...\" She looked up to the sky. As expected of the Canterlot weather team, the skies were bright and clear with a few fluffy white clouds perfectly shaped and placed to provide decoration and the occasional spot of shade. Spotting the nearest one, Nyx spread her large wings and pushed herself up into the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the ground, Phoenix arched an eyebrow as he watched her fly up. To his surprise, he found that he could see her clearly even as she got farther and farther away. He hadn't really thought about it before, being too distracted by his return to Equestria and the impending investigation, but realized that his eyesight was somewhat sharper at a distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Huh. Well, if nothing else, that should come in handy,</i> he thought to himself as Nyx glanced shiftily from side to side before breaking off a pony-sized chunk of cloud and smoothing over the gap left behind before flying back down the ground with the bit of cloud held in her hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix shook his head in disbelief at the sight, even though he knew from Rainbow Dash's trial that pegasi could manipulate clouds and weather. <i>Which I will never, ever, <b>ever</b> forget.</i> It was one thing to know it in theory, and another to actually see a flying pony break off a piece of cloud like cotton candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she was back on street level and placed the cloud in front of Phoenix. \"Here you go. Just hop on,\" she said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix inspected the cloud with an expression of uncertainty on his face. After all, magic or not, it was still a cloud. It looked like there should be no possible way that it could hold his weight. He looked up to Nyx, who was grinning widely, cat-like eyes sparkling with anticipation, so he reached out a hoof to poke it first. The fluffy white mass pushed in under his hoof, and as he gave it a few more experimental pokes, he realized that it felt like a stress ball, but one that could be broken up as he pulled off a small piece, molding it in his hooves before putting it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter confirming that he could indeed touch it, he climbed up onto the cloud and boggled as it not only held together under his weight, but didn't so much as drop an inch. It was like those cloud platforms in old 2-D platformer games he had played as a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations, Mr. Wright, you're 100% pegasus,\" Nyx replied. \"Well, at least for weather. There's a <i>small</i> chance that you might not be able to fly well, but that's incredibly rare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix hopped up and down a few times on the cloud to test it before seeing Nyx's good mood fall somewhat. Sitting down on the cloud (which he quickly realized was one of the most comfortable things he had ever rested his butt on) he asked, \"What's the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I was just thinking of my friend, Scootaloo,\" Nyx replied, leaning against the side of the cloud as she reminisced. \"She's a pegasus too, but she has a sort of magical birth defect. She can do almost everything any other pegasus can do, but her wings will never give her enough lift to stay airborne for more than a minute or two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Wow, that's... that's gotta be rough,\" Phoenix replied sympathetically. \"I imagine it'd be like being born a human with only one leg.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx nodded, looking up to the sky with a wan smile. \"Yeah, you know how Rainbow Dash is so gung-ho about flying? Scootaloo absolutely idolized her. Still does, really. When she found out she'd never be able to follow in Dash's hoofsteps, she was completely devastated for a long while. But don't worry, she's okay now. What her wings lack in lift, they make up for in velocity, so right now she's in Las Pegasus to build up a name for herself on the stunt and racing circuit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx giggled and looked at Phoenix. \"'Tires of Fire' Scootaloo, the fastest pegasus on land! That's what she's calling herself now, so I'm not too worried. In fact, I bet you twenty bits she'll be the first pony ever to pull off a Sonic Rainboom on ground-level.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix smiled back, but then asked, \"So why did it make you sad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx replied, \"Well... it's just that right before you showed up, we had a Cutie Mark Crusader going-away party. Scootaloo's off in Las Pegasus, and Sweetie Belle's actually here in Canterlot at the big conservatory. I should visit her if we get any free time on this case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix nodded understandingly while she sniffled slightly, opening up her heart to him. \"I could've left, too... joined the Guard or the police academy to learn how to protect ponies, or even gone overseas, but... it was already too much, letting those two leave. My other friends, Twist and Apple Bloom, were still settled in Ponyville, so I found a reason to stay so I wouldn't have to lose anypony else from my life. My friends, mom, Spike... I'm... I'm probably going to live a long, long time... A lot longer than anypony except Spike. And I'm at peace with that, I think... I just want to hold onto them while I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix wasn't entirely sure how to respond to Nyx's confessions as tears started to form in her eyes. He had never been that great with kids and teenagers, and his knowledge of alicorns was limited to them having traits of all three pony races, and being extremely powerful and revered. On the subject of friendship, though, he could speak up. \"I actually know how you feel, Nyx. You know, when I was young, my best friend left school really suddenly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis got her attention, and he looked her in the eye as he nodded. \"Yeah, his dad was killed, and he had to move away. I didn't see him again until years later, when we were both adults. By then, he'd changed completely. He'd become a cold and ruthless prosecutor who only wanted to get the accused convicted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah,\" Nyx whispered. \"So did you meet him in court?\" Phoenix nodded. \"So what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix chuckled. \"What else? He got accused of murder, and I defended him. It's a long story, but we patched things up, and it turned out he wasn't quite as different as he'd seemed at first. He just wanted to make sure that criminals would be punished. Now, the two of us are clear that we just want to get at the truth, so we're still able to be good friends. I'm sure it's the same for you and your friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx smiled, her eyes still moist but her joy genuine. \"Thanks, Mr. Wright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a problem. Oh... and about your... lifespan? Like I said before, I know people back home who can channel spirits. One of them's my assistant, so believe me when I say this.\" He placed a hoof on her shoulder. \"You are <i>never</i> alone. The ones you love will <i>always</i> be there for you, so don't ever feel like you need to hold yourself back just to hold onto them. Real friendship never dies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the conviction in Phoenix's eyes, Nyx tried to find the words to express her gratitude when their conversation was interrupted by a sudden shout. \"Help! Help!\" An elderly neon green stallion with a blue mane pointed at Nyx and Phoenix while shouting. \"Nightmare Moon's stealing our clouds! And she's got an evil porcupine eating that stallion's head!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix sputtered with indignation while Nyx eeped and quickly took off flying again. Phoenix was about to give the old coot a piece of his mind when he suddenly felt himself get yanked away by Nyx's magic, flapping and flailing wildly as she carried him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was <i>that</i> about?!\" he exclaimed, eventually giving up on trying to escape the magic grip, instead crossing his forelegs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-nothing,\" Nyx lied. \"I just realized we should really be getting to the crime scene!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh...\" Phoenix didn't buy it for a second, but the fact remained that they did still have an investigation to perform, so he went along for the ride until they reached the scene where they met...</span></div></div>",

He looked down at the charred grass, and sighed as he spotted a white tape outline. \"Deja vu...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Huh?\" Nyx blinked at the seeming non-sequitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Just remembering my first time here in Equestria,\" the pegasus murmured. \"Ace Swift was killed by a bolt of lightning, and his body was found in a charred area of grass. It took some doing to get Rainbow Dash off the hook.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So you're <i>that</i> defense attorney, pal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The familiar voice nearly scared the feathers off Phoenix's wings. He yelped and spun to face the speaker. For a moment, he was under the impression that he was facing a slightly older man, wearing a filthy overcoat, with a scruffy appearance and a messy head of hair. He blinked, and the view changed... slightly. He was now facing a slightly older stallion, wearing a filthy overcoat, with a scruffy appearance and a messy mane. The similarity was even more jarring than when Phoenix had first met Sonata or Applejack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx wasn't as disoriented. \"Oh, are you the detective in charge here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The stallion grinned. \"That's right! Detective Dick Gumhoof, lead investigator on this case!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0If Phoenix was disoriented before, now he was just plain dizzy. <i>Seriously?! GumHOOF?! This is too crazy to be coincidence!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx noticed his condition, and kept him steady when it looked like he was about to fall over. \"Phoenix? Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her voice brought the attorney back to his senses. \"Huh...? Oh, yes, of course!\" He looked at the detective, who was looking at him curiously. \"Sorry about that, you just remind me a lot of somepony else I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Huh. Guess what they say is true, everypony has a twin out there,\" Gumhoof mused. He grinned again. \"Well, anyway! You're the defense team for that magician, right? What was her name... Tricky?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Trixie, actually,\" Phoenix replied, getting into his element. \"And I hear the victim was the court wizard of Saddle Arabia, Hassim, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That's right, pal!\" Gumhoof sighed. \"Talk about your international incidents. This is going to be one ugly trial, and you've got one hay of an uphill battle ahead of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So, can you tell me any details on what happened here?\" Phoenix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gumhoof considered, then shrugged. \"Why not?\" He looked downcast for a moment. \"Not like my salary can get any lower...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>... And the similarities continue,</i> the attorney thought, as Gumhoof presented him with a manilla envelope. It took Phoenix a moment to open it, being unused to his body and all. The envelope, it turned out, contained the initial autopsy report. \"Hm... cause of death... electrocution? This really is deja vu...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, but there's one big difference from Ace Swift's murder,\" Gumhoof broke in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What's that?\" Nyx asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y'see, we couldn't find any stormclouds or anything like that around. Also, our unicorn docs determined something. The electricution that did him in... was magical in nature.\" Gumhoof shivered. \"Scary, being able to summon that much power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix frowned. \"Something isn't right, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Huh?\" chorused Nyx and Gumhoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's just, when I defended Rainbow Dash, Twilight told me something,\" the attorney mused. \"She said that no living unicorn has the magical prowess needed to summon lethal amounts of electricity, and that those types of spells are forbidden. So, why exactly was Trixie arrested?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, she was seen leaving the scene of the crime,\" Gumhoof said. \"A witness saw her after hearing a few lightning bolts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Remembering that Equestrian lightning worked differently from Earth lightning, Phoenix nodded with a sigh. \"Great... an eyewitness. My day just can't get any worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, you think that's bad?\" Gumhoof asked with a wry grin. \"Take a look at this.\" He led Phoenix over to what appeared to be a set of hoofprints in the ground, near the back door of the house. \"They're still kinda fresh. Care to guess who they belong to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Trixie,\" the pegasus replied with a groan. \"She told me she'd only spoken to Hassim in passing! What was she doing in his backyard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good question, pal. Maybe you oughta ask her,\" the detective replied. He scratched the back of his head, lifting his coat enough that Phoenix caught a glimpse of his cutie mark: a broken magnifying glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>How fitting, if Gumhoof is anything like his double on Earth,</i> the attorney thought wryly. Out loud, he coughed. \"Well, anything else you can tell us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gumhoof frowned. \"Well... just between the three of us... something here doesn't add up. And I don't just mean the 'lack of power' thing. From what I saw of the body... Hassim was hit from different angles at the same time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That is strange,\" Nyx said with her own frown. \"I'm not sure what to make of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix sighed, giving the scene one more look. Nothing jumped out at him, unfortunately. \"Well, we might as well get going. The trial's tomorrow, right?\" he asked the detective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yep, sure is. You might wanna study hard, Mr. Lawyer,\" Gumhoof laughed heartily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Study hard, and share this with my friends,\" muttered Phoenix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But, didn't they say - \" Nyx began, looking confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"They said they couldn't help directly with the investigation. But I'm just going to ask them some questions about what we know about the crime. Getting details from ponies who know their stuff, you understand?\" Phoenix clarified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh...\" Nyx nodded. \"I understand.\" She grabbed Phoenix in her magic again, and flew off, the attorney pegasus not even protesting this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gumhoof watched them leave. \"Huh. Wonder why he didn't just fly with her?\" He shrugged. \"Ah, well, not my problem. Instant noodles, here I come!\" He trotted out through the opulent house, making sure not to touch anything. It wouldn't do to dirty the home of the prince of Saddle Arabia, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At the station in Ponyville, three ponies awaited the train to Canterlot. Two young unicorn mares and a slightly older stallion drew hardly a glance from the rest of the town. They whispered amongst themselves, seperate from the townsponies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I can't believe all of this!\" the youngest mare squealed quietly, practically bouncing on her hooves. She was a purple color, a shade or two darker than Twilight, and wore a magatama and light-colored robes. Her black mane was done up in an ornate style that drew some curious looks from the locals. \"This is amazing! And I thought Nick was lying when he told me about this place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It would seem Wright was telling the truth after all,\" the stallion replied. He was light in color, similar to Phoenix's coat, wearing a brilliant magenta coat and white crevat. His black mane was cut short in the back, but pushed forward to frame his face. \"I'm just glad we were able to get used to these new forms on our own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And knowing Phoenix Wright's luck, he's probably landed smack dab in the middle of a foolishly foolish fool's errand,\" the last mare said. She had a white coat, with a light blue mane that framed her face in a sort of bowl cut. She wore a black vest studded with jewels the color of her mane, and a small whip hung by her side. \"That or a murder investigation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The younger mare frowned. \"Well, normally I'd say 'that's impossible', considering what this world's like, but given what he told us about his last visit here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Indeed,\" the stallion said with a frown of his own. \"Wright has the most unfortunate luck sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"A fool's luck, one might say,\" the mare with the whip added. \"Still, let's see what exactly he's up to in this city of 'Canterlot'.\"</span></div></div>",

At the moment, they were following Twilight and Nyx to the house of Twilight's parents, the librarian having gotten in touch with them during the investigation. As they made their way up the road, Phoenix found himself staring at the upscale houses they were passing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Twilight? Are you sure we're going the right way?\" <i>I feel like I'm trespassing,</i> he thought. <i>Some of these places look like they're worth more than the entire building my apartment's in.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, we're almost there,\" Twilight breezily replied, completely comfortable in their surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You live in a <b>tree</b>, for crying out loud!</i> Try as he might, though, he just couldn't find a way to vocalize his astonishment that the small-town librarian he knew came from such a wealthy background. His train of thought was interrupted anyway when a pink, blue-eyed ball of energy started bouncing around right in front of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie grinned as she hopped backwards, blithely doing so without tripping over any of the cobblestones in their path. \"Oh, you're gonna love Twilight's parents! They're super-duper nice and fun. They invited us here for Twilight's 25th birthday and we had so much fun at the party, everypony in the neighborhood came to join in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They came to complain about the noise, darling,\" Rarity replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, don'tcha remember all th' city guard that came t' tell us t' pipe down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\" Pinkie Pie rubbed her chin in thought as she continued to bounce along on her other three legs. \"I remember they stayed for the cake. And the limbo contest! Officer Cuffem was so happy to win the trophy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash groused quietly through lightly clenched teeth, \"I <i>so</i> would've won if Officer Hotpants hadn't walked by. I'd like to see any of you try to limbo with a sudden wingy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix blinked, unfamiliar with the term, but Applejack nudged his shoulder and shook her head with an expression that clearly said 'you don't want to ask.' She then took it upon herself to change the subject. \"Anyway, don't let the fancy digs worry ya none, sugarcube. Ah had th' same reaction, first time Twi invited us over t' her folks' place, but they're good, honest ponies. Not lahk the stuck-up snobs that live up in these parts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's called 'class' and 'sophistication', darling,\" Rarity huffed. \"I can't imagine why you would be surprised. After all, one should expect fine, upstanding parents to produce such outstanding children like our dear Twilight and her brother. Besides, I don't recall you turning Fancypants down when he wanted to sponsor Sweet Apple Acres in that agricultural competition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack retorted, \"Now that was business. 'Sides, ah ain't got nothin' 'gainst yer friend Fancypants. Feller might not've ever put in a hard day's work in his life, but at least he appreciates the effort other ponies put into keepin' Equestria runnin'. Not like them sicky-fants always hoverin' around him with their noses in th' air an' not a single opinion of their own between 'em.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The word is 'sycophants,' darling,\" Rarity corrected. \"Though... I will admit, you have a point there. But that just demonstrates the difference between <i>true</i> class and those who merely play at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here!\" Twilight called out from the front, walking up to the door of their destination. It wasn't the biggest or the fanciest house on the block, but it still looked like a mansion to Phoenix, who hung back a bit to take it in. The door opened and an older mare and stallion came out to greet them as everypony filed in. Nyx wrapped her grandparents up in a big wing-hug before going inside, and the Elements of Harmony each paid their respects before following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix was the last one in, and he reflexively reached out to shake hands with the stallion of the house before embarrassingly realizing that the gesture didn't work well with hooves. \"Heh... sorry, old habit. It's nice to meet you, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just call me Nightlight. And this lovely vision is my wife, Twilight Velvet. \" Twilight's father replied, ushering the human-turned-pegasus inside. Velvet rolled her eyes a little, but couldn't keep a smile and a slight blush off her face at the obviously well-worn compliment. Then he said, \"It's a pleasure to finally meet you, after everything our daughter's said. Though I have to admit, I expected you to be more... alien.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix chuckled and replied, \"Heh, believe me, so did I. It's been a strange day for everypony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have to tell me all about it,\" Velvet replied. \"Actually, I wouldn't mind if you could share some stories of the cases you've tried back home! I don't know if Twilight told you, but I'm something of a novelist, and I'd just love to get a chance to talk to someone who's been involved in actual murder cases for inspiration.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix was taken aback by the suggestion, but in a good way. <i>She thinks ponies would actually want to read stories about a defense attorney? Wow, maybe I'm finally cashing in some good karma points.</i> Laughing modestly, he said, \"Wow, I'm flattered! Yeah, I've tried a lot of strange and fascinating cases, and I'd love to tell you all about them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he'd love to,\" Twilight interrupted, suddenly butting in. \"But for now, he's got to make sure he <i>studies</i> and is prepared for the trial tomorrow.\" She gave Phoenix an arch look that made his pale coat paler as beads of cold sweat formed on his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, that's right. Gotta study up! But after the trial, I'm all yours, Mrs. Velvet.\" <i>Right. Gotta focus on making sure Trixie's found innocent, and not incite the wrath of my co-counsel's mother.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we're happy to put you and Twilight's friends up for as long as you need, though I'm afraid we don't have quite enough beds to go around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Phoenix was disappointed. Just another case of drawing the short straw, since he couldn't possibly ask any of Twilight's closest friends to sleep on the floor for his own benefit. But then he recalled a moment earlier that day and replied, \"Actually, that's not a problem. I'm sure I can just get a piece of cloud to sleep on.\" It felt weird to say, but remembering the astonishing comfort of resting on condensed water vapor put him in a good mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I prefer cloud beds too,\" Rainbow Dash said from the living room before something clicked. \"Wait, when were you up in the clouds? Nyx, did you take Nix flying without me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix ended up having to quickly explain his continued aeronautic virginity and how Nyx had helped him test his pegasus-hood, much to the amusement of the others as Rainbow acted like she'd been cheated out of her chance to mentor Phoenix in the ways of the pegasi. After a lively dinner with Twilight's friends and family, the group gathered around to discuss the evidence Phoenix and Nyx had been given, sparse as it was. After hours of poring over every conceivable detail and angle, they decided that it was time to turn in so that they would be fresh and ready for the trial the next morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Nyx brought down enough cloud matter for Phoenix to make himself some comfortable bedding (while Rainbow grumbled that a real pegasus should be able to do so himself), the attorney took off his suit and settled in for a good night's sleep. Unlike his first night in Equestria, not only was the bed properly sized for his current body, but it was the most snug, comfortable 'mattress' he had ever rested on. Even with all the thoughts and questions about the trial running through his head, it didn't take long for him to drift off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Most of the girls had piled into Twilight's old room, as well as the guest room. Rarity and Fluttershy shared a bed, as did Applejack and Twilight. Nyx shared with Pinkie Pie, though neither really minded; Pinkie, after 'testing' various ponies, had determined that being Nyx's partner would be comfiest, and Nyx had agreed. Rainbow Dash and Phoenix slept soundly on seperate cloud beds, though Phoenix was out in the living room as opposed to in one of the normal bedrooms. He'd insisted, after all, seeing it as inappropriate to be the lone male in a room full of young mares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Still, his sleep started to become less sound, as he started twitching, his face contorting. \"Mmm... no... Mia...\" he murmured. His twitches became more pronounced, his breathing labored. Soon, he'd gone beyond twitching, and into outright thrashing. Sweat poured down his face, his murmurs turning into whispered pleas for mercy from Twilight, from Nyx, asking them not to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was fortunate for him, then, that Rainbow Dash happened to pass by on her way to the kitchen for an early-morning cup of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The athletic pegasus had refined the art of napping to the point where she'd actually reduced the overall amount of sleep she needed each night. She'd gotten a nap earlier, after Princess Celestia's little bombshell that she A) wouldn't be the judge in this case, and B) was asking the rest of them not to investigate with Phoenix. She was still a little mad about that, but she wasn't about to argue with the Princess. She'd woken up about a minute ago in the guest room, and silently crept out, intent on getting a cup of water, downing it, and perhaps getting in a little early-morning exercise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All that flew out of her mind when she saw Phoenix in the grips of a nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"N-Nix?\" she asked, hovering closer. When she saw how badly he was thrashing, her eyes widened. She'd actually seen this kind of behavior from Scootaloo once or twice, after the news that the orange pegasus would never truly fly like she could. She knew nightmares, and from the way the attorney was sweating and jerking around, this one was bad. \"Nix! Wake up!\" she hissed, trying to pin him to halt his thrashing. Phoenix was stronger than he looked, though, and she was knocked off of him onto the floor with a loud 'thump!'. Shaking her head to clear it, she saw that his condition seemed to be worsening. And for the second time that day, Rainbow felt useless, but this time it was worse. One of her friends was suffering, right there in front of her, and she couldn't do anything to help. \"Nix!\" she cried out, trying to reach her voice to him through the depths of darkness the nightmare had landed him in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then Nyx charged into the room. She didn't require much sleep herself, being an alicorn, but she still enjoyed it. She'd woken up, however, due to a loud 'thump!' she'd heard from the living room. She'd carefully slid out of bed, making sure not to wake Pinkie Pie, and crept towards the living room to see what was going on. At Rainbow Dash's cry, she'd abandoned stealth, and burst in, intent on confronting whatever menace was assaulting her prismatic-maned friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Seeing nothing threatening at first, her eyes then fell on Phoenix's thrashing body, and she understood. She was by his side at an instant, and used her magic to pin his limbs. \"Here's hoping this works,\" she muttered, as she lowered her horn to Phoenix's head. There was a brief flash of light, and Phoenix awoke with a piercing scream!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0About thirty minutes later, everypony in the house was gathered in the living room. Velvet, upon seeing Phoenix's condition, had hurried into the kitchen, and made a pot of tea. One cup of said tea was now with Phoenix, and it was definitely welcome, the frazzled attorney beginning to calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So, what happened, anyway?\" Twilight asked, looking between Rainbow, Nyx, and Phoenix. \"All I know is I'm in the middle of a dream, when I hear a scream that jolts me awake, and everypony's charging into the living room to find you three all looking like you've seen a ghost. You most of all, Phoenix.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix sighed. \"Nightmare. Nearly a night terror, if what Rainbow was telling me is true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It must have been, with the way you screamed,\" Rarity fretted over him... or more precisely, his mane. \"Why, your mane is almost ruined with the sweat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Rarity, focus!\" chided Applejack. \"So what were ya dreamin' about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix shuddered. \"Bad memories and fears, all woven together in a tapestry of terror.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sounds... terrifying,\" Fluttershy said ernestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Do you remember anything specific?\" asked Nyx, nursing her own cup of tea. Phoenix's scream had scared her half to death, worrying that she'd botched the waking spell somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Of memories... only the worst. Coming into the office to see Mia dead on the floor, with Maya crying over her was only the first act,\" Phoenix murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Who are 'Mia' and 'Maya'?\" Twilight wondered. \"You mentioned 'Mia' the last time you were here, but you never told me anything specific about her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mia was my boss, the head of the law offices I work at. Maya is her younger sister.\" Phoenix screwed his eyes shut, not willing to shed more tears on this matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So... you found your boss dead, with her sister crying over her? That actually happened?\" Rainbow asked, feeling sick. \"And you said that was just the <i>first</i> act?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah... it only got worse. Being accused of murder, only to find out my supposed 'girlfriend' was behind it... falling to my near-death in a raging river due to a frail bridge...\" Phoenix kept his eyes shut as he recounted his worst memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The ponies, on the other hoof, were wide-eyed. \"How have you managed to stay sane?\" breathed Velvet. \"If those three are the worst incidents... I can only imagine how much else you've been through!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sometimes I wonder how I stayed sane,\" the attorney mumbled. \"Then I look around me. Maya, Pearl, Edgeworth... I've got a lot of friends, all of them ready to help me when I'm in a bind.\" He finally opened his eyes again, and smiled at the gathered ponies. \"And I have friends here, too, to comfort me when I need it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The ponies all smiled back at him, even Nightlight and Velvet. The unicorn stallion coughed. \"Well, after all of that, I doubt we'll be getting back to sleep tonight. I hope everyone's satisfied with how much rest they got?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'll be fine,\" Phoenix affirmed, draining the last of his tea. \"At least I got more sleep than my first night in Equestria!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He and Twilight shared a chuckle at that, and the rest joined in, as Velvet bustled off to the kitchen to get an early breakfast started. Still, Phoenix pushed his nightmare out of his head. Today, he would defend another innocent in court. He was prepared for an uphill battle... one he intended to win.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nyx took deep breaths as she and Phoenix waited outside the courtroom for the defendant to arrive. She adjusted her headband for the dozenth time, just for the sake of doing something. Somehow, Rarity had found the time and materials to put together a purple blouse and shoes, as well as a headband and glasses in the style of her childhood. Not to hide her identity, as that had been public knowledge for years now, but because the fashionista had insisted that a professional appearance would help her project confidence and conviction in court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, it wasn't working. She looked over at Phoenix as he pored over the notes they had assembled during their study session, his mane re-styled and his suit freshly cleaned. Nyx had to admit that in his case at least, Rarity had a good point. Looking at him now, she would never guess that just a few hours ago he had woken the entire household up with his night terrors. Like he hadn't been forced to face half of the things he had told them about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pegasus glanced up from his files, Nyx realized she'd been caught staring. Instead of calling her out on it, though, he asked sympathetically, \"Feeling nervous, Nyx?\" When she nodded, the corner of his mouth quirked up in a smile. \"Heh, that's natural. I still remember having butterflies in my stomach before my first case. Heck, my <i>butterflies</i> had butterflies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx gave a weak, shaky laugh in response. \"I wasn't this scared when I was fighting hydras and Scorpios,\" she replied, demurely looking down at her hooves and thus missing Phoenix's startled reaction to the admission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter shaking his head in disbelief, Phoenix told her, \"Well, it's okay to feel nervous, but try to keep it off of your face as much as you can when Trixie gets here.\" Nyx looked up at him, so he explained. \"It's something Mia used to say. Right now, Trixie's future is in our hands... er, hooves. She's going to be looking to us for hope, so it's important that we smile and move forward with confidence. We know that Trixie isn't a murderer, so as long as we hold onto that truth, we'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx listened carefully to Phoenix's words, taking them to heart. \"Giggle at the ghosties,\" she whispered quietly to herself, thinking of the song Pinkie Pie had taught her and her friends when they were little and more easily scared. It had a similar message to what the lawyer was telling her, so she started humming it and put a smile on her face. She would be calm. She would be focused. She would do everything in her power to help Trixie from being punished for a crime she didn't commit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept her smile up as a pair of bailiffs approached, flanking Trixie as she was led to meet her attorney. In stark contrast to how she usually carried herself, the showmare's face was downcast, her steps hesitant. <i>This is what Mr. Wright meant,</i> she thought to herself. <i>She needs us right now. Not just to defend her, but to believe in her, so she can believe in us.</i> With as much confidence as she could muster, she stepped forward and said, \"Hi, Trixie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue unicorn tilted her head up, gradually taking in the sight of the black alicorn who had an wide grin on her face. Trixie's pupils shrank, her ears flattening as she asked, \"Phoenix Wright...? Have I gone mad with grief over my incarceration, causing me to hallucinate about past enemies, or do you see her too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx felt a resurgent pang of conscience hit, but forced herself to smile even wider, adding a creepy, manic edge to her expression. Moving her lips as little as possible, she glanced over to the pegasus and asked, \"Mr. Wright? Did you tell her I was your co-counsel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix gulped as even he was feeling a little creeped out by Nyx's expression and Trixie's reaction to it. Once again, he got the sense that there was a story there that he might have benefitted from knowing beforehand, but there wasn't any time to get into that. \"It, uh... never came up. Is this going to be a problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A problem? A <i>problem?!</i>\" Trixie reared up on her hind legs, waving a hoof between Phoenix and Nyx. \"I should have known this was a trap! You both felt that you hadn't humiliated me enough, so now you want to get me shipped off to a Saddle Arabian dungeon! You can't do this to me! Do you have any idea what they'll do to a pony as beautiful as Trixie?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix groaned and rubbed a hoof against his forehead while Nyx visibly struggled to maintain a cheerful expression and Trixie started screaming 'mistrial' over and over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoughly fifteen minutes later, Phoenix and Nyx had finally gotten Trixie to accept that the black alicorn genuinely wanted to help. Or at the very least, they got her to stop complaining so loudly. It seemed to clear the air when Nyx blurted out that she had once bullied Trixie after having heard about her from Twilight. That had gotten a stunned look from the showmare and a good deal of surprise from Phoenix, who could scarcely imagine that sort of behavior from the young mare he'd gotten to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, even though this added to the questions he had about his increasingly enigmatic assistant, the stream of apologies that erupted from Nyx seemed to throw Trixie off. And just when she had seemed ready to launch into another tirade, Nyx had lashed out with the most pleading puppy-dog eyes Phoenix had ever seen on a horse. Trixie still groused a bit about how she should have tried to represent herself, but chose not to act on this. Instead, they spent what time they could discussing their strategy for the upcoming trial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I think our best tactic right now is to prove to the court that you couldn't have performed the spell that killed Hassim,\" Phoenix explained, which went about as well as one could expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Couldn't?!</i> Is that a challenge? The Great and Powerful Trixie will have you know that there is no spell known to unicorn-kind that she cannot perform!\" She reared up on her hind legs and thrust a hoof up in what was probably meant to be a show of grandiosity, but was rendered somewhat less so by the lack of her trademark hat and cape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix cleared his throat and glanced from side to side, but thankfully the guards watching the doors simply did their duty with remarkable stoicism as Trixie dropped back down onto all fours with an indignant 'humph'. \"Yes, well... that's sort of the point we're going for, Trixie. During Rainbow's trial, Twilight told me that <i>no</i> unicorn can summon up a strong enough lightning bolt to be lethal to a full-grown pony. Especially one the size of a Saddle Arabian, and a magic-user himself at that. As long as we stick to that line of reasoning, the prosecution can't establish that you had the means to commit the murder, and you'll be acquitted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Granted, this means the real culprit is still at large,</i> Phoenix nervously thought to himself. <i>And the Saddle Arabians probably won't be satisfied going home with no one to punish for the crime, so to keep the peace between the two nations... No, I can't think about that. From what I've heard about the Royal Sisters, it doesn't sound like either of them would allow an innocent to be punished for political expediency. Besides, bad sense of humor aside, Achmed seems a lot more reasonable than most prosecutors I've had to face.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lifted up a hoof to cover a yawn as his early and abrupt waking started to catch up with him. He didn't remember a lot about the nightmare he had been yanked out of, thankfully, though the flashes he could still recall were like a slideshow of all his worst memories. Times of terrible loss and horrific danger, bathed in the light of a full moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix tapped his hoof against his notes as he started to drift into a daydream, making small pencil marks on the papers. With a little help from the others, he had gotten a sort of strap that allowed him to hold a pencil with his hoof. His penmanship was nothing to write home about this way, but there was no way that he was going to have the time to learn how to write with his mouth the way Applejack and Fluttershy had demonstrated for him, so the improvised aid was a welcome addition to his arsenal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than writing, however, Phoenix's mind drifted back to the moon he'd seen in his dream. In contrast to most dreams where the details faded away the longer he was awake, he hadn't thought about the moon much immediately upon waking. The more he did so now, though, the more he realized that it had been a constant presence in every scene. Shining in through the window illuminating Mia's body. Hovering overhead as he plunged into the icy waters of raging mountain rapids. Even when his ex-'girlfriend' Dahlia Hawthorne had revealed herself as a sociopath and a murderer. That had taken place indoors, inside the courtroom back on Earth, yet upon reflection, he realized that somehow the moon had been affixed to the wall behind the Judge. Always shining its pale light upon the tragedies of his life, but not with the familiar pattern of craters one saw in Earth's sky. Instead, the moon had looked strange and alien, with a shadowy pattern cast over most of its face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Trixie's voice snapped him out of his daydream. \"<b>WRIGHT!</b> I know you're a pegasus, but get your head out of the clouds! What are you scribbling, anyway?\" Phoenix suddenly felt the notepad get yanked out of his hooves by Trixie's magic as she looked at what he had been unconsciously doodling. \"Wright, why in Celestia's name are you drawing the Mare in the Moon when you should be focusing on the case...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could ask what that was, the trio were approached by...</span></div></div>",

He looked around before sighting the two Saddle Arabian prosecutors, eyes locking on a coffee pot balanced on Achmed's back. \"Oh you have got to be kidding me,\" he whispered to himself, though Nyx's keen hearing picked up on it just fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good day,\" Achmed said in greeting. Smirking slightly at Phoenix, he added, \"Or is it 'Good doh?' I'm afraid my Equestrian may be a little rusty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... no, you got it right,\" Phoenix replied nervously, eyeing the coffee pot as though Achmed had approached brandishing scimitars at the defense team. As before, Farah was by his side, the veiled and bejeweled mare's eyes darting every which way as she kept her own silent counsel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the focus of Phoenix's attention, Achmed asked, \"Ah, do you enjoy coffee? I would be glad to share a cup with you before the trial begins. You look as though you could use it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... sure. As long as you don't throw it at me,\" he said with a nervous chuckle, drawing a confused look from every equine in the room save for one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie fumed, asking, \"What are you doing, Wright?! You shouldn't be fraternizing with the enemy! They're just here to taunt us before the trial!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore either of them could think to stop themselves, Nyx and Phoenix both asked, \"You mean like you did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf glares could set things on fire, then Celestia would have been able to take a vacation from her sun-raising duties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is beside the point! Wright, these are the horses who want to get Trixie declared guilty and locked away in a Saddle Arabian dungeon for the rest of Trixie's life! As your client, Trixie commands you to have nothing to do with them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this was going on, Achmed had taken the pot from off of his back in order to pour a cup and sip it while he watched with an amused expression. \"Now, that is not entirely true,\" the stallion replied after she finished. \"We wish for the guilty party to face justice for their crimes. If you are truly innocent, then your attorney shall prove it in court, and we will turn our investigation elsewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAchmed took another sip of coffee, and for a moment, all traces of amusement vanished from his demeanor. \"Evidence is everything, Ms. Lulamoon, and at this moment it points squarely at you. It is my duty to prosecute you, and I shall do so without hesitation or restraint. The trial will determine whether justice is on our side or yours, but justice is what Hassim's murderer will have to face. <i>That</i> is absolute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx gulped, feeling nervous for reasons she couldn't quite define. As a prosecutor, Achmed wasn't anything like the ones Phoenix had described from his own world, or from what she had heard of Trixie's behavior in the role. He wasn't making trash-talk or belittling the defense, but there was a sort of cold ruthlessness in his voice and eyes that sent a shiver down the alicorn's spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at Phoenix to see if he felt the same way, but the attorney was meeting Achmed's eyes with his own. The same pegasus who had been getting browbeaten by his own client just a minute ago was now standing strong and steadfast. \"So is Trixie's innocence,\" he replied. \"I know it without a doubt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since Nyx had started to come back into her power, she had felt comfortable that she was stronger than almost any other pony around besides the princesses. Even though she still had a long way to go before both she and her magic fully matured, this was true in most cases. Something about the clash of wills between Phoenix and Achmed taking place, however, made her feel small again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then prove it. Test the strength of your convictions against mine,\" Achmed challenged. Then he grinned, though the mood didn't lighten along with it. \"If you felt like saving time, we could settle this the Saddle Arabian way, with a duel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The truth is the only weapon I'll need,\" Phoenix replied evenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx's inner fangirl squeed at the sheer determination and conviction with which Phoenix said that. She tried to hold it in as she smiled with what was meant to be a projected aura of confidence and poise. Her state of mind turned it into a goofy grin that caused Trixie to feel sick and roll her eyes when she saw it, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The prosecution and defense may enter the courtroom,\" a bailiff said, walking up to the lawyers. The stare-down between Phoenix and Achmed was broken up as they each turned to their respective assistants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready, Nyx?\" Gesturing with his head toward Achmed, he whispered, \"I don't know what it is, but he's definitely got something up his sleeve. He might not be the gloating type, but I can tell... he's confident that he's going to win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx smiled and nodded firmly. She had been nervous before, but now she was getting psyched up. The truth was on their side, and they were going to go as far as it took to fight for it. Turning to Trixie, the alicorn said, \"It's okay. It doesn't matter what he throws at us, because we know you're innocent, and nothing will stop us from proving that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie looked away and muttered, \"Easy for you to <i>say</i>. Trixie has prosecuted against Wright before, and it was only thanks to that cowardly pegasus's intervention and that idiot judge giving him a second chance that allowed him to escape crushing defeat under Trixie's hooves.\" Glancing furtively at him out of the corner of her eye, though, Trixie's frown faltered from disdain into worry... and just a hint of desperate hope. \"It took a miracle to beat me last time. Do you think you would go so far again to <i>save</i> me now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch for yourself, Trixie,\" he said. \"By the time this is over, you'll be walking out of this courthouse a free mare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the doors opened and they stepped into the courtroom. The battle was about to begin.</span></div></div>",

In fact, aside from Achmed at the prosecutor's bench, the only true difference that the pegasus could see sat at the judge's chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix had never laid eyes on Princess Luna, aside from pictures. Now, however, he felt that those pictures did her an injustice. Her brilliant navy-blue coat, her sapphiric mane dotted with all the stars of the sky, blowing in an eternal, unfelt breeze... Phoenix had rarely had to think about such things since becoming a lawyer, but he had to catch his breath after laying eyes on this pinnacle of ponykind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Never seen a princess in the flesh before?\" Nyx muttered to him, giggling softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This snapped Phoenix out of his reverie, and just in time. Princess Luna banged her hoof on the podium, in place of a gavel. The sound cut through the ambient noise of the courtroom like a knife. In a clear, strong voice, the Princess spoke. \"Court is now in session for the trial of Trixie Lulamoon. Are the defense and the prosecution both prepared?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Inquisitor Achmed inclined his head at the prosecution bench. \"The prosecution is prepared, Your Highness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix, noting one key difference in address, followed suit. \"The defense is prepared, Your Highness.\" <i>This trial's going to be equal parts pleasing her and proving Trixie innocent, I can feel it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The alicorn glanced between the two benches, finally setting her gaze on the pegasus. \"Mr... Wright, is it? My sister speaks highly of your prowess in the courtroom. Given the... delicate nature of this case, however, are you certain you're up for it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix nodded. \"Definitely, Your Highness. I intend to prove my client's innocence beyond reasonable doubt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Achmed smiled, pouring himself a cup of coffee. \"We shall see whose proof is more definitive in the trial proper, Mr. Wright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Indeed we shall,\" Luna said with a nod. \"Though I admire your conviction, Mr. Wright, know that it will not affect my ultimate decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I understand, Your Highness,\" Phoenix replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Then let us proceed! Inquisitor Achmed, your opening statement, if you would?\" Luna turned to the Saddle Arabian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Taking a swig of coffee, Achmed set his cup down. \"I have only this to say: The outcome of this case, and by extension this trial, will ultimately affect the relations between Equestria and Saddle Arabia for possibly years to come. I shall not rest until the culprit of this foul act is brought to justice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well said, Inquisitor,\" Luna remarked. \"Now then, you may proceed by calling your first witness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"First we shall hear from the local detective in charge of the investigation,\" Achmed stated, glancing at a paper. \"The prosecution calls Detective... Gumhoof.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Here's hoping that detective can trip himself up in our favor,\" muttered Nyx.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"If he's anything like a detective I know on Earth, he will,\" Phoenix promised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A few moments later, Detective Gumhoof was on the stand, having offered a short bow to the Princess. Achmed spoke again. \"Detective Gumhoof, please run us through the details of this case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes sir!\" Gumhoof snapped a salute, and began his testimony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\"><div class=\"bquote\">\"The victim was found dead in the backyard of the home he'd appropriated for the Prince of Saddle Arabia. Cause of death: electrocution caused by magical lightning. Since the defendant was seen leaving the scene of the crime around the time of death, we arrested her the moment we got word. Hoofprints taken at the scene match the defendant's perfectly. A pretty open-and-shut case, all in all.\"</div></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hm... in my experience, few things are as they seem,\" Luna mused at the end of the detective's testimony. She turned to Phoenix. \"You may begin your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes, Your Highness,\" the attorney replied. He opened his mouth to start, but paused on hearing a muffled squeak next to him. He glanced at Nyx, who was pointedly looking away from him. Shaking his head, he started the most crucial part of the trial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\"><div class=\"bquote\">\"The victim was found dead in the backyard of the home he'd appropriated for the Prince of Saddle Arabia.

You'll get a chance to talk to them when you're through with the good detective.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The pegasus nodded at the reply. \"Alright, then. But, Detective, how do you know that Trixie could have committed the crime? It could be coincidence that she was in the area.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Easy, pal!\" Gumhoof replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\"><div class=\"bquote\">\"Hoofprints taken at the scene match the defendant's perfectly.\"</div></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cred\"><b>HOLD IT!</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And how do you know when those hoofprints were left at the scene?\" Phoenix asked, desperate for a lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The prints were rather fresh. They couldn't be more than a few hours old,\" Gumhoof replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How much time passed between the report of the murder and Ms. Lulamoon's arrest?\" the attorney continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hm... about... 30 minutes, tops,\" the detective said after thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix blinked. \"Only 30 minutes? That's rather fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The witness described the defendant rather clearly, ya know,\" Gumhoof said. \"It couldn't have been anypony else!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But still, how do you know those prints were left there at the moment of the crime?\" pressed Phoenix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cred\"><b>OBJECTION!!</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mr. Wright, kindly refrain from badgering the witness,\" Achmed admonished. \"This hardly seems relevant to the detective's testimony. Shouldn't you wait until the eyewitness testifies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cred\"><b>OBJECTION!!</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The detective has stated that the reason my client was arrested was because her hoofprints were at the scene of the crime. I believe it's important that we know more,\" Phoenix riposted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Luna nodded at that. \"The defense is in the right. The prosecution's objection is overruled.\" She looked at the witness stand. \"Detective, are you certain those footprints were left behind during or after the murder?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gumhoof opened and closed his mouth a few times, but then sighed, shaking his head. \"I'm not certain, no. And neither is anypony else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Then the hoofprints are circumstantial evidence,\" Phoenix declared. \"Without knowing when they were left, they can't be used to conclude my client's guilt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Achmed sighed. \"Very well then. In that case, the prosecution calls for the eyewitness to take the stand! Detective, you are dismissed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y-yes, sir,\" murmured Gumhoof, slightly shame-faced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That was amazing, Mr. Wright,\" Nyx gushed. \"Wow, you totally blew a hole in that detective's argument!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, well, that was round one,\" Phoenix sighed. \"Now we have to deal with the eyewitness. Let's hope their testimony isn't foolproof.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As he said that, the next witness was led in. It was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Meanwhile, up in the gallery, Rarity watched Detective Gumhoof get dismissed from the stand. Once he was out of sight, she whispered to the seemingly empty seat beside her, \"It's alright, darling, he's gone now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more seconds, Fluttershy peeked out over the railing to make sure the coast was clear before sitting up straight again. With a timid blush, she stammered, \"Th-thanks, Rarity...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, dear, but how do you know that stallion? He didn't do anything to you, did he...?\" At the thought of anypony harassing or harming her dear friend, Rarity's voice took on a dangerous tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that tone, Fluttershy squeaked and quickly shook her head. \"Oh, no! No, I've never seen him before, but, he, umm... well... you'd think it's silly...\" She trailed off, tilting her head so as to hide behind her mane as she thought back to the recurring nightmare she occasionally had of a huge, scruffy monster in a green coat popping out of nowhere and bellowing at her. She still remembered the first time she had it, since it was the same night that Rainbow Dash had been arrested, but probably would have let it fall out of her mind completely anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps she would have, that is, if a member of the same species as the 'monster' in her nightmare hadn't shown up the next day. Even though the one in real life had seemed nice, with Twilight accompanying Phoenix and everything, she'd been too terrified to speak, and made up a lame excuse about being frightened by his hair. It was only by hearing his name, giving her the idea to bypass her fear by pretending that he was an actual phoenix, that she had been able to carry on a conversation with the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, now everypony thought that she naive enough to think that she <i>literally</i> thought he was an immortal firebird, but she didn't want to make her friends feel foolish by pointing out the mistake. Detective Gumhoof, on the other hand, despite being a pony, looked so much like the creature from her nightmares that she had reflexively hidden at the sight of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found it!\" Pinkie suddenly popped up on the other side of Fluttershy, holding something in front of the pegasus's muzzle with her hoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity quickly identified it and recoiled in her seat. \"Ewww, lint? Pinkie, why do you even have that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I saw Fluttershy dive to the floor, so I thought, 'Oh, she must've dropped something!' And since all I found was this pocket lint, I knew this had to be it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy blinked and glanced over her shoulder at her bare body. \"Um... Pinkie... I'm not even wearing anything with pockets...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you should, though. I mean, if you just tucked your lint away in your pockets, then you wouldn't drop it on the floor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy and Rarity blinked at Pinkie before the the pegasus smiled and replied, \"You're right, Pinkie, I should have thought of that before we left. Rarity, do you think you could make something for me after court adjourns for the day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity's eye twitched, and she rubbed her forehead as she felt the beginnings of a headache coming on. \"Why, of course, dear,\" she replied before muttering to herself. \"No, Rarity, don't scowl... scowling at upside-down logic isn't lady-like, and besides, you'll get wrinkles...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time that day, Rarity was starting to wonder just how good an idea it was for the three of them to be spectating over the trial. Twilight and Spike were busy researching whatever magic could have summoned and transformed the attorney while Applejack had stayed with them in order to help however she could. Meanwhile, Rainbow Dash had been summoned as a potential witness, and was being kept sequestered from the rest of the trial so as not to contaminate her testimony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity's current role was, naturally, to observe the proceedings and keep an eye out for anything that seemed odd. Her eye for detail would hopefully help her pick up on any contradictions or small details that might get missed by the defense team. Even if she couldn't help with the investigation or work with the defense during the actual trial, she could offer insight during the hours when court was not in session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy and Pinkie, though, were helpful in less obvious ways. The pegasus had really wanted to be there to offer moral support, but it was hoped that her natural empathy would help them pick up on the prosecutor's intentions, since Phoenix had grown convinced that there was more to the Saddle Arabian Inquisitor than met the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie was there for... well, officially she was there to kick off the celebration if... no, <i>when</i> they secured Trixie's freedom. Unofficially, she was there so that she wouldn't get in the way of the others while they researched strange and complex magical theory. Even <i>more</i> unofficially, though, she was there because they knew she had a knack for 'stumbling' upon important clues or facts through some strange combination of luck and intuition. If there was anything that Phoenix, Nyx, Rarity and Fluttershy couldn't detect, Pinkie would do it somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the rest of the time, she found lint instead<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, the next witness to arrive took her mind off of such things. Unfortunately, it brought back her scowl. \"Oh, no... why <i>him</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, Rarity? You've got the same twitchy eye as when the Cutie Mark Crusaders offered to cater one of your fashion shows!\" Pinkie licked her lips as she thought back to that night. The event had almost been cancelled when they found out that Sweetie Belle had tried to impress Rarity by swapping out the official caterer's mini-sandwiches with her own, which violated several chemical weapons treaties. The candies Twist had made, however, more than compensated for it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity groaned, now presented with <i>two</i> unpleasant things to think about. \"Ugh... well, do you remember the conversation Applejack and I had about 'sycophants?'\" When both of her friends nodded, she pointed down at the stand. \"Well, there is your alpha specimen...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the witness stand was a grey-coated unicorn stallion with his nose stuck so far up in the air that he would drown if caught out in the rain without an umbrella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a sip of coffee, Inquisitor Achmed addressed the unicorn. \"Witness, please state your name and occupation for the court.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witness snorted derisively. In a voice that absolutely dripped with disdain and condescension, he replied, \"Oh, please. <i>Everypony</i> who's <i>anypony</i> already knows me, so I shouldn't have to waste time giving my name out to the... ugh... commoners in the peanut gallery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie gasped. \"Omigosh, we can have peanuts up here? And nopony <i>told</i> me?!\" Unfortunately, she said this loudly enough that it was heard throughout the courtroom, and it only seemed to fuel the snob's sense of smug superiority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Luna, however, deflated him like a balloon at a cactus convention with just three words. \"And you are...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witness blinked and tried several times to reply to the Princess of the Night, but stalled out each time, so Luna asked, \"I am sorry, apparently I am not 'anypony' enough to have made your acquaintance. Will the witness please state his name and occupation for the court records?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-actually, Your Highness, we have met on several occasions,\" the unicorn stammered, trying to coax some memory of their meeting out of the dark alicorn. Instead, all he got was a bored 'get on with it' look, causing him to hang his head as he sheepishly replied, \"Jet Set, Your Highness. I am an investor and patron of the arts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, witness,\" Achmed replied, barely hiding a smirk at the rich unicorn's expense behind his coffee mug. \"Now, you claim to have seen the defendant at the scene of the crime on the night of the murder. Please testify before the court exactly what you saw.\"</span></div></div>",

Without a doubt, it was that carnie, Trixie Lulamoon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe courtroom was filled with the sound of murmurs from the gallery while Trixie fumed and shuddered with rage. \"CARNIE?! Wright, I want you to sue this lying brown-noser for perjury and slander when this is over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of a hoof banging against the judge's podium cut off most of the noise as Luna tried to get the trial back on track. \"Order! <b>ORDER!</b> Ms. Lulamoon, another outburst like that, and you will be held in contempt! And the witness will remember that there is little room in this court for such ad hominem attacks. Do I make myself clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Your Higness,\" everypony involved reflexively replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wow, I wish I could take her home with me.

Mr. Wright, that testimony doesn't make sense with what we know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix looked at her out of the corner of his eye and smiled as he gave a nod. \"Good, you picked up on it, too. That testimony has more holes than Swiss cheese.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied that the courtroom had settled down, Princess Luna nodded curtly and said, \"Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gladly, Your Highness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\"><span class=\"cgreen\">My wife and I had just had a <i>lovely</i> brunch, and were taking a carriage back home.

Why, when we first heard it, we assumed that one of your breed's hooligans was pulling a prank.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx bristled at the somewhat tribalist jab Jet Set made, though Phoenix simply rubbed his chin in thought. \"Interesting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet Set blinked at Phoenix in confusion while Achmed chuckled to himself and poured a fresh cup of coffee. \"And what do you mean by that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Achmed said with an amused tone. \"Please enlighten the court as to what you find so interesting, Mr. Wright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix thought to himself, <i>He knows exactly what's wrong with that statement, I can tell. So why is he so calm?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could speak, Nyx asked, \"It's because he said that they looked straight at the residence, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. Tell me, Jet Set, if you assumed that some pegasus was setting off lightning near you, wouldn't your first instinct be to look <i>up</i>? As I recall, storm clouds are designed to strike straight down with the first bolt, and never strike the same place twice after that. Wouldn't you want to take refuge underneath the cloud?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, the courtroom was filled with muttering until Luna silenced it with a stomp of her hoof. \"A very astute observation, Mr. Wright. I, too, would like to hear the witness explain this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet Set sputtered on the stand before admitting, \"W-well, yes... we did look up to the sky first, but it only took a few moments to see that there were no clouds in the vicinity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix slammed his hooves on the table, then pointed one at Jet Set. \"Then why did you say that you looked straight at the residence?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet Set glared and stammered angrily, \"I didn't think that it was important! The only thing that matters is what we saw when we <i>did</i> look that way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\"><span class=\"cgreen\">Moments later, we saw the culprit leaving the residence, plain as day.</span></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"clred\"><b>OBJECTION!</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLacking the ability to put his hands on his hips, Phoenix flared his wings in what he assumed was a confident manner. If he had been paying less attention to the witness, however, he might have noticed that this made many members of the audience (especially the mares) look scandalized as he 'popped a wingy' for everypony to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it was, he was too far in the zone to pay any mind to such things. \"And how could you have seen my client leave the residence, Jet Set?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How else? With my <i>eyes</i>,\" the snobby unicorn replied, grinding his teeth together at the pegasus who was clearly trying to make a fool out of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix shook his head. \"That's impossible. Unless you have a spell to make your eyes move around outside your skull!\" He hesitated for a moment before asking Nyx out of the corner of his mouth, \"Unicorns can't do that, right...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe furiously blushing alicorn squeaked and replied, \"Um... no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, I just had to be sure.\" He then turned his attention down to the papers in front of him. \"According to Detective Gumhoof's testimony and the investigation records, hoofprints <i>were</i> found leaving the residence...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! You see?\" Jet Set smirked at Trixie, who simply glared back. \"Even your own attorney knows you did it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me finish. Hoofprints were found leaving through the <i>back</i> entrance. You claimed that your carriage broke down in <i>front</i> of the residence, so tell me, Jet Set... how did you manage to see my client leaving at that time if there was an entire house in the way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... that is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you even see Trixie leaving the residence at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"clred\"><b>OBJECTION!</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Highness, the defense is badgering the witness,\" Achmed protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna stomped her hoof and replied, \"Objection overruled. This is material to the case at hoof, so I will allow it. Witness, did you or did you not actually see the defendant leave the residence?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJet Set shrank under the stern gaze of his ruler as he replied, \"W-well... I may not have... actually seen her <i>step out</i> of it, as such... but we did see her nearby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what you're saying,\" Phoenix countered, \"is that you saw my client <i>walking down the street.</i> That's a pretty flimsy basis on which to accuse somepony of murder. What made you think she was leaving the residence?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hoofprints! You said yourself...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hoofprints have nothing to do with my question, Jet Set. I asked what made <i>you</i> think that she was leaving the residence? If you didn't see her leave with your own eyes, then what made you think that she wasn't just walking by?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BECAUSE WE SAW THAT TROLLOP GO IN THE NIGHT BEFORE!\" Jet Set was looking frazzled by this point as he shouted it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix froze as the room suddenly exploded in noise and gossip, realizing that he may have overplayed his hand. He had expected to trip Jet Set up with the contradictions in his testimony and discredit him, rendering everything he said circumstantial. This, however, was not something that he had been expecting. Even the Princess couldn't contain the chaos in the room before taking a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>\"ORDER!!!\"</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany ponies were blown back in their seats by the sudden bone-rattling vocal explosion. As the ringing in everypony's ears died down, Achmed calmly took a sip of coffee and said, \"Your Highness, I think that the witness should amend his testimony to include this new information.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed,\" Luna replied. \"The witness will testify as to what he saw the night before the murder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix looked at Trixie.

From 8:00am to the time of her arrest on the day of the murder, I was with Trixie in her wagon working on plans for the performance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Achmed did a spit-take at that. \"WHAT?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The gallery erupted into excited clamors at this. Not even Princess Luna's hoof could restore order. She sighed, before taking a deep breath. Seeing this, Phoenix, Nyx, Rainbow, and a few other wise ponies covered their ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>\"ORDER!\"</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Royal Canterlot Voice silenced the courtroom in an instant. Luna took a smaller breath. \"Now then, Rainbow Dash. Are you certain of the timing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After making sure her ears still worked, Rainbow nodded. \"Trixie has this really fancy clock in her wagon. Says it's from one of the best clock-makers in Canterlot. It's magically wound to keep perfect time, apparently. I arrived at her wagon at 8 sharp, and neither of us left until she was arrested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I see,\" the princess nodded. \"And given that the murder happened around 10:15am, and the defendant was arrested around noon, if she was at her wagon the whole time, then there is no possible way that she could have committed this crime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cred\"><b>OBJECTION!!</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Achmed looked less composed than he had all day. \"But the previous witness, Jet Set, said that he saw the defendant nearby at the time of the murder!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<span class=\"cred\"><b>OBJECTION!!</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The previous witness has proved to be unreliable!\" Phoenix retorted. \"We can't take what he says as the truth. On the other hoof, Rainbow Dash has no reason to lie to protect my client!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Luna nodded again. \"The defense has a point. We cannot take Jet Set's testimony as fact, whereas Rainbow Dash, who has good reason to lie to <i>convict</i> the defendant, is instead testifying on her behalf.\" She banged her hoof on the podium. \"I believe prolonging this particular trial any further is unnecessary. The defense has proven that the defendant's hoofprints are merely circumstantial evidence, that the 'eyewitness' is unreliable, and that the defendant has no motive to commit this crime, and no opportunity, either. Given all of this, this court finds the defendant, Trixie Lulamoon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>NOT GUILTY</b></font></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Confetti erupted in the courtroom around Trixie, who had tears of joy streaming down her face.

With a high pitched \"Squee!\" she launched herself at Phoenix hugging him. \"Thank you! Thank you so much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was nothing, I was just doing my-OW!\" The defense attorney cried as Trixie suddenly stepped back and punched him in the shoulder. \"What was that for?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a small taste of what will happen if you ever tell anypony what Trixie just did! Trixie is a show mare of the highest caliber, and has a reputation to maintain and lot's of adoring fans to please, so don't go bragging to them about how she hugged you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPheonix was about to respond, when someone bumped into him from behind, knocking him into Trixie, causing both of them to fall to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops. Sorry, I didn't <u>see</u> you there.\" Said an unfamiliar male voice. Trixie and Phoenix got back to their hooves, and the defense attorney turned to look at who had bumped into him. The sight he found awaiting him was an odd one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a Griffon, smaller than Gilda had been, and wearing a black hoodie with holes for His wings, which were black like a ravens. His hood was up, but Phoenix could see his face quite clearly despite the shadow it cast over it. The feathers over his eyes were black and made shapes like an 'X' which contrasted greatly with the white feathers that covered the rest of his head. The most interesting thing about his appearance, however, was that Phoenix could clearly tell from his eyes that he was blind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I should <u>watch</u> where I'm going next time, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you should! In your lack of attention you knocked over the Great and Powerful Trixie and her Competent and Tacky defense attorney, Phoenix!\" Trixie growled, far to busy dusting off her cape to look at who had bumped into them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My bad, I...Wait. Did you say Trixie? As in the pony accused of murdering Hassim?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not anymore.\" Rainbow Dash announced proudly. \"Nix here just helped prove her innocent!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's good.\" the Griffon replied. \"I mean, it's bad that the killer is still on the loose, or that there was little to no evidence found that pointed to them, but it's good that an innocent mare wasn't punished for their crime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx noticed the cane the blind Griffon had dropped when he had bumped into Phoenix, and picked it up with her magic. There appeared to be a small emblem in the shape of a coat of arms on the handle, but she didn't recognize it as the logo to any company she knew of. Carefully she passed it back into his hand. \"Here, you dropped this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why thank you miss. My name is Jacob by the way. It's a pleasure to meet you all, but I'm afraid I have somewhere else to be at the moment, so I guess I'll <u>see</u> you later.\" And with that the Griffon worked his way around the group and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What a strange Griffon...</i> Phoenix thought to himself, <i>...but he has a point. The real killer is still out there, and unless he's brought to justice, this international incident is only going to get worse.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...Trixie supposes this is the part where the Pink pony pops out and throws a party to celebrate the Innocent and Free Trixie's Innocence?\"</span></div></div>",

The voice's owner, an earth pony wearing a purple overcoat and a ruffly white crevat, trotted into the lobby, giving Phoenix a sardonic look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix was flabbergasted. \"E-EDGEWORTH?!\" he exclaimed. \"Wha - how - why are YOU here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Looking for you, Wright,\" Edgeworth replied. \"You gave everyone a shock when you seemed vanished after the party. Maya called myself and Franziska when she realized you hadn't come in to the office the next morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wait, is Von Karma here, too?\" Phoenix asked, slightly nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Edgeworth nodded. \"She should be here, soon. She said she wanted to talk to the prosecution...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The sound of a throat being cleared caught the two stallions' attention, and they looked at Rarity. \"Mr. Wright, I assume you are... acquainted with this gentlecolt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix nodded. \"Yes, I am. This is - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Miles Edgeworth, a high prosecutor for the city both Wright and myself live in,\" Edgeworth said, bowing to Rarity and the others. \"I'm also a childhood friend of Wright's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"A high prosecutor?\" Trixie asked, eyes gleaming slightly. \"Trixie is intrigued. You must have many tales of squashing hapless fools trying to get the wicked back onto the streets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Edgeworth inclined his head towards her. \"For a time, I was like that. I sought victory at any cost, stooping to dirty tricks to secure a 'Guilty' verdict. And my record was untarnished... until I encountered Wright. After losing to him twice, I ended up being defended by him against charges of murder.\" He smiled wryly. \"I changed my viewpoint after that, deciding that bringing the truth to light is more important than getting a 'Guilty' verdict.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix nodded. \"I'll say this much, Trixie. If you took up prosecuting on Earth, I'd cry for most defense attorneys who had to face you. But understand that the truth is more important than 'winning'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Trixie looked contemplative at that. Before anything else could be said, however, Achmed entered the lobby, along with a unicorn mare. Phoenix's eyes zeroed in on the whip hanging by the mare's side, and he knew who she was immediately. Before he could comment, Achmed spoke up. \"Well done, Mr. Wright. I confess that your convictions were stronger than mine this time. But the case is not yet solved. Are you staying in Canterlot long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix nodded. \"At least until the actual culprit is caught.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Achmed returned the nod. \"I hope that, when the actual killer is caught, you won't be defending them. Given your performance today, I'd hate to have to face you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I, for one, pity the foolish fool who so foolishly decided to kill an ambassador,\" the unicorn mare declared. \"'Twas a foolishly foolish fool's decision to cause such an incident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix sighed slightly. \"And hello to you, too, Von Karma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Franziska von Karma snorted a little. \"Are you still so nervous around me, Phoenix Wright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Considering that during our first trial against each other, you whipped me into unconsciousness, I believe I deserve to be,\" Phoenix deadpanned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The native ponies all gasped. \"She did <i>what</i>?\" growled Nyx, contemplating all sorts of unpleasant things to do to the mare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Seeing this, Phoenix put a hoof on Nyx's shoulder (he had to rear up slightly to do this). \"Calm down, Nyx. It was a while ago, and there wasn't any lasting harm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx frowned, but calmed down. She had done the job, however, as Franziska looked intimidated by the larger mare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Achmed coughed. \"If you'll excuse me, I must return to the investigation.

She wasn't looking back at him, though. She wasn't even looking at the two Guards. Instead, her eyes seemed glazed over as she looked back through time itself to one of the worst moments of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She was being taken away. Nyx was being taken away by Twilight's beloved mentor. She was being taken away because Celestia was afraid of what she could become, and Twilight had <b>let</b> her do it. She had allowed Celestia to convince her that it was for the best if the little alicorn filly that Twilight had grown to love as her own daughter got taken to Canterlot for testing. She had found herself unable to argue with her teacher and ruler when Celestia said that she had to separate them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hadn't been until after Celestia's chariot had taken flight that Twilight had found the resolve to hurry after them. To defy the logical arguments that had been made to her and beg Celestia to stop and let her stay with her daughter. By then, it was too late. Twilight had chased after the chariot, screaming and sobbing at the top of her lungs, but her cries had gone unheard as she was left alone with the knowledge that she had failed Nyx.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had <b>betrayed</b> Nyx. Her daughter had been carried away against her will, and Twilight had known that there was a chance that they would never see each other again. Nyx had been taken away to be judged, not for anything she had done, but for what she might become. And if it had turned out to be the last moment that they ever spent together, Nyx's final memories would have been of the mare she loved and trusted more than anypony in the entire world simply standing by and allowing her to be dragged off to her doom.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... you can't do this,\" Twilight whispered, her voice dry and raspy as she began to hyperventilate. Her voice gradually grew louder and higher, building to a pained shriek. \"Celestia can't have her! You <b>won't</b> take her away again! <b>I WON'T LET YOU!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix yelped and recoiled from the unicorn when she suddenly seemed to explode, her eyes burning red with fury and her mane and tail bursting into flames! The two Guards reflexively braced themselves in a defensive posture in the face of the most powerful unicorn alive tapping into a well of righteous anger and blind panic that only a mother protecting her child could draw from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix and Twilight's friends shouted to her, afraid of what she might do in such a fragile emotional state. All of their cries fell on deaf ears, though, as all Twilight could see were the armored thugs sent to take her child away again, under orders of the crown. They wanted her to stand aside. They wanted her to blindly obey and betray Nyx again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Never</b> again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf they wanted to take Nyx, then Twilight would fight Celestia herself to her last dying breath! Without a care for her own safety, Twilight began charging a level of mana into her horn that was dangerous even for one of her strength and talent. The unicorn Guards, sensing the danger, quickly threw up barrier spells. Given the strength of the spell that Twilight was charging up, however, the result would be much like trying to use cocktail umbrellas to shield themselves from a flamethrower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Twilight began to channel the magic she had gathered into a wave of raw destructive force, however, a different sort of shield threw itself between herself and the Guards as Nyx jumped in to protect them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her daughter leap into the path of her spell, Twilight immediately cut it off, while the tiny bit of magic she had already managed to cast lanced forward before getting absorbed by Nyx's own magic barrier. The young alicorn's shield cracked so badly that it nearly shattered from the strain, but barely held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-get out of the way, Nyx,\" Twilight stammered, grinding her teeth together. She was burning through mana at such an accelerated rate, even without actually casting a spell, that she knew she would only have a short time to act if she wanted to protect her daughter. \"I can't let you go! Not again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx stood fast, though, and shook her head. \"No, mom, you have to stop! I know you want to protect me, but you don't really want to hurt these ponies! If you did, then you'd never forgive yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight wavered, her flaming mane and tail flickering before extinguishing themselves, leaving the unicorn looking slightly charred, and very frail. As burning red eyes faded back to their usual soft lavender, she weakly protested, \"I'll... I'll never forgive myself if anything happens to you, either...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx leaned forward to nuzzle her mother. Her own voice tremored with worry, but she struggled to keep it under control as she replied, \"It's okay... it's okay, mom, it's not like back then. I'm not a scared little filly anymore... I know this is all a big misunderstanding, so I believe in you and Phoenix and everypony to be able to prove it. You'll figure it out... I just know you will.\"</span></div></div>",

She was too burnt-out from her rage shift, and even were that not the case, Nyx's nuzzling soothed her fears. She reached up to embrace her daughter, an embrace which was eagerly returned. \"Just... promise me you'll be safe,\" she choked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I will, mom,\" Nyx assured her. She squeezed a little harder, then let go of her mother. She turned back to the guards, sighing. \"I'm ready to go, now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0One of the guards put a magic restraint collar on the alicorn's neck, while the other bound her wings. They then led her away from the former celebration, although nopony felt like partying anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sorry to kill the mood, everypony,\" came a familiar voice. Detective Gumhoof stepped forward out of the shadows of the evening road. \"But, well, a warrant is a warrant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix looked at the detective. \"Mind telling us why, exactly, Nyx was arrested?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gumhoof sighed. \"Well, remember how I mentioned yesterday that it looked like Hassim had been struck from multiple angles at once? Nyx has shown in the past that she's able to duplicate herself, and that she's able to summon lightning strong enough to chase away gigantic monsters from the Everfree Forest. Not only that, but, well... when the Saddle Arabian prince heard that she was in town, he immediately told Achmed to have her arrested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So the warrant <i>didn't</i> come from Celestia?\" asked Twilight, now looking angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gumhoof shook his head. \"Afraid it did. Achmed knows Nyx's history, so he wasn't about to step on anypony's toes, and risk igniting this international incident into something worse. So, he went to Princess Celestia, told her what the prince had ordered him to do, and she signed the warrant. Mind you, from what I saw of her face, she wasn't happy in the slightest. But, I think she's catering to the prince's demands, just to placate him for the time being.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight growled in frustration. \"Argh... let me guess, the prince is convinced that Nyx is still Nightmare Moon, isn't he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gumhoof shrugged. \"Dunno. I wasn't there when Achmed received the order, I was just there when Celestia signed the warrant.\" He sighed. \"Well, afraid that's all I've got for you, everypony.\" He looked at Phoenix. \"Good luck proving her not guilty. You're going to need it.\" With that, the detective left, leaving everypony more depressed than before. Even Pinkie Pie's mane had deflated slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix, however, was running through everything he knew of the crime so far. Something seemed off, to him. \"Twilight, what time did Nyx bring me back to the library yesterday? After she found me at the castle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight blinked. \"Um, it was about 10:30 AM, or so. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix smirked. \"Well, in that case, Nyx has a rock-solid alibi. The murder took place at 10:25 AM, which means that there's no way she could have committed this crime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That thought seemed to cheer everypony up. \"That's right, everypony!\" Pinkie said, her mane inflating again. \"Feenie will just prove that in court tomorrow, and Nyx'll be free, just like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Do you honestly think it'll be that easy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Everypony turned to look at Trixie, who had a sour expression on her face. \"Whatever do you mean, Trixie?\" asked Rarity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, what gives?\" Rainbow added with a cocked eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Trixie sighed. \"Must Trixie spell it out to everypony? Gumhoof just said that Nyx has demonstrated, in the past, the ability to duplicate herself. Therefore, if you bring up her 'alibi' in court, Achmed will just say that she sent a couple of duplicates to do the job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Edgeworth, having been silent up until now, nodded. \"I'm afraid Miss Trixie is correct, Wright. You can't rely on a mere alibi for somepony who can make more of themselves.\" He smirked slightly. \"Of course, your trusting nature is why you'd never make it as a prosecutor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix rolled his eyes at that. \"True enough, I guess.\" He then turned to look at Twilight. \"On another note, it's time for you and everypony else to stop tip-hoofing around the alicorn in the room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight gulped a little, shifting her eyes from side to side. \"I, uh, don't know what you're talking about, Phoenix...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix actually growled a little, startling the unicorn. \"Twilight. From the moment I came back to Equestria, one question has been on my mind: 'Where did Nyx come from?' It's obvious she isn't your daughter by blood, she admitted to me that she was adopted. Moreover, both you and her have implied that her story isn't exactly a nice one, at least not entirely. And, twice now, ponies have referred to her as 'Nightmare Moon'. From what I recall of Equestrian history the last time I was here, Nightmare Moon sounds like a corrupted version of Princess Luna, so why would Nyx be addressed as her?\" He stalked forward, until he was nose-to-nose with Twilight. \"I need answers, Twilight, and I need them now, if I plan to defend your daughter.\"</span></div></div>",

Nyx overthrew the princesses, plunged Equestria into eternal night for two weeks, Imprisoned you and all three of her best friends, almost got you hung, cured the deranged cultists that caused all of this in the first place, was criminally negligent to her royal duties and almost died because of it, then finally assisted with the releasing of the princesses and had her powers taken away as punishment.\" He shook his head. \"I can definitely see that becoming a problem.

I can answer that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Everypony's jaw dropped as a small black alicorn filly stepped out of the shadows. She had very distinct cat-like eyes, a purple mane and tail, and a very familiar shield cutie mark. Twilight was the first to snap out of her stupor. \"NYX!\" In a flash the unicorn was across the room, embracing the filly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Edgeworth coughed slightly. \"Well, I'd say this is a rather practical, if slightly illegal, demonstration of her duplication,\" he said awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Quite,\" agreed Franziska, \"but I can't find it in me to break up this admittedly touching scene.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm shocked,\" Phoenix commented. \"You, the prosecutor with ice water for blood, can't break up a touching scene?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hush,\" the bright-maned unicorn snapped, reaching for her whip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After a moment, Twilight pulled away from the filly. \"Nyx, how are you here?

I left most of my magic with my copy, so I'd be a filly in appearance again, which made it easier to hide in the shadows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wait...\" Applejack blinked at this. \"Yer sayin' that the one they took off ta jail was the <i>fake</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uh-huh,\" Nyx replied. \"I know it's kinda illegal, but I didn't want Mom to go nuts again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight shook her head. \"I'm sorry, Nyx.

You're using a spell that creates a copy of yourself, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx shook her head. \"Not quite. While magic is involved, to make a copy purely from magic is nigh impossible. What I do is more like mitosis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix blinked. \"You mean you split yourself into two or more ponies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Essentially, and it does take some magic to do it, but once it's done, my duplicates are self-sustaining, until they merge back with me.\" Nyx sighed a little. \"I had to put most of my magic into my copy this time, or else it would have been a lot smaller than it should be. This way, nopony should suspect anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So, do ponies mature physically based on how much magic they have?\" Franziska asked with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rarity shook her head. \"Only alicorns do that, dear. If that were the case for all ponies, we'd all be less than half the size of Twilight over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, hush, I'm not that - \" Twilight began, before she was interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Twilight Sparkle, enough with the self-deprecation!\" All eyes turned to Trixie, who stomped up to the lavender unicorn. \"You are one of the most powerful unicorns<a name=\"freturn1\"></a><a href=\"#footnote1\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"Footnote 1: This universe hasn't had  Magical Mystery Cure ... yet\">1</a> alive. You levitated an Ursa Minor <i>all the way</i> back to its home in the Everfree Forest, while simultaneously using a water tower as a milk bottle for it. What's more, in addition to your raw magic power, you're also scarily intelligent. You deceived me - <i>me</i> - by using cheap tricks and sleight-of-hoof while I was under the influence of the Alicorn Amulet. I would remind you that, prior to getting that amulet, I was second to none in trickery and sleight-of-hoof.

But, my sister refused, saying that she can't act impartial so long as you are representing the defense, Mr. Wright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This caught Phoenix off-guard. \"What do you mean, 'she can't act impartial'? Why am I so special?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Luna shook her head. \"I do not know. She wouldn't elaborate. All I know is that, with neither her nor I willing to be the judge for this case, we are in need of a new judge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight frowned. \"But, when we talked to Celestia yesterday, she said it was important that one of you two represent Equestria's interests in helping Saddle Arabia catch Hassim's killer and bring them to justice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"True enough, but an impartial judge is more important than such political matters,\" Luna replied. \"So, unless Mr. Wright is willing to give the case to another lawyer, we're rather deadlocked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix was the one to frown this time. \"Last time I was here in Equestria, Twilight mentioned that no other lawyer would so much as touch Rainbow Dash's case. I can't expect anypony would be eager to defend Nyx against a similar charge, especially given the nature of the case, as well as... her own history.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"True enough,\" Luna conceded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Trixie was the next pony to speak up. \"What of Princess Cadenza? Could she be the judge in your place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Luna shook her head. \"Regrettably, the Crystal Empire is a seperate state from Equestria, and Princess Cadenza has already informed us that she has no wish to become embroiled in these matters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So, none of the three Princesses can be the Judge,\" groaned Rainbow. \"That's just great. Who can we call?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was a moment of silence, before Franziska spoke up. \"A rather foolishly foolish question, in my opinion. We simply must get an impartial judge, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And where do you plan to find one, missy?\" asked Applejack, arching an eyebrow at the whip-holding unicorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Franziska smirked. \"Why, on Earth, of course! Wasn't it a human judge who presided over the trial of Rainbow Dash over there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight gasped. \"Of course! The Judge would be more than willing to assist in this case... I hope. Just give me some time and I can summon him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rarity, however, pushed the lavender unicorn down. \"I think not, darling. You're still exhausted from your rage-shift earlier, you're in no condition to do any sort of summoning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Franziska nodded. \"In that case, I'll head back to the portal in the castle near Ponyville.\" She looked at Phoenix. \"It is the same judge, is it not, Phoenix Wright? The one who presided over the cases where we matched wits?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix nodded. \"Yep, it's the same one.\" He rubbed his forehooves together. \"Okay, so we've got our plan. Maya and I will try to learn the reasoning behind Nyx's arrest, Edgeworth and Trixie will investigate the crime scene, and von Karma will go back to Earth and fetch the Judge. Any questions?\" Everypony shook their head. \"Alright, then. Let's get started.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Phoenix considered his options. At first, he mulled over the idea of asking Edgeworth and Trixie to search the Saddle Arabian residence for clues while he tried to find out the reasoning behind the accusation of Nyx. Between Trixie's knowledge of Equestria's workings and Edgeworth's keen investigative mind, on the surface it seemed like a no-brainer to place his trust in the two prosecutors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason why he thought twice about it, though, was because his magatama allowed him to see beneath the surface. Thanks to his conversation with Trixie before the trial, he knew without a doubt that she wasn't involved with the murder, but the appearance of Psyche-Locks in that same conversation indicated that she had some sort of dealings with the victim that she didn't want to reveal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, Trixie, we really do need to investigate the residence,\" Phoenix said before regarding Edgeworth and Trixie. \"So if you can, I'd like you two to try to find out what you can about why the prince of Saddle Arabia was so quick to accuse Nyx instead while Maya and I look at the crime scene.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth arched an eyebrow at his now-winged friend and asked, \"Are you sure you'll know what to look for, Wright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix did his best to look offended. It wasn't that hard. \"Hey, you aren't the only one who's done his share of investigating crime scenes. Besides, I know how things work in Equestria a bit better than you do, thanks to my last visit here. Plus that crash-course on Saddle Arabia that Twilight gave me on the train ride over. You and Trixie know how prosecutors think, so you'd get more insight from meeting with Achmed than I would.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth took this in stride and nodded curtly while Trixie asked, \"Perhaps I should accompany Mr. Wright instead. I have been to the residence on occasion in preparation for the show I was to perform. I'm sure that I would be more helpful in that regard than another non-native.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Trixie shot a meaningful look at Maya, the young human-turned-unicorn puffed her cheeks out in irritation as she protested, \"Hey! I'm plenty helpful! And not just with my spirit medium abilities!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, Trixie rolled her eyes the instant the words 'spirit medium' came out of Maya's mouth. <i>I guess they don't have those around here,</i> Phoenix thought. <i>Huh, I wonder if she can even channel spirits here? The magatama works the same, so she should be able to. I'll have to keep that in mind.</i> More importantly, however, was Trixie's behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she kept it low-key, the showmare's offer and exclusive use of first-person pronouns only helped reinforce Phoenix's decision. He had no evidence on hand (or hoof) that he could use to confront her about her meetings with Hassim, but Phoenix had a niggling feeling that as much as she wanted to bring the real killer to justice, allowing Trixie on the scene might result in an important piece of evidence going missing, if only to protect her own secrets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Trixie. I can't tell you how many times Maya's helped crack a case. Given your connections with the Saddle Arabians, Edgeworth could use your help a lot more than I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie sighed under her breath before replying, \"Very well, then.\" She turned to the adorable alicorn filly and reared up, cape billowing behind her as she proclaimed, \"Nyx helped Phoenix Wright prove Trixie's innocence, so the Great and Diplomatic Trixie will do her part to return the favor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix grinned, glad that the showmare was willing to agree. \"Thanks, Trixie.\" He then turned to the others and said, \"Alright, everyone, we'd better get going. And don't worry, Nyx, we'll find everything we need to prove you innocent, and get you... er... the other you... out of jail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet we will,\" Maya exclaimed, scooping Nyx up in a hug so exuberant that Pinkie Pie held up a card reading <u>9.3</u> \"You just stay out of trouble, and Nick and I will clear your name before you know it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx let out a squeak as she was practically crushed, but she blushed a little, eyes welling up with happiness that there were so many ponies (and not-quite-ponies) willing to stick their necks out on her behalf. Because they trusted her. \"Th-thank you,\" she said, stammering a little as she hugged Maya back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho to follow, now?</span></div></div>",

It creates an area in which no one can hear what anyone else is saying unless their looking at their mouth while they're talking. Nothing that's said in there can be heard outside the area of the spell either, even if you are looking at their lips. My hearing is sharp enough that it only muffles the sound and distorts the voices, but if I know them well enough I can identify them through the spell. There were a lot of ponies inside the spell area when Hassim was killed, but only a few seemed to be talking. Still, casting a spell like that over Hassim's entire house...\" Jacob trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing it would take a lot of magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most likely, but if a unicorn had a special talent related to sound, then they could probably pull it of with much less magic, and I happen to know a mare with a special talent just like that who had heated words with Hassim lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who would that be?\" Phoenix inquired, hoping to get a name for his first potential suspect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vinyl Scratch, daughter of Fancy Pants and Fluer De Lis.

Despite being a human from another world who just happened to be wearing the shape of an earth pony, he had the dress sense and high-class attitude that would have made him blend in at any society function or garden party. <i>Even without a horn,</i> Trixie mentally added, considering the massively disproportionate ratio of unicorns to earth ponies or pegasi among the capital's upper-crust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that being a unicorn was a free pass into the Canterlot elite, of course. Trixie grumbled to herself, recalling how, for all their pretensions of culture, 'the ponies everypony should know' were oh so quick to dismiss the wonders and astonishment she had to offer as nothing but a crass carnival act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trixie is surprised by how quickly you have acclimatized to Equestria, Mr. Edgeworth. When Mr. Wright was here, he floundered about like a fish out of water, and that time he was still human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis didn't even get a laugh out of Edgeworth as he replied, \"Yes, that sounds like Wright. He's always been rather emotional, yet he somehow manages to work things out in the end, even when he seems to make horrible choices. His willingness to place his trust in those he probably shouldn't is something that used to utterly baffle me. Especially today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't believe that he should be defending Nyx?\" This came as a modest surprise to Trixie, coming from a friend of her former adversary in court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of thoughtful silence from Edgeworth before he replied, \"From what I have heard of this world's recent history, your system of justice is much more... lenient than the one I represent. In my country, someone who went mad with power, overthrew the government and ruled as a despot would have been imprisoned for the rest of their natural life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie began to nod in agreement before the vagueness of Edgeworth's description struck her as rather intentional. \"You... are talking about Nyx, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth looked askance at the showmare. \"Miss Trixie, it astonishes me that you are a free mare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie flinched. \"That was... my mind was corrupted by the Alicorn Amulet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which you purchased of your own free will, for the sake of getting some ill-conceived revenge on Twilight Sparkle. I've heard the story, and the fact remains that even if the situation ultimately spun out of your control, you not only set it into motion through your own actions, you did so with ill intent. The same is true of Nyx. Regardless of the circumstances surrounding her 'birth' and identity issues, she personally led a coup against your government.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie shuddered as she looked at Edgeworth, hearing the icy edge in his voice growing as he levied her past crimes against her. But he wasn't done yet, his tone only growing colder as he leveled a withering stare at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even before that, your prosecution against Rainbow Dash was a farce and an insult to the law. I have no issue with the fact that you prosecuted her. Had I been in your situation with the same facts that you brought to court at my disposal, I would have taken the case myself. What I cannot forgive, however, is that you only did so to satisfy your need for some petty revenge. The justice system does not exist to bring anyone personal satisfaction, it exists to bring forth the truth, and ensure that the law is applied fairly to all who would break it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth paused, looking up at the castle again for a moment. \"Yet here you both are, walking freely until just yesterday, because those who were in a position to pass judgement on you believed that it was better to grant you opportunities for redemption than to punish you for your crimes. In that regard, Wright is far more suited to this world than I could ever be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... Trixie is getting that impression, yes,\" the unicorn replied, suddenly realizing just how grateful she should be that the Princesses had respected Twilight's request for clemency after the Alicorn Amulet incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another long silence as they drew closer to the palace's public entrance. Surprisingly, it was Edgeworth who broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All that said,\" the earth pony mused, his voice reluctantly losing much of its hostile tone, \"I am used to dealing with criminals who are far less willing to repent and take a second chance in good faith. Your society doesn't operate under the same rule of law as mine does, and it was your rulers' right to show mercy if they so chose. Given that both you and Nyx have apparently done well in living up to the trust given to you, and no permanent harm was done to your victims, I'm willing to go along with Wright for the time being.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie gave Edgeworth a look. \"And now the Great and Powerful Trixie has a better idea of how Phoenix Wright bested her in court if he routinely has to face the likes of you..\" One thing was certain, and that was that her impression of the humans in Phoenix's world (based on her previous experiences with the lawyer and what was known of those who lived overseas) were in immediate need of revision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, before the unsettling conversation could continue once more, they had made their way onto the palace grounds. \"In any case,\" she said, coughing into her hoof as she hastily tried to change the subject, \"this portion of the palace is open to the public for tours or those seeking an audience with the Princesses when they hold open court. Now, one of these guards will be able to help us get to the quarters housing the Saddle Arabians. Simply allow the Charismatic and Influential Trixie to leverage her identity as one of the crown prince's entertainers, and they should take us right where we need to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth arched an eyebrow at the ability of Trixie to rebound to her showy persona, but simply replied, \"Well then by all means, go ahead.\"</span></div></div>",

In my personal experience, Phoenix Wright has always won his trials through sheer luck. And even then, he hasn't won every case he's partaken in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You mean Nix lost a case once?\" Rainbow asked, stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Franziska nodded. \"Indeed. I was there when the verdict came down. His client was guilty, and there was nothing Phoenix Wright could do about it!\" She frowned. \"And yet, despite his loss, he came away with a smile. That always infuriated me about him. His thrice-damned cocky - mmph!\" She was cut off as a zipper materialized on her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rarity's horn stopped glowing, signifying her as the culprit. \"Really, darling, I realize you must be upset at the memories, but that's no excuse to curse in front of children. Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Franziska nodded sullenly, and the zipper was removed. \"That was an interesting experience,\" she mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"On another note, darling, who is your tailor? Your shirt and vest are simply <i>gorgeous</i>!\" the alabaster unicorn exclaimed. \"Why, with a slight modification, you'd be one of the most beautiful mares in Equestria, to say nothing of Canterlot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The prosecutor flushed. Her father had always told her, from an early age, that a professional appearance was more important than an attractive one. She'd done her best to blend the two, but had never received so much as a comment on her appearance. She'd eventually stuck with what was comfortable for her; her shirt and vest, the latter studded with a few jewels. To be complimented so heavily on her appearance... it touched a side of her she hadn't felt in years; a true feminine side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before anything else could be said, a knock at the door preceded Princess Luna into the room. She held out a hoof, forestalling the bows that were coming. \"Please, this is no time to stand on ceremony.\" She looked around. \"Where is Mr. Wright? I was hoping I could speak to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"He left to investigate the crime scene,\" Twilight replied. \"He's going to be representing Nyx, after all, so he needs evidence to point away from her guilt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Luna eyed the alicorn filly in the unicorn's embrace, then nodded. \"I see. Of course he'd take the case.\" She sighed. \"This presents us with a new dilemma, unfortunately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What now?\" moaned Rainbow. Given the number of unpleasant surprises of late, the prismatic pegasus was on her last nerve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Luna sighed. \"I'm afraid that, circumstances being what they are, I must recuse myself as judge for as long as Nyx is the defendant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What?!\" Twilight and Nyx exclaimed at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Franziska was more controlled. \"Do elaborate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Blinking at the sight of the unfamiliar mare, Luna nonetheless did as asked. \"Simply put, Nyx's history being what it is presents problems with her as the defendant. Even to this day, there are ponies who believe I was too lenient on her. If I find her 'not guilty' in such a politically-charged case, ponies may believe I had personal bias in her favor.\" She sighed again. \"Which is, I admit, a not-entirely unfounded accusation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So jus' because ya like Nyx, ya can't be the judge? Well, that's just great!\" grumbled Applejack. \"And yer sister can't be the judge so long as Phoenix is representin' Nyx!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Princess of the Night nodded. \"Indeed. You understand the problem clearly. Either Celestia or myself are needed to oversee this case as it unfolds, owing to its political nature. Yet circumstances are preventing both of us from doing so. We therefore were wondering if anypony had a solution to this conundrum?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was silence for a moment, then Franziska chuckled. \"Well, the answer is simple, your Highness.\" As eyes turned to her, she elaborated. \"If neither you nor your sister can adequately watch over the trial tomorrow, we need to find a completely impartial judge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And where might we find such a judge?\" asked the blue alicorn archly. \"And who might you be, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah, forgive me for not introducing myself, your Highness,\" the prosecutor said with a sincere bow. \"I am Franziska von Karma, a prosecutor of the highest caliber from Earth. And as for impartial judges, you can't get more impartial than being from another world entirely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight gasped. \"That's right! The Judge from Rainbow Dash's trial! I could summon him back here to Equestria, and he could preside in your place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pinkie shook her head rapidly. \"Uh-uh! No way, Twilight! You're still a little loopy from when you lost your cool at the guards, so no summoning for you! Dr. Pinkie's orders!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As Twilight grumbled, Franziska chuckled a little. \"Well, then, I believe I should make my way back to Ponyville, posthaste. From there, I can go to the portal that appeared in the nearby castle, retrieve the Judge, and be back well in time for the trial tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Luna nodded, clearly relieved at the solution to her problem. \"I shall pay for priority tickets, for both you and the Judge, Ms. Karma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's 'von Karma', your Highness,\" Franziska said. She turned to the others. \"I shall return before tomorrow, count on that!\" With that, she trotted out towards the train station, Luna following close behind.</span></div></div>",

She knew it would be an easy task to get the Judge to come along. Probably just hearing about the ponies again would be enough to convince him. If that failed, she would use more... forceful methods. She flicked her eyes back to the whip she carried as she thought this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The motion didn't go unnoticed by Princess Luna. \"I admit curiosity as to why a prosecutor would need to carry a whip, Ms. von Karma,\" the navy alicorn spoke up. \"Is it for self-defense?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Partly,\" replied the prosecutor. \"But it's also an implement to... help things along in court.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Pardon?\" Luna looked at Franziska in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The smaller mare snorted. \"The courthouse is but a three-ring circus, and the prosecutor is the ringmaster. As the ringmaster leads the circus, so too do I lead the trials in court. When the other 'rings' are being uncooperative, I simply give them some 'encouragement' to get back in their places.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Luna's expression was unreadable. \"I hadn't realized that the prosecutor's position was so much more valuable on your world than here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Franziska laughed. \"The point of a trial, and the purpose of a prosecutor, is to condemn the one on trial. And the von Karma family prides itself in doing everything perfectly, in every way, so naturally my father and I were both prosecutors. Perfect prosecution, perfect verdicts. That is how we operate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Luna was silent for a moment. \"I cannot help but ponder how twisted your father must have been to instill such a viewpoint into his daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Franziska froze. \"What does that mean?\" she asked, her tone frigid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Luna's voice was even colder. \"You say that the point of a trial is to condemn the defendant. I've never heard such balderdash. The point of a trial is to find the truth, and convict the guilty party, be they the defendant or no. Obviously, your father was rather overzealous in his job, not to mention highly amoral.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y-you dare?!\" The prosecutor was grinding her teeth. \"You dare say that a von Karma was anything less than upstanding in all respects?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes, I dare,\" the princess replied, still icy. \"And not just your father, but you as well. Tell me, what levels have you stooped to to get a 'guilty' verdict? To what depths would you sink to see your 'perfect' record unblemished? When in a court of law, you deal with the lives of people, innocent or no. To treat the courtroom as a 'circus' speaks of a level of sociopathy darker than the far side of my own moon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before Franziska could say anything else, Luna's horn flashed, and the world around them seemed to vanish. The alicorn's eyes glowed white, and the human-turned-pony was suddenly under the impression that the princess was looking <i>through</i> her, seeing her soul. Franziska had never felt anything like it, but it was almost like this pony was... judging her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Luna's next words, coming seemingly from nowhere, confirmed these thoughts. <b>And for all your claims of 'perfection', Franziska von Karma, your record is anything but. You have lost two trials against Mr. Wright, despite saying that you 'encourage' the rest of the court to dance to your tune. And your father was convicted of murdering the one attorney who managed to put a penalty on his record. Your father was as amoral as any serial killer, and you yourself are treading a fine line.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Franziska flinched, but tried to rally. \"My losses against Phoenix Wright were mere flukes! He wins by luck, not any actual skill! And what happened to my father was... regrettable, but to tarnish a von Karma's reputation is - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<b><i>Reputation?!</i></b> bellowed the voice of the princess, the sheer force causing the unicorn's legs to buckle under her. <b>The court is responsible for passing judgement on lives, for upholding the law. And you are worried about your <i>reputation</i>? Were you a prosecutor in an Equestrian court, I guarantee your antics would not be tolerated! Before you try to find fault in others, you should first examine yourself!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The world came back into focus, and Franziska was suddenly aware that she was breathing hard, and sweating. She looked with wide eyes at the pony before her. She had seen Luna in court as a judge, but now she was looking at the alicorn in a new light. \"What... are you...?\" she breathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I am Princess Luna, co-regent of Equestria, Diarch of the Moon. Remember that, and mind your tongue in the future.\" With that, the alicorn trotted off, the unicorn following soon afterward.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Some time later, Franziska found herself walking up the path to Castle Nightstone. She'd hardly spoken a word since Luna's blistering retort against everything she'd known. Her body was on autopilot, while her mind was deep in thought. Such a state wasn't exactly common for the prosecutor, but the alicorn's words had shaken her foundations. She had taken a brief nap on the train to Ponyville, to try to sort out her thoughts and feelings. She wasn't having much luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>It's the same words. Those same damnable words!</i> she thought. <i>Both Phoenix Wright and Miles Edgeworth have said those words before! 'The point of a trial is to find the truth.' I thought it the idealistic prattle of those weaker than myself. But... this Princess Luna... she said the same thing. She wields power, great power from the looks of it. And yet she shares that idealistic view. I thought Phoenix Wright's performance today a fluke. But, is it really?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Could it be that... I've been wrong this whole time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Even as a part of her mind violently rebelled against the idea, another part seriously considered it. Looking back on her previous trials against Phoenix Wright, and even her time with Miles Edgeworth during what would have been his debut trial, she realized that the truth had always come to light, owing to their determination. The latter case had been before Miles had become 'weak', falling into the same traps that she believed Phoenix Wright had. It was a sobering thought, but Franziska now knew that there was something to those words that all three had said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She shook her head violently. \"Thoughts for later, Franziska. Focus on the here and now, and get the Judge to Canterlot.\" She looked up, and realized she was in the room where the portal had formed. Looking at the ceiling, she smiled, as she realized the ladder she, Edgeworth, and Maya Fey had used to safely climb down through the portal was still there. Using all four hooves as hands and feet, she carefully climbed back up the ladder. As her foreleg passed through the portal, she felt it change. It wasn't painful, just odd. Flexing her regained fingers, she climbed the rest of the way out. Stepping down onto the asphalt of the alley, she stretched her human form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ms. von Karma!\" Franziska turned to regard the speaker, as he came running up to her. She mused briefly on the striking similarities to a pony she'd seen in court that very day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good afternoon, Scruffy,\" she replied. \"Have you been doing as we asked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yep!\" Detective Gumshoe said with a nod and a smile. \"Ain't nobody come through here, just like you said. I was just making another round when I saw you come through. So, what's it like on the other side?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's... interesting,\" Franziska admitted. \"Scruffy, fetch your car. I need to find the Judge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh? Something going on?\" Gumshoe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She nodded. \"Yes. There is a trial tomorrow on the other side, and the locals are in need of an impartial judge. You can't get more impartial than being from another world, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I getcha. It'll take me a few minutes to bring my car around. Just sit tight, Ms. von Karma!\" Gumshoe dashed off, leaving Franziska to her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>So dutiful... I hardly appreciate him and all the hard work he does,</i> she mused. A small smile crossed her face; it was a genuine smile, not one of her haughty court smiles. \"Perhaps... Miles isn't the only one who can change because of him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"<i>Have you become weak as well, Franziska?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Franziska spun around to face the speaker, and her eyes widened. The whip she'd grabbed on reflex fell from nerveless fingers. \"Impossible... you can't be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Stepping out of the shadows of the alley was a figure she never thought she'd see again. He stood taller than her by a head, with greying hair and skin. Dressed in a fanciful suit studded with gems, he stalked toward her, using a cane in his right hand. His eyes were cold and harsh, and he had a cold, thin-lipped smile as he looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The image of Manfred von Karma spoke again. \"I can't be what, Franziska? I can't be here? A von Karma is perfect in every way. I had such hopes for you, after Miles let me down. To think that my own flesh and blood would become weak as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Franziska tried to rally. \"If Phoenix Wright and Miles Edgeworth truly are weak, then how is it that they both seem stronger than you? The two of them have done things together that no one person can do. They got the Chief of Police arrested. They got <i>you</i> convicted!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I am aware of their accomplishments, idiot girl!\" snarled Manfred. He stalked closer, even as Franziska retreated. \"But for all their accolades, they are still weak! A trial is meant to convict the defendant, and a prosecutor is meant to expedite that process. That was the lesson I taught both you and Miles! And yet one lucky defense attorney is enough to rattle your convictions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Franziska had rarely felt true fear before. The first time had been years ago, when the 'lawyer' Calisto Yew had pulled a gun on both her and Miles. The second had been a few years later, when she had been shot on the way to the courthouse. And now, for the third time, she felt it again, stronger than ever, as her father's image verbally assaulted her. She backed up against the wall of the alley. \"W-what do you want from me...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That 'inquisitor' is not a true prosecutor. You will take his place, and you will convict the alicorn,\" Manfred said simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Franziska blinked. \"Why...? What do you stand to gain from this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"If you do not do this... the court wizard will have been only the first to lose his life,\" said the phantom, as he stepped back into the shadows, out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With the image of her father gone, the young prosecutor slid down the wall, breathing heavily. She was sweating again. It was too much. Combined with the shock of Princess Luna's scathing words earlier, Franziska von Karma did something she had never done before. She fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The last thing she saw was a car pulling around. The last thing she heard was her name, being shouted by a familiar voice.</span></div></div>",

He set the tray down on a nearby coffee table, poured a cup, and gave it to Franziska.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She took it cautiously, blowing on the steam slightly, before taking a sip. It wasn't the best tea she'd ever had, but it certainly wasn't the worst. \"My thanks, your Honor,\" she said gratefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Now, now, Ms. von Karma, we're not in court here, so no need to stand on ceremony,\" the Judge laughed. \"Just call me 'Judge'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Franziska nodded, slowly. \"Very well, then, Judge.

What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Franziska blinked. <i>What did happen? I remember returning from Equestria, meeting with Scruffy, and then - !</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was through dint of Herculean effort that she kept her face neutral as she remembered. <i>That's right...

'New venue'?\" the Judge blinked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Franziska nodded. \"You're aware that Miles Edgeworth, Maya Fey, and myself were concerned over Phoenix Wright's disappearance, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah, yes, I remember Ms. Fey was particularly worried. What of it?

You mean, like in a science fiction novel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Franziska nodded again. \"Somewhat, although this one is real. I've been on the other side myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Fascinating,\" the Judge mused. \"And are the locals in need of a good judge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"They are,\" Franziska confirmed. \"Moreover, you've been there once before, I believe. Presiding over the trial of... what was the name... Rainbow something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Rainbow...?\" The Judge blinked for a moment, then his eyes lit up. \"AH! You mean I'm needed in Equestria once more? Fantastic! I thoroughly enjoyed my first visit there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Franziska nodded. \"Well, then let's not waste time. Scruffy, take us back to the alley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You got it, Ms. von Karma!\" Gumshoe said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A little while later, the three were standing outside the portal. \"The last time I visited Equestria, I was summoned by a unicorn named Twilight Sparkle,\" mused the Judge. \"Why do we need to go through this roundabout method?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Franziska sighed. \"Twilight exhausted her magic earlier today, and is in no shape to do any summoning. I offered to bring you there personally, to ensure nothing untoward happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I see...\" The Judge nodded, and stepped toward the ladder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah, a word of warning, Judge,\" Franziska said, remembering a key detail. \"For some reason, traveling through this portal changes people into ponies, so please keep your wits about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Fascinating,\" mused the Judge, as he began to step down the ladder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When he was completely through the portal, Franziska stepped on herself. \"Scruffy, keep this alley clear of all pedestrians until all of us return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You got it, Ms. von Karma!\" Gumshoe said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With that, Franziska lowered herself back down through the portal. As her face cleared the threshold, she finished climbing down the ladder, to see a dark grey earth pony with a brilliant silver beard, dressed in black judge's robes waiting for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I have to admit, this is one of the more unique experiences of my life,\" the Judge said, looking over himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'll help you get acquainted with your new body, then we'll head for Ponyville, and take the train to Canterlot,\" Franziska explained, stepping over to the Judge.</span></div></div>",

Oh, sorry Applejack. What did you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The farmer shook her head. \"Ah swear, yer spacin' out worse 'n Rarity lookin' at a dust bunny in her boutique. What's got yer tail in a twist?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The two, along with Spike, were in the palace library, with a nice pile of magical theory texts sitting next to them. Twilight was supposed to be reading one on transformative magic, but she was having trouble focusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight sighed, lightly banging her head against the table they were sitting around. \"Ugh, sorry, AJ. I know I'm supposed to be working on a way to turn Phoenix back into a human, but... I just can't help but wonder why Princess Celestia is hiding information about him from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This again, Twi?\" Applejack asked. \"Look, ah told ya before, the Princess don't got ta tell ya everythin' she knows, right?

I really should work on a means of changing Phoenix back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She went back to her book, while Applejack grinned, and returned to the farming magazine she'd found. Spike was busy reading the latest issue of a comic he'd been waiting for, though he kept a close eye on his surrogate sister in case she had a 'Twilight Spazzle' breakdown. It was unlikely... but then again, it had been unlikely that she would turn the whole of Ponyville into a battleground over an old stuffed doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A mere few seconds had passed before another pony joined them. This unicorn had a coat of a slightly darker hue than Twilight, with a black mane done up in a small bun, with most of it flowing freely. She looked younger than Twilight, and was levitating a book on spirits. \"'Scuse me, can I sit here?\" she asked. \"Um, there's no other place with sun left open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sure thing, sugarcube,\" Applejack said, scooting over to make room for the younger mare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nodding her thanks, the newcomer sat down at the offered spot, and opened the book on spirits. After a moment, though, she looked up at Twilight. \"Um, I kinda overheard what you were saying earlier. You... wouldn't happen to have been talking about Phoenix Wright, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Though she spoke in a somewhat low voice, she firmly gained the attention of both ponies and the dragon. \"How did you know his name?\" Twilight asked, a slight edge to her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The unicorn smiled. \"Simple; he's my partner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was a moment of silence. \"Wait, what?\" Spike asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sorry, let me introduce myself. I'm Maya Fey,\" she said, bowing slightly. \"I work with Nick at his law office on Earth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Maya...?\" Twilight blinked. \"Oh, Phoenix mentioned you last night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"He did?\" Maya asked, perking up. \"What did he say about me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um, not much, I'm afraid,\" Twilight admitted. \"It was in conjunction with a nightmare he had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Maya winced. \"Ah.\" She brightened again quickly. \"Well, no matter! I just wish I could've been in the gallery for the trial, but unfortunately, it's completely full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Probably because this is sort of an international incident,\" Spike said carelessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Spike!\" scolded Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Too late, though, as Maya had heard the dragon. \"Wait, 'international incident'? Was the victim someone important?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight sighed. \"The court wizard of Saddle Arabia. Sound important to you, Miss Fey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Maya winced. \"Ouch...\" She brightened again. \"Well, doesn't matter. Nick'll prove his client not guilty. Assuming he or she really is not guilty, that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"She is, trust me,\" Twilight said. \"Oh, my name's Twilight Sparkle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, so you're the one who helped Nick out the last time he was here!\" Maya said with a smile. \"He told me about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Only good things, I hope?\" Twilight said jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Maya got a teasing grin. \"Well, he mentioned something about you wanting to fire him at one point...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Spike guffawed at Twilight's sputtering. \"I think i like this one,\" he said with a grin of his own.<p align=\"left\"><u>Footnotes</u><br><a name=\"footnote1\"></a><a href=\"#freturn1\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"Return from Footnote 1\">1</a>\u00a0 If only you knew, Applejack...</p></span></div></div>",

This has become far more than merely a legal matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack spoke up, asking, \"Beggin' yer pardon, Yer Highness, but ah'm not followin'. Rainbow here's sure Trixie couldn't 've done it, so as long as we think she's innocent, why shouldn't we be doin' everythin' we can t' prove it? 'Tain't right t' sit on th' sidelines an' not do anythin' if an innocent pony's bein' accused o' somethin' she didn't do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Rainbow Dash hovered, visibly fretting in contrast to her usual brash personality. \"Y-you don't know what it's like, Princess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia looked at each of the six ponies and Spike with a warm but sad expression. \"I am sorry, my little ponies, but this is a matter of international importance. Court Wizard Hassim was a close friend and cousin to the King of Saddle Arabia, as well as an important political figure in his homeland. That is why it is necessary that I personally preside over this trial. To show that Equestria stands with our allies in bringing his murderer to justice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It also means that whatever judgement I arrive at is not just a legal ruling, but the will of the crown. If my faithful student and her friends, one of whom will most likely be called upon as a witness...\" she said, looking toward Rainbow Dash. \"If you involve yourselves in the defense, then it could be seen as bias which would damage the relationship between Equestria and Saddle Arabia. I assure you, the members of the royal investigation team are going to do everything within their power to determine the facts of this case. If your friend Trixie is truly innocent, then the evidence will prove that out, but I must show our allies that Equestrian justice is fair, true, and unbiased. Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the assembled ponies reluctantly nodded, though Applejack tugged the brim of her hat down over her eyes. \"Still don't seem right,\" she muttered quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry, Applejack, but this is the way it must be. Besides, as I understand it, you have already found counsel to represent Trixie in this coming trial. That should be enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes,\" Fluttershy assured her despondent friends. \"If anypony can prove Trixie's innocent, it's Mr. Phoenix!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mention of that name, the already white-coated sun princess seemed to become even more pale. Not so much in appearance, but the radiant aura that always seemed to surround her faded slightly. \"Phoenix...? Twilight, did you bring Phoenix Wright here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... yes,\" the purple unicorn replied, slightly confused by the Princess's reaction. \"As soon as we heard that Trixie was accused of murder, it just made sense to try to bring him here to represent her.\" Her ears flattened atop her head as she asked worriedly, \"Did I... did I do something wrong, Princess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... no, no, Twilight,\" Celestia assured her, though her voice was touched with... dismay, perhaps? She approached her student and lowered her head to nuzzle Twilight softly as she said, \"I should have expected nothing less. I know he will do a fine job. It just... makes things a little more complicated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight, grateful that she had not angered her teacher, was nevertheless still concerned about what she might have done to cause Celestia such dismay. \"But why, Princess? You're the one who asked me to summon him to defend Rainbow Dash...\" She trailed off as a long-unanswered question rose up to the forefront of her mind. \"But you didn't want me to tell him that you were the one who chose him... Why? What's the connection between you and Phoenix Wright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh my,</i> Rarity thought, watching the conversation between Twilight and Celestia. Her inner gossip took command as she mused, <i>Could it be? That nervousness... Her reluctance to share the details of their mysterious connection... Is the Princess in love with Mr. Wright? Oh, how am I supposed to compete with THAT?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia sighed and smiled wanly as she replied, \"It's... not important, Twilight. I simply don't think that it would be best if I preside over a case in which he is representing the defense for the same reasons I didn't want you involved. I am afraid that I will have to ask...\"</span></div></div>",

Come to think of it, when she asked me to summon Phoenix last time, she acted kinda oddly, too. How can I... wait.</i> She reached inward, tugging on a strand of magic she hadn't used in years. Not since Rainbow Dash's trial. \"Princess... you act oddly whenever Phoenix is brought up. He claims to know nothing about you, yet you know about him. Why is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>*BANG* *rattlerattlerattlerattlerattle* *BANGBANGBANGBANGBANG</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As Twilight watched, the area around Celestia turned black, and a multitude of chains appeared, surrounding the alicorn, as five red padlocks appeared, locking the chains in place. Celestia herself seemed not to notice. Nor did any of her friends. \"As I said, Twilight, it's not important,\" the Princess said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I see...\" Twilight said, letting go of the magic strand... the leftover power of Phoenix's Magatama that lay within her. \"Thank you for the information, Princess.\" She paused as a thought occured to her. \"Um, I kinda asked Nyx to be Phoenix's co-counsel. Is that going to cause an issue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia put a hoof to her chin in thought. \"Hm... so long as it's just Nyx, and just as his co-counsel, I see nothing wrong with that. But warn her to tread lightly. We can't afford any more of an international incident than we're already in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Understood, Princess,\" Twilight said with a bow. Her friends followed suit, and they followed her out of the throne room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As they left, Celestia allowed the facade of the flawless princess drop, and she let out a sigh. \"Phoenix Wright...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This sucks,\" Rainbow Dash complained. \"I hate feeling useless, and that's just what I'm going to be for this whole thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We're all in that same boat, dear,\" Rarity sighed. \"I myself was hoping to contribute something to this trial, since I was so useless last time.\" She sighed again. \"I suppose we shall simply have to support Trixie and Phoenix from the gallery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm more concerned with why the Princess is hiding her connection to Phoenix,\" Twilight mused. \"She won't even tell me! She didn't tell me the last time I summoned him! It's so frustrating...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Is it really that big a deal, Twi?\" Applejack asked. \"Ah mean, she is the Princess, ya know. She can't tell ya everythin' she knows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The scholarly unicorn sighed. \"I know, Applejack, but... still, it's frustrating that she can't trust me with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The group walked through the palace, rounding a corner, and almost running smack into Phoenix and Nyx. It was only through dextrous use of magic that nopony ended up in a tangle of legs and hooves. Once everypony had calmed down, Nyx looked closer at her mom and her friends. \"What's with the long faces, everypony? Phoenix and I were just about to go investigate the crime scene.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight sighed. \"Phoenix, Nyx... I'm afraid the rest of us aren't going to be able to help you in your investigation after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The two blinked at that. \"Might I ask why not?\" Phoenix asked, somewhat archly. \"Wasn't the whole point of all of you coming along so that you could give me a hoof?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before Twilight could reply, Rarity broke in. \"I can sum it up for you in one word, Mr. Wright: <i>politics</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Phoenix groaned at that. \"Oh, of course, it's not just a murder, no, it's a freaking <i>international incident</i>,\" he mumbled. \"Sometimes I wonder if some cosmic being is having fun at my expense.\" He sighed. \"So, it's just me and Nyx on this case?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And the police from the precincts Criminal Affairs department,\" Twilight reminded him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well <i>that</i> makes me feel better,\" the pegasus attorney grumbled, thinking of the police back on Earth. \"Well, I'll see what I can do. Let's go, Nyx.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"See you later, Mom,\" the black alicorn called as she and Phoenix trotted off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight looked after the two of them, thinking to herself. <i>Should I have told Phoenix about the Psyche-Lock on Celestia? It was a big one... five locks total. I don't know if I should or not...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her inner musings were interrupted by Rainbow Dash. \"C'mon, Twilight, let's find somewhere to relax or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Right, yeah,\" the unicorn agreed, as she followed her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n[[Here, this thread loops around to the first option from this chapter: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1879793-MLPFiM---Nyx-the-teen-years/map/154122212221\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/ite...</a>]]</span></div></div>",

It rubbed its eyes with the back of its hoof... no, 'hand'. Humans and minotaurs had hands. (Certain ponies in town would never let her live it down if she got caught making that sort of mistake.) It then slowly blinked open a pair of dark blue eyes, a hue similar to its dress.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nyx winced, reflexively backing up as her wings flared defensively against the onslaught of the human's scream. Before she could try to calm the human down, however, she looked again and found the creature... smiling like Pinkie Pie during a solid week of birthdays. \"Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh, you're real! And you <i>talk</i>! I knew it! I <i>knew</i> Equestria was real!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx suddenly found the human buzzing around her, occasionally touching her. \"Oh, wow, you have such a beautiful mane... and wings! Real wings! *gasp* And a <i>horn</i>! Oh my gosh, does that mean you're a princess? I'm sorry, your majesty, I was just so excited!\" She quickly stepped back and bowed with a stage flourish. It all happened so fast, Nyx had to remind herself to close her mouth as her jaw hung open from surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... well... I am an alicorn, but I'm not a princess,\" Nyx replied, trying to get her head together. Then she blinked as something else the human said caught her attention. \"Wait, why are you so surprised Equestria is real? Where are you from? How did you get here? And who <i>are</i> you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human (Nyx guessed from her build and voice that it was a girl) smiled energetically. \"Well, I wasn't <i>surprised</i>, exactly. My dad told me stories about when a unicorn summoned him to Equestria all the time when I was little. He always told me they were just bedtime stories, but I could tell he was lying about that! I was just amazed to actually be in a whole other world! There's so little real magic in my world, but I figured that if someone from yours could summon someone from mine, then there had to be a way to send myself here, and I found one!\" Taking a moment to breathe, Trucy giggled and blushed a little. \"Oops, and sorry for not introducing myself. My name's Trucy-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Wright,\" Nyx interrupted, taking the time to piece things together while the girl rambled. Trucy wasn't the only one who had parents tell stories, and one was of the time Twilight summoned a human lawyer named Phoenix Wright from another world to save Rainbow Dash from charges of murder. If her father was brought to Equestria during that time, there were only two possibilities, and she could tell from Trucy's gasp that she was dead-on with her guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! How did you know?! Did you use your magic to cast an identification spell?\" Trucy asked, causing Nyx to blink and bust out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no... as far as I know, there's no such thing. I just knew because... my name's Nyx, and my mother's Twilight Sparkle. The one who summoned your dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis actually took Trucy aback. \"No way... <i>the</i> Twilight Sparkle? I can't believe it!\" Then she cocked her head. \"But dad never mentioned her having kids... er... foals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx pointed out, \"And from what mom told me, Phoenix didn't have any children when he was brought over here, either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls looked at each other. Then they grinned and simultaneously asked, \"Adopted?\" Then just as simultaneously, they answered, \"Yep.\" This caused the two teens to start giggling, loosening up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I never thought I would meet a human,\" Nyx said, \"let alone Phoenix Wright's daughter! You know, he's one of my heroes, after all the stories mom told about how he never gave up, fighting right to the end to make sure justice was served and the innocent were protected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucy nodded. \"And I always wanted to meet Twilight Sparkle. A real unicorn, with <i>real</i> magic!\" Clapping her hands together, she pulled them apart again to reveal that she was suddenly holding a wand. \"All my tricks are just illusion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx oohed. She hadn't sensed any magic, but neither had she seen how Trucy put the wand in her hand. \"Is that why you came here? To meet my mother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to that question, Trucy's expression shifted from bubbly and cheerful to a more determined face. \"Actually... I need a pony who knows magic.\"</span></div></div>",

So what made you take the chance of coming here instead of researching the spells in the book you found?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucy blinked a little. Nyx could see her reaching for an answer as she replied, \"Well, ah...

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before she could so much as summon up the strength to open her eyes, Nyx started becoming aware of sounds. Muffled and incoherent at first. Her sense of touch then started to kick in, including just enough equilibrium to figure out that she was laying on her side. Instead of the stone floors of Night Stone Castle, however, she could feel thin carpeting against her cheek. All the while, the sounds she was hearing slowly grew more clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-ke up! Trucy! <i>Trucy!</i>\" A stallion's voice. Adult, but probably not much older than her, if Nyx were to guess. And loud. Very loud. Either she actually <i>had</i> gotten into the special cider and was suffering a hangover, or this stallion could project his voice like an actor in a Trotway show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she heard another voice. Softer. Female. Trucy's. Definitely Trucy's. Nyx heard the young magician groan as she was helped up to her feet. \"'Pollo...? That you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, now come on! We've gotta get out of here before that thing wakes up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, 'that thing' had already woken up, and Nyx slowly, shakily started pushing herself up to her hooves. This prompted a yelp from the male voice, who shouted, \"Stay behind me! I'll hold it off!\" Nyx rubbed her forehead and slowly opened her eyes, allowing the light in as she looked toward the sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFunnily enough, while her vision was still blurry and unfocused, she found herself looking at what seemed to be nothing less than a giant chicken brandishing a stick in her direction. When her eyes began to focus and let her see more clearly, however, she found herself on the receiving end of a frightened glare from a male human with the most unique manestyle she'd ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were in some sort of office with a desk, a bookshelf in the back, and a decorative plant near the window. The human was standing between Nyx and a groggy Trucy, holding a golf club and waving it around in the alicorn's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, before Nyx could say or do anything more, Trucy smacked him upside the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! Trucy, what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are <i>you</i> doing, Apollo?! I told you to give me at least three hours before casting the return spell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo glanced back over his shoulder, finding himself caught between what he was certain was a demon horse from the depths of Hell and a fuming Trucy... and apparently didn't know which one he should be more intimidated by. \"I panicked, okay? You disappeared on me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was <i>supposed</i> to disappear,\" Trucy retorted, hands on her hips. \"That was the whole point! What kind of spell did you think I was casting, here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a <i>real</i> one,\" Apollo protested. \"And where did this monster horse come from?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx blinked and sat down on her haunches with a sour look on her face. \"Umm, excuse me, I'm not a monster <i>or</i> a horse. I'm a pony,\" Nyx replied with irritation evident in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis just freaked Apollo out again. \"Ahhhhh! It talks?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Nyx's anger flared up at being called an 'it', the door near Trucy and Apollo opened, and in stepped a tall, stubbly man with sleepy eyes. He looked older than Apollo, and wore a sort of grey, hooded sweatshirt, and a garish blue hat that would have made Rarity shriek with terror. There was a moment of silence as this man looked around the room before settling on the club in Apollo's hand. \"Huh, I didn't know you played golf,\" he mused, causing the younger man to choke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha... buh... don't you see the big black horse?!\" Apollo demanded, pointing at Nyx.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pony,\" the older man corrected, stepping forward so he was standing in front of Nyx. \"And I was waiting for you to introduce me to our guest from Equestria.\" Holding out his hand, he smiled faintly and apparently decided to handle the introductions himself. \"Hello, miss. My name's Phoenix Wright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx didn't even realize that her jaw was hanging open until she tried to respond. Lifting up a hoof and placing it in Phoenix's hand, she stammered, \"N... Nyx. Nyx Sparkle...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix's expression didn't visibly change in any way she could see, but as she looked up at Phoenix's eyes, she could see a brief shimmer there. Recognition, perhaps, at the mention of her mother's surname, but also a hint of... sadness? She couldn't really be sure. He simply took in that information and mused, \"Well. How about that? Why don't I pour some grape juice and you can tell me how Twilight's been doing these days?\" He then looked over at Apollo and asked, \"Well? Aren't you going to offer the lady a seat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger man's eye twitched, causing Nyx and Trucy to giggle softly as he slumped forward in defeat.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After pouring a cup of grape juice for everypony (every<i>one</i>, Nyx mentally corrected herself, being the only pony there) Phoenix asked, \"So, how are things in Equestria? No more murder cases since I was there last, I hope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx laughed softly and shook her head. \"No, things have been pretty peaceful lately. At least as much as you can expect in Ponyville. We get some monsters from the Everfree Forest every now and then, but we generally send them packing again before they can do any serious damage.\" She fidgeted nervously, slightly overwhelmed at being face to face with the only one of her heroes who didn't know about the events surrounding her 'birth', not to mention her rise and fall as conqueror of Equestria. And to be perfectly honest, sitting across from this champion of truth and justice, she quickly realized that she wanted to keep it that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, between her mom's exploits and her own adventures with the Cutie Mark Crusaders, there were plenty of other stories. While she tried to think of one, she lifted up her cup with magic. For whatever reason, Apollo chose that moment to spray a mouthful of grape juice at her. Narrowing her eyes at him as the sugary drink dripped down her face, Nyx grabbed some napkins with her magic in order to wipe herself clean and clean up the carpet before it could stain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apollo! What was <i>that</i> for?\" Trucy asked, almost as irritated as Nyx was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back and forth between the alicorn and his human co-workers, Apollo stammered, \"But she... the cup... napkins! <i>Floating!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she <i>is</i> part unicorn,\" Phoenix replied, calm amusement plastered all over his face. \"That's sort of what they do. Don't be too hard on him, though, girls. I had trouble getting used to Equestria when I was there, and that was <i>with</i> Twilight's help. Speaking of your horn, though, Nyx... I couldn't help noticing your wings, and based on your size, I'm guessing you're part earth pony, too. As far as I knew, the only ponies like that were the Princesses, so does that mean you're royalty back home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx froze for a moment, her black coat turning a few shades greyer as this question struck closer to home than she wanted to get into. After all, she could easily explain that no, she didn't have any claim to the throne, but then she would probably have to explain <i>why</i> she didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately (if only for the sake of deferring the question) there was a rattling sound as someone outside the office tried to open it, only to find it locked. After that came a knock on the door. From the other side, a female voice asked, \"Hey, is anybody in there? Why's this door locked? Open up, in the name of the law!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo suddenly went white as a sheet as he recognized the voice, while Phoenix smiled a bit. \"Oh, it's Detective Skye. I wonder what she's here about,\" the older man mused. He got up to go to the door, but before he opened it, he grinned back at the other three and whispered, \"Apollo, why don't you show Miss Nyx the back office while I see what Ema wants?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx suddenly found herself getting shoved toward another room on the opposite side of the office, and though she was indignant about being manhandled, didn't offer much resistance once she figured that if Phoenix didn't want her meeting this 'Ema Skye' person, there was probably a reason for it. Once in the back room, Apollo quickly closed the door and braced himself against it, looking like he was in the middle of hyperventilating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, man... okay, we just stay here and don't make a sound until she's gone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSettling down nearby, Nyx raised an eyebrow in concern. Whispering quietly, she asked, \"What are you so worried about? Who is this person?\" Recalling that Phoenix had referred to her as 'Detective', as well as her 'open up int he name of the law' line, she quickly put two and two together. Her eyes widened and she asked, \"Are you... on the wrong side of the law?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! No,\" Apollo hissed through his teeth, \"I mean... I'm a defense attorney and she's a detective, so we're technically supposed to be on opposite sides in the courtroom, but that's not the issue. If you thought I freaked out, just wait until <i>she</i> sees you! She'll never stop screaming about how you're 'scientifically impossible', and probably arrest us all for breaking the laws of physics. Or at least for having an exotic pet without a permit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx glared at him again, starting to wish she had cockatrice eyes instead of her draconic ones. Somehow, Apollo had proven himself to be able to push one of her buttons with every other sentence out of his mouth, and the ability to turn him into a spiky-haired lawn ornament was an increasingly attractive fantasy every time he did so. But in the ensuing awkward silence between them, she overheard Detective Skye speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh. So if you're just sitting around drinking grape juice, why lock the door? Better yet, why do I count <i>four</i> cups? That book is evidence in this case, so if you took it or are hiding whoever did, I'll have no choice but to search this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo froze up again. \"Uh-oh... she's gonna come back here. We've gotta hide you!\" He frantically looked around, but there weren't any good places. The only thing that <i>might</i> be big enough to conceal her was Phoenix's desk, but there was no way that would work for more than a few seconds. And though he glanced out the window, thinking briefly of pushing her out and letting her wings keep her from splattering on the streets below, it was too narrow. Not to mention that he could just imagine the uproar that would spring up if she were seen in public. \"Oh no... oh no, this really isn't good... Can't you use some of your... magic... for this sort of situation...?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx sighed. If Phoenix hadn't suggested that it was for the best to hide her true nature by sending her back here, she wouldn't have any problem with simply introducing herself. Were humans seriously that xenophobic by nature? It probably wasn't a good idea to dwell on that, though, as Ema's footsteps were approaching the door, though it sounded like Phoenix and Trucy were trying to keep her distracted to buy a little more time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a matter of fact, I do,\" Nyx replied to Apollo, focusing her horn on the first spell she thought of that might help here. One that would...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nyx's horn began to glow with magic as she laid the spell out in her mind. However, she needed a catalyst to get it going, To that end, she bit down on a few of Apollo's hairs and yanked them out. This drew a short yelp of surprise and pain from the lawyer, but he had the presence of mind to quickly clap a hand over his mouth and glare at Nyx while she smirked back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting her spell mix with the hairs, Nyx felt the magic flow through her and start changing her body. It was a spell that she had studied when she had been thinking of exploring more of the world. The wizard who had developed it, Shifty Shaper, had called it 'The Ultimate Tourist'. A sort of shapeshifting spell that wouldn't require the constant focus of a maintained illusion, and if she tried to change into a shape from her imagination despite being unfamiliar with the species she was emulating, there was a good chance of falling into what was referred to as the 'uncanny valley'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, the Ultimate Tourist would use Apollo's hair as a sample to create a template, then apply her own features to that template to create a form for herself that, while human, would be uniquely her. Fortunately, as she felt her body starting to contort and twist in ways that made Apollo cover his eyes to keep from vomiting in disgust, there was no pain. Instead, she simply felt as though she were caught up in one of Miss Rarity's moments of inspiration, and getting pulled from one suit of clothes into another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the sensations faded, signalling that the magic had run its course, Nyx took a second to look herself over. Her line of sight was now lower, and being on all fours was no longer as comfortable a position as it should have been, so she reached out toward Phoenix's desk for support and hesitantly pulled herself up onto her hind legs. The fingers on the ends of her hooves... hands... felt strange and alien to her, but at the same time they gripped the edge of the desk as if they knew what to do on their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer glossy black coat was gone, her skin having taken on a more mocha hue. Standing at full height, she realized that, just as she was tall for a pony by nature, she was also tall for a human, though not to as extreme a degree. Possibly an inch or so taller than Apollo. Her limbs were long and athletically toned, as far as she could tell. She was surprised by the lumps on her chest, though, not sure what they were supposed to be for. Thinking back, she recalled that Trucy had them too, just not as pronounced as the ones attached to her. Still, it was the physique that the spell had crafted for her, so she assumed that they were standard equipment for a human female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling proudly at her accomplishment, Nyx whispered to Apollo, \"Okay, we can go out, now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo peeked out from between his fingers, his eyes bugging out before he quickly covered them again. \"That's <i>not</i> better,\" he hissed, sweating nervously as Ema got closer and closer to the door out in the other room. Pointing at Nyx, he quickly whispered, \"Horn! Wings! Eyes! <i>Clothes!</i> You need clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx blinked in confusion for a moment, reaching up to her head and back to realize that her horn and wings were still present. \"Oh yeah... Shifty did mention the horn would stay, since any unicorn casting the spell would still need it in order to use magic.\" Most likely, the unicorn wizard hadn't expected an alicorn to use the spell, which is why wings hadn't been mentioned. Likewise, since the eyes were one of her natural features that were applied to the template, those hadn't changed at all. As for clothes, Nyx wasn't sure why <i>that</i> was such a big deal, considering she had been just as naked only a minute ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, she chalked it up as 'one of those things that freaks Apollo out' and took it into consideration. She felt more... 'exposed' than usual, anyway, so she wrapped her wings around her body and focused on an illusion spell. Adding clothes to her existing body would be far less taxing than creating a whole illusory persona, so she imagined an ensemble around herself matching Trucy's magician outfit, complete with a top hat to cover her horn, and her wings being disguised as a cape. It would confuse anybody who tried to give her a hug, since tactile illusion was orders of magnitude more difficult, but she hoped that it would suffice until she could get some actual clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, to conceal her draconic eyes, she created an illusory pair of shades based on the ones DJ PON3 always wore. \"Alright, <i>now</i> how do I look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo hesitantly dared to peek again, but this time there wasn't anything to immediately throw him into panic mode. \"Like you're going to pull a rabbit out of a hat and then use it to pierce the heavens,\" he replied, but she could see him relaxing a little. \"It's better than nothing at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after he said that, though, he ended up getting knocked down as the Detective on the other side of the door suddenly shoved it open. A pretty brown-haired woman in a white lab coat (who looked to be a bit older than Nyx and Trucy as far as the alicorn-turned-human could tell) scowled as she looked into the room, quickly glancing at Apollo and Nyx.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEma looked Nyx up and down, then crossed her arms and asked, \"So, you would be...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Twilight sighed happily as she settled into her favored reading spot, a plate of nachos resting on the table in front of her while she magically reached out for her topic of choice. Today, it was an archaeological study on pre-Celestian civilization. Even with a couple of immortals governing Equestria, and the sun princess's edict early in her reign that historical records should be periodically copied onto fresh parchments so as to preserve them for future generations, there was still so little from before that time that had survived to the present day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding the tome carefully in her magic, she plucked cheese-covered chips to snack on while she opened her mind to the wonders of ancient life. Nyx was busy refurbishing Night Stone castle, Spike was helping Rarity by acting as a model for those rare occasions when she might actually get to design something for a bipedal customer, and it was the middle of the day with nothing better to do than catch up on her research. A perfect moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she was about to take a bite of her chip, though, the library door flew open, and Twilight's ears were immediately assaulted by a high-pitched scream! Her hold on both book and chip fumbled for an instant, causing the book to dip dangerously close to the cheesy snack. Her eyes flying open wide with panic at the thought of staining the book with grease so soon after getting it, Twilight reacted quickly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, but not necessarily in the <i>best</i> way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of simply lifting the book back up, she quickly reached out with a third magical field for the plate of nachos, quickly moving it out of the way so that the book could land on the table safely. In the process, though, she forgot about the lone chip she was about to bite on for all of half a second, very nearly dropping it onto the open pages! Again fearing for the book's safety, she tried to push it out of the way while simultaneously lifting the plate up and moving it to catch the chip, but with her concentration as scattered as it was, this resulted in several seconds of magically juggling book and snacks in a total panic before a good half of the nachos simply slipped off the plate and landed on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGritting her teeth as the cheese and chips sank into her mane, Twilight groaned. It didn't help at all that she <i>still</i> heard that piercing shriek. Pushing her bangs out of her eyes, she looked up and snapped, \"WHAT?!\" That was when she saw Trucy, and her jaw nearly hit the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot seeming to be aware of the disaster she nearly caused, Trucy paused for breath before rushing toward Twilight with an ecstatic gleam in her eye. \"Oh, wow, it's really you! <i>The</i> Twilight Sparkle, and you look almost just like I imagined! And you were really juggling things with your magic, that's amazing!\" She grabbed one of Twilight's hooves and started shaking it vigorously enough to shake the nachos out of her mane. \"I'm Trucy Wright! Oh, man, between my dad and Nyx, it almost feels like I know you already, but I still can't believe you're right here in front of me. This is such an honor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx couldn't help but snicker to herself as her mom became the target of Trucy's adoration. Gathering her senses, Twilight stammered in a shaky voice, \"Who... human... you... Nyx... <i>Wright</i>?! You're... you're Phoenix Wright's daughter? My books didn't say human children grew up so fast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Nyx completely lose control and bust out laughing. Unable to contain a giggle-fit, she came up to help clean the bits of crumbs and grease out of Twilight's mane while explaining, \"You're not the only one who came down with a sudden case of parenthood, mom. Mr. Phoenix adopted Trucy here some time after he helped you with Rainbow Dash's trial, and she found a way to come here just to see you. About a <i>case</i>.\" She added extra emphasis to that last word, rather excited about the implications.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Trucy was obviously a fan of Twilight based on her father's stories of Equestria, Nyx had loved hearing about how Rainbow Dash was saved from banishment after being accused of murder. How both Phoenix and Twilight had worked together, pushing through doubt and lies to expose the truth and protect the innocent with little more than faith in their client and the determination to see it through to the end! The way it had been described to her made it sound as thrilling as any battle she had ever read about, or even experienced first-hand. And now they were being called upon to help!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Twilight was still rattled, but not being shaken anymore. Looking at Trucy's beaming face and considering the implications of her arrival, the unicorn just couldn't stay mad. Smiling a little, she replied, \"Oh, wow... I haven't seen Phoenix in so long, I'd love to hear whatever you can tell me, Trucy. How has he been? And the Judge, too, is he doing well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucy giggled and found a seat for herself. It was a bit small for even a teenaged girl like her, but she made herself comfortable. \"Oh, sure, I'd be happy to tell you all about it!\"</span></div></div>",

For a moment, she puzzled over the mysterious mare's appearance, but then she remembered something... something she'd been told long ago. Of a unicorn mare who'd done everything in her power to pin her own crime on Rainbow Dash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The crime of murder...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sonata!\" breathed Nyx, mind going into overdrive. How was the murderess loose? Nyx had been told that Sonata had been banished to the sun for her crimes, both the murder and framing a national heroine. So her appearance here was illogical! After all, Princess Celestia had seen to Sonata's banishment herself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>That didn't stop Nightmare Moon,</i> a treacherous part of Nyx's mind said snidely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That was different! Nightmare Moon had a thousand years to prepare her escape! Sonata's been banished for far shorter than that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Perhaps it's a sign that Princess Celestia isn't perfect?</i> her inner devil replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx was about to retort, but stopped herself. \"No, no, I'm <i>not</i> going to get into an argument with <i>myself</i>. Last thing I need is anypony thinking I'm crazy... again.\" She sighed, and glared at the unicorn. \"Still, wouldn't hurt to bring her to Mom, see if she can do anything about this. At the very least, Princess Celestia ought to be informed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her musings were interrupted when the object of her attention began to stir. \"On the other hoof, I could deal with her myself...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"...Ugh ...\" Mia Fey groaned. \"Maya, Pearl, where did you bring me this time?\" She groaned again as the sound of her voice exacerbated the headache she already had. \"What I'd give for some aspirin right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with the headache,\" a young, female voice said harshly. \"After what you pulled a few years ago, I'm surprised you have the nerve to show your face around here, Sonata.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mia opened her eyes at that, intent on giving whoever was speaking a piece of her mind. The fact that she found herself looking at an angry black alicorn caused her train of thought to derail for a bit. \"Um, what?\" she said intelligently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The pony snorted. \"Don't play dumb, Sonata. I don't know how you escaped your banishment, but trust me, I'll fix that soon enough,\" she said, as her horn began to glow a deep blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mia's mind finally caught on to the situation. She was in Equestria, somehow, and this pony thought she had committed some wrong. And she had seconds to convince the alicorn otherwise. \"Wait! Hold on! I'm not this 'Sonata'!\" she protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh yeah? Well you're a dead ringer for her, that's for sure,\" the midnight alicorn retorted. \"Right down to the fact that you're a unicorn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That caused another derailment of Mia's train of thought. For the first time, she looked herself over. <i>Gray coat, check. Tail, check. Four legs, check. Horn...</i> she reached up with a foreleg to confirm. <i>... check.</i> She sighed, then thought of something. \"Miss, do you happen to know what 'Sonata's Cutie Mark was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This seemed to give the alicorn pause. \"An eye, I believe, representing her talent for perception.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mia craned her neck to look at her own flank, as did the alicorn. To her relief, there wasn't an eye, but rather the image of her attorney's badge, the mirror to the own she just now realized was on her lapel. \"Well, I think that settles it. I'm not this 'Sonata'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The alicorn had the good grace to look sheepish. \"My apologies, Miss... Fey, was it? It's just, you really do look a lot like her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No offense taken, miss,\" Mia said. \"Though, I confess to being rather confused about several things. How I got to Equestria, why I'm a pony...\" She tried disengaging from the body, only to find herself firmly trapped inside. \"And most importantly, why I appear to be alive again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wait, what?\" The taller pony blinked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mia sighed. \"Let me explain...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx listened to Mia's story with a neutral expression. When she was finished, the alicorn sighed. \"So, let me get this straight. You're a human, from Earth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mia nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And you were killed a few years ago by a guy who didn't want you letting his secrets out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Another nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And, despite these claims, here you are, alive, as a pony.

So why don't we accept my word as being true until we come across proof leading one way or the other?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx worked her jaw for a moment, then sighed. \"Alright, I guess that's as good as anything. I think I should take you back into town, to my mom. She should be able to answer a few questions for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Works for me,\" Mia said, standing up on all fours... or trying to. She promptly fell over, as she was unused to the stance. \"But, perhaps a lesson in balance is needed first?\" she asked sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx chuckled a little, and set about giving Mia some basic pony pointers.</span></div></div>",

The height difference between the two, coupled with Nyx's catlike eyes and black hide, made it a very intimidating sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mia sweated, deciding honesty was the best policy as she looked up at the demon before her. \"Um... yes?\" She braced herself for whatever wrathful judgement Nyx had for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She was unprepared for Nyx to let out a squee of delight, and wrap her in a bone-grinding hug. \"OmigoshomigoshomiGOSH!! This is so <i>awesome</i>! I'm meeting the mare who trained <i>Phoenix Wright</i>! Eeeeee!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mia gasped a little. \"Um... Miss Nyx? Air?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh! Sorry!\" Nyx let go, blushing in embarrassment. \"Sorry I got carried away, it's just... Phoenix Wright is one of my personal heroes.

I mean, kinda hard to be legendary when you're dead,\" Mia said, scratching the back of her neck with a hoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before Nyx could comment, there was a gust of wind, resolving into a rainbow-maned pegasus. \"Heya, Nyx! There you are! Twilight wanted me to check up on you, and - \" The newcomer cut herself off as her eyes fell on the other pony in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mia blinked, as the pegasus's irises shrunk, then dilated. When the blue mare started snorting and pawing the ground, that was when Mia realized she was about to come under attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rainbow Dash couldn't believe it. Here was the mare who had very nearly ruined her whole life. Here! In Castle Nightstone! She was supposed to be banished to the sun! Well, it didn't matter. She'd get the chance to correct this little oversight of Princess Celestia's. And revenge would be <i>sweet</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rainbow sprang at the mare, shrilling a war-cry. Her target yelped and scrambled to get away, but she was far too slow to escape. Rainbow was on her in a moment, a blue forehoof lashing out to strike the grey mare in the face. Before the blow could land, though, a blue aura caught it, and dragged the prismatic mare away from her target. Rainbow glared at the alicorn. \"Nyx, what the hay?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"She's not who you think she is, Rainbow,\" Nyx replied. \"She's a different pony!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How would you know who I was thinking she was?\" the weathermare asked. \"You weren't around when it happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Maybe not, but Mom told me all about what happened. I made the same mistake you did, assuming she was Sonata, but she's not! The Cutie Mark is different!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rainbow blinked, and scrutinized the grey mare. She was on her side, giving Rainbow a good look at her cutie mark, which was some weird golden disc thing. And the mare she was thinking of had... \"Oh. Omigosh, I am SO sorry!\" Rainbow exclaimed, realizing her mistake. \"I totally confused you with somepony else!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Let me guess... a mare named Sonata?\" the grey look-alike asked. \"Nyx made the same mistake, as she said. What did this Sonata do that was so terrible, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"She committed murder, and tried to frame me for it,\" Rainbow said bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The other mare blinked. \"Well, that would certainly explain the hostility, if I resemble her that much,\" she mused. She held out a hoof to Rainbow. \"Mia Fey. A pleasure to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The prismatic mare blinked, then smiled. \"Rainbow Dash. Again, sorry for the mistake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No worries,\" Mia replied. Then she blinked, and looked at Rainbow closely. \"Ah-ha, so you're the one Phoenix had to defend in court here, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Huh? How'd you know Nix defended me in court?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mia blinked, then looked at the alicorn. \"Wait, I'm confused. I thought the court case was before you came along?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rainbow face-hooved, realizing her error. \"No, no, not her! 'Nix' was a nickname I came up with for Phoenix when he was defending me. Haven't thought about it in a while, and didn't think about the confusion it could cause these days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah, that makes sense,\" Mia nodded. \"Anyway, I know Phoenix because I'm the one who taught him everything he knows about being a lawyer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Whoa...\" Rainbow's eyes bugged out slightly. \"So, he learned everything from you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Everything he couldn't learn from a book, anyway,\" Mia elaborated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Including how to win cases only by the skin of his teeth?\" the prismatic mare deadpanned. At Mia's choked expression, Rainbow sighed. \"Seriously, if Fluttershy hadn't pointed the hoof at Sonata at the last minute, I wouldn't be here right now. That victory for Nix was pure luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mia sighed. \"Well, luck is a large part of a defense attorney's success.\" She frowned. \"The common mindset among people is that when someone is accused, they are guilty until proven innocent.\" She sighed. \"It wasn't always that way...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx cocked her head quizzically at the creature she saw lying on the ground. It wasn't that she didn't know what it was, far from it. She'd seen depictions of humans before, mostly in stories about them living across the sea with other ponies. Nyx thought their physical descriptions ridiculous, to be quite honest. A race of bipedal beings who could walk around without even a tail for balance? She'd seen feats that Pinkie Pie had done that made more sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Still, even by what she'd read about humans, the one on the floor was strange. She (Nyx assumed it was female, judging from the softness of the face) had perhaps the most ridiculous mane - <i>hair</i>style, that is; reddish orange and long, but it was done up in a bizarre ponytail. Rather than hanging back behind the head, it was tied off to dangle to one side. In addition, the human wore yellow and white clothes (blast if Nyx could remember what each article of clothing was called, humans had so many), along with a black glove with a blue interior on her right hand. Around her neck hung a necklace with a blue... jewel? No, the blue area of the necklace didn't look like any jewel Nyx had ever seen before. It didn't sparkle in the light from Nyx's horn, for one thing, and it was too smooth on its surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As the human groaned and began to stir, Nyx put such thoughts out of her mind, instead settling on more important matters. <i>Who she is and how she got here, for starters,</i> the black alicorn mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ow...\" moaned Athena as she regained consciousness. \"Note to self: never let Apollo choose the post-victory restaurant. What did I even eat, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Apparently something bad enough you blocked it out,\" mused a female voice from nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Apparently,\" agreed Athena. There was a moment's pause. <i>Wait a tic... that wasn't Trucy's voice. Heck, that doesn't belong to any girl I know! So who...?</i> She opened her eyes. She blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The black horse-like apparition with cat-like blue eyes blinked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um...\" began Athena. \"Were you the one who spoke just now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The horse-like creature nodded. \"That's right. My name's Nyx. And you are?\" It - she? It certainly sounded female - held out a hoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uh... I'm Athena,\" replied the shell-shocked lawyer. She reached out to the hoof, half-expecting it to vanish. But no, it remained solid, even as she shook it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Pleased to meet you, Athena!\" Nyx chirped. She then cocked her head. \"Are you alright? You look a little dazed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Dazed... right... one way to put it,\" muttered Athena. She looked Nyx over. The lawyer had never been a fan of Greek mythology, but even she knew what unicorns were, and the long horn identified the black mare as one. Except, a glance at Nyx's sides revealed wings, and the winged horse Pegasus was the one known for those. What did you call a horse that had both a horn and wings?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Almost as if sensing Athena's thoughts, Nyx smirked. \"Never seen an alicorn in the flesh before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alicorn?\" Athena echoed, testing the word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The black mare nodded. \"It's the term for a pony that has both a horn and a pair of wings, like I do.\" She extended her wings partially for emphasis, before folding them against her sides again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wait, pony? You're a pony?\" The word triggered something in Athena's memories, a picture she'd found once. \"Don't suppose you know of a human named Phoenix Wright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Whatever Athena had expected, a huge grin and a squee from Nyx wasn't it. \"You know Phoenix Wright?! He's one of my personal heroes! Omigosh, how's he been? Has he defended many more innocent people? Is he still practicing law? Is he - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Whoa, whoa!\" Athena held up her hands, smiling slightly at the alicorn's exuberance. \"So, I take it you know him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The mare blushed, visible even through her black coat. \"Well, I know <i>of</i> him. He defended one of my friends from murder charges, before I met her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Athena nodded. \"Yeah, that sounds like my boss, alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx's eyes went round. \"Your 'boss'? You mean, you work under him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Athena nodded, giving Nyx a 'peace' sign, along with a grin. \"That's right! Athena Cykes, attorney at law!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx smiled. \"Well, let's get you to Ponyville, and see if my mom can figure out how you got here, and how to send you home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Your mom?\" Athena asked with a blink. \"Why would she know all that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx's smile grew. \"She's Twilight Sparkle, student of Princess Celestia, and one of the most powerful unicorns alive today.

Now something is gonna happen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The alicorn rolled her eyes. \"Oh, come on, Spike, you're being paranoid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Athena grimaced. \"Actually, I'm gonna have to side with Spike on this. Every time someone - or somepony - says something like 'what could possibly happen', something really bad happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, paranoia notwithstanding, if all goes well, you'll be back home by this time tomorrow,\" Twilight said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Both Athena and Spike groaned in dismay. \"I'm going to get sucked into something here now, I just know it,\" moaned the lawyer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Such pessimism,\" Nyx clucked in disapproval. \"You know what you need, Athena? You need to relax. I'll take you to the spa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Athena perked up immediately. \"A spa? Count me in! I haven't been to one in... gosh, have I <i>ever</i> been to one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight chuckled. \"You two have fun. I'll let you know if anything major happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0About an hour later, Athena and Nyx, along with Rarity (who had been at the spa for other reasons) were in the middle of the steam room, all of them feeling very relaxed. The fashionista had taken to Athena's hairstyle and dress sense almost immediately. Likewise, the lawyer found it nice to talk to Rarity, as Phoenix and Apollo weren't very good about answering appearance-related questions honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, you can hardly blame them, dear,\" Rarity said, when Athena voiced this. \"Stallions, no matter where they are from, will never answer such questions with honesty. Although, admittedly, Phoenix could dress rather sharp. And his hair! Goodness, I remember how it seemed to scream, 'Take That!'.\" She giggled. \"Ah, if he were a pony, I would ask if he were in the market, as it were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Athena flinched. She hadn't pried much into her boss's past, but she'd read some old case files involving him. She didn't know how well over the whole 'Dahlia' thing Phoenix was, but she didn't want to risk it. \"That might not be a good idea, Rarity. Phoenix had some... girl trouble in the past, and it might have jaded him to the idea of dating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rarity pouted a little. \"Oh, that's too bad. Might I ask what sort of girl trouble?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Athena thought it over, then just decided to be direct. \"The girl he thought was his girlfriend tried to frame him for a murder she committed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Both of the mares' eyes widened. \"Well. That certainly qualifies as 'girl trouble', though not in the usual sense,\" Rarity admitted. \"How did that turn out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"He was found innocent, she was found guilty, and she was... put to death a few years later,\" Athena said, wincing a little at the last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Both ponies looked a little ill. \"Put to death?\" Nyx croaked. \"I mean, I know she killed someone, but still...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Athena sighed. \"That's Earth law for you. We're not very keen on the idea of murderers running loose, so we make sure they can't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The alicorn shuddered. \"Here in Equestria, a murderer is just banished to the moon or the sun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The human blinked at that. \"Well. If we could do that on Earth, it would certainly be an effective way to deal with them. But space travel on Earth is extremely limited.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The three continued talking throughout their visit to the spa, blissfully unaware of what was to come.</span></div></div>",

I followed Nyx back to the library, while Rarity peeled off back to her home to prepare for a trip to Canterlot, Equestria's capital. I nearly burst out laughing when I heard that; the pun was just too obvious. Rarity's a fashion designer, and she was to meet with a prospective client up at the capital, as well as check in on her younger sister, Sweetie Belle. I admit, I'm a little jealous. I don't have any siblings, either to worry about or have worry over me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">Ironic, then, that soon I would worry over one unicorn's fate... and that I would play a key part in determining said fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Athena yawned as she cricked her neck. The guest bed hadn't exactly been comfortable, having been designed for ponies, but Athena had made do by curling up in the bed and sleeping on her side. The bad news was that she woke up somewhat sore in her joints, and so she was forced to massage them to get them working at full efficiency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Morning, Athena,\" Nyx said as the human came downstairs. \"Sleep well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not too bad,\"Athena replied. \"Don't suppose there's a chance for breakfast before I go home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Some chuckling preceded Twilight out of the kitchen, followed by a tea set. \"Spike's working on it, don't worry. Also, since Phoenix was last here, I read up on human dietary habits, just in case I ever had to host one again, so you won't be offered hay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The lawyer grinned wryly as Twilight poured the tea. \"Thanks for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was a sudden belch and flash of green light from the kitchen. Athena blinked at this, but Nyx and Twilight hardly batted an eye. \"Who is it from, Spike?\" asked the librarian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Spike came in, holding a rolled-up scroll with an official-looking seal holding it together. \"Princess Celestia, who else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As Twilight took the scroll in her magic and Spike went back to the kitchen, Athena leaned over to Nyx. \"Did I miss something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Spike has a unique flame that he can use to send letters simply by exhaling it,\" the alicorn replied. \"He used to only be able to send and receive such things from Princess Celestia, but he recently learned how to send letters to other ponies as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Huh,\" Athena mused. \"That sounds convenient.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The sound of Twilight's teacup crashing against the table caught their attention. The unicorn's eyes were wide as she re-read the letter. \"No... no, this has to be a mistake!\" she breathed. \"This can't be happening, not again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Twilight? What's wrong?\" asked Athena with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The librarian looked up. \"It... it's from Princess Celestia. She... she says that there's been a murder in Canterlot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Athena groaned. <i>Of course, I knew something like this would happen.</i> Then a thought occured to her. \"Why would the Princess be telling you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight opened and closed her mouth a few times. \"Because... because the suspect they've arrested... is Rarity!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was a loud *<i>crash!</i>* from the kitchen, and Spike ran back in. \"<i>Say what?!</i>\" he yelped, at the same time as Nyx and Athena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Th-that's what it says!\" Twilight insisted, as she held the letter out for them to read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><div class=\"bquote\">My faithful student,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but a situation has emerged in Canterlot. One of the city's elite pianists, Ivory Strokes, was found murdered in his home late last night. The autopsy is still being performed, but a cursory inspection of the body has led me to believe he was struck with a blunt object with enough force to snap his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I normally wouldn't trouble you with this, but two circumstances force me to relay word to you: first, Ivory Strokes is the brother of Ponyville's mayor, Ivory Scroll. She should be informed of this by a friend. Secondly, your friend Rarity has been arrested as the prime suspect. Given the trouble you had finding a lawyer during Rainbow Dash's trial, I believe it would be best if you tried to contact Phoenix Wright once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I personally do not believe that Rarity could have done this. However, I will not be presiding as judge; instead, I will be fetching the Judge from Rainbow Dash's trial, and informing him of the situation. He is the one that will need convincing of Rarity's innocence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour loving teacher,<br>\r\nPrincess Celestia</div></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was silence as the news was digested. \"There's no way Rarity would do this,\" Athena finally remarked. \"I've known her less than a day, and I already know she wouldn't do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I agree,\" Twilight said, getting over her shock. \"Spike, I want you to round up the rest of the girls, and get them ready for a trip to Canterlot. After I visit the mayor, I'll prepare a spell to contact Phoenix and - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Athena coughed. \"You <i>do</i> know I'm right here, and could probably represent Rarity just as well, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight blinked. \"But, didn't you want to get home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Athena smirked. \"Now what kind of friend would I be if I left Rarity hanging? Going home can wait for a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight considered this, then nodded. \"Alright, that's one thing off my mind. Nyx, can you take Athena to Canterlot ahead of us, so she can get Rarity's approval?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx nodded. \"You can count on me, Mom!\" She and Athena left the library, followed by Spike.

Nyx's eyes widened as the shifting revealed the familiar starburst cutie mark. Yet... something was different. As the unicorn started to rise, Nyx saw the squared-off snout and the more stocky build of a stallion, rather than the trim form of her adoptive mother. Flabbergasted, she stood there as the stallion double of Twilight rose to his hooves, grumbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Very smooth, Dusk. Dunno what you did, but whatever it was failed spectacularly,\" he muttered. He opened his eyes, blinking them for a second to reveal the same violet shade as Twilight's.

You're a mare!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx arched an eyebrow. \"Last I checked, yes I was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But... then you can't be Sable Noctis,\" he elaborated. He looked contrite. \"I'm sorry for any confusion, you just have quite the resemblence to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This did little to clear up Nyx's confusion. \"I've never even heard of Sable Noctis,\" she said. \"I've been compared to <i>Nightmare Moon</i>, but not whoever you're talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The unicorn's jaw fell open. \"Nightmare... Moon?\" he repeated. \"Never heard of her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx's eyebrows flew clear up to her maneline. \"How can you not have heard of her? The Mare in the Moon, patron of Nightmare Night, evil side of Princess Luna, wanted to bring eternal night, is this ringing any bells?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He shook his head. \"You're the one not making sense! I've heard of the <i>Colt</i> in the Moon, not the Mare, and last I checked, Sable Noctis is the one who wanted to bring eternal night to Equestria! I stopped him with my friends, Applejack, Rainbow Blitz, Elusive, Butterscotch, and Berry Bubble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx blinked hard at that. The story was familiar, yet the names were all wrong. Still, an idea was forming in her head. \"And... your name is...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The unicorn puffed out his chest slightly. \"I'm Dusk Shine, personal student to our benevolent ruler Prince Solaris, and librarian at the Ponyville Books and Branches library!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That confirmed it. There were too many coincidences, and only one plausible explanation. The alicorn took a breath. \"Well, I'm sorry to tell you, Dusk Shine, but I don't believe you're in your native dimension anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dusk's eyes bugged out of his head. \"Wha...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx sighed, and began to elaborate. \"First off, there's no 'Prince Solaris' here, but rather, Princess Celestia. Second, what you said about 'Sable Noctis' is identical to what we know of Nightmare Moon here. Third, you and your friends are all mares here with different, yet fairly similar names.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dusk blinked several times in succession. \"So... I'm in a dimension where everypony's gender has been switched?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That appears to be the case, yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dusk nearly collapsed in relief. \"Thank Solaris! I thought for a moment I was dealing with a madmare.\" He blinked, and looked sheepish. \"Um, no offense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx chuckled. \"None taken.\" She held out a hoof. \"I'm Nyx, reincarnation of Nightmare Moon turned good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dusk gaped. \"Uh... you're kidding, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She chuckled. \"Nope. Why, what am I called in your dimension?\"</span></div></div>",

His royal black coat made it difficult to see any wounds, but he had the faint traces of scars faded after years of growing and healing, and a slightly burnt stench permeated the air, likely the effect of a miscast spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright, uh...\" Nyx tilted her head, stopping herself from saying 'dude,' since she wasn't familiar with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I'm fine,\" the colt answered in a soft rumble, like the gentle beating of a drum. \"I just... oww... didn't cast a spell right.\" He looked up at Nyx, not seeing her wings. \"Why are you in my... er, Ponyville's Castle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Your</i> castle?\" Nyx' wings flared, the hairs of her coat bristling slightly at the gall of this... this <i>stranger</i> saying that the castle she and her friends have been working on for so long was his! \"This is mine and my friends' castle! We've been fixing it up for months!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe colt wasn't listening any more, instead staring at her wings. \"That's... that's impossible...\" Nyx was about to throw a very strong rebuttal at the unwanted guest- namely, 'it is <i>so</i> possible!' - when he reached out and brushed one of her wings with a hoof. \"Only stallions can be Alicorns...\" He stopped poking at her wing and brought the hoof to ground, pushing himself to stand. \"How in the name of Solaris' beard are you a filly Alicorn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx blinked, briefly wondering who Solaris was before regaining her composure. \"Well, of course I'm a filly! All Alicorns are female. Princess Cadance is female, so are Princesses Celestia and Luna.\" Nyx tapped a hoof against the ground with a self-assuring <i>hmmpf.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe colt worked his jaw for a second, before replying slowly, \"You mean... Prince Rythmus, Prince Solaris, and Prince Apollo?\" The colt just shook his head, snorting dismissively. \"Whatever. I'm done for today. I need to get home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you live? What's your name?\" Despite her confusion on how this impossible colt could exist, she still wanted to learn more about him. Her years as Twilight's daughter had done nothing to slow her desire to learn more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe colt struck a heroic pose; his nose thrust into the air, his wings spread, and a sly smirk playing on his lips. \"My name is Nox, and I'm the Hero of Ponyville!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx gaped for a second before shaking herself out of it and glaring at 'Nox'. She was going to show this... this <i>boy</i> who's boss, and she was going to do so in the most diplomatically amazing way possible! <i>\"Nuh-uh!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah-huh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh-uh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah-huh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh-uh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah-huh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh-uh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah-huh, times a hundred!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh-uh times infinity!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNox, fuming over his sudden verbal loss, turned to look away from the frustrating filly- only to see her cutie mark was a shield, just like his. \"Hey, you have a cutie mark like mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Nyx looked at her own flank. On it was a midnight blue shield, with a waning crescent moon stamped in the middle. On the colt's flank was a similar shield, though the crescent moon was waxing, not waning. \"Well, they <i>are</i> similar... but mine's cooler!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes way! I got it for doing something super cool, and some other stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got mine in a cooler way, though. I did something super-duper cool to get it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two glared at each other, ready to shout out their greatest offenses and defenses possible (once again, being 'uh-huh' and 'nuh-uh,' respectively), when they heard the unmistakable sound of a draconic growl. \"S-spike?\" Nyx called out fearfully, Nox's question of \"S-spines?\" coming at the same moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large, red, smirking dragon lumbered into the room, followed closely by a pair of bigger dragons. \"Well, well, well,\" The red one said snidely. \"Look at we found. Snacks,\" he and his cronies laughed darkly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx and Nox' initial fear washed away, replaced with anger at the intrusion in the castle. \"Hey, dunderheads!\" They shouted in stereo. \"Get outta my castle or I'll stuff your faces with Mud cakes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two Alicorns blinked at each other in surprise, the red dragon laughed. \"Oh-ho, this snack bites back! Let's see if it's less feisty in the belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragons all moved into the room, and Nyx an Nox gulped, backing into the corner by a large, ornate window. \"N-nox...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should... should we run?\" Nyx dropped into a slightly awkward battle stance as three... four... <i>five</i> dragons all lumbered into the large room, trapping them in a corner between a window and a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I... I think that we should f-fight, right? We don't want them ruining the castle! What do <i>you</i> think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx' stance shifted a bit as she tried to keep all the dragons and her fellow Alicorn in her vision. \"Well, I think that...\"</span></div></div>",

Yeah, Twilight? Did'ja need something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight looks at him for a second before shaking her head. \"No, not really. Just wondering if you were hungry. I thought I heard your stomach growling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I'm good. I think I had too many pop-rocks at the party last night.\" Spike snorted, a small <i>pop</i> and <i>crackle</i> emanating from his nose. \"I think that filling sapphires with small amounts of gunpowder was both the smartest and craziest thing I've ever seen Pinkie do, when it came to cooking for dragons.\" Spike burped, a fireworks show in miniature dancing before him for a second. \"The only problem is that she didn't tell me at first, and I ate the whole bowl...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight giggled, returning to her scrolls. \"Alright, then. must've been my imagina-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TWILIGHT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GYAH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUURRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Pinkie Pie?! Don't do that, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Twilight, but there's smoke and fire coming from Nyx's castle! I thought I should warn yo-\" In a blur that even Pinkie could appreciate, Twilight was out the door. \"Well, the cavalry's been sent. Have a good afternoon, Spike~!\" She happily hopped into the Library's closet, where a whirring noise was heard for a second, before the door opend again, with nopony behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike just raised the book to cover his face, thinking, <i>'this will all be over soon, it's okay...

Then, using their combined strength, the two Alicorns sent them flying like a hammer-throw deep into the Everfree Forest. \"Yeah, we did it!\" Nyx and Nox shared a hoof-bump before their revelry was cut short by a bright flash, and a shout. \"NYX!\"</span></div></div>",

Nox took to the air in the fairly tall room, letting loose his scimitars at the purple dragon, its blonde hair getting clipped as he ducked out of the way of one blade, the other coming around to give him a faceful of ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple dragon slumped into Garble, who was already struggling to get out of the daze Nyx had put him in. \"Ooohhh.... you ponies are gonna regret that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Thunk!</b> With that, Garble slumped to the ground and laid still.

She was surprised to see a child there, but even more surprised that he was completely unfamiliar to her. And he was napping so cutely and peacefully despite the rest of the room being wrecked. Where had he come from? And where were his parents? Whoever they were, they were probably going to be worried, if they weren't already. Leaning down, she gently nosed the little unicorn awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly opening his eyes, the child yawned and mutters, \"Aww, izzit morning already...?\" He sleepily looked around before realizing, \"This isn't my room...\" Then he looked up at Nyx and said, \"Uh-oh... I'm in twouble, aren't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alicorn looked down at him with a bemused grin and replied, \"Well, I <i>hope</i> not. You shouldn't be wandering around in places like this by yourself, though. My name's Nyx. What's yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nebbah-la!\" he exclaimed cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx smiled warmly. \"'Nebula', huh? That's a great name! So, Nebula, where are your parents?\" Well, at least the unicorn wasn't scared. The question still remained as to how he got there in the first place. Still, getting him back home was the first priority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prob'ly at home,\" he replied. \"You're room's really dirty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx laughed a little. \"Well, it was clean enough yesterday, and it's not even my room. Anyway, where's your home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNebula thought for a moment. Then another moment. As Nyx waited patiently, he eventually replied, \"I'unno!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx groaned. Okay, so the kid was too young to have memorized his address. \"Well, how about your parents? What are their names?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, while his answer came much more easily this time, it wasn't any more informative. \"Mommy,\" he told her with a bright smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx sweatdropped a little. \"I see... okay, well, do you know your daddy's name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, your daddy. What's your <i>father's</i> name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx facehoofed. \"Okay, this is the wrong line of questions, I guess.\" She thought for a second, then leaned down to ask Nebula, \"Alright, Nebula, did your parents ever tell you what to do if you got lost?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis proved more fruitful as he thought back and recited, \"They told me t' go stwaight to the libary!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx sighed in relief. \"Well, that's convenient! Tell you what, why don't I help you get back there, and then we can find your parents?\" He nodded cheerfully as she lowered her body, offering her back. She couldn't help but giggle a little as he climbed up and clung to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she felt he was secure, Nyx smiled and started trotting out of the castle, getting back onto the path to Ponyville. She always had fun playing with kids, and got along well with the younger Cutie Mark Crusaders, but she'd never met a colt or filly that was so calm and cheerful about waking up in a strange place before. He was so at ease, it was utterly disarming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they approached the outskirts of Ponyville...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As they got back into town, Nyx just made a few brief pauses along the way to ask ponies she met if they recognized the foal of her back, but none of them could say they'd ever seen the little blue unicorn. After thanking the fifth pony she asked, Nebula's stomach started growling against her back, causing her to say, \"Oops, are you getting hungry?\" When he nodded, she smiled at him. \"Well, let's fix that. We can make a quick stop at Sugarcube Corner before we get to the library. I'm sure Pinkie Pie'll like to meet... of course, why didn't I think of that? Pinkie knows everypony, so she's bound to know your parents!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNebula smiled cheerfully and exclaimed, \"Yay, cupcakes!\" Nyx couldn't help but giggle as she changed direction slightly, trotting down the road toward the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, they entered and were surrounded by the smell of sugary treats. They had showed up before the usual lunch rush, so Pinkie Pie was able to break away from the couple of customers who were already there to come greet them. \"Hi, Nyx! I didn't know you were a foalsitter. Is that what you've been doing up at the castle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNebula waved with a cheerful, \"Hi, Pinkie,\" while Nyx laughed and replied, \"Oh, not exactly. The little guy was lost, so I'm trying to find his house. He got hungry along the way, so I thought I'd stop by here. You wouldn't happen to know where he lives, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie stroked her chin as she looked Nebula over, making several contorted 'concentration' faces that made Nebula giggle as he tried to imitate them. \"Hmmm, nope! They must not live in Ponyville, because I'd recognize him if he were from around here.\" Suddenly, the pink pony let out a horrified gasp! \"Oh my gosh! That means his parents are probably here in town, searching for their beloved foal... and <i>I haven't thrown them a welcome party yet</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNebula gasped at that, clearly sensing the terrible ramifications of this. Nyx chuckled nervously and replied, \"Uh... Pinkie, before you go off to do that, can we get a couple of cupcakes for the road? He said his parents told him to go to the library if he got lost, so I'm going to take him there and see if they show up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Yes, perfect!\" Pinkie Pie said with enthusiastic focus. \"We'll make it a 'Welcome to Ponyville and here's your son back' party! Here, try these, I made them just ten minutes ago!\" With that, she offered Nyx and Nebula a couple of heavily-frosted cupcakes before pulling out a notepad to start furiously scribbling out plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-heh... thanks, Pinkie,\" Nyx said, leaving a few bits on the counter to pay for them as she left, floating her own cupcake in front of her to take dainty bits as she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNebula wasn't so well-mannered, instead gleefully scarfing the cupcake and getting crumbs and frosting all over his face. After a few bites, he licked the remnants from his lips and made a happy, contented sound... but then the sugar rush started to kick in, and he hopped off of Nyx's back to start bouncing around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Nyx, thank you thank you thank you, Nyx!\" he exclaimed, hopping about as his horn started to glow. Each hop grew higher as his magic enhanced the lift he got, amusing Nyx at first before she started to get disturbed by just how much air he was getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm glad you enjoyed it, but don't go too high! I don't want you to hurt yourself,\" she cautioned, concerned that he might take a bad fall. When he refused to listen to her, though, she then tried to snatch him out of the air with a cushion of her own magic. Even then, though, the giggling unicorn's magic field tried to get him to bounce out of it, forcing her to quickly wrap hers around him completely like a bubble so that he wouldn't squirm out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis normally would have worked, but as she held him in place, the 'bubble' surrounding Nebula started vibrating, building up what felt like a tremendous amount of energy before the baby unicorn suddenly burst free, letting out a gleeful squeal as he rocketed down the street!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx's eyes bugged out in surprise, but she quickly spread her wings and took flight after him as he bounced around like a pinball! Nyx winced whenever he ricocheted off of something, but he seemed to be safely cushioned by his own personal field of magic, and as she gave chase, the greatest danger seemed to be to the town as she had to quickly react to keep the destruction down to a minimum, or to protect ponies in danger of being hit with debris. As such, she wasn't able to catch up with him until his trip came to a sudden, crashing end, making her clench her teeth with worry until she heard his delighted laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she knew there was going to be problems, seeing as how he'd managed to smash into...</span></div></div>",

The azure mare's eyes bugged out as she witnessed the remains of her wagon. \"Wh-wh-what has happened here?! Who <i>dares</i> to destroy the Great and Powerful Trixie's property?!\" Glancing around, the unicorn's eyes landed on Nyx. \"<i>You!</i> You vile black fiend!

Still, she wasn't currently on her back trying to recover her breath from a colt thinking he was a cannonball.

Is this... your Mommy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uh-huh!\" Nebula chirped, continuing to nuzzle against the increasingly uncomfortable showmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx turned her attention to Trixie. \"Well.

I hope you appreciate the sacrifice I'm making to my dignity here, Nightmare Moon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Trixie found herself on the receiving end of a draconic-eyed glare. \"For the record, my name is Nyx, not Nightmare Moon. I've put that life behind me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Trixie gulped, but rallied her courage. \"Trixie recalls that you stole her hat and cloak after thoroughly humiliating her in front of the whole town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx paused, then chuckled. \"Ah, right, I forgot about that.\" Reaching deep into her astral mane, Nyx produced the two items in question. \"Thanks for reminding me, I'd forgotten these were still in there.\" She set the hat on Trixie's head, and lifted Nebula up so she could tie the cape in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Trixie was shocked. \"Why... why would you return these?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx smiled wanly. \"As a show of good faith that I'm not who I used to be.\" With that, she trotted off towards the library, a still dumbfounded Trixie following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The two mares plus one colt made it to the library without further incident, and Nyx opened the door. \"Hey, Mom! Got a bit of a mystery for you to solve!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"A mystery?\" Twilight's head poked out from a pile of books. \"What sort of mystery?\" She trotted over, but paused as she saw Trixie. \"Uh, is Trixie part of the mystery?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That would be correct, Twilight Sparkle,\" sniffed the showmare. \"You see this colt here?\" She turned to the side slightly, so Twilight could see the colt that was now lightly dozing on Trixie's back. \"He apparently thinks Trixie is his mother, which is impossible because Trixie has never been with a stallion in such an intimate manner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Really?\" Twilight blinked. \"Huh.

Suddenly, he smiled widely, and pounced on the lavender unicorn. \"Mommy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0If Trixie and Nyx had been confused before, it was nothing on what they felt now. The two glanced at each other, then at Nebula, then at the thoroughly gobsmacked expression on Twilight's face. Nyx began to rub the side of her head with a hoof. \"Ugh, it's not even Tuesday...\" she moaned.</span></div></div>",

Twilight Sparkle is the mother, so you will be hearing from Trixie's attorney about the damages to her livelihood!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a haughty sniff, the showmare turned her nose up and started to make her way to the door, only to be interrupted by Nebula asking, \"Where's mommy going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie stumbled and sputtered as she turned back around. \"You just said <i>Twilight</i> was your mother! Make up your mind, you little-!\" She cut herself off, though, when the little unicorn started looking at her with wide eyes, lip quivering as he reached out toward her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx blinked and looked back and forth between Trixie on one side, Nebula and Twilight on the other. She then spoke up and said, \"Okay, this is getting so much weirder... Trixie, I've been living here for years, so I'd know if mom had gotten pregnant. It's as impossible for her as you say it is for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As 'Trixie says' it is?\" the showmare asked, narrowing her eyes at Nyx. \"Perhaps you two haven't had your fill of humiliating Trixie, and set this all up to further damage the Great and Powerful Trixie's reputation by painting her as a deadbeat mother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No! That doesn't even make sense,\" Twilight protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie turned her attention back to Twilight, pointing an accusing hoof at her. \"Don't try to deny it, Twilight Sparkle! You and your friends have always had it out for Trixie! Heckling my show...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, they were pretty vocal about their opinions, I'll grant you, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luring an Ursa Minor to make you look good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that was those two doofus fans of yours trying to make <i>you</i> look...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calling on the Great and Powerful Trixie to save Equestria from eternal night...\" She gave Nyx a quick glare. \"Setting it up so she would fail so that she could be mocked and humiliated all over again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx interjected, \"Look, I really am sorry about that. I was going through a lot of stuff at the time, and besides, they really thought it would work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie stomped her hoof down and asked, \"Then <i>why</i> are you doing this to Trixie?! Twilight Sparkle, you are nothing but a-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trixie, <i>stop</i>!\" Twilight held onto Nebula, who was right on the edge of bursting into tears from watching the unicorns argue. \"Look, there's no conspiracy against you, and a really simple way to settle this. I happened to read about a spell a while ago for this sort of thing. It's used in courts of law to settle inheritance disputes, so will that work for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie glared at Twilight, but then looked at Nebula and sighed. \"Fine, but only if Trixie gets to see this spell first! The Great and Powerful Trixie will not allow for any funny business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trixie will cast the spell again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight shook her head in confusion. \"Trixie, we cast it six times now. The results are... kinda clear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trixie said she will cast the spell again,\" the azure unicorn snapped, with a strain of desperation in her voice. \"Or better, Trixie will find another spell, because this one is obviously faulty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight groaned. \"No, it's from the textbook used by Forensic Magic experts throughout Equestria, so it isn't the spell. And we've all been doing it perfectly.\" Between them, Twilight, Trixie and Nyx had all tried casting it, always with the exact same results. \"Somehow, Trixie... you and I... have a son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long, uncomfortable moment of silence, Trixie started to weakly stagger toward the door. \"The Great and Powerful Trixie... needs to lie down...\" Nyx and Twilight made no effort to stop her, but she stopped herself before reaching the door. With a bitter chuckle, she muttered, \"But of course, Trixie's bed was smashed to pieces, along with the rest of her worldly possessions...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight walked over to her and put a hoof on her shoulder. \"Look, I know we've clashed in the past, but you could stay here for the time being.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe showmare replied, \"Trixie doesn't need your pity...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not offering out of pity.\" She looked over at Nebula, who had fallen back to sleep. \"For whatever reason, even without the spell, he identifies us both as his mothers. If you're gone, he'll probably be really scared. You saw how he got when we were arguing. Imagine waking up and suddenly finding one of your parents is gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie joined Twilight in looking at Nebula before letting out a heavy sigh. \"Fine... Trixie will accept your hospitality...\" she relented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight nodded and guided her to the bedrooms. Passing Nyx, she asked, \"Nyx, why don't you see about getting Applejack to let Applebloom help salvage what you can from her wagon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx nodded. \"Sure thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading out the door, she took wing just as Spike walked in the door with a big bag of groceries. Not seeing past it, the baby dragon snickered and said, \"Hey, Twilight! When I was in town, I saw that showboating blowhard Trixie's wagon! It looked like it got hit by another Ursa. Can you believe, that obnoxious attention-horse even bothered showing up in Ponyville a... ahh...\" As he talked, Spike had set the groceries down and started sorting through them. Looking to Twilight, he also happened to notice the other unicorn, who looked as though she were trying to burn a hole through his head with sheer force of will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight groaned and said, \"Spike, Trixie is going to be our <i>guest</i> for a little while, so please treat her like one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike gulped. \"Oooookaaaaay. Hiiii, Trixie...\" he replied. He forced a smile and gave her a little wave. Trixie didn't reply, but turned and let Twilight lead her back to the living spaces. Not before shooting him another dirty look, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft alone in the room, Spike shivered. \"Yeesh... what happened here?\" Then he blinked and noticed something else. \"And why is there a foal here?!\"</span></div></div>",

Belle...\" she trailed off, remembering that her two best friends had set off that very morning for places beyond Ponyville.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx trotted over, and nuzzled her friend. \"Don't worry, Applebloom. Twilight and I have solved that mystery... sort of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sort of?\" both earth ponies chorused. Pinkie Pie continued. \"How can you 'sort of' solve a mystery? That's like saying you're 'sort of' awake, even though if you're not awake, you're asleep, and - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"<i>Pinkie Pie!</i>\" barked Nyx, cutting the party pony off before she could really get going. \"What I mean is that the answer we've got only raised more questions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Like what?\" the repair-pony asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx hesitated, then glanced around. \"I'll tell you two, but only if you Pinkie Promise you won't say a word to anypony else except me, Twilight, and Trixie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What does Trixie have to do with this?\" an annoyed Applebloom asked, having heard stories about the showmare from Applejack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Pinkie Promise and I'll explain,\" Nyx repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Both earth ponies glanced at each other, then back at Nyx, and nodded. \"Cross my heart, hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye!\" they said as one, going through the motions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx sighed. \"Okay, here's the deal,\" she said in a low tone. \"Nebula crashed into Trixie's wagon, right? Totally demolished it, as you can see. Trixie comes along, and she's not happy about this. She begins to rail into me about destroying her property, seeing as I was once Nightmare Moon and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sounds like Trixie's just got a buncha sour apples from her past visits,\" Applebloom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx nodded. \"Well, here's the thing. The moment Nebula pops out of the wreck, he sees Trixie, and just like that, he's slammed into her, and calling her 'Mommy'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wow. Trixie is Nebula's mommy?\" Pinkie said with surprise. \"Who'da thunk? I mean, Trixie's pretty good-looking, I guess, but not really my style.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx decided not to comment. \"Oh, but it gets better. Trixie claims she's never had a foal, or even a coltfriend. Seeing as this is a bit of a mystery, I decide to take her and Nebula to the library. Lo and behold, when Nebula sees Twilight, he tackles <i>her</i>, calling her 'Mommy'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Applebloom blinked. \"Waitaminute. A foal can't have two mommies. It ain't possible. I remember that lesson with Cheerilee.\" Her face reddened under her coat, and she looked away. \"And ah still wish ah could get the image of mah brother and her outta mah head...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You and me both,\" muttered Nyx. \"So getting back to the point, Twilight shows us this spell that's supposed to determine a pony's parents. And, to our utter shock, it seems that both Twilight and Trixie are Nebula's parents. We cast the spell six times, twice from each of us, just to make sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Both earth ponies looked dumbfounded. Then Pinkie cheered right up. \"Well, if that's the case, then I need to make sure the party's ready for Trixie and Twilight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Applebloom looked at Pinkie as if she'd grown a second head. \"Ya can't be serious, Pinkie. Twilight's just found out she apparently had a kid, with another mare, with <i>Trixie</i> of all ponies! The last thing they need right now is a party!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But... but parties make everypony feel better!\" Pinkie said with surprise plain on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx sighed. \"Pinkie, remember, you Pinkie Promised not to tell anypony about this. A party would tell EVERYpony about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pinkie looked like she was twitching a little, but then she sighed. \"You're right. We can't have a party for everypony.\" Then she perked up. \"We just need a party for Trixie, Twilight, and the rest of our friends!\" Seeing Nyx raise a hoof to object, Pinkie continued on. \"They're going to find out anyway, somehow, so we might as well get it over with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx blinked, then sighed. \"Point taken,\" she said. \"Let's get these things back to the library so Trixie won't complain... too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah'll get Big Macintosh ta bring the pieces of the wagon back ta the Acres when he's done with his chores fer today,\" Applebloom said. \"Meantime, ah'll take the bed pieces an' get ta work on those.\" She piled the bed pieces into a wagon, and set off for the Acres, while Nyx levitated the books and alchemy lab remnants and flew back to the library.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Nyx returned to the library with Trixie's books, she found Twilight busily researching while Spike fetched whatever books she asked for. The unicorn was so deeply focused on her reading that she didn't even notice Nyx's arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... no... <i>definitely</i> no...\" she muttered as she flipped through the pages. \"Arrgh, it just doesn't make any <i>sense</i>...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx set the books down as she walked up and asked, \"No luck so far?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight jumped a little, then sighed and shook her head. \"No, there are a few spells that could conceivably help two mares have a child, but every single one I've found so far is ruled out.\" She blushed and shut the book she was reading. \"Mostly because I would definitely remember being present for it. So, were you able to save anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx nodded and glanced over what she had brought from Trixie's trailer. \"Applebloom took what she could, and it sounded like she'd be able to fix it up. These were all fine, but it looked like she had some alchemy equipment that got smashed up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, probably how she makes fireworks for her show,\" Twilight mused. \"Now if only I could make sense of this. I mean, maybe the genealogy spell got a false positive, like instead of me one of the parents was a close relative...\" She trailed off, then shook her head firmly. \"No! No, that's even <i>more</i> impossible. Ugh, I'm not thinking straight. So, what kind of books does she have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx floated the books up one by one to look them over. \"Looks like a couple of spellbooks... some plays... Huh, this one's bookmarked.\" She flipped it open and raised an eyebrow. \"What's 'Vaenia?'\" When Twilight shrugged, she set it down and picked up the last one. \"Oh, and it looks like this one was something she was writing. 'How the Great &amp; Powerful Trixie Defeated the Lupus Major.' Yikes, did that actually happen? Those things are killers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike came up and rolled his eyes. \"Yeesh, she never learns. That's how the whole Ursa Minor thing got started. Anyway, why don't we take a lunch break? You'll probably be able to think more clearly when you aren't hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx blinked and exclaimed, \"Cupcakes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... actually, I was thinking more celery soup, but sure,\" Spike replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, not cupcakes for us,\" Nyx explained. \"When Nebula was hungry, I offered to take him to Sugarcube Corner. He said 'Yay! Cupcakes!'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight asked, \"So? That's what they sell there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I never said they did,\" Nyx told them. \"I didn't say anything about cupcakes at all. And Pinkie Pie didn't recognize him, so obviously he'd never been there before. Oh, by the way... she's kind of determined to throw you a party, Twilight. Bloom and I couldn't talk her out of it, but we did get her to limit it to just your close friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight sweatdropped. \"Well, thanks for trying, Nyx.\" She then stopped herself as the pieces suddenly fell into place. \"Wait... of course! That makes the most sense out of anything! Nebula remembers me and Trixie as his parents because we are! And we don't remember him because we're not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx and Spike looked at each other, then looked back at Twilight. \"Uh... you said that makes the <i>most</i> sense? Mind telling us how?\" the baby dragon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A parallel timeline,\" Twilight explained. \"Another Equestria that's similar to ours, but fundamentally different in some ways because of events that happened differently or ponies making different decisions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... you and Trixie getting together would sure be one heck of a different decision,\" Spike replied. When Twilight gave him an exasperated look, he said, \"I'll get lunch started...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he went off to the kitchen, Nyx asked, \"So, this timeline thing might explain how he got here, but if that's the case, how do we send him back home? How would we even find the world he came from, for that matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight winced. \"Well, that's going to going to take a lot of work to figure out. I mean, parallel timelines are just a theory for the most part, but at least it gives us a starting point. And if his mother and I are anything alike, she's probably turning her own world upside-down to find him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx chuckled at that. \"Well, that's certainly true. I suppose I'll go help Spike make lunch, then. We'll tackle this after we've eaten.\"</span></div></div>",

The most prominent was the young colt currently snuggled up against her. Despite her protests, she couldn't help but smile when she looked at him. \"You are an enigma, little one. How did Trixie become a mother without knowing?\" She sighed again, and nuzzled him. \"Well, no matter what, Trixie can't blame one so young.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The napping colt was woken up by the nuzzling. He yawned, and smiled at her, though it faded when he saw her sad look. \"Mommy? Why are you sad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Trixie offered a small smile. \"Tr-<i>Mommy</i> was just thinking about sad things, little one. It isn't nice, but sometimes it can't be helped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nebula smiled back. \"Don't wowwy. If you're sad, I'm sure Papa and Big Sis Nyx can cheer you up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Trixie smiled, then paused. \"Wait... 'Big Sis Nyx'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nebula nodded. \"Uh-huh! She's weally cool! She always plays with me! She and Big Sis Midnight are really awesome! Auntie Wainbow says so!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Trixie slowly nodded. \"Of course they are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nebula giggled, then looked around. \"Where's Gwannie Hazel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The question nearly stopped Trixie's heart. She hadn't heard that name in years, not since... \"Um, she's... on a vacation. She'll be back soon, little one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, okay,\" Nebula said through a yawn. \"I'mma go back to bed now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When she was certain that the colt was asleep, Trixie carefully slipped out from the bed, making sure not to disturb him. She silently opened the door, tip-hoofing through before closing it just as silently. She trotted down the stairs to see Twilight flipping through a few books. \"Any luck, Twilight Sparkle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Looking up, Twilight sighed. \"Well, a little. I've determined that Nebula is, in fact, from a parallel timeline, not this one. Hence, the reason neither of us can remember being his parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Trixie blinked, then let out a relieved chuckle. \"Oh, thank Celestia! Trixie thought she might be going insane!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"If you're talking about the whole 'two mares having a foal' thing...\" Twilight began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, no, this is something different,\" Trixie explained. \"You see, Trixie spoke to young Nebula just now. Some of what he said confused me. For example, he called your adoptive daughter 'Big Sis Nyx'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wait, he knows me?\" Nyx asked, coming back in from the kitchen with a tray of sandwiches. \"But he didn't seem to when I found him up at the castle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Search Trixie,\" the showmare said with a shrug. \"He mentioned some other ponies, like a 'Big Sis Midnight' and 'Auntie Rainbow'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight blinked. \"Well Rainbow can only refer to Rainbow Dash. I believe you zapped her with a lightning bolt during that first show here in Ponyville?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Trixie had the good grace to look sheepish. \"Yes, well... There was one last thing that bothered Trixie. He mentioned... my mother, Hazel Lulamoon.\" She spat out the last two words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight and Nyx exchanged glances, though it was Spike who broke the silence. \"Not on good terms with your mom, I take it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Let Trixie put it this way; if the way Hazel raised Trixie is an example of good parenting, Nightmare Moon would have won an award for 'best parent ever',\" the showmare said venomously. Then she blinked and looked at Nyx. \"Er, no offense meant...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx sighed. \"None taken. So why did him mentioning her bother you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Trixie hesitated. \"The way he mentioned her... he called her 'Grannie Hazel'. That implies that she's a part of his life, beyond stories on Trixie's part. Which means, logically, that she's a part of <i>Trixie's</i> life as well. Trixie feels... conflicted about knowing there may be a timeline where Trixie made up with her mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight looked at Trixie with a degree of concern. \"Trixie... do you want to try to reconnect with your mother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Trixie looked startled for a moment, then slumped. \"Trixie... does not think that such an endeavor will succeed... but yes, part of her wants to see her mother again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx spoke up. \"Where does your mother live?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Out in Whitetail Woods,\" replied Trixie. \"It's an old wooden house with a thatched straw roof. It's the only building in that part of the woods for miles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx nodded, and trotted to the door. \"I'll be back in time for the party if I can't find her,\" she promised Twilight, before flying out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Trixie blinked, then looked at a nervous-looking Twilight. \"What did she mean, 'party'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well...\" Twilight began, knowing that the showmare would likely react poorly.</span></div></div>",

It unnerved Nyx slightly, but not as much as the green mare who was currently muttering under her breath about 'ungrateful whelps'. \"Um, is now a bad time, Ms. Lulamoon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hazel snorted. \"No, no, I'm perfectly happy to be told that my attention horse of a daughter is back in the same town where her fame went up in smoke. I told her she should never have become a showmare!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wait, you did?\" Nyx asked with a blink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes, I did!\" snarled Hazel. Nyx was beginning to think the mare was perpetually angry. \"I told her that no daughter of mine would be a show-boating showmare! But she ran away from home to do exactly that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I see...\" Nyx said slowly. \"Have you never tried to contact her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"She traveled a lot,\" Hazel replied. \"It was hard to try to get in touch with her. But even if that wasn't the case, she made it clear that she has no intention of listening to me. The only reason I keep tabs on her is to make sure I get a grandfoal one day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uh-huh,\" Nyx said skeptically. \"If you were really concerned about getting to know your grandfoal, perhaps you would have tried reaching out to Trixie sooner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, I won't worry about that. When she does have a grandfoal, I'll make sure that it's raised properly, to make up for my failure with Trixie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That sentence chilled Nyx. \"What are you saying...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Do I have to spell it out?\" Hazel said acerbically. \"When Trixie has a foal, I'm going to take it, and raise it as my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx stared at the mare. \"Now I see why Trixie wasn't eager to talk about you. She never mentioned you were insane!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hazel chuckled darkly. \"Insanity and genius are often mistaken for each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"There's nothing 'genius' about your plan! Hay, you told <i>me</i> everything! What makes you think I'm not going to report you to the princesses?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Simple. You're not going to leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx blinked, realizing belatedly that Hazel's horn was glowing a blood red. Before the alicorn could react, she felt a sting in her rump. Looking back, she saw a dart sticking out of her cutie mark. With a chill running down her spine, Nyx tried to run, but her legs were already unsteady. The tranquilizer in the dart was powerful. With a groan, she fell over, fighting to keep herself awake. It was a fight she lost, and the last thing she saw was the evil, grinning face of Hazel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx's head was pounding when she woke up. Groaning, she raised a hoof to massage her temples. As she did, however, she felt something distinctly out-of-place. Opening her eyes, she was shocked to see...</span></div></div>",

It wasn't so much the outfit itself, but rather the stereotype that went with it that was causing her embarassment. Prench maids were said to be rather... naughty, at times. Nyx grumbled, and went to remove the outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Stop.\" It was a single word, and should have been easily ignored. But Nyx found her attempt to remove the outfit stymied, as her body stopped responding to her brain. Unable to move anything save her eyes, she focused on the source of the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hazel Lulamoon stood there, a wicked smirk on her face. \"Wondering what's going on, by chance? It's a special brew of mine. It makes your body completely subserviant to my orders. When I ordered you to stop, your body interpreted that as a sign to cease all non-vital activities, such as moving.\" She circled the helpless alicorn. \"Now, since you're completely under my control, let me ask you: What prompted this visit? Why did Trixie send you to me? Answer me truthfully, and leave nothing out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Against her will, Nyx found herself relating the story; how she had found Nebula in the old castle, how she had met Trixie and revealed Nebula's heritage, and the party which had partially prompted this visit. Nyx said everything in a dull monotone, a mark of how unwilling she was to relate anything to this mare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When she was finished, Hazel paced around her, a frown on her face. \"So... this foal from another timeline bears Trixie's blood, as well as your adoptive mother's? How interesting... and disgusting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx couldn't speak, but nonetheless arched an eyebrow at the potionmaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Seeing the expression, Hazel elaborated on her statement. \"The fact that this 'Nebula' was conceived from two mares indicates that magic was involved somehow. And using magic to conceive a foal is absolutely disgusting. The fact that it's from another timeline matters not; this abomination will not live, not so long as I'm around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx felt a chill go through her, even as Hazel continued speaking. \"So, here's what will happen, my pet. You will return to this 'party', and inform those in attendance that I was unable to make it. When the party is over, and everypony is asleep, you will take that foal, and bring it back to me. While you're doing all of that, I will prepare a potion to dissolute that creature spawned of magic back into its base components.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The chill was now an icy claw of dread that held Nyx's heart in a vice-like grip. But Hazel still had more to say. \"Oh, yes, and just to be sure, you will not speak of this to anypony. You will not even so much as emote that something is wrong. You will act as you normally would.\" Hazel trotted off, then stopped. \"You will depart now, but leave the outfit here. No need to raise questions. And if you get caught, or somepony tries to stop you...\" She leaned in deadly close. \"Use deadly force to get that abomination here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The mad brewmistress left the room, even as Nyx removed the maid's outfit mechanically. Thanks to Hazel's orders, her face was perfectly calm. But inside, her mind was racing. <i>How am I supposed to save Nebula?! What can I do?!</i> Her body was moving on its own, leaving the house and flying back toward Ponyville. <i>I can't give up! I can't just let that witch kill an innocent foal! But... what can I do...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx's mind was in turmoil, even as her calm expression never faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Trixie eyed the decorations nervously. \"Well, Pinkie Pie, Trixie admits she was worried this would be too loud. But this decor is actually rather tasteful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pinkie shrugged, not losing her smile. \"Nyx told me you'd like this to be somewhat low-key, so I decided to tone down on my usual stuff. The other girls should be here soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Trixie gave Pinkie a gimlet gaze. \"And why, pray tell, did you feel this whole party was necessary?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pinkie shrugged again. \"Mostly because Twilight, me, and the rest of the girls are the bestest of best friends, and something like this couldn't stay secret forever, so might as well get it out of the way now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Trixie had to admit, there was some logic in the party pony's statement. \"Fair enough, Trixie supposes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight trotted up to the two of them. \"Trixie, are you nervous about meeting your mother again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Trixie winced. \"Trixie is... uncertain, whether her mother will even accept the invitation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Why?\" Pinkie asked, cocking her head. \"Is she a big meanie grumpy-pants who doesn't want to see her daughter's alternate-timeline lesbian-self's foal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was dead silence for a few seconds. \"Well... partly, yes,\" Trixie finally said. \"But we parted on bad terms. Hazel didn't want Trixie to become a showmare, whereas it was what Trixie always dreamed of doing.\" She frowned. \"Trixie received her hat and cloak anonymously, and with them was a note: 'Follow your Dreams'. So Trixie left Hazel's home, and has been on the road as a showmare ever since.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Aw...\" Pinkie grabbed the azure unicorn in a tight hug. \"Don't worry, Trixie! You'll be safe and sound here in Ponyville!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At that moment, the door to the library opened, and Nyx walked in. Something everypony noticed was that she was alone. \"Did you find Hazel, Nyx?\" Twilight asked, trotting over to the alicorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx nodded. \"I did, but she declined the invitation. Sorry, Trixie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Trixie waved it off. \"Don't worry about it, Trixie knew this was a likely possibility. And, honestly, Trixie is relieved. Trixie had no idea what she would say to Hazel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx nodded. \"So, the party's starting soon, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"As soon as the rest of the girls get here!\" Pinkie affirmed.</span></div></div>",

Those members of the Bearers of Harmony who hadn't been told about Nebula yet were informed, to varying reactions. Fluttershy thought it was sweet of Twilight and Trixie to try to care for him, despite not truly being his parents. Rarity was of like mind, and was mentally planning an outfit that would suit the young colt better. Rainbow found the situation hilarious, to the point where she'd literally fallen out of the air due to laughing so hard. Applejack was dumbfounded, but she eventually accepted what she'd been told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So, what exactly have you been up to since the Alicorn Amulet fiasco?\" Rarity asked Trixie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Trixie sighed. \"Truth be told, Trixie has been working on rebuilding her image. She realizes now that the Alicorn Amulet fiasco was little more than a temper tantrum mixed with an ego trip. Trixie did some soul searching, and did not like what she saw. So, Trixie decided to start over from the ground up.\" She sighed again, glancing at Nebula, who was playing 'Pin the Tail on the Pony' with Pinkie. \"And it was going well, until a blue cannonball disguised as a colt crashed into my wagon, destroying nearly everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Don't be too hard on the little guy,\" Rainbow said, giving Trixie a small glare. Of the six friends, Rainbow was the one who had the hardest time letting go of grudges. \"I mean, he's just a kid, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Trixie is well aware of that,\" the azure unicorn retorted, meeting Rainbow's gaze. \"Trixie is just saying that this mishap is going to cause problems. She was scheduled to perform on a Manehattan stage tomorrow, but with her wagon and most of her supplies destroyed, Trixie may have to cancel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Manehattan?\" Applejack asked with a quirked eyebrow. \"Fancy that. How'd you wrangle that kind of deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The magician smirked. \"Trixie has her ways...\" She sighed. \"But without a means of getting there, and without supplies...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx came over, smiling. \"Don't worry, Trixie, I'm sure everything will turn out okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Applejack looked over at the alicorn. \"Say, Nyx, you alright? You've been kinda quiet all night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm fine,\" Nyx assured the farmer. \"Just a little tired from flying all the way out to Whitetail Wood and back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What were you doing out there, darling?\" Rarity asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"She was searching for Trixie's mother, Hazel Lulamoon, to invite her to the party,\" Trixie explained. \"An invitation which was declined.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Declined? Whatever for?\" Rarity blinked at the admission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Trixie parted ways with her mother on bad terms,\" Trixie sighed; perhaps she should work a story of how she left into her routine? Maybe then she wouldn't have to repeat herself so much. \"Trixie hasn't thought much about Hazel for a while, but Nebula...\" She looked at the colt, who had placed the tail a good foot away from the mark. \"Nebula mentioned 'Grannie Hazel' at one point, meaning that, at least in his world, Hazel is an active part of his life. Trixie decided it would be worth reaching out to her mother about this. But, old wounds and all that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah getcha,\" Applejack nodded. She looked back at Nyx. \"Ya sure yer okay, sugarcube? Ah mean, ah'd think a li'l flight like that wouldn't be an issue for ya, seein' as yer an alicorn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"AJ, keep in mind that Nyx hasn't got all her awesome alicorn powers back yet,\" Rainbow reminded the earth pony. \"And Whitetail Woods might not be too far away, but it is pretty big, and depending on how long it took her to find Hazel's place, a round trip from there could be tiring, even for a pony like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Trixie nodded. \"She was gone for some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Applejack nodded. Still, something was nagging at her. She couldn't explain why, but she felt that there was something off about Nyx.</span></div></div>",

She had a green coat and lustrous mane, her cutie mark bearing the image of a cauldron with a wisp of steam above it in the shape of a heart. \"And please, call me Hazel. It's actually MS. Lulamoon, anyway, as I never did marry. Oh, but I'm sure you didn't come all this way to hear me prattle on about myself. And I know who you are, Ms. Nyx. There's only one reason a mare of your age would come this far out into the middle of nowhere... There's a certain special somepony who's eye you want to catch, and you heard that old Hazel Lulamoon could give you an advantage in that arena.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Nyx would have called her 'old' anything. Nyx had been 'born' as a pre-adolescent, and been adopted by Twilight who was still rather young, herself. As a result, there wasn't much difference between their apparent ages. Hazel, despite being Trixie's biological mother, would have easily been able to pass for the showmare's older sister, and not by much. While Nyx was distracted by such comparisons, Hazel practically pulled her inside as she talked, then gave the alicorn a sly wink. \"Well, I can tell you, dear, that you heard absolutely right. Why don't you come inside, I'll put on some tea, and you can tell me all about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually... you see, I... umm, okay,\" Nyx stammered, swept up in a sort of conversational tide that kept her from forming a complete sentence. Before she knew it, she was sitting down in what looked like the cabin's study, a nearby fireplace keeping the room warm and cozy. Before Nyx could say anything about why she was actually there, Hazel was already heading to the kitchen, assuring her she would only take a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft alone for the moment, Nyx looked around, particularly at the selection of books Hazel kept. Books on herbology and gardening, potion recipes, and several shelves worth of romance novels and self-help books like '<i>How You Know He's a Keeper</i>' or '<i>50 Tricks to Get The Stallion of Your Dreams</i>'. Surprisingly harmless stuff, considering the impression Trixie had given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go, I hope you like cinnamon tea,\" Hazel said, coming back into the room with a tea service floating above her head. Sitting down across from Nyx, she set the tea down on a small table between them and started pouring. \"Now then, why don't you tell me about this pony who makes your heart flutter? And don't be afraid to share anything. Even a mare who happens to be a beautiful celebrity can be turned into a silly filly when that special somepony touches her heart, and that's why I'll do whatever it takes to ensure that you find happiness in the joy that is love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the teacup in front of her was filled, Nyx picked it up with her magic and levitated it in front of her. It was probably just the effort of flying all the way, but simply listening to Hazel was as exhausting as being around Pinkie Pie and Rarity when they were on a roll, combined. However, when she took a delicate sip of the slightly spicy tea, she felt warmth and energy start to return to her. She gave a contented sigh, feeling the hot tea slide down her throat, and while Hazel started to drink her own, she replied, \"Actually, Ms. Lula-... Hazel, it's about your daughter, Trixie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mention of Trixie's name was immediately followed by Hazel's teacup falling to the floor, the cup shattering and spilling its contents. Nyx winced, and started fearing the worst when she saw Hazel's pleasant smile suddenly turn into a thousand-yard stare. \"Trixie? My... Trixie...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she reached out with her magic to scoop up the sharp pieces of china from the floor, Nyx gulped, afraid that she'd flipped some kind of switch in Hazel's brain. Something that shouldn't have been touched upon. \"Umm... yes, it's a complicated story, but things happened and Trixie decided she'd like to resolve whatever issues there were between you in the past. She's in Ponyville right now, if you'd like to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Hazel exclaimed, coming back to the conversation from wherever she had gone a moment ago. \"Of <i>course</i> the answer is yes! Oh, my darling Trixie said that she had given up on love completely after the unpleasantness, but I knew love would find its way back into her life!\" The unicorn hopped down to the floor and reached up to take Nyx's hoof between her own. \"And you don't need to wait until after the wedding. I would be proud if you called me 'mom'. In fact, I <i>insist</i> upon it,\" she said with wide, joy-filled eyes fixed on the utterly stunned teenaged alicorn.</span></div></div>",

I never had one of my own, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Er... actually...\" Nyx began, hoping to clarify things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hazel, however, took her hesitation in completely the wrong manner. \"Wait... I don't see a ring! Oh, you silly goose, that won't do at all! If you're going to do this, you need to do this right! I actually bought a ring for her father, but wouldn't you know it, the deadbeat never came back to me! Ah, well, you can take it, dear!\" With that, she levitated a worn, velvet case to the alicorn, slipping it in her saddlebags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx tried again to reason with the matchmaker. \"I just came to invite you to a party that Trixie's attending, and - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hazel gasped in a manner eerily reminiscent of Pinkie Pie. \"A party?!

Oh, and you'd better have proposed by the time I get there, so we can start on wedding plans!

Pinkie herself had gone to retrieve the other guests, namely the remaining friends of Twilight Sparkle. There was also Nyx to consider, and Hazel, should the mare decide to come. Trixie shuddered a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You okay, Trixie?\" asked Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Trixie is... uncertain about her mother's disposition.

When I reached adolescence, she became somewhat... manic about the idea of having a grandfoal.

If you can show her that you're doing well, maybe she won't worry so much and you'll be able to really connect again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you crazy, mom? That'd never work,\" Nyx protested. \"I don't know how to fake being in love, and even if I could keep it up for an entire evening, I barely even know Trixie! Not to mention all the ways the story could get blown, like... say... <i>Applejack</i>? The Element of Honesty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie sighed softly and rubbed her chin in thought. \"Absolutely right... we'll need to fool her too, somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly,\" Nyx replied before doing a double-take. \"Wait, what? You're actually considering this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's a horrible plan,\" Trixie confirmed with a nod, \"but now that my mother has set her mind on it, she won't be satisfied unless she sees her daughter with someone. So it's either put on a show and soothe her enough that we might actually have a real conversation, or deal with her playing matchmaker all night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight added supportively, \"And you're a great actress, Nyx! Everyone thought you were fantastic in the school play, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was years ago, and I was basically playing myself...\" the alicorn argued, only to be interrupted by Trixie nudging her to the other side of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what, Twilight Sparkle, why don't you go help your snarky little dragon out with the preparations while I give Nyx a bit of coaching? After all, if there is one thing that the Great and Powerful Trixie knows how to do, it is putting on a performance,\" she said, shooing Twilight away. While doing so, she whispered to the alicorn, \"Just play along for now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx blinked, but sighed and resigned herself to it as she said, \"Okay, okay, I'll give it a shot. Don't worry about us, I'll work it out with Trixie here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight smiled and nodded, heading out to the kitchen. Once she was out of earshot, Trixie said, \"Look, Trixie will level with you. I never wanted to have to share this with another pony, but I'm left with no other choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Is it something more embarrassing than what you already said?\" Nyx asked, to which the unicorn groaned and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trixie told you what happened when I tried to introduce her to friends, or even just acquaintances. Because of Hazel's behavior, I had almost no friendships last longer than a few meetings with her. But when Trixie actually fell in love...\" She facehoofed as she confessed, \"Trixie allowed herself to become infatuated with another pony. Once. A teenaged crush. But it was one-sided on Trixie's part, and when Hazel discovered this, she took steps to fix it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx arched an eyebrow. \"Fix it? What, you mean she got even <i>more</i> intense and drove your crush away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie looked back at her with a deadly serious expression. \"Much worse! The very day after Hazel discovered Trixie's infatuation, the one I was in love with immediately began fawning over Trixie like a lovesick puppy!\" When Nyx just tilted her head in confusion, the unicorn filled in the blanks. \"You saw Hazel's cutie mark, didn't you? Don't let her eccentricities fool you, my mother is a potion maker and alchemist almost without equal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx gasped as it suddenly clicked. \"You don't mean... a love potion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe showmare nodded grimly. \"It was the greatest betrayal Trixie ever felt... to be given something so precious, but knowing it was completely artificial... and Trixie has long suspected since then that it is why her father left Hazel before I was born. I had a terrible fight with her, left home to make a life as far away from that place as possible, and gave up on love completely. Thoughts of romance just felt so fake, and after what they did to my mother... Trixie hoped that she might have gotten over her obsessions in our time apart, but apparently not. And now Trixie is afraid of what she'll do if she thinks I haven't found love in all this time. So either we give her what she wants for just one night, or be prepared to watch her every single moment she is here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx winced. She still wasn't sure that she could do a good job of playing along, but at the same time she didn't know if there was a better option after hearing that story. \"Okay, say I do go along with it, how would we convince her you and I are... a couple...? I mean, no offense, but there's a bit of an age difference, not to mention the friction between you and my mom and her friends... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie couldn't help but laugh a bit at that. \"Have you ever <i>read</i> a romance novel? Anything that seems like a hindrance would just make it 'forbidden fruit' and therefore more romantic in her mind. Say... after Trixie's wagon was destroyed, you leaped in to rescue me, and it was love at first sight. Hazel will eat that up.\"</span></div></div>",

She looked at Twilight as the lavender mare busied herself with multiple projects at once, all the while humming softly to herself. Then, she looked at the ring Nyx had shown her, which was sitting on the kitchen table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight,\" Trixie started in a soft, emotional voice,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Trixie,\" Twilight said as she turned to look at the mare. \"What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would... would you marry me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Living as a traveling showmare did not pay much coin, and my hunger for food was only drowned out by the emptiness in my very soul, the gaping wound in my malnourished heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's ears flattened on her head, her nose scrunching up into what was, in Trixie's oinion, a very, <i>very</i> cute frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I wanted to be loved and adored by all my fans, but it wasn't enough; it was never enough for Trixie. I needed new audiences after I had exhausted my meager tricks in Las Pegasus, Baltimare, and Whinniapolis, and I needed them to shower me with more adoration than ever before. So, I did what any good showmare would do. I found a small town that I had not yet visited, and I spun a tale about something great and spectacular that I had done, accompanied by visuals to help sell the story.\" Trixie snorted in derision. \"It mattered not that it was impossible, because everypony knew it was, and knew it was just a tale. Well,\" Trixie said as she rolled her eyes toward Twilight. \"Everypony except the town of Ponyville. Here, I'm taken as a boastful pony. It's show business, that's how you're supposed to act! So, when some of my crowd got uppity, I did the one thing I could: I performed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight reflects on the indignant airs Trixie had been using when her friends were trying to show her up and winced. \"I guess that it's no fun being upstaged at your own show, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no it is not.When I left here the first time, I had nothing but a small bag of twenty bits I'd been able to salvage. From there, I started saving up, starving myself at times to keep more cash than I was spending, so I could get a new stage-home. But that was difficult. Drunken ponies don't make the best of crowds, and they'd usually throw more bottles and lewd comments than bits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie cleared her throat, sniffing almost disdainfully. \"But, that is the price I paid for trying to impress a crowd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight shifted uncomfortably in her seat, her muzzle down low near her teacup. \"...ry,\" Twilight whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie looked up. \"What? I didn't quite catch that, Twilight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight looked into Trixie's eyes, pain in her eyes. \"I'm so sorry, Trixie, I... I tried to tell my friends that what they were doing was mean, but none of them would listen. And Spike kept telling me I should step up, because before you'd come into town, I had been practicing a set of 26 spells; something that I do every other week, with lots of practice before each set. H-he kept telling me to show you up, but I didn't want to, and then the Ursa came, and- and everypony was scared, and I was scared, and I did the only thing I could think of, and do you know how embarrassing that was for me? I've always hated the spotlight. Standing with Princess Celestia at the entrance to the Gala? That's easy, nopony's paying much attention to me. But the week after you left, everypony kept calling me the stagemaster, and I hated it. You'd looked so sad, and hurt when you left, I couldn't believe ponies were blaming everything on you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight took a breath to calm herself, taking a sip of her cold tea before continuing, a heating spell activating itself almost unconsciously. \"It wasn't even your fault, it was those two colts' fault. I don't even think anypony thought to tell them off, and I can't say I did anything about punishing them either.\" Twilight shrinks in her seat, squirming a little under Trixie's gaze. \"I just felt so awful when you ran off like that, that, well...\" She squirmed a little again. \"I... I saved what I could from your cart before Mayor Mare decided to use everything else in the repairing of property.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie was taken aback. Twilight... had saved something? \"What... what did you save of Trixie's?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight got up and walked towards the door that lead to the basement, pausing to look back at Trixie. \"It's... Everything I saved is down here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie got up as Twilight opened the door, and followed her down the stairs. When they got to the basement, Twilight trotted over to a small cabinet, and opened it to reveal a few spell books, and... \"My... that picture, Trixie... I never thought I'd see it again...\" Trixie picked up the old photograph, tears welling in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh, he was... Like a brother to me,\" Trixie fibbed. No need for her to know that story, at least... not now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie sniffed again, rubbing her eyes to clear away the tears before trotting up to Twilight and wrapping her hooves around the other unicorn. \"Th-thank you, Twilight. Trixie... I...\" She couldn't say more, instead just held onto the lavender unicorn for all she was worth, letting out all the frustration and anger that had been pent up inside for too long in a long, shuddering breath. \"Thank you, Twilight. Thank you for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie kept her gaze on Twilight as the other mare turned a bit red, a small smile splaying across her face. \"W-well, I'd... I would definitely like to get to know you better first, but... I do like you, and, um...\" Twilight buries her head in her hooves. \"Gosh, love is too confusing and convoluted! My heart's feeling all fluttery, and, um, oohh... I just... Let's do it, for tonight, okay? And, if... if we can say that we like each other, than let's spend more time together. I'd, um, I'd like that, if it's okay with you?\" Twilight peeked over her hoof, quickly ducking back down as her blush deepened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie just smiled broadly, her own heart soaring, the hole that had been there for too long closing a little. Not much, but it was a start. \"Twilight, Trixie- no, I would l-love that chance. I'll do it, I'll be a good pony, I-I can promise that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight looks up again, hesitantly, before shooting her muzzle forward to give Trixie a small kiss that lasted forever and a second, each of their hearts beating all the quicker as they both gasped, flustered more than ever before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight looked at Trixie again, bashfully, and smiled. \"We can do this. It shouldn't be too hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie pulls Twilight into a hug, sniffling into her mane. \"Yes... I know we can.\"</span></div></div>",

The veiled tiara on her head was no better. In fact, it seemed even worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx stared down at her from the library's balcony, Trixie by her side. \"Is... is she <i>humming</i> the Wedding March?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie nodded morosely. \"Oh, mother... You always wanted everything exactly the way you wanted, but you never could see what was right before your eyes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx saw the wistful look in Trixie's eyes, and went out on a limb. \"Trixie... did you ever meet your father?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie flinched, almost like she'd been hit. \"I... Yes, I have met him. He's the one who bought me my first stagecoach.\" Trixie sighed. \"He was always so kind, but he was so weak a stallion...\" Trixie sniffled. \"Well, I'd best go get ready. I do not know how your mother got her friend to make me a dress. But Trixie will not complain, it looks... beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx smiled, and they went back inside, Nyx descending to help with the last-minute preparations as Trixie went into Twilight's bedroom to slip into her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazel gasped when she saw Trixie not standing with the Alicorn who'd come to visit her, but an absolutely <i>beautiful</i> unicorn mare with a purple coat, and a shimmering silvery-blue gown that had stylized magical swirls at the hem and along the bodice. Trixie was wearing a flowing, floor-length dress that was a lovely lavender, streaks of pink and violet accentuating her figure. All in all, the two of them looked beautiful, and Trixie's mother had no qualms about letting them know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Nebula was introduced as the two's 'adopted' son, Hazel's eyes had blazed with unnatural light, and throughout the night, Nyx and Pinkie played interference. While Trixie and Twilight were dancing together, Hazel slipped something into Twilight's drink, and Nyx had to dump it into a plant to make sure nopony drank it. The plant turned into a stylized green heart. When Trixie saw Twilight heading over to get another glass, she instead offered her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Trixie and Twilight were participating in a breathtakingly beautiful duet, Pinkie 'accidentally' slipped, knocking Twilight off her hooves, the dart that Hazel had shot at Twilight embedding itself into the wall beyond while Trixie jumped forward to catch Twilight in her forelegs, both singing the last words of the song softly as they stared into each other's eyes, before remembering where they were and who was watching, and got back to their hooves and hurried over to do something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was several hours later that Nyx and Pinkie Pie flopped over, exhausted, onto some cushions after Hazel had departed. It was an equally as tired Trixie and Twilight who collapsed onto a third cushion together, Nebula bouncing around them excitedly, talking of how different Granny Hazel had been, but that she was still cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight shifted her position a little bit, her gown rustling against Trixie's as she snuggled up against her. Trixie sighed contentedly, before realizing it was too quiet. She opened her eyes, and Nebula was sitting there, looking at her with innocent. \"Are you gunna make the good shrieks now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash fell to the ground laughing, Pinkie Pie joining her. Trixie and Twilight- after she realized what Nebula was unknowingly insinuating- both developed deep blushes before simultaneously using invisibility spells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spells didn't stop the group from hearing their hooves hitting the stairs, nor the door slam once they reached the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock on the door, and Spike went to answer it. \"Hey, sorry if w're a little loud,\" he said without looking at who it was. \"We were just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Midnight!!!\" Nebula ran up and leaped into an embrace with the unfamiliar mare, who choked out a sob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Nebby, Mom was so worried about you, she and Twilight have been running themselves ragged looking for you. I'm so glad I found you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do you want to be? Which D'aww inducing scene is next? Trixie and Twilight's, or Nebula and Midnight's?</span></div></div>",

Great party, huh? Nothing like a nice, friendly, get-together! Heh heh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite, right, Twilight Sparkle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Twilight.

Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, it was nothing. Your mother sure was... interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie groaned. \"Do not remind me of how she behaved, please! I saw what happened to the plant that Nyx dumped your drink into; it was pure love extract, probably mixed with Heart's Desire and Throbbing Cherry. Ooh, I hate it when she tries to force somepony else to love me, I'd rather they loved me for who I am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight put a leg over Trixie's withers, nuzzling her. \"Don't worry, Trixie, I think you're a great pony. It's not your fault that your mother is the way she is, nor is it your fault that Snips and Snails brought that Ursa Minor to town. Now,\" Twilight started as she got up, her dress slipping off as she started stretching. \"I believe it's time to sleep. You can sleep in my bed, of course, I'll just pull out the guest bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie looked at her, almost indignantly. :Oh, no you don't! I will not let you put yourself out of place in your own bedroom! That would be rude beyond compare!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight shot Trixie a quizzical glance. \"What? It's not rude, I'm the one-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-Who will sleep in her own bed,\" Trixie interrupted with a huff of finality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight, not wanting to argue, groaned and gave up. \"Fine, I'll sleep in my own bed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Trixie will be sleeping in it with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you can sleep with me- hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie giggled as she pulled her own dress off, folding it nicely before trotting over to the other unicorn. \"Oh, don't give me that, Twilight. I don't mean anything sexual by it... yet, I just want to... I just want to know what it's like. I've always been alone, and...\" Twilight nuzzled Trixie reassuringly, giving her a small kiss on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Trixie, I'd li- I mean, I'd love to, uh, gosh, saying 'sleep with you' sounds dirty no matter how I word it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is fine by me, Twilight Sparkle.\" Trixie trotted up to the bed, nudging Twilight along as well. \"I am quite content with cuddling. I-if you want to, I mean.\" Trilxie looked away, and then back again. \"You do want to, r-right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight just giggled and hopped up onto the bed, motioning for Trixie to do the same before pulling the covers over the two of them. \"Of course I want to cuddle,\" Twilight said as she wrapped her forelegs around Trixie. \"I told you before that I wanted us to get closer to each other.\" Twilight puckered her lips, leaning in towards Trixie, who met Twilight's lips with her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, two young unicorn mares felt a warmth and happiness that neither had felt before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, a librarian, who had known the love of a child, and the love of friends, found the love of companionship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, a showmare's heart, mistreated and cold as it had gotten, was warmed by the heart of another, and a flame, strong and true, was sparked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, Midnight came early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright, options:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1: The next morning, Twi and Trix wake to find a young mare named Midnight asleep in the library's main room, with Nebula held in her forelegs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-OR-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2: Midnight tries to take Nebula away, and Trixie, Twilight, and Nyx have to save him!

She got her Cutie Mark due to her skill at magic, you know. She wanted to develop her magic as an entertainer, a showmare. I was originally against it, but it made her happy. However, she always came home from secondary school looking a little down and depressed. Eventually, I asked her what was wrong. She was evasive with her answers, until I casually asked if she had a colt on the mind.\" She smiled fondly. \"Her blush was answer enough for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wait, if Trixie was so skilled with magic, why not send her to Celestia's School?\" Nyx asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Too expensive,\" Hazel replied. \"And even if that weren't the case, they focus more on practical applications of magic, rather than entertainment applications.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx nodded. She'd been by Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns, and knew that they prided themselves on researching new magical ways to make life easier for the common pony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hazel continued. \"Continuing on, Trixie admitted that there was somepony at school she liked, but she wasn't sure how to approach them. I suggested that she ask him out to his face, but she protested, saying it would never work. I eventually gave her a small vial of potion that I told her would increase her courage, and let her ask. She took it, and said she'd consider it.\" The potionsmistress smiled warmly at the memory. \"The next day, Trixie came home looking like she was on Cloud 9. She thanked me, and told me the potion worked, and she now had a date with the colt! I was happy for her, and I helped her get dressed for the date, although she was insistent that I not meet him yet. I understood that; meeting the parents often comes later in a relationship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx smiled as well. \"It sounds like things were working out. So, what went wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hazel's warm smile evaporated, and she looked down. \"A couple of weeks after she started dating, I realized that I needed somepony in my life, too. I decided to go out to a club one night, while Trixie was attending a sleepover at one of her mare friends' place. At the club, I met a rather dashing stallion named Card Sharp. He was a specialist at card games, and he mentioned that he was a teacher of performance magic as well.\" She sighed. \"That alone should have been a red flag.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uh-oh...\" Nyx had a feeling she knew what would be said next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I took Card Sharp home with me, and... well, we were both a little inebriated...\" Hazel was blushing furiously through her coat. \"A-anyway, we ended up in bed together, not that either of us were complaining. But when we woke up, it was to Trixie's gasp of utter shock. Imagine my astonishment when Card looked more embarrassed than I was, telling her 'it's not what it looks like'. Trixie promptly threw him out of the house, then started yelling at me. As it turned out, her crush/coltfriend was Card, who taught at her school. The old schoolfilly/teacher crush/romance. So, seeing him in bed with her mother didn't do wonders for her attitude towards me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I can imagine... So is that why she doesn't like you?\" Nyx wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, no. The true hatred came just after. As it turned out, a paparazzi for the school newspaper happened to be lurking nearby, and caught most of her yelling at me. The next day, the newspaper's headline read 'Teacher/Student Relationship Doomed By Hot Mom'.\" Hazel spat out the headline. \"Trixie became a laughingstock within the day, and Card was no better off. He tendered his resignation the very same day, and told Trixie he was leaving her and the town. Trixie came home in tears, yelling the whole story at me.\" Tears pooled around Hazel's eyes. \"She packed her bags that same night and fled, and I haven't seen her since.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx was truly sympathetic to the turquoise mare. She'd read about such romantic failures in the few romance novels Twilight had in her library. And to think that Trixie had been such a victim of circumstance! She sighed. \"Miss Lulamoon - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Call me Hazel, dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hazel, then.\" Nyx gathered her courage. \"Look, I didn't know about any of this. And Trixie honestly does want to reconnect with you. There's been some... unique circumstances that have cropped up. It's not my place to explain, but there's a small party being held in Ponyville, and she's one of the guests. If you could attend, she can explain what's going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And I'll have the chance to apologize for my part in her utter embarrassment,\" Hazel mused. She smiled, and nodded. \"Alright. If Trixie's willing to give me a chance, I'll go.\"</span></div></div>",

Not because she didn't recognize who it was, but because she <i>did</i>. \"Rainbow Dash!\" There was no mistaking the colorfully-maned pegasus, but what Nyx couldn't figure out (aside from why she was there in the first place) was why Dash was dressed in dark, imposing-looking plate armor with a spear on the floor right next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no way of knowing what had happened to her, or if Dash was just taking a nap, Nyx reached out a hoof to nudge the pegasus awake. When Dash opened her eyes, Nyx smiled and asked, \"Hey, Dash, sorry to interrupt your nap, but I just found you laying there and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NIGHTMARE MOON!\" Nyx jumped as Rainbow Dash spat out that hateful name, instantly flipping herself upright and grabbing her spear in one fluid motion so that she could hold its tip pointed at Nyx's throat. \"So, that whole 'I'm reformed now and flying away on the moon' thing was just a ruse, huh? Well, you're not getting away with it this time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx's eyes went wide as saucers. \"Wh-what?! Rainbow Dash, what are you talking about?! It's me! Ny-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I haven't forgotten who you are, NIGHTMARE MOON! Just because you're punier than last time doesn't mean I'm gonna give you a chance to get inside my head. Brainwash me twice, shame on you; brainwash me three times, shame on me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx confusedly asked, \"Brainwashed?\" But then she yelped and reflexively pulled back as Dash actually thrust forward with her spear with clearly lethal intent! \"Dash! What in Celestia's name are you doing?!\" she asked, ducking from side to side to avoid the flurry of spear thrusts that came at her from the most loyal pony she'd ever known. Even though she had just woken up, the pegasus wielded the spear like a professional, and Nyx couldn't even spare the time to wonder where she had learned such skill without putting herself at risk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a flap of her wings, Dash suddenly flipped over Nyx and whipped her spear around to strike the alicorn's flank with the butt end of it. The impact struck like a club, making her hind leg explode with pain and momentarily stumble, leaving her open for a follow-up attack that would have impaled her if she hadn't reflexively summoned a magic blade to parry the spear and push back against the freakishly strong and skilled Dash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHobbling around to face the pegasus again, Nyx spoke with a voice filled with a mixture of fear and concern. \"Dash, you're not yourself! Let's get Twilight, and she can-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Dash interrupted, though. Her eyes narrowed as she asked, \"Twilight?! Did you do something to Twilight or Rarity? If you touched a hair on their manes, I'll-! This isn't over!\" Pushing herself off, the armored pegasus flew straight into one of the windows, smashing through the glass while Nyx cried out for her to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so bad,\" she said to herself as she galloped toward the castle exit where she saw the rainbow-colored blur of the armored pegasus flying away. Stretching her own wings, she took flight and tried to catch up, even though she knew trying to outfly Rainbow Dash was a futile effort. Sure enough, it wasn't long before she lost sight of the pegasus completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, think, Nyx. She wasn't acting like herself at all... it was like she didn't even remember me. Maybe she got hit on the head. Maybe it was a spell. Either way, I've got to tell the others!\" She banked toward Ponyville, hoping to find somepony who could explain what just happened and help her snap Dash out of it. Along the way, she encountered...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx was, by this point, semi-accustomed to being an impromptu landing zone for certain pegasi. On some occasions, it was Ditzy Doo, losing her flight path as her misaligned eyes betrayed her. Admittedly, Ditzy had been getting better. She was receiving treatment for both her strabismus and logarrhea, treatment that served to make Ditzy more stable in flight, and more coherant as well. The other pegasus Nyx was used to landing on her was Rainbow Dash, whom she was currently chasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So it came as a bit of a surprise to the alicorn when her flight path was derailed into a nearby cloud. \"Oops, sorry Nyx, didn't see you there,\" came the familiar brash voice. Nyx looked up, and blinked. Yes, this was the Rainbow Dash she was used to, with no armor, no spear, and not calling her hateful names. Instead, she was smiling down at the alicorn, a smile that slowly faded. \"Uh, you okay? You look like you've seen a ghost or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx slowly stood up on the cloud. \"It's 'or something', Dash.\" Her eyes narrowed as a possibility occured to her. \"I think there might be a Changeling masquerading as you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dash's eyes flashed. \"WHAT?! I thought we took care of them years ago!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, yeah, but I found somepony in the castle who looked identical to you, down to the facial structure. Though... I thought Changelings could only morph their appearances.\" Nyx put a hoof to her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, that's what Twi said. Why?\" Dash asked, bouncing on her hooves slightly in agitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, this... doppelganger of you was dressed in some sort of heavy armor and carried a spear. And she's pretty good with it, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rainbow blinked. \"Why would I ever need a spear? I'm strong enough with my own two hooves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was then a shout attracted their attention. \"<i><b>WHAT THE BUCK IS GOING ON HERE?!</b></i>\" The voice, distant as it was, was unmistakable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Dash sitting with Nyx on the cloud was wide-eyed. \"Yeesh, she sure <i>sounds</i> like me, I'll give her that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx looked at her. \"Can you catch her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dash smirked. \"If she's wearing heavy armor like you said, it'll be a piece of cake!\" She took off in the direction of the shout, Nyx following at a slower, but still quite fast, pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Things are very, <b>very</b> messed up.</i> This thought was foremost in the dragoon Rainbow Dash's mind as she looked at the landscape. There were absolutely no familiar landmarks. How had she gotten from Mt. Ordeals to... wherever she was now? She could never recall seeing a place like this throughout the whole world. There was a relatively small town nearby, and off in the distance she saw a fancy castle. But the shape and design matched none of the castles that Rainbow Dash had seen in her time. Hence why she had screamed at the top of her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Argh! This makes no sense!\" she snarled, punching a nearby cloud in her agitation. \"Nightmare Moon's back, and I don't know where the buck I am!\" She paused as a thought occured to her, and her eyes widened. \"Wait a minute... Of course! Nightmare Moon! She must have brought me here for... some reason! I'll just go back, kick her flank, and make her take me back home! Piece of cake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Funny. I said the same thing about catching you.\" The voice came from behind her, startling her. But it was more than its sudden appearance. It was the eerie <i>familiarity</i>. Turning around, Rainbow Dash came face to face... with Rainbow Dash. The major difference was that one wore armor, while the other was completely naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The armored Dash's eyes went wide. \"Wh-what the hay? Are you just one of Nightmare Moon's illusions?!\" She whipped out her trusty spear, aiming it at the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For her part, the unarmored Dash barely flinched at the weapon. Her eyes narrowed, however. \"Hey, don't call Nyx that! Nightmare Moon is a thing of the past!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The two pegasi began to circle each other in midair. \"Says you!\" the armored one said. \"I saw her myself! Sure, she's smaller than I remember, but I'm not looking a gift horse in the mouth! It'll be easier to smack her around if she's so weak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The other glared. \"You aren't going to smack her around, not if I can help it!\" With that, she lunged at the dragoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dash was careful not to strike to kill. <i>This may just be one of Nightmare Moon's illusions. On the other hoof, it might just be some poor pony she brainwashed and altered to look like me. I can't afford the risk of killing an innocent.</i> She jabbed and swung with the blunt end of the spear. To her amazement, her doppelganger dodged and wove around her swings in a manner similar to her monk friend, Applejack. <i>Could she be from Stabul? I didn't know they accepted non-Earth ponies as monks!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She was less impressed when the look-alike tried kicking her, and just rebounded off her armor, clutching her hoof. \"Yeesh, did Nightmare Moon's brainwashing make you dumber? This is full-plate armor! No dinky little kick is going to get through this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her double frowned, then soared up and away slightly. Dash watched her with a smirk, confident she'd run the mare off. That confidence vanished as her double did an about-face, and began to fly around her at high speed. Dash's eyes widened as she recognized the beginnings of a tornado. Quickly, she strapped her spear to her back and flew counter to her double, disappating the vortex that had partially formed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The two pegasi hovered in midair, panting at the exertion. Dash was feeling it more than her double, though. Her armor, while effective in combat, was considerably less so when dealing with weather. Still, she smirked. \"It'll... take more... than that... to take me down,\" she panted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her double merely smirked back. \"Like an alicorn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dash barely had time to register the sentence before she was wrapped in a magical aura, and spun around to face Nightmare Moon again. \"Now,\" the black alicorn said, keeping a firm grip with her magic, \"are you going to try to attack me again, or are you going to listen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dash glared. \"Why should I listen to anything you have to say? Twilight trusted that you were purified by the Elements, yet here you are, corrupted again! Are you going to try to destroy the world again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nightmare Moon glanced over Dash's shoulder, clearly looking at her double. \"Would it help if I said I have no idea what you're talking about? Sure, I tried to bring eternal night, and actually succeeded for a couple of weeks, but the Elements of Harmony have never been used on me. Successfully, that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dash narrowed her eyes. \"Are you trying to mock me?! I was there! I used one of the Elements on you! They purified you and destroyed the Giant of Babil! Don't tell me you've forgotten!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before anything more could be said, a voice reached them from the ground. \"What in tarnation is goin' on up thar?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Looking down, all three fliers saw five more ponies below them. Five ponies they all recognized... or thought they did, in one case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dash's double flew down to join the five first. \"We caught some crazy pony who looks like me, that's what's going on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Who the hay are you calling crazy, you imposter?!\" roared Dash, as she struggled to get out of the magical grip of Nightmare Moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was a pause. \"She certainly sounds like you, darling,\" an alabaster unicorn said, looking between Dash and her double.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dash's heart skipped a beat. \"Wha - ?\" Then a thought occured to her, and she leveled a glare at the alicorn. \"You... you brainwashed all of them, didn't you? You sick, twisted - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nightmare Moon cut her off. \"If I had brainwashed them, there'd be signs. They'd have my eyes, for one thing.\" She flew down to the others, and turned Dash around to face them. \"Look. Do any of them have my eyes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dash remembered that from Twilight's description of her own brainwashing. Looking around, the dragoon's heart sank as she realized there was no trace of turquoise in any of the eyes she saw. Even her clone had her own, familiar rose-colored eyes. \"So... if they're not brainwashed... then what the bucking hay is going on here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight - or the pony that was a dead ringer for her, down to the cutie mark -  smiled. \"Well, in order to better answer that, why don't we head to the library? That way, we'll have a degree of privacy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dash considered this, then nodded. \"Works for me. At least there I'll be able to read up on where I am.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As they made their way toward the library, the other ponies kept glancing toward the armored Rainbow Dash, who in turn kept an eye on her 'double'. On occasion, though, she would glance at Twilight or Rarity, who were on opposite ends of the herd making their way to Ponyville. When the silence got too awkward, Applejack asked, \"Uh... say, Rainbow Dash...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" both of them replied in unison. They then glared at each other and snapped, \"She meant me,\" causing Applejack to facehoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah meant the one in th' armor. Dragoon Dash, or Rainbow Spear, or whatever we should call ya...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe armored Dash replied, pointing a hoof toward her double, \"You can call me RAINBOW DASH, because that's <i>my</i> name. Why don't we call <i>her</i> 'Naked Dash'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, at least I don't have to hide my ugly face behind some clunky helmet that makes me look like a big purple chicken,\" the other Dash retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe armored Dash fumed. \"Big purple <i>dragon</i>, you idiot! And we're exactly identical, so if I'm ugly, you're ugly, moron!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if we're identical and I'm a moron, that makes you a moron who dresses like a big, purple chicken!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Dashes started butting heads, glaring at each other and both refusing to back down until Applejack groaned and wedged herself in between them. \"Alright, y'all simmer down! We gotta call ya <i>somethin'</i> fer the sake o' convenience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm rather partial to Dragoon Dash, personally,\" Rarity interjected. \"It sounds like the name of a dashing storybook hero, and really suits that striking armor of yours. The sleek lines and draconic theme say 'I am a mare not to be trifled with', while the dark color and the way it frames your face provide a sort of mysterious allure.\" The white unicorn delicately tapped her chin in thought as her mind went off on a tangent. \"Goodness knows, it's next to impossible to get <i>our</i> Rainbow Dash to put on the more ladylike attire I've tried to make for her, but this gives me some fresh ideas! Oh, the things I could do with you... perhaps you could come by the boutique when you have a free moment, and I can get you out of that armor to try a few ensembles?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for the dragoon, the 'mysterious allure' provided by her helmet also made it more difficult for the others to see her cheeks turning red from the compliments. \"I... uh... s-sure! Dragoon Dash it is,\" she replied before puffing out her chest with pride and gloating to her double. \"See? <i>She</i> knows I'm awesome.\" Rainbow Dash just stuck her tongue out in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack said, \"That was one o' mah suggestions, so why'd ya latch onto it when Rarity... Ah, never mind, that ain't the question ah wanted to ask. Ah was wonderin'-\" Before the farm pony could finish her thought, though, the group was suddenly interrupted by a terrified scream!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverypony whirled around to see Fluttershy backing away from the thick brush on the side of the path. During the heated argument between the two Dashes, she had instinctively held back away from it, only to notice a rustling in the bushes. Thinking it to be some animal, she had leaned in to get a better look only to get a glimpse of something horrifying!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling itself up out of the brush was a huge, slimy mass of something that was half drooling, fang-filled mouth, and the rest of it seemed to be nothing but tentacles and eyestalks! None of the Equestrian ponies had seen anything like it, but Dragoon Dash immediately knew the danger and pulled her spear from her back. \"Fluttershy! Get away from it, quick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe timid yellow pegasus, not knowing what the creature was, nevertheless had a track record of being able to pacify hostile creatures. Focusing what confidence she had, she faced the monster and gave it The Stare, looking it straight in a few of its many eyes. \"Now that wasn't very nice, startling me like that,\" she said sternly to the monster, which stopped in its tracks and gave her what was probably a confused look. \"You should know better! Now, if you want to start over,  you should apologize right now! Otherwise, you should go right back where you came from, if you're just going to cause a commotion and scare innocent ponies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster was apparently locked in place by The Stare, and started to pull back a little. But then it started to inhale, causing Dragoon Dash to shout, \"Hold your breath, everypony!\" She then pushed herself off the ground and started flying straight up into the sky as the monster belched out a cloud of noxious gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the closest to it, Fluttershy caught the brunt of the cloud. As soon as it touched her, the pegasus's eyes began to burn, her nose and lungs doing the same. Her body was wracked with painful coughs, soon joined by the others as they reflexively cried out for their friend, only to get caught in the cloud as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... *cough* *cough* fink...\" Rainbow Dash snarled between hacking coughs, looking up with nearly blind eyes toward the sky. \"Big... purple... *cough* CHICKEN *cough* abandoning us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature's horrible breath wasn't the worst of it, though, as the debilitating effects of the gas broke whatever hold The Stare might have had over it. As Fluttershy fell to the ground, the monster shambled over toward her and picked her up with some of its tendrils, its mouth opening wide. Between coughs, the others could hear the pegasus let out a ragged scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx, the most combat-capable of the group, reflexively summoned her magic blade and struggled to fight the effects of the gas enough to hurry to Fluttershy's aid. Because she was nearly completely blinded, though, she was afraid to attack recklessly for fear of accidentally hitting Fluttershy. She staggered toward the pegasus's scream, but was going to be too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom out of the blue, however, a streak of dark purple and cyan came shooting down toward the ground at incredible speed! Dragoon Dash flapped her wings as rapidly as possible, gathering more and more velocity as she aimed her spear at the monster. She felt the sound barrier trying to resist her, pushing back against her, but she held her spear close and used the unique shape of her dragon knight armor to increase her aerodynamics, breaking that barrier just before she slammed into the monster, her spear punching straight through it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sonic Rainboom that erupted from the point of impact sent out a shockwave that didn't just blow the monster apart from the inside out, but also blew the gas cloud away in all directions, where it could disperse harmlessly into the breeze. In the aftermath, the others wiped their bleary eyes clear and saw the dragoon standing in the scattered mass of tentacles and breathing heavily. With a cocky smirk, she said, \"I told you to hold your breath. Those Malboros are bad for your health.\"</span></div></div>",

Ordeals, training to increase my skill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Increase?\" Nyx said incredulously. \"You're plenty skilled enough already! Hay, you managed to make <i>me</i> stumble from a blow from the blunt end of your spear, and that's no easy task.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dragoon Dash was about to make a snarky reply, but she became acutely aware of the death glare she was getting from Twilight. Nervously, she said, \"Ah-heh... no hard feelings? I thought you were Nightmare Moon, that's all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx rolled her eyes. \"Yes, I gathered that from the way you kept calling me that hated name. I'm not really Nightmare Moon, but rather, her reincarnation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The armor-clad mare blinked. \"Reincarnation? You mean, like a phoenix?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Close, but not quite,\" Twilight explained, getting into 'lecture' mode. \"You see, when a phoenix dies and comes back to life, that is known as a ressurection. Ressurection, from what I've read, allows the being in question to retain all memories of the life prior to their death. Reincarnation, on the other hoof, entails a completely new life, with no access to the previous life's memory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dragoon Dash nodded. \"I get it. So, she was reborn, not just brought back from the dead, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight beamed. \"Exactly. You seem to grasp things better than our Rainbow, that's for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Love you too, Twi,\" Rainbow Dash snarked from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Chuckling, the dragoon nodded. \"Anyway, so you're the reborn form of one of the greatest evils to ever plague the land? That's gotta be hard on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx sighed, her mood dropping. \"You have <i>no</i> idea... I have enough trouble dealing with the stigma of Nightmare Moon's actions on this world, I don't need whatever she did on yours laid on my shoulders as well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dragoon Dash cocked her head. \"So, we're going with the theory that I'm on a different world than I'm supposed to be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That is the most logical explanation,\" Twilight said. Noting the confused looks on everypony else's face, she elaborated. \"There are theories that say multiple versions of the same world can exist, albeit slightly different from each other owing to choices or events that occured differently in each world. Rarity, do you have some ribbon and a marker I can borrow?\" Rarity nodded, offering the requested items over to Twilight. \"Thank you,\" the lavender unicorn said. \"Now, suppose this ribbon,\" she held up a red ribbon, \"represents the timeline of our world as we know it. Everything that's happened in our timeline makes up this red ribbon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So what's the point yer tryin' ta make, sugarcube?\" Applejack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm getting there. Now, remember how the six of us got our cutie marks on or near the same day thanks to Rainbow Dash?\" Everypony save for Dragoon Dash nodded, and Rainbow took the opportunity to smirk at the armored mare. \"Now, this isn't an insult to your abilities, Rainbow, but there was always the chance you wouldn't have pulled off the Sonic Rainboom when you did, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rainbow's smug look wilted like a weed under a garden-scouring spell. \"I - ! But - ! You - !\" she sputtered for a few moments, before sighing in defeat. \"Yeah, I guess there was that chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight nodded. \"According to the theory we're going by, somewhere out there is a world where Rainbow Dash <i>didn't</i> perform the Sonic Rainboom.\" She marked the red ribbon with the marker, and laid a blue ribbon branching off the red from the marked point. \"This blue ribbon is that other world, or rather, alternate timeline.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Everypony was somber at that revelation. Dragoon Dash finally broke the silence with a cough. \"So, you're saying that I've somehow hopped from my 'ribbon' onto yours, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx and Twilight nodded. Rainbow then spoke up. \"Well, the sooner you get to work figuring out how to send her home, the better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before the dragoon could protest, Twilight shook her head. \"It's not going to be that easy, Rainbow. Without knowing how she got here in the first place, sending her home is going to be a chore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Then there's the fact that somehow, monsters from my world are popping up over here,\" Dragoon Dash added. When everypony looked at her curiously, she elaborated. \"None of you have ever seen a Malboro before today, right? That kinda means something's wrong. And I frankly wouldn't be able to live with myself if I went home without fixing it. I can't leave my friends hanging, after all, even if you aren't exactly the friends I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rainbow's glare lost a fair bit of its intensity at that. \"Yeah, I understand how you feel. I guess if I were in your horseshoes, I'd feel the same way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight nodded, then turned to the dragoon with a smile. \"On that note, what can you tell us about the versions of us from your world?\" Her smile widened. \"Oh, I bet I'm a mage somewhere, doing good for the sake of other ponies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dragoon Dash chuckled. \"Hate to burst your bubble, but magic's not really your strong suit back home.\" Twilight looked gobsmacked, so she pressed on. \"You are, in fact, one of the queen diarchs of the kingdom of Colton, where I served until recently as the Dragoon commander.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight's eyes bugged out. \"I-I-I-I'm ROYALTY?!\" she sputtered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, you did help save the world, and you're well-known and loved in Colton,\" the armored mare explained. \"And you're happily married to Rarity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rarity almost matched Twilight's expression. \"I-I beg your pardon?!\" she gasped out, before looking at Twilight. \"Not that there's anything wrong with you, dear, but I assure you that my interests lie firmly with the stallion persuasion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight nodded, blushing furiously. \"Same here. And even if that wasn't the case, you all are my friends! I couldn't picture any of you being closer than that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rarity nodded. \"Exactly. I would hate to risk losing friendship for an endeavor that might never go anywhere anyway.\" She shook her head, then turned her attention back to the smirking dragoon. \"So, aside from ruling this kingdom, what do Twilight and I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dragoon Dash smiled. \"Twilight is one of the best damn swordsmare's the kingdom's ever seen. She started out serving as a Dark Knight under the previous king, but she eventually gained the power of a Paladin as well, balancing light and darkness in herself to bring balance to the world.\" She paused for a moment. \"At least, I think that's how she explained it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight blinked. \"Me, a swordsmare? Well, I guess in different circumstances, I can see it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The dragoon continued. \"Rarity, on the other hoof, is a White Mage, a wielder of magics designed to heal and support allies in the field, although she also mastered the mighty Holy spell, which is basically one giant 'screw you' to anyone thinking she's an easy target. Oh, and she's also a crack shot with a bow. Makes it look artistic at times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rarity tapped her chin in thought. \"Well, I guess I can see a certain elegance to archery. Goodness knows it requires more skill than swinging a sword around like a lunatic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight looked askance at Rarity. \"I don't fall into that catagory, do I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rarity blinked, then blushed. \"Well, no. I mean, <i>you</i> don't, Twilight. And I doubt your counterpart is a lunatic either, I was just making a note.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pinkie Pie interrupted, having been unusually silent. \"So when are you going to get to the part where you had a secret crush on Rarity?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dragoon Dash stared, wide-eyed, at the pink pony. \"How the hay did you - ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"<i>It's Pinkie Pie</i>,\" chorused everypony else.</span></div></div>",

You're telling me my double from another world is a filly-fooler... and she didn't even get the filly? What's up with <i>that</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe if either of you would brush your mane now and then,\" Rarity teased, getting a dirty look from both Dashes, though Dragoon's expression was tempered by mild embarassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do <i>all</i> our barn doors swing that way over on your side, or jus' you three?\" Applejack asked with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragoon Dash turned toward the farm pony and leered. \"Are you suuuuuuure you wanna know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack thought about it for a minute, then sweatdropped and shook her head. \"On second thought, why spoil th' mystery? Ah'm more curious about mah job over there anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Royal concubine!\" Dragoon Dash replied immediately, but she couldn't keep a straight face and started guffawing when everypony saw Applejack turn white as a sheet. \"Nah, nah, I'm just messing with you. You're the toughest warrior monk alive, master of martial arts and guardian of Stabul kingdom. And last I heard, King Macintosh was looking for a good husband for you in case he never produced an heir to the throne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColor returned to Applejack's face as she sighed and rolled her eyes. \"Ah, dangit, mah Big Mac's startin' t' get the same way, talkin' 'bout me startin' mah own branch on the Apple family tree, even though ah'm so busy runnin' the...\" She trailed off again, the others just as stunned as she was as the realization hit. \"KING MACINTOSH?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wow, you're a princess,\" Fluttershy said softly, beaming at her earthy friend. \"That must be so exciting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! NO way! Now ah <i>know</i> yer just messin' with me this time,\" she stammered in denial, blushing as she tried to hide under her hat. \"Ain't no way ah'm royalty in any of them time-ribbons!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say, your highness,\" Dragoon Dash replied with a snicker before noticing Fluttershy looking up at her with a gentle, bashful smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, um... am I a princess too?\" she asked. In an instant, the dragoon stopped snickering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... not... exactly,\" she replied. \"In my world, you're a summoner.\" When she could see that the others didn't understand, she explained, \"There are spirit beings called eidolons, and summoners are... were able to befriend them, summoning them to appear whenever they needed help. But you <i>did</i> spend several years on the eidolons' world being raised by their king and queen, so I guess that does kind of make you a princess.\" She gave Fluttershy a hollow smile, trying too hard to make it look good to fool the yellow pegasus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking softly, almost a whisper, she asked, \"That sounds nice... but you said... 'were'... Did... did something happen to the other summoners...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragoon Dash couldn't keep eye contact, and had to look away from Fluttershy as she replied, \"Yeah... um... 'something' did. I don't really wanna talk about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy backed away. \"Oh... okay... I'm sorry if it was a bad question to ask...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly jumping in before the atmosphere could grow too heavy, Pinkie Pie bounced in front of Dragoon Dash and asked, \"Ooh! Ooh! What about me?! Am I the princess of Partyland? Or am I like the Grand Vizier of Partyland, which is really a boring and evil place, but since I'm the Grand Vizier, I'm under contract to scheme and plot against the actual rulers so it can become a fun and happy place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the dragoon stammered, suddenly caught in Hurricane Pinkie, who was rattling off detailed plans about how her double most likely plotted to usurp the throne of Partyland, Nyx saw Rainbow Dash creep quietly toward the kitchen with her head hung low. Whispering to her mother, \"I'm going to go get some snacks for everyone,\" she got up and followed the usually brash pegasus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the kitchen, she saw Rainbow slump down onto the floor near Spike, who had a thousand-yard stare going on as he muttered to himself, \"Twilight... and Rarity. Rarity... and Twilight. Twilight... and Rarity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are... you okay?\" Nyx asked, trying to nudge the little dragon out of his catatonic mumbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned his head to look at her, slowly growing aware of her as he said in a thin, strained voice, \"Nyx... please... please tell me you have a spell to get that image out of my head!\" He clung to her, whimpering at the thought of his long-time crush and the pony he thought of as a big sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx gently hugged him and whispered soothingly, \"There there, Spike. Come on, it's not like you've lost anything. <i>That</i> Rarity is a whole universe away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Rainbow Dash muttered. \"A totally awesome universe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx asked, \"You okay, Dash?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow muttered bitterly, \"Of course! I'm totally great! I just don't see what's so great about that stupid other me that everyone's hanging on her every word. Just because she popped into this world from one where everyone's a ridiculously awesome gay princess, swinging around her stupid spear in her stupid chicken armor, with her stupid face...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx started to say, \"Come on, Dash, it's not like--\" only to be interrupted by Rainbow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and when my friend was about to get eaten by a big ugly monster, she saves the day while I'm too busy hacking my lungs out to lift a hoof!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx blinked. \"Is that why you're feeling bad? Come on, Dash, I know Fluttershy doesn't think that. None of us do. We were <i>all</i> helpless and couldn't do anything in that cloud. I know if we hadn't been taken by surprise, you would've grabbed her out of harms way in a blink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash looked up at Nyx, but then slumped back down. \"Except I was and I didn't...\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx looked down at the brooding pegasus, but couldn't think of anything to do or say other than to let her deal with it on her own. \"Well, Spike, can you help me make some sandwiches?\" she asked. The dragon quickly nodded. Anything to divert his attention from the images playing out in his mind's eye, but before they could get the ingredients ready, he burped up a scroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking in surprise, Nyx asked, \"A message from Celestia? I wonder what it is?\" Grabbing it and unrolling the scroll with her magic, she quickly scanned the brief missive, her eyes quickly growing wide with surprise. \"MOM!\" she cried, bursting out of the kitchen and into the library! To the startled ponies, she quickly exclaimed, \"Something just happened!\"</span></div></div>",

Somehow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You mean ponies from your world are responsible for those flying ships?\" Twilight asked, a sparkle in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The armored mare nodded. \"More specifically, Colton is the only kingdom that has airships. Which means it's probably the Red Wings, their premier air force.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rainbow Dash cocked her head. \"The 'Red Wings'?

Don't worry, I'll get us there.\" Her mane and tail began to billow in an unseen wind, lengthening and filling with stars. \"Hold on, everypony! It's been awhile since I've done this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The two pulsing masses of stars began to swirl around the group, trapping them in a stellar tornado. Before anypony else could comment, they vanished in a swirling celestial mist that flew off towards Canterlot. The only one left behind was Spike, who looked around, and sighed once more. \"Why couldn't this just happen on Tuesday, like always?\" he muttered, and began to clean up the slight mess that had been left behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In Canterlot, Celestia and Luna looked at the approaching airborne fleet with wary eyes. \"Sister, I admit uncertainty as to our course of action. I have never seen anything like these in our history books of the past 1000 years,\" Luna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia nodded. \"Nor have I. Yet we will do what we must to make sure there is no threat to our kingdom.\" She turned as she sensed an approaching magic signature, and smiled as the approaching stardust cloud swirled to reveal the forms of the bearers of the Elements, as well as Nyx. \"Welcome, my little ponies. I apologize for the short notice, but - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia cut herself off as she noticed a discrepancy. Namely, that there was one extra pony who, nonetheless, looked very familiar. A pony who was curled up into as small a ball as her armor would allow, shivering. \"Oh, by the Sun, that was weird!\" moaned the armored mare, taking off her helmet to run a hoof through her prismatic mane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia looked at her, then at Rainbow Dash, then at Twilight and Nyx. \"Something tells me there's a story here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before anything else could be said, the armored version of Rainbow Dash sprang to her hooves. \"Story, yes, but not now,\" she said brusquely. \"Now, that letter said something about an airship fleet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia arched an eyebrow, and idly folded down her ears just as Luna exploded. \"<b>THOU DAREST ADDRESS OUR SISTER IN SUCH AN INFORMAL MANNER, KNAVE?!

Then she blinked, and looked back and forth between Luna and Nyx. \"Wow, this really is different from my world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"World?\" asked Celestia, glancing between the two different Rainbow Dashes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight nodded. \"From what we can tell, this Rainbow - whom we've taken to calling Dragoon Dash - is actually from a seperate timeline from ours. She's already noted several differences between our worlds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I see...\" the solar princess nodded. \"Now things begin to make more sense. I assume, then, that the approaching fleet is from your world?\" She directed this last part at Dragoon Dash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The dragoon nodded. \"Gotta be. More specifically, they're probably from the kingdom of Colton, the only nation that has airships. Also, they're more than likely a contingent of the Red Wings, Colton's premier air force.\" She strode past the princesses, and squinted at the approaching fleet. \"Hm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Can you see anything identifiable?\" asked Celestia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dragoon Dash narrowed her eyes. \"It's hard to tell, but...\"</span></div></div>",

If it's here, that means my Twilight is, too! I'm gonna go up to greet her! Ha, just wait until she finds out we're in a whole other world. She's going to geek out so hard.\" Before anyone could say a word, the dragoon had already launched herself up toward the airships.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT DOST THOU... that is, what do you make of this, dear sister?\" Luna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia replied, \"I haven't seen enough to form my own opinion just yet...\" Turning to Nyx and the Element bearers, she continued, \"... but perhaps <i>you</i> have. What do you all make of this other Rainbow Dash? From that, I imagine we will have a fair impression of what to expect from these 'Red Wings'. Twilight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight Sparkle blinked. \"Me? Ah, well... she seemed trustworthy to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx chuckled and winced a bit as she looked back at where she had been hit before, her naturally black coat the only thing hiding a nasty bruise. \"Yeah, there was <i>no</i> subterfuge in her introduction. My flank is still smarting from when she mistook me for her version of Nightmare Moon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's got some great stories,\" Pinkie Pie exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perty rough around the edges, but ah'd say she's a straight shooter,\" Applejack agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's... nice...\" Fluttershy whispered softly. \"She saved me from a horrible monster...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity said, \"Really, aside from having better fashion sense, she's pretty much exactly like our Rainbow Dash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, please,\" Dash jealously muttered. \"Underneath that tin chicken suit and big fancy stick, she's just an arrogant show-off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, darling, exactly the same,\" Rarity teased, earning her a grumpy glare from the pegasus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Celestia said with a bemused grin. \"That is a relief. I believe we should be prepared to greet our guests from another world, then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!

As she drew herself up to the level of the ship's deck, she saw two very familiar and welcome figures, both clad in gleaming white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twi! Rarity!\" Dragoon Dash called out to her dear friends as she landed on the deck, coming in somewhat faster than recommended in her eagerness, so she skidded across the boards before coming to a stop right in front of the royal unicorns. She then wrapped them both up in a big hug. \"Aww, it's so good to see you two! But how the hay did you make it here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen diarchs of Colton both blinked in surprise, but then laughed softly and returned the embrace. \"We could ask the same of you, dear,\" Rarity replied. \"We believed you were still training on Mt. Ordeals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragoon Dash snickered and replied, \"Geeze, even I don't know. One moment I'm up there, the next I'm in some castle I've never seen before, getting woken up by a mare who looks just like- Oh, Twilight, you are gonna <i>flip</i>! We're in a completely different world! Not only that, but we all have doubles here who've been living completely different lives! Can you believe that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight chuckled and replied, \"Well, actually, I can. That's sort of why we're here in the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragoon Dash released her hug and facehoofed. \"Ah, sheesh, and here I was hoping to surprise you. Well, you'll probably like meeting your double, at least. She's more of a magic-user than you are, but just as much of an egghead, and...\" She trailed off a little before asking, \"Wait, that's why you're here? Why would you come all the way to a whole other world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight smiled and patted the dragoon on the shoulder. \"Oh, don't worry, Dash, I'll tell you all about it. I'm actually really glad you're here, so you can help out. Just like old times.\" The purple unicorn stepped up toward the prow of the airship, looking down at Canterlot and all the ponies down below. She then looked back over her shoulder and called out, \"Alright, everypony...\"</span></div></div>",

The moment, however, was interrupted by a call from the helm. \"Landing has begun, my queens. This world's castle, in the sun it gleams!\" Dash looked over, smiling as she saw the engineer Zecora expertly guiding the Sunrise to a gentle landing in front of the terrace where the world's native ponies had gathered. Zecora made sure the airship was properly secure, then turned around. \"Welcome back, my prismatic friend. To your tale, an ear I'll lend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dash smiled again. \"Later, Zecora! Right now, it's time for a meeting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The gathered ponies stared at the airships in wonder. The name 'Red Wings' was well-earned, as the hulls of most of the ships were painted a deep red. The exception was the lead airship, the Sunrise. That ship was painted gold, with white trim, and an emblem of a sun on the tip of the prow. Celestia smiled at the similarity to her own Cutie Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A gangplank descended from the Sunrise, hitting the ground in front of the gathering. An azure-colored mare stepped onto the top of the gangplank, and cleared her throat. Her appearance caught a few of the ponies off-guard. \"Trixie!\" hissed Rainbow Dash. \"What the hay is she doing there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hush, Rainbow,\" Celestia chided. \"Remember, she is not the Trixie you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before anything else could be said, Trixie took a breath, and belted out in a voice that could be heard through the whole terrace and beyond, \"<b>Presenting their Royal Majesties, Queen Diarchs of Colton, Twilight Sparkle and Rarity! Also presenting, Dragoon Commander of Colton, Rainbow Dash!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As the named mares took Trixie's place at the top of the gangplank, Celestia and Luna arched eyebrows, turning to their own Twilight and Rarity. \"Anything I should know about, Twilight?\" asked Celestia in a teasing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight sighed, her face beet red. \"I think you know enough from that alone,\" she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The three mares descended the gangplank, followed by Trixie, with whom Dragoon Dash appeared to be having a small conversation. Ignoring that, the two queens of Colton trotted forward, as Celestia and Luna stepped towards them, away from the crowd of smaller ponies. When they were a foreleg's distance apart from each other, they stopped. The two pairs of diarchs examined each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finally, the white-clad lavender unicorn spoke. \"I am Twilight Sparkle, Queen Diarch of the kingdom of Colton on the world of Gaia. This is my wife, Queen Rarity.\" She bowed to Celestia, followed by the robe-wearing alabaster unicorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When they had risen, Celestia took her turn. \"I am Celestia, Princess Diarch and Regent of the Sun of the country of Equestria. This is my sister, Princess Luna of the Moon.\" Both she and Luna dipped their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Queen Twilight blinked. \"You're both considered princesses? But then where is the reigning ruler?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia smiled. \"We are. When our mother, the Queen, passed away in a time before written history, both Luna and myself refused the title. We agreed to rule together under the title of 'Princess' in the hopes that our subjects would not think us to be unapproachable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Queen Rarity smiled back. \"A very thoughtful and wise decision, your Highnesses. We have no such excuse in Colton, I'm afraid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Luna chuckled. \"Apparently. And since you both possess the title of 'Queen', the two of you technically outrank my sister and myself. Therefore, you may drop the formalities around us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was silence for a moment, before Dragoon Dash and Queen Rarity burst out laughing as Queen Twilight's face reddened slightly. \"Are you two finished?\" the lavender queen asked acidly once their laughter had calmed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sorry, Twi,\" the dragoon replied, \"it's just, I've heard about your track record for this sort of thing. Every pony in authority you meet wants you to drop formalities around them. And this time, they have a legit excuse!\" She began laughing all over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She wasn't alone, however, as the two alicorns chuckled as well. Laughter began to spread from that focus point, and soon everypony on the terrace was laughing to one degree or another. Once the commotion had died down somewhat, Celestia smiled at the two queens. \"I look forward to the remainder of our meeting, Queen Twilight. Perhaps you would care to join my subjects and I for a meal? I'll have a banquet prepared within the hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I look forward to it, Celestia,\" the lavender queen replied. Glancing around, her violet eyes locked on another violet pair. \"For now, though, I believe I'd like to meet your subjects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Well, this meeting's gone quite well so far,</i> Queen Twilight thought as she sat across from her counterpart near the head of the banquet table. <i>My other self is a librarian, and a mage of no small power, to boot. And apparently, Starswirl has been dead for centuries here. When I mentioned I met him, she seemed to explode with questions. Reminds me of Pinkie Pie when she regained her laughter. And adopting the reincarnated Nightmare Moon as a daughter... I never would have considered that.</i> Here, she glanced at Nyx, who was currently the subject of her wife's attention. <i>On my world, Nightmare Moon was essentially a virus that infected Luna; a virus created by Discord. Yet here, she seems perfectly happy.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As if sensing her thoughts, Nyx glanced at the lavender queen and smiled. \"So, Queen Twilight. I don't mean to be rude, but what brings you to our world, anyhow? I mean, not that this isn't utterly fascinating and all, but I doubt you dropped by just to say 'hi'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Queen Twilight sighed, her good humor evaporating. \"You're quite right, Nyx. Yes, my Red Wings and I came to this world for a reason.\" She turned to Celestia, her voice and face lined with seriousness. \"Celestia, though it pains me to admit...\"</span></div></div>",

Malboro thing appeared and attacked us, isn't it? So how did they get from Gaia to Equestria?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Twilight sighed. \"It was my fault... Before Rarity and I were given the throne of Colton, we and several other dear friends went on a quest to save our world. Along the way, we made use of an ancient machine. A ship like our airship, but so much more advanced that it could even take us into the depths of space, and allowed us to venture onto Gaia's moons. We gave up that ship, but I had Zecora, our Chief Mechanic, begin work on developing a new type of engine based on what we had observed of its workings. Just in case we ever had cause to venture beyond our planet again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But to travel beyond our own sphere,\" the zebra said, \"is a challenge for even me, I fear. The workings I could recreate, of course. The trick was to find a stable power source. One that would let us reach the moon without ending in a huge ka-boom. With much trial and error (mostly the latter), I eventually discovered a new type of matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Twilight cleared her throat and interrupted, \"Long story short, we found a substance that contained extraordinary amounts of energy. In hindsight, we should have thought harder about where all that energy came <i>from</i>, but we were too eager to start working on how to use it to power our new engines. The early tests went fine, but there was a miscalculation that led to a massive power overload, which got out of control and started creating vortexes. Mostly in unpopulated areas, thank goodness, but our world is filled with hostile creatures. Malboros are bad, but far from the worst you can find tucked away in the dark corners of Gaia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Rarity admitted, \"At first, we were just concerned with protecting our own world and closing up the vortexes. After a short while, though, we came to realize that there was <i>another</i> world on the other side. An inhabited one. Once we discovered that, we did all that we could to close every vortex except for the largest one, at the site of the original accident, we mobilized the Red Wings in order to lend whatever assistance we could offer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna nodded thoughtfully. Obviously struggling not to use the Royal Canterlot Voice, she said slowly, \"I see... well, your offer is certainly appreciated, but personally, I am unsure about allowing a foreign military to patrol our lands, no matter who is at its helm. I trust you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queens nodded. \"This is your kingdom, and we'll respect your decision,\" Queen Twilight replied, \"though from what I've seen of it, you don't have much in the way of a standing defense force. If you choose not to let the Red Wings fight with you, then the least I can offer is sharing training and information on the creatures that passed through the rifts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia replied, \"You might be surprised, Queen Twilight. Equestria is far from defenseless, though it is true that our society is not as martial as yours seems to be. Would you allow me and my sister to deliberate on the matter before coming to a formal decision?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, if you knew these two like I do, you'd jump on it,\" Dragoon Dash brashly interrupted. \"Twi here's a paladin. A <i>paladin</i>. The ultimate goody four-horseshoes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia laughed softly at the pegasus's outburst while Queen Twilight blushed over her friend's behavior. \"Thank you, Dragoon Dash, that will certainly be one of the things we take into consideration.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the meal went by without incident as the guests from Gaia and their Equestrian hosts conversed about each other and their respective worlds. When it was over, the queens and Dragoon Dash waited in a guest chamber prepared for them while Celestia and Luna deliberated in private. Meanwhile, Nyx and the bearers of the Elements were given a tour of one of the Red Wings' airships by Zecora, who gave them a detailed description of everything they saw, made all the more impressive by doing it all in rhyming verse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne pony in particular wasn't paying attention to the tour, though, as Rainbow Dash hung back. When she was sure nopony was looking, she slinked back around a corner and started sneaking her way back up to the top deck. Once there, she looked at the tower where the Colton royals were waiting, and readied herself for take-off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Dashie! Where are you going? The tour's the other way!\" Before the pegasus could launch herself into the air, Pinkie Pie's head suddenly popped up from a nearby barrel, startling her so much that she instead stumbled and fell on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly picking herself up, she clapped a hoof over Pinkie's mouth and glanced shiftily from side to side. \"Shhh! You wanna get us caught? Look, I need to fly up there and see what those three doppelgangers are up to. It's way too convenient that we get monsters we've never seen here, and then they show up with their heavily armed flying ships and flank-load of soldiers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, I thought they explained it pretty well,\" Pinkie replied, talking out of the corner of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... a little <i>too</i> well,\" Rainbow muttered, narrowing her eyes at the tower. \"Like the sort of story a <i>spy</i> would come up with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie blinked. \"But if you're gonna sneak up and listen in on them, doesn't that make <i>you</i> a spy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay if you're a spy for the good guys! Now, I'm gonna do this no matter what, so are you gonna help me or not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie thought. \"Hmmm.... okay! I'm in,\" she replied cheerfully. \"Meet you there!\" With that, she ducked back into the barrel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash pulled herself up in order to peer into the barrel, only to find it completely empty. Shaking her head, she muttered, \"I will <i>never</i> understand how she does that,\" but then turned her attention back to the tower and took wing.</span></div></div>",

They listened carefully, hoping to catch some of the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"... so I guess I was caught in one of those vortex thingies, huh?\" Dragoon Dash's voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It seems like it,\" replied Queen Twilight. \"The spell that was cast to seal the <a onclick=\"$('#dropNote1').toggle (200);\" style=\"cursor:pointer;color:#0000ff;\" title=\"\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">vortices</span> <span style=\"font-size:8pt;opacity:.75;text-decoration:none;\">\u25bc</span></a><div id=\"dropNote1\" style=\"padding:0px;display:none;\">proper plural for 'vortex'</div>  is one that could be cast remotely. I wasn't concerned with where the vortices were so much as sealing all but the one where the Red Wings could fit through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Makes sense,\" the dragoon said. \"But, what was it like traveling through the vortex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It was a little disorienting,\" Queen Rarity said. \"It felt like down was in fifteen different directions at once. And don't get me started on what up felt like. It was only for a few moments, but still...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was a pause, during which Rainbow and Pinkie imagined Dragoon Dash tapping her hoof against her chin. \"Well, I don't remember anything like that. I just remember passing out on Mt. Ordeals, and when I woke up, I was greeted with Nyx's face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Huh...\" Queen Twilight mused. \"Well, perhaps the vortex opened directly above you and sucked you in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Who knows?\" the dragoon muttered. \"All I know is that we're here now, and we've gotta stop the monsters that snuck in here from our world.\" There was a pause. \"That is, if the two of you even want me along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twin gasps emanated from the room. \"Dash! How could you even think we wouldn't want you?\" Twilight exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I hurt you, Twi!\" cried Dragoon Dash. \"I literally, physically hurt you! Yes, I was under Nightmare Moon's control at the time, but that doesn't change what happened!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It makes all the difference, darling!\" Rarity countered. \"You said it yourself, you were under her control, and you were doing things that were against your will!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not entirely,\" replied the dragoon, a hitch in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was a brief moment of silence. \"Dash, what are you saying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dragoon Dash took a shuddering breath. \"Nightmare Moon... she doesn't always forcefully brainwash ponies. She likes to play on your desires, your wants. That's what she did with me, the first time. She looked into me, and saw that there was a small part of me that wanted you for myself, Rarity. She took that part of me and exaggerated it, so that I was willing to do anything to get you. Even... even kill you, Twi. How can I live with that, knowing that my own weakness almost cost both of you everything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rainbow Dash was in tears by this point. She had never been in a situation quite like the one her counterpart was describing, but still... they were the same pony, in a fashion. \"I don't think I could live with myself either, at that point,\" she murmured aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The dragoon was comforted by the presence of her friends. \"Dash, no matter what she did to you, the fact is you stood by us when it really counted, when the fate of the world was at stake,\" Twilight said reassuringly. \"And that's all that matters to us. I told you before, I forgive you for what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pinkie Pie took the job of comforting Rainbow, hugging her prismatic-maned friend. \"See? If that ever happens, Dashie, just stand by us when crunch time comes. That's all it really takes.\" The pink pony was unusually serious, and Rainbow hugged her back, letting her tears fall into Pinkie's cotton-candy-like mane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There were a few moments of silence. Then Dragoon Dash coughed. \"So, why are you guys the only ones who came along? Why not round up the old gang?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight sighed. \"Fluttershy's been busy rebuilding the village of Mist, when she's not visiting the Feymarch. She probably would have come if we'd asked, but she's got more important things to do than fight monsters. Applejack's busy at Stabul, training new monks to replace the ones lost against Colton. We can't pull her away from that, not for something like this. As for Pinkie... well, she'll probably pop up here when we least expect it, anyway. She's crazy like that. But she needs to stay and rebuild Epona.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Makes sense,\" the dragoon said. \"And yeah, she'll probably come flying in on the Surprise right when we really need it. She's uncanny like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Still, I do hope she stays in Epona for at least a while,\" Rarity mused. \"I mean, she'd been seperated from Chrysalis for a while. The two deserve to make up for lost time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wonder what Chrysalis is like here?\" asked Dragoon Dash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, we haven't asked yet,\" replied Twilight. \"But if Nyx is any indication, this world is far different from our own in terms of how ponies turn out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, I already saw this world's version of Spike. He's still a baby dragon, and apparently your double's assistant at the library,\" explained the dragoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Makes sense. He was magically aged thanks to Nightmare Moon's influence on our world, but if she never got to him here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Makes me wonder what Gilda's like, here. She's my old friend, after all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rainbow winced as she heard that. She hadn't spoken to Gilda since the day of that party. She still remembered the griffon's spiteful words to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, don't go looking, Dash. We're here for the monsters, nothing else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before anything more could be said...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rainbow Dash held onto Pinkie and turned away from the wall through which they'd been eavesdropping on the Gaians. She sighed as she prepared to fly the two of them back down to the Red Wings' ship. Deep down, she had been hoping to hear something that would implicate them in a plot. Something to ameliorate the sense of inferiority shed felt since her failure to do anything when the Malboro appeared. After hearing what she had, though, she just couldn't hold onto her suspicions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could think too much, though, she noticed Pinkie Pie's tail twitching out of the corner of her eye. Her eyes went wide with shock, and she pushed away from the tower wall just as a monster's claws sliced through the air where the ponies had been! Those claws were attached to a flying creature that looked like a large beak-faced gargoyle, which hissed at Dash and Pinkie. And it wasn't alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least a dozen monsters were flying around the tower, and many more filled the skies as cries of alarm spread throughout Canterlot castle. Pinkie Pie yelped and held on tight to Rainbow Dash as she juked and weaved through the air between the attacks of the monsters. Gargoyles, giant birds, creatures that looked like balls of living flame and even weirder things flew around them, lashing out at the ponies whenever they came into reach!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash's reflexes were put to the test as she had to evade the creatures while carrying Pinkie Pie. Lacking the weapons or armor of her Gaian counterpart, she nevertheless got in a few good kicks here and there, and would sometimes end up swinging her pink friend into one of the monsters in her attempts to dodge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, one of those monsters happened to be a Bomb, which got a face-full of Pinkie hoof as the earth pony was dragged and swung around through the air. It didn't burn to the touch, but recoiled a bit, flipping around a few times before righting itself, then glared at the two ponies. With an angry expression on its face, it started steaming and changing color as it gave chase, growing larger and more puffed up as it filled itself with explosive energy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven without knowing what it was, Pinkie Pie's Pinkie Sense was going off like crazy as she saw it draw closer, Rainbow being too focused on escaping the swarm of monsters to notice it! \"Rainbow! Behind us!\" She then scrunched up her face as she felt the sudden urge to sneeze, but only in her left nostril, which caused her to blink in surprise... and delight. \"Oh, you're actually gonna want to turn around to see this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow replied, \"<i>Kinda busy</i>, here!\" But nevertheless she glanced over her shoulder to see what was behind them. At the sight of the bomb, just moments away from detonating, she almost dropped Pinkie in surprise right there! But before it could explode, the sky behind it lit up even more brightly as the monsters between her and the tower were suddenly backlit by a pure white light that came from the horn of a unicorn that Rainbow was far more accustomed to seeing working with needle and thread than looking so... intimidating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the light as well, some of the monsters quickly tried to turn and flee, but to no avail as Queen Rarity unleashed Holy on them, the light from her horn splitting off into dozens of shining orbs that flew off in all directions, seeking out the flying creatures. The Bomb that had been chasing Rainbow and Pinkie got caught up in one of those spheres, and was instantly vaporized before it could detonate. Many other monsters followed suit as the balls of weaponized white magic sought out their targets but left Rainbow and Pinkie unscathed, clearing out the sky immediately surrounding them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHovering in the air with her jaw hanging open, Rainbow just gaped in astonishment and held onto Pinkie Pie while the other two Coltonese ponies flew from the tower. Dragoon Dash flew, carrying Queen Twilight who had at some point changed from her white, shining paladin armor into a much darker suit of plate mail. Holding a dark, wicked-looking blade in front of her with her magic, Dragoon Dash flew her into a patch of sky where the monsters were still fairly thick. Queen Twilight then swung the blade around in an arc that unleashed a wave of darkness, striking numerous creatures down before they could harm anypony.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With Dragoon Dash flying them around despite the heavy armor they both wore, Twilight continued using her Dark Wave to cut down scores of monsters, only pausing every so often to take a drink from her stock of healing potions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFighting the fatigue that was building in her wings, Dash said, \"I don't get it, Twi! You never get this many monsters all swarming on a place at once! Especially a city like this! Not unless-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless they're being coordinated by some sort of mastermind,\" Queen Twilight agreed. She lashed out with another Dark Wave, the deadly technique drawing on her own health and life force to send an arc of destructive energy cutting through the army of flying creatures. When she had a moment to look around, she scanned the ground and saw something that clearly didn't belong in the chaotic panic that had overtaken Canterlot. Someone moving calmly and methodically toward the castle gates. \"Down there! Land us in front of him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the monsters had been cleared out of the immediate area, giving the Royal Guard and their doppelgangers a chance to start protecting the civilians, so Dragoon Dash nodded and went into a dive to intercept the unnervingly calm stranger. Dropping Twilight down first, Dash then landed beside her and drew her spear. \"Alright, who are you and what're you doing here?!\" the dragoon demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stranger paused in mid-step and stopped to look at them. Standing larger than the average pony, and closer to the Equestrian princesses in stature, but with a stronger, more masculine build. Encased completely in black armor similar to Twilight's own, the intruder wore a purple cloak and a horned helmet. Not like a unicorn, though, but rather with two horns sticking out to the side, one on either side of his head. In fact, his body structure and the design of the helmet suggested that he wasn't a pony at all, but rather a large goat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Twilight asked, holding her dark blade out in front of her, though she felt increasingly uneasy as she looked at the armored goat. It wasn't simply his intimidating appearance, but the fact that he seemed familiar, somehow. \"Are you the one who set these monsters on Canterlot?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am,\" the goat replied, his deep voice sounding bemused as he focused his attention on Twilight. \"That is interesting armor you wear. If you are worthy of it, then you should already know who I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's he talking about, Twi?\" Dash muttered, keeping herself at an angle so that she would be ready to flank the goat at any moment?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Twilight replied, \"I'm not sure.\" To the stranger, she shouted, \"My name is Twilight Sparkle, queen diarch of Colton! As a guest of Equestria, I demand that you call off your monsters, then surrender and identify yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first she received no response, but then dark, tinny laughter came from the goat. \"Ha ha ha! Well, Twilight Sparkle, since you have given your name, I shall do the same. I... am Garland.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Twilight gasped, the parts of her not covered by armor turning pale. Dash glanced over at her, blinking in surprise at her reaction. \"Twi?! What's the matter? Who is this chump?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, good, you do know my name. Then you should also know that I will not surrender merely because you ask it of me,\" Garland replied. He then lifted up a cloven hoof and slammed it down into the ground, causing a tremor that caused the ponies to momentarily struggle to keep their balance as the street cracked open. From the fissure, an immense sword with a blade as wide and long as either of them rose up, the horns of his helmet glowing with magic as he took it up and held it in the same stance that Twilight held hers. \"To a true dark knight, such words are meaningless! Let your sword speak for you, and fate will determine who's demands are met!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing why Twilight was so shaken up, Dragoon Dash glared. \"Yeah, well fate can kiss my flank, pal,\" she replied, launching herself and thrusting at him with her spear. \"You mess with our friends, this is what you get!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dash, wait!\" Twilight exclaimed, broken from her trance by seeing her friend make the first move. \"He's--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a clash of metal against metal, sparks flying as the dragoon's spear was blocked by the blade of Garland's immense sword. \"Ha, yes, that's more like it! Show me what I have been missing in the eternity since I was cast into the void between worlds!\" The eyeholes of his helmet began to glow a baleful crimson color, his sword suddenly wreathed in dark magic. \"But if this is all you are capable of, then I, Garland, will knock you all down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant sword swung around, swatting Dragoon Dash away and through a wall with such force that the bricks shattered and crumbled from the impact. In the same swing, a Dark Wave far larger and more powerful than any Twilight had ever summoned erupted from the blade. The shockwave smashed through anything and everything in its way, but unlike Twilight whenever she used the technique, Garland didn't look even the slightest bit winded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the aftermath of the attack, Dragoon Dash groaned and picked herself up on unsteady legs, looking like she had been on the losing end of five rounds with a Behemoth. \"What... the hay...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still alive. Impressive,\" Garland mused, noting the sheen of a protective magic aura surrounding the pegasus. \"Even <i>with</i> assistance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to look at Twilight, who had exchanged the armor of a dark knight for that of a paladin, which is what had allowed her to access the white magic of a holy knight. Garland growled at her, \"You, however, disappoint me. Diluting the teachings I left behind by taking on the mantle of a paladin? Did you think that it would give you greater power? Let me show you what a <i>true</i> champion of Chaos is capable of!\" With that, he turned his blade on Twilight.</span></div></div>",

Looking up, they beheld the glowing form of Princess Celestia, who landed between them. There was no gentleness in her face now. Every line was hard as steel. Her eyes glowed partially white, a testament to her cold fury. The air grew warmer, showing that the alicorn was letting her nature as Regent of the Sun shine through. And when she spoke, every syllable echoed with the power of the Royal Canterlot Voice. \"<b>Begone, dark one. You are not welcome in my city, or my nation.</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Queen Twilight trembled as she beheld the power that was being brought to bear. She sidled over to Dragoon Dash, who was likewise semi-paralyzed in fearful awe. \"D-damn... Did our world's Celestia have this kind of power?\" asked the dragoon, who was still somewhat unsteady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No... she never displayed anything like this!\" replied the paladin-queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Garland, despite his helmet, was clearly uneasy about engaging such a foe. \"Your power is your salvation, Sun Goddess. For the time being. I shall do as you ask and leave. But make no mistake, I shall return, eventually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia narrowed her eyes as Luna and Nyx touched down on either side of her. Where Celestia glowed with the power of the sun, Luna shone like the many stars in the sky bespeckled her coat, instead of just her mane. Nyx's mane and tail writhed as though alive, though she lacked the visual impressions of the two elder alicorns. Still, she made her case known. \"<b>You think we'll let you come back without any repercussions?</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"<b>Thou art mad beyond reason if thou believes we would condone your return,</b>\" Luna added, her voice slipping into antiquated speech as her feelings got the better of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Garland chuckled as his sword sank back into the ground. \"Peace, goddesses. The Sun, the Moon, and the Shield are arrayed against me, and I won't return for some time. But return I shall, more powerful than all three of you combined. That is a promise.\" With that, he turned, and a pillar of fire engulfed him. When the flames cleared, he was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Up above, the monsters began to flee and disperse. With the one controlling them gone, their natural instincts took over, and they left the city. The Royal Guard pursued them to the city limits, aided by the Red Wings. When the last monster had fled, a barrier formed around the whole city, emanating from somewhere in the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The three alicorns let their power withdraw back into them, losing the extra features that channeling such power brought. Celestia sighed. \"I don't like doing that. I hate using my full power, or anything close to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"There wasn't any helping it,\" Nyx sighed. \"That... pony, and I use that term loosely, reeked of evil. It was worse than...\" She trailed off, looking down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Luna seemed to sense where the young alicorn's thoughts were heading. \"Be at ease, Nyx. Thou - ahem, you are Nightmare Moon no longer, and have not been for some time. Your friends and family see this, as do we.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx's next words chilled everypony. \"But there's always a chance of a relapse. No matter how much time I spend among my friends and family, there's the possibility, no matter how remoted, that I might go nuts again. Whenever I think about that...\" She left the sentence hanging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So don't think about it.\" Three alicorns turned to regard Dragoon Dash, who limped toward them, Queen Twilight by her side. \"Seriously, if you worry all the time about something coming true, eventually, it will come true. It's a... what's the phrase I'm looking for, Twi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"A self-fulfilling prophecy,\" supplied the queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, that,\" the dragoon said. \"Think about other things, like getting back at that tin can of a pony.

From the castle, the bearers of the Elements of Harmony converged on Nyx, catching her in a giant group hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Silly filly! You just gotta stay positive, that's all!\" Pinkie Pie said, hugging the alicorn tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Your days as Nightmare Moon are a thing of the past, dear!\" added Rarity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You haven't let us down since, and I'm not going to let you start moping about it now!\" Rainbow Dash declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're a nice pony, Nyx,\" was all Fluttershy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"All you need to do is believe in yourself and your own strength,\" finished Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With such a display of support, Nyx couldn't help but smile. She hugged the six ponies tightly, letting a few tears fall from her face. \"Thank you, all of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The tender moment was broken by Queen Twilight. \"Princesses, I apologize for spoiling the mood, but... in light of this attack, I believe a strategy meeting is called for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia sighed. \"I believe you're correct. In the wake of this attack, my decision has been made for me. You and your troops are welcome to lend your hooves to deal with the monsters of your world, as well as this... Garland character. First, however, I will need you to tell us everything you know of him. I'll have a strategy meeting called immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Less than fifteen minutes later, all the requested ponies for the meeting were gathered around a large table. The two reigning Princesses were there, of course, as were the bearers of the Elements, and Nyx. Also present for Equestria was Captain Shining Armor of the Royal Guard, his wife Princess Cadence, as well as the captain of Luna's personal guard. For the visitors from Gaia, the two queen diarchs of Colton were there, along with Dragoon Dash, Captain Trixie, and Zecora. The dragoon had been healed by the expert touch of Queen Rarity's magic, as though she'd never been hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Looking around, Celestia saw that everypony who should be here was. She coughed into a hoof. \"Everypony, may I have your attention?\" The mutters around the room fell silent. \"Thank you. In the wake of the recent attack, I've decided that the Red Wings of Colton are to be welcomed in Equestria. They have offered their help in dealing with the problem of the monsters, as well as their mastermind. Queen Twilight, please, take the floor. What do you know of this... Garland character?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Queen Twilight stood. \"What little I know about Garland comes from legends and myths.

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Queen Twilight took a breath and closed her eyes, thinking back to the records and legends she had read. \"Once upon a time, centuries ago, Garland was the strongest and bravest knight in all the nation of Capricorneria, a kingdom of goats that no longer exists in our world. It was a feudal era, with many nations constantly warring against one another. No one nation could gain much of an advantage over the others without the others focusing their forces on them, so the state of turmoil continued. Under Garland's leadership, however, Capricorneria's armies started aggressively seizing neighboring territories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unlike previous times that other nations had attempted this, though, Garland succeeded in gathering large amounts of territory for Capricorneria very quickly. He focused his attention on strategic supply points and political centers. Instead of setting his forces up in large army-to-army battles, he would lead strikes against his enemy's most vital points, personally defeating their best champions and overthrowing their leaders. Without their commanders, many of the enemy armies were quickly absorbed into Capricorneria's, and before the other nations could mount an effective defense, Capricorneria had grown into a powerful empire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some of the remaining nations fought to the bitter end. Others surrendered and were absorbed into the empire once their warlords realized that they couldn't hide behind their soldiers. Eventually, within Garland's lifetime, he had transformed his kingdom from a small feudal state into a superpower with no enemies that could threaten them anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was the last thing he wanted. To his people and his king, he was a hero. His king lavished him with honor, glory, wealth, and even offered him the princess's hoof in marriage. He didn't understand that the only thing Garland really cared about was battle. All the victories he had won hadn't been for Capricorneria sake, but for his own love of conflict. And with no serious challenges left outside of the kingdom, he turned against Capricorneria itself. He abducted the princess and stole her away to a nearby fortress, challenging Capricorneria to send its mightiest champions against him if they wanted to take her back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Dashes glowered at this part of the story, and Rainbow snapped, \"That rotten snake! I hope he got what was coming to him,\" before getting shushed by her librarian friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that. Please continue,\" Twilight Sparkle apologized to her double.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Twilight chuckled a little, then took a moment to gather her thoughts before she continued. \"Well, here's where things get a little muddled. According to the story, Garland defeated every warrior that Capricorneria sent against him, until finally four pony warriors of light from a distant land appeared. Led by a swordspony of matchless skill, they defeated him and rescued the princess. But even though the stories say he was killed in that battle, they also say that he came back soon afterward, wielding the power of darkness and commanding monsters to terrorize the lands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Supposedly, just before death could take him, his anger and thirst for battle drew the attention of a powerful, malevolent entity. It brought him back from the brink of death and gave him the powers of a dark knight. The very <i>first</i> dark knight. In exchange, he would spend the rest of his life spreading chaos and destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Twilight hung her head a little. \"Honestly, the records were so old, it was impossible to tell what was fact and what was fiction. Personally, I always assumed he was killed by the four warriors, and that the rest was a story made up after the fact to embellish how evil he was. It's true that when I was being trained in the ways of a dark knight, he was credited as the inventor of the techniques, but he still could have just developed the skills before his death. After meeting him today, though... I think he could actually be the real thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why would he appear before us now, and in Equestria rather than Gaia?\" Princess Luna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Twilight replied, \"When we fought, he mentioned having been imprisoned in 'the void between worlds.' Unfortunately... I think we are to blame. Perhaps he was banished from Gaia somehow, and when we opened a hole between our worlds, he was able to slip out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia interjected, \"Personally, I am more concerned with his stated goals. He seemed quite confident that he would be able to gather the power he would need to face all of us. You are the only one of us who knows the ways of the dark knights, your majesty. How would he go about doing so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Twilight thought deeply, shaking her head. \"I don't know... The skills I was taught weren't nearly on Garland's level, but when I use the Dark Wave, I sacrifice a bit of my own life force and convert it through my sword into chaotic energy that breaks apart whatever it hits. Garland himself calls himself a champion of chaos, so if there is some source of that type of energy he could tap into...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs one, the Equestrian ponies immediately groaned, \"<i>DISCORD</i>...\"</span></div></div>",

Princess Celestia had gone elsewhere, to fetch the Elements of Harmony. Hopefully, they'd be able to seal Discord back up again should Garland break the draconequess loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0On reaching the statue, the ponies were relieved that they'd arrived before the armored goat did. Luna sighed. \"Good.

A statue in a garden. Doesn't that strike you as rather... dangerous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Luna shrugged as Celestia teleported to the group. \"Tis how the Elements of Harmony decided to deal with him. What became of him on your world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dragoon Dash smirked. \"Sealed in the core of a moon, drifting off in endless space.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Equestrian ponies all blinked repeatedly. Queen Twilight smiled. \"Remember what I said when we were discussing the monsters earlier? We had a ship at one time that could take us to the moons orbiting Gaia. One of those moons was where we sealed Discord. Incidentally, that's also where we met your double, Princess Celestia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Is that so?\" asked Celestia as she distributed the Elements of Harmony to her ponies. \"Strange. Is your Celestia not connected to the sun as I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The question caused the Gaian ponies' eyes to bug out. \"Wait... connected to the sun?! What does that mean?\" the dragoon sputtered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Exactly what it implies,\" Twilight Sparkle said, slipping into 'lecture' mode. \"Princess Celestia is the Regent of the Sun, and she raises the sun daily to grace Equestria with light and life. Her power is tied to the sun, and she can draw on its immense power for extra strength if the need ever arises. Similarly, Princess Luna is tied to the moon, and raises the moon when night falls, as well as keeping the stars in order. Like Celestia, she can draw on the cold void of the moon and stars to fuel her power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was silence for a few moments. \"So that's what that energy was earlier, when you faced down Garland,\" Queen Twilight breathed. \"You were tapping into your respective celestial bodies to give you power! Except...\" She turned to Nyx. \"What is it that gives you power?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx smiled. \"I gain power from the knowledge that my friends and family will be safe when I stand up for them. I am a shield for the ponies of Equestria.\" The gathered ponies, both of Colton and of Equestria, smiled back at the teen alicorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The moment, however, wasn't to last. \"<i>Well, well, well, how sentimental,</i>\" came a drawling masculine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Everypony, even the Gaians, gasped as they spun to face Discord's statue... which was as solid as it had ever been. \"How are you able to talk?\" growled Celestia as she narrowed her eyes at the stone face. \"The Elements should have sealed you in all respects!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"<i>Six ponies, six chances for a weak link, my dear Celly,</i>\" came the reply. \"<i>Now, for the sake of your friendship, I won't name names. After all, you'll need to retain your trust in each other if you're to bring down Garland.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This caused everypony to blink. \"Waitaminute,\" Dragoon Dash said, stepping forward. \"You mean you <i>don't</i> want him using your power?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"<i>Of course not!</i>\" snarled Discord's voice, and he actually sounded angry. \"<i>That goat is using my power in completely the wrong way! I enjoy <b>chaos</b>, not destruction!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Queen Twilight cocked her head. \"Strange... you sound the same, but you're completely different from our world's Discord. He manipulated everypony to try and destroy the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"<i>Well then, with all due respect to myself, he is an idiot,</i>\" was the reply. \"<i>I never ask for anything, you know, but this once... stop Garland. He cares for nothing but death and destruction.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There were several moments of silence as the gathered ponies processed the draconequess's words. Then a deep masculine voice spoke. \"How disappointing.\" A pillar of flame on the edge of the group caused everypony to yelp as Garland was revealed. \"To think that a spirit of chaos would ask harbingers of order to stop an ally.\" A lightning bolt flashed between the horns of his helmet, lashing out to strike the statue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Several yells and exclamations followed the crack of the bolt, as the stone fell away to reveal Discord himself. He narrowed his eyes at the armored goat. \"While I appreciate the gesture, you are not my ally. You're not even my friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yet I could be,\" Garland replied, even as the various ponies glanced back and forth between the two. \"Why do you hesitate to aid someone who would aid you in making use of your full potential?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Maybe you weren't listening when I talked to the others,\" the draconequess said with a sneer, hopping down from his pedastel. \"I am a spirit of chaos. <i>Chaos</i>, not destruction. Allow me to emphasize my point. Celly, during my reign, do you recall if anypony ever died directly by my hand? Not because of me corrupting them, not because they got caught in an environmental shift, did I ever directly kill anypony?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia thought back on those dark days. Many ponies had died, some driven to suicide by the chaos, others dead because of changes to the landscape. But... \"No, you never killed anypony directly, Discord. Thank Faust for small favors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Discord gave a sardonic look to Garland. \"And there you have it. I'm quite proud that my hands are, more or less, unsullied by the blood of ponies. And I see no reason to change that. That means no allying with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Garland sighed. \"And here I'd hoped you'd be reasonable.\" With that, he threw a red orb at Discord, which expanded to swallow him whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The draconequess yelped, and beat his fists against the sides of the orb, before lightning began to play over his body, causing him to scream in agony. To the shock and horror of the ponies present, his body began to mutate. His serpentine body contorted and became more equine in nature, his horns moved to the center of his forehead and merged into one, and his wings lengthened and grew into large feathered wings. His arms and legs grew longer and gained hooves as the rest of his body continued to change. When the lightning was finished, and the orb vanished, Discord had been completely changed into an alicorn stallion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He staggered to his hooves, leveling a glare at Garland. \"How... How did you know about this?!\" he snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I've known of you since you were but an infant,\" the goat replied. \"How does it feel to be in your true form once more, Discord? Or should I call you Prince Harmony?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Prince?!\" exclaimed Rainbow Dash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Harmony?!\" gasped Twilight Sparkle. \"As in, 'Elements of Harmony'?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ironic, isn't it?\" Garland gloated. \"To think that your own creations could be used against you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Discord snorted. \"That's part of a life that's no longer mine, you fool. Change me back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Apologies, but I'm afraid I can't do that,\" the armored goat said. With that, he rushed forward past the stunned ponies, and slammed a hoof into the alicorn stallion's face, knocking him over. With a quick application of chain and a magic inhibitor ring, Garland had effectively disabled Discord's magic and flight. With that done, the goat latched on to Discord. \"You are but one half of a greater whole, Discord. It's time to return to Gaia, where you will be complete!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As a pillar of flame manifested around the two, Discord's eyes locked on to Celestia's... and the solar princess was startled by what she saw. Discord was terrified, and his last words conveyed that all too well. \"Celly! Save me!\" That was all he could say as the goat teleported them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Everypony stared at the spot where the two had been. Then Fluttershy looked up at Celestia, and gasped on seeing tears trailing down the white alicorn's face. \"P-Princess? Why are you crying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia took a ragged breath, and when she spoke, her voice was choked by repressed sobs. \"He...

Celestia had spent a good portion of that time trying to dry her tears, with little success. Still, when she addressed the room, her voice's strength had returned. \"I suppose I owe many of you an explanation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ta say the least, Princess,\" replied Applejack. \"Ah heard what ya said, an' ah <i>still</i> can't believe it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia took a breath. \"I believe starting at the beginning would be best in this instance. You see, it's a common misconception that alicorns are immortal. We aren't, at least for the most part. Luna and I are special, in that we are tied to our respective celestial bodies. That bond is what gives Luna and I our eternal life. Other alicorns, such as Cadance, do not have such a bond, and thus are far more limited in their lifespan.\" She nodded towards Cadance. \"She will still outlive the average pony of the main three breeds, but eventually old age will claim her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cadance nodded back. \"It's a bit of a pill to swallow, knowing that I'll probably outlive my husband, his darling sister, and all of my other friends,\" she said sadly. \"But at least my aunts will be here to help me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Luna took up the narrative. \"Cadance, unfortunately, is one of two remaining non-eternal alicorns. She has the title 'princess' merely because she is of higher noble standing than other nobles, including my many-times great-grandson, Blueblood. Unless she bears an alicorn foal, Celestia, Nyx, and myself will be the only alicorns left. And I'm not certain whether or not Nyx shares my eternal lifespan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And I'm not certain I want to,\" Nyx replied. \"I'm not sure I can handle outliving Mom and all of my friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia coughed. \"At any rate, Prince Harmony was a non-eternal alicorn from long ago. He and I met several times, and we grew to love one another. Prince Harmony's greatest accomplishment was the forging of the Elements of Harmony. He spent years working on them, determining what traits would be essential to maintaining harmony throughout Equestria. The first successful test was when a surviving group of Windigos tried to invade. The Elements banished them to the frozen northlands. It was after that event that Harmony proposed to me.\"  She smiled. \"I'd never been so happy as on that day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight frowned. \"So what happened? Why did Prince Harmony become Discord?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia sighed. \"As I said, he was a non-eternal alicorn. I think knowing that was a bit too much for him to swallow. After learning that I would outlive him, he started looking for a way to gain his own eternal life. He spent years working on it. More than once, I asked him to give up his quest, but he refused. He didn't want to leave me. And, after about a century, he came to me one day, and said he'd done it. He'd found a way to stay with me. I was curious, but he said it didn't matter, that we were now together forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Queen Twilight arched an eyebrow. \"And, let me guess. Shortly afterwards, things started going wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia sighed. \"It started out harmless enough. Small pranks on various ponies, an occasional change in his appearance, a random quip here or there. I paid it no mind. But the pranks started getting more creative, and less... harmless. His appearance would shift from one moment to the next. And his attitude towards order had been almost completely inverted. Still, I didn't see it. Or rather, I forced myself not to see it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cadance sighed knowingly. \"Ponies can do stupid things when they're in love, auntie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shining Armor coughed. \"Your Highness, when did you realize that Prince Harmony had truly changed for the worse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia winced. \"I didn't truly see it until one of 'Harmony's' pranks nearly got Luna killed. Even we eternal alicorns aren't truly invincible. The cloud Luna was napping on spontaneously became part of a rapidly-forming tornado of chocolate milk. Harmony had always liked chocolate milk. Luna barely escaped unscathed. But that was when I knew that Harmony was changed. When Luna and I confronted him, he told us he'd grown tired of the orderly world we'd made together. He just wanted to have fun. He was wearing the form of a draconequess by that time, and I knew that there was no bringing him back. I called him 'Discord', and he liked the new name. Shortly thereafter, Luna and I brought his own creations, the Elements of Harmony, to bear against him. The rest, as you know, is history.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was silence for several seconds. Then Queen Twilight coughed. \"Well, I apologize, but my forces and I must depart for Gaia immediately. Garland said that he was heading there, and we need to secure our borders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Waitaminute!\" Rainbow Dash interrupted, incredulous. \"What about all the monsters that were let loose into our world?

Twilight finally broke the silence. \"Nyx, what are you saying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx had a hard look in her eyes. \"I'm saying that I'm willing to offer my help to Gaia in bringing Garland to justice. And, like it or not, Discord is technically a citizen of Equestria, and I intend to bring him back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was silence for a few more moments, before Twilight smiled. \"Well, then I'm going with you! Goodness knows, an opportunity to study another world doesn't happen every day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Count me in, too!\" Rainbow Dash said, flying over. \"No way I'll leave you two hanging!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Woohoo! We can have a party in another world!\" Pinkie exclaimed, bouncing over to the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Studying the fashion trends of another world would certainly increase my own repertoire of designs,\" Rarity mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah'd be lyin' if ah said ah weren't interested, mahself,\" Applejack agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Um...

Besides, it's technically your princesses' call if you can come along or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's quite alright, I'm going with them,\" said...</span></div></div>",

She must have fallen from a great hieght, seeing as she was in the very center of a microcrater presumably made by her impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh by Celestia...\" Nyx rushed over to the foal, carefully placing a hoof on her chest. \"Breathing. Heart pumping. Good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her hoof came away, she noticed it was covered in glittering gray dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...that's weird. Worry about it later.\" The alicorn wrapped a gentle telekenetic field around the filly, lifting her carefully in order to avoid hurting her any further. \"Alright, my little pony, we're just going to take a quick teleport to the hospital. I promise you'll be okay in no time.\" Focusing her magic, Nyx disappeared from the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoft?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot booping, mind you, beeping. Totally different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her eyes slowly. A... bed? That was the word. Bed. Well, except it was a rectangle instead of a circle, which meant she couldn't curl up like she liked to. Anyway, where was this bed anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a screen next to her making weird lines. That explained the beeping. She considered taking it, but until she knew what it did there really wasn't any reason to. There were curtains around her bed... oh, and look! A little table next to her, with her hat on it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere on the moon was she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriosity piqued, the foal rolled out of the bed. The <b>Cartographer's Cap</b> was placed primly upon her head--no sense exploring without it, after all!--and she began to examine her surroundings more thoroughly. Nothing for it, she was going to have to open the curtain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad she been more focused, she might have noticed a number of subtle things. The dust coming off her, for instance. The sheer color of the place. Birdsong. But it wasent until she came face to face with the window and saw the bright blue sky that she finally understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This was not the moon.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried not to panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe failed utterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBursting through the only door in the room, the filly ran screaming down the hall with her forelimbs waving in terror. Nurses jumped from her path, pressing against the walls as the siren rushed past them. She went head-over-heals down a staircase, rolling to a stop at its base; calmly, she adjusted her <b>Cartographer's Cap</b>, shoook her head, and began running in panicked fear again. Eventually she managed to leave the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she stopped, and stared. Grass. Dirt, the real clumpy sorta wet kind. Buildings....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. Where am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are right outside Ponyville hospital.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe filly turned to look at the speaker.... and started screaming again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx sighed. \"And today is going to be a loooooooong day, isn't it.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nyx tried to interrupt the little filly's screaming, but her words were drowned out by the shrieks coming from the little pegasus, who was pointing up at her with a hoof, eyes bugged out in panic. When that failed, the alicorn sat down on her haunches and decided to just wait it out. As the scream continued, Nyx found herself watching and waiting with a raised eyebrow as she started to wonder just how in Equestria such a little pony could hold so much air in her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after getting tired of waiting, Nyx reached out to put a hoof over the filly's mouth. The grey pegasus apparently took this as a sign of aggression, however, and quickly snatched the <b>Cartographer's Cap</b> from her cute little head, re-folding it in a blink into a <b>Cartographer's Cutlass</b> with which she valiantly swatted against Nyx's leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough this was about as effective as one would expect from a sword made of paper, it <i>did</i> produce several very interesting results. The first was that Nyx noticed the cute little horn on the filly's head, revealing her not as a pegasus, but an alicorn! The second was that she noticed the cute little tiara she wore. The third was that as Nyx looked her over, she noticed the cute little Cutie Mark on her flank, and the crest of the moon that so resembled Princess Luna's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis took Nyx so much by surprise once it came together in her head that as the filly attacked with the<b>Cartographer's Cutlass</b>, the teenager faltered. As a result, instead of planting her hoof against the filly's mouth, she instead gently booped her nose. At the same time, the <b>Cartographer's Cutlass</b> poked hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of stillness as the two alicorns stared at each other. In that moment, drawn out through the sudden silence, there was a sense of connection between them. A spiritual bond, almost, allowing a sense of understanding to pass between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you... like jam?\" the little filly asked, breaking the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... sure, who doesn't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Evil</i> jam?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooo... I prefer grape,\" Nyx replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two ponies looked one another in the eye, the adorable pony princess saw the truth and sincerity in the teenager's visage. Truly, this was a mare who preferred <i>grape</i> jam over evil! A champion of delicious fruity spreads, pure and sacred. Not her evil doppelganger, grown large and powerful from the fruits of wickedness, as she had at first assumed. Woona felt so moved by the teenager's good and honest connection to non-evil preserves that tears welled up in her eyes, and she embraced the large black alicorn. A hug that spoke her apology for the misunderstanding so much more powerfully than mere words ever could, even those spoken in the <b>ROYAL CANTERLOT VOICE</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough a few words would have been appreciated, as Nyx blinked in confusion. \"Um... sooo... this is an awkward question, but... are you Princess Luna?\" She didn't know how the princess of the night would have ended up in such a state, though it was possible. After all, she had been reduced to fillyhood and Luna restored to full adulthood by transferring Nyx's excess magical power into the princess. Could something have happened to drain Luna's power, reverting her to this... utterly adorable state?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of answering with a straight 'yes' or 'no,' however, the filly bowed in a dignified manner and formally introduced herself. \"I am Princess Woona of Equestria, the Chosen Woon, Queen of the Moon Rocks, friend of the Lunar Mares, Bat-Ponies, and Minotaurs, and deposer of the Changeling Regent!\" As she finished, she gave a pose holding aloft the <b>Cartographer's Cutlass</b>.</span></div></div>",

No, I believe you, It's just...\" The black alicorn paused, unsure how to put this delicately. \"I've only ever heard of a princess Luna on the moon before.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Princess Celestia was in the middle of enjoying a brief period of rest and quiet in between her royal duties. Sitting in the middle of the royal garden, she poured herself a cup of tea and watched her many pets play in the sunshine. As she magically raised the teacup to her lips, a scroll suddenly popped into existence beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my. I wasn't expecting a letter today. I wonder if Twilight or one of her Ponyville friends have a report?\" Holding the scroll in front of her, she took a long sip of tea as she unrolled it and read its contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for her royal image, nopony was around to see either her eyes bugging out or the spray of tea that drenched the scroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LUUUNAAAAA! LUUUUNNNNAAAA!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night princess groaned, buried under her covers. To shut out sounds of shouting and banging against her bedroom door, she tried covering her ears with her hooves. When that didn't work, she picked up her pillow and jammed it down over her head, only for her sleep-drunk mind to realize after the fact that her horn made this a bad idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumbling to herself, she dragged herself out of bed and made her way to the door. After taking a deep breath, she gripped the handles with her magic and yanked the doors open. Her eyes bloodshot and star-lit mane messy from being interrupted in the middle of her sleep, she looked out at her sister and hoarsely croaked, \"WHAT?! What is important enough to drag me from mine slumber in the very middle of the day, dear sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia was outside, a hoof raised to knock on the door some more as she was flanked by the Lunar Guard who were stationed outside the princess's bedroom whenever she slept. Seeing her sister's condition, the elder princess looked her up and down and observed, \"Sister... why do you have a pillow impaled on your horn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna looked up at the pillow resting on her head like a letter on a spike. Downy feathers fluttered down around her face from the hole as she returned her attention to the princess of the day. A blush of embarrassment touched her face as she replied flatly, \"We asked thou first...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Luna. My apologies for disturbing your sleep, but I just received a letter from Twilight and Nyx that you must see.\" Celestia held up the tea-stained letter for Luna to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dear Princess Celestia,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new arrival has appeared in Ponyville. A young alicorn filly named 'Woona', which Nyx found in the Ponyville castle earlier this morning. According to Nyx, she looks exactly like she imagines Princess Luna did as a filly, and claims that you are her sister. If you and Luna are able, please hurry to Ponyville at your earliest convenience so we can make sense of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour faithful student,<br>\r\nTwilight Sparkle</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she read it, Luna's eyes widened much as Celestia's had minutes ago, her mane straightening itself into a more orderly flow as she grew more and more awake by the word. \"Woona? Thou means...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia nodded. \"Indeed,\" she replied, producing a second object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\nOption 1: An ancient map, drawn on thousand-year-old moon paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: A storybook Celestia wrote long, long ago for her sister about a filly named Woona and her adventures on the moon.</span></div></div>",

At the edge of the Stars, In a sea far away...\" Celestia trailed off, and Luna completed the rhyme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Lays things dear to My heart, that keep Darkness at bay. Oh, I should have never listened to the darkness within. I should have kept..\" Luna shook herself. \"I need to go into the Sea Far Beyond The Stars, and find the Island of Lost Memories.

Besides, she didn't have to interrupt the foals' playtime to deliver the news. Seeing a box of tissues, she levitated a few over toward herself and concentrated on a temporary transformation spell. One tissue was transformed into an elegant sun hat based on one she'd seen in Carousel Boutique. The other was transformed into a scarf that wrapped loosely around her neck and shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down on her haunches, the alicorn did her best imitation of Rarity's accent to play along as she replied, \"....I prefer degobah tea, darling. Did you hear about Blueblood's party?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the name, Woona suddenly gasped, her dapper monocle falling out of her eye and into the empty teacup in front of her before her eyes narrowed. \"<i>Blueblood!</i>\" she muttered icily, surprising Nyx and Owlsong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearing her throat, Nyx quickly raised a cup to her lips and daintily sipped the nonexistent tea. \"Ah, I can tell from your tone that you are well acquainted with him. That stallion may be a prince, but he is surely no gentlecolt. Everypony who actually knows him thinks so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis got a smile from Woona, who fished the monocle from her cup and put it back into place. \"Ah, yes, quite! And he's also quite the cheat at all manner of games.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx replied, \"Well, only a pony in the know would wear such a <i>smashing</i> hat, darling. You simply <i>must</i> give me the name of your haberdasher!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three ponies giggled and chatted for a few minutes more, giving Nyx a chance to get to know Woona a little better. For an alicorn who had survived the impact she had calculated earlier without a scratch, she came across as nothing more than a silly filly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, sir Multiplex, you're of the Fillydelphia Plexes? How marvelous, you and Owlsong simply must join me at my chalet this winter,\" Nyx said to the stuffed hydra before a cloud of mist flowed toward her, wrapping around the alicorn and getting absorbed into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRe-united with her other self, Nyx gained her copy's memories and said, \"Ah, good news, Woona. My dear mother sent a letter to the princesses--\" Nyx suddenly stopped herself. The little filly seemed to think that only Celestia ruled over Equestria. As Woona looked at her curiously, Nyx coughed and added \"--elestia. The princess-a Celestia. I'm sure that you will be able to see her soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was any chance of Woona catching her slip, it was gone the moment Nyx mentioned Celestia's name. A wide smile spread across Woona's face, her eyes glittering with joy before she leapt up into the air, her hat and mustache flying off of her as she let out a squeal with the force of the <b>Royal Canterlot Voice</b> behind it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna see my sister! I'm gonna see my sister! I'm gonna see my sister!\" the little filly exclaimed over and over as she bounced around, hugging Nyx and Owlsong and Multiplex repeatedly and getting a thin coat of dust over all of them. Nyx giggled at the sight and let her hat and scarf turn back into tissues, removing them from her body as she said, \"Since the doctors say you can leave, why don't we go to the library? The princess will probably be meeting us there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoona nodded happily and waved to the other filly before leaving. \"Bye, Owlsong! Thanks for the tea, it was great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx giggled and also waved, turning to go. Before she left completely, though, she levitated the tissues over to the recuperating filly and transformed them into a hat and scarf to fit her small stature as a parting gift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile...</span></div></div>",

We're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them dropped out of the sky, landing on Twilight's balcony.

It's still weird to think of us being related, and hello aunt Luna!\" She stepped back as the two walked in. \"I think Nyx is bringing, well, 'Woona' with her from the hospital. They should be here soon enough. Um... is Woona really Luna?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only insomuch as Nyx is,\" Luna replied primly. \"That is to say... she is of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight raised an eyebrow. \"Sorry, but... [i]of[/i] you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the night you were kidnapped,\" Celestia explained, \"Spell Nexus did manage to summon a portion of Luna's soul, the portion that was Nightmare Moon. Your blood was used to generate a body for her, but without her memories--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw,\" the unicorn interrupted darkly. Then she sighed, her demeanor becoming cooler. \"I'm sorry, you just sounded like... those fanatics that keep showing up trying to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I should explain, sister.\" Luna rubbed her forehead. \"The soul... when a child is born, naturally, the mother tears off a part of her own soul to give to it. The thing you must understand is that souls can regenerate, can... grow, but only if they are given a form to embody. What they took from me was purely anger and hate, but even Nightmare Moon is more than that, and somehow that anger and hate became a scared little filly in the forest.\" She gave a dark smile. \"I find it somehow gladdening that my seed was so small as to be almost buried by what Nyx became.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, are you saying you're Nyx's father?! And, and what does this have to do with Woona?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia and Luna exchanged glances, the sun princess looking away first. \"Well.... technically speaking, Luna would be the <i>mother</i> and <i>you</i> would be--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Skipping that! Images I don't need! Just... just focusing on Woona.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white alicorn giggled. \"For all that growing up you've done, there are still some things that never change my faithful student.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight gave Celestia a deadpan look. \"I was <i>fourteen</i> when I found out about the.... ugh, 'primal era.' Really, going into a catatonic state after seeing images of your princess with--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The point we wish to make,\" Luna interrupted smoothly, \"is that Woona is a portion of my soul. But there are... differences between her and Nyx. For one thing, she is from a more---childlike side of my personality, developed while I was....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an awkward silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....you know. And for another.... she remembers her \"adventures\" on the moon, which to be honest may or may not have happened.\" Luna shifted uncomfortably. \"I had years to... imagine, and there was this complicated story I made up while I was bored, but it's entirely possible that the story has somehow managed to... manifest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The unusual thing about Woona, when compared to Nyx, is that she comes from a fully developed alternate world.\" Celestia shrugged. \"That means her soul should, in theory, be attached to all the other souls that Luna imagined is somepony were to attempt to pull her out with the spell that Nexus used to make Nyx.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So all the wizards want a piece of Luna to make their artificial children?\" Twilight asked, somehow managing to keep her face utterly deadpan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, she has always been quite the prize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TIA!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The problem here is that we don't know if any of Woona's imaginary friends would also become real.\" The princess of the sun ignored her sputtering sister for the moment. \"To be honest we don't know how Woona came to be. When Nyx appeared, there was a massive... surge in magic, but this is unprecedented. I have no idea how Woona is existing in the physical realm, or if it would allow her friends to come with her. The worst part is she is unaware of any of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight sighed. \"I thought as much...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna, managing to get herself under control, gave Twilight a sympathetic look. \"Don't worry. We intend to explain the situation calmly and rationally but with the most tender loving care we can manifest and assure her that she is just as real as any other pony. We've all learned from the Nyx debacle.\" She coughed gently. \"Speaking of which, shouldn't she be here soon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She probably didn't want to teleport. I can imagine Woona's asking her all sorts of questions about Ponyville on the walk over, they'll be here in no--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door burst open, a panting Nyx staring wildeyed. \"YOU ALL HAVE GOT TO SEE THIS.\"</span></div></div>",

Granted, for a town in which Pinkie Pie lived, this wasn't actually that strange. What <i>was</i> strange was that the stage and curtains were all made up of some sort of grey matter. The curtains weren't hanging from anything, but instead went up a few dozen feet before fading out. Not only that, but even though it was the middle of the day and there was no sign of speakers or musical instruments, two spotlights with no apparent source shone down on the center of the stage while its lone performer danced and twirled a cane to a snappy ragtime number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid performer was Woona of course. The little alicorn filly was giving it her all to do an entertaining tap dance for the crowd of ponies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the princesses and Twilight stepped out to see, the librarian's jaw dropped open. \"What the... how is she doing that? <i>Why</i> is she doing that?

The moon dust will then shape itself into any form she wishes (because moon dust is known for being gentlecoltly) and can even vibrate to produce music.

There were two unicorns, a pegasus, and an earth pony. The pegasus (a mare) and one of the unicorns (both of whom were stallions) shared yellow coats and brown manes, giving Nyx the distinct impression that the two were related. Even their cutie marks were similar; each had one half of a firey blue wheel. The earth pony, the other mare of the group, was a dark brown, with a similar-colored mane. Her cutie mark was a wrench, similar to Applebloom's. Nyx doubted, however, that this was a cousin of the Apple family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But it was the remaining unicorn that drew most of Nyx's attention. His coat was ash-grey, while his mane and tail were a mix of red and orange. The spikey style gave the impression that the unicorn had flames instead of a mane. His horn, Nyx noted, was sharper than the norm, looking like it could easily pierce flesh were the unicorn so inclined. The last odd detail about the unicorn was his cutie mark. It looked like a capital letter 'B', mirrored and placed edgewise on the left side of a capital letter 'M'. Nyx couldn't begin to guess what such a cutie mark meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Seeing that they were starting to come around, Nyx doused her horn, and hid in the shadows of the room. She would judge whether or not they were threats before revealing herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ugh...\" Ashen Blaze moaned as he rubbed his head with a hoof. \"Gale, why didn't you tell me that that machine could explode if I channeled magic through it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was an indignant snort. \"I wasn't counting on you testing it so soon. It was still experimental. And thanks to you, it will probably remain experimental for a while longer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Were Ash's eyes open, he would have rolled them at the mechanic's annoyed tone. As it was, he huffed. \"Well, if you'd just have the courtesy to label the things that aren't ready for testing yet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Knock it off, you two,\" Gold Heart said. \"Gale, since Soul and I arrived late, mind telling us what the machine was supposed to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It was meant to work in tandem with Ash's artificial Element of Magic,\" Gale explained. \"The two working together would have amplified the effects of Ash's spells. At least, in theory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Considering how big that explosion was, I'd say it worked a little <i>too</i> well,\" Ash muttered, as he finally opened his eyes. Then he blinked. \"Come to think of it, just how big was that explosion? Because I don't recognize this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The other three opened their eyes, too. \"Oh, great. If we were blown so far away there's no identifiable landmarks, I shudder to think what my apartment looks like,\" moaned Gale, the earth pony covering her eyes with a hoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not to mention Canterlot,\" Soul Mage added. \"Of course, this could probably work as a side-show to one of Trixie's performances, assuming you can tone down the explosion enough...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Heart cuffed her brother with a wing. \"Be serious! We don't have any clue where we are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Or how we got here,\" Ash added, frowning. \"I can't see any holes in this room that would mark entry from four impromptu missiles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You know, that's one of the nicer things we've been called over the years...\" mused Soul. As Heart raised a wing to cuff him again, he backed away from her. \"Easy, sis! I'm just kidding!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Let him be, Heart,\" Ash said, and the pegasus stood down. \"First thing's first, let's get some light in here,\" he continued, lighting up his horn with an orange glow. Looking around, he sighed. \"Still don't see any - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ash! Behind you!\" Gale exclaimed, falling into a basic fighting stance. Soul reached out with a tendril of blue energy, and connected with his sister, wreathing the two in ethereal blue flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ash, knowing his allies weren't prone to over-reacting, whirled around to confront what had spooked them. What he saw caused his eyes to widen. \"Ah, <i>skvetch</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx knew her cover had been blown. Mentally, she berated herself for forgetting that a simple light spell was something any unicorn worth their horn knew. She was more interested in what she'd learned from overhearing them speak, as well as the blue flames surrounding the brother and sister pair. Still, she knew she had to defuse the situation. \"Whoa, there, calm down!\" she pleaded, holding her hooves out to the side to show she was unarmed. \"I'm not going to hurt you.\"</span></div></div>",

It's not every day you find a group of ponies suddenly appearing, especially not a place like this.\" Nyx sized the other ponies again, biting her lip lightly. \"I'd almost say you weren't from Equestria, because if you were, then you'd know about Castle Nightmare here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGale looked up at that. \"Castle Nightmare? No, never heard of it.\" She frowned in annoyance. \"Great, that machine threw us into a completely different universe. Oh, I hope it didn't do anything bad to ours...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think it did,\" Ash said as he activated PC. \"Every other time we've flown through the temporal fields between worlds it creates a sonic boom. Since that obviously did not happen this time, we can safely hazard the guess that our world is perfectly fine, we'll just need to get back to it...\" Ash trailed off as PC's screen filled with text. \"Well, I'm getting an energy reading that matches one of the Gems, but... Why are they here..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Energy reading? Gems? Do you mind cluing me in, please?\" Ash looked at Nyx, smiling thinly before offering a small, lazy salute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashen Blaze, <i>de facto</i> of the Order-Naries,at your service, Ma'am. My friends here are Gold Heart, Soul Mage, and Gale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a pleasure to meet you, Ashen Blaze and company. My name is Nyx. And,\" Nyx cocked an eyebrow inquisitively. \"The Ordinaries? Why would you name a team about being ordinary?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh sighed as Soul chuckled. \"No, we're mercenaries, who work to keep balance and order. We defend against anything that would cause chaos, like Tau'rin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx blinked, not really understanding but willing to go with it. \"That seems very interesting. Also, what is that thing on your head?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This? It's PC, a Portable Computer. It's basically a super-enhanced energy detection spell, attached to a locator matrix, equipped with a sarcastic and sometimes quite annoying persona.\" Ash seemed to glare at Nyx, before she realized he was looking at the device. \"Yes, you were supposed to hear that. Well, I can't help it if it's true.\" Ash shook his head. \"Whatever. Look, Nyx, it has been good meeting you, but if you can point us in the direction of your version of Ponyville, I would be much obliged.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, it's right over that way,\" Nyx said as she pointed through the window. PC beeped, Ash turning around until he was facing the opposite direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, there <i>is</i> a Gem here... I can't tell where, though, and I don't know why there would be one without Tau' here as well. It just wouldn't make sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGale started towards the door. \"Well, fearless leader, do you want to go after the Supposed Gem, or the Actual Town?\"</span></div></div>",

Ugh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Rainbow Dash? Pinkie Pie? Mom?!\" Dash looked up to find a pony looming over Twilight, a glint in her eyes. <i>No, that's no pony, that's an <b>Alicorn!</b></i> \"Nightmare Moon! Step away from my friend before I have to get physical!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx's eye twitched. \"Seriously, Rainbow Dash? did you hit your head or something? I'm just checking to see if my mother is okay.\" Nyx looked back at her mother, barely sparing Rainbow Dash a glance, though she seemed somewhat... different. Did she style her mane?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow gasped, backpedaling as she stared at Nyx and Twilight with growing horror. \"N-no... No! That's- that's not true! Twilight can't be your m-mother! She's my best friend, a-and you... you're... you're-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, hello, stranger! Woooowwww, I wonder where in Sugardia we are this time- oh, better yet, <i>when</i> we are! I wonder where Fluttershy went, she always knows what time it is! Hey, Twilight, wake up! We're down a teammate! We need your sciencey smartiness, Twilight!\" Nyx was soon completely ignored as Pinkie started shaking Twilight, who whimpered in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey now, you can't just go shaking ponies awake like that, she might have a concussion, Pinkie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie looked up at Nyx, whose eyes were quavering with worry, and she smiled bashfully. \"Oh, sorry. I get a little carried away sometimes.\" Pinkie stepped back as Nyx leaned over Twilight, horn aglow with a healing spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight started stirring, and Nyx's horn stopped glowing as she sighed with relief. \"Mmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, wake up. You've been injured, it looks like you're close to magical burnout.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight squeezed her eyes shut, squirming a bit on the hard ground before curling up. \"Juss fiev mur menuss,\" she mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx giggled. \"Oh, mom, you're still you... I guess I'll have to eat all these chocolate chip pancakes on my own...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight's eyes snap open, and her stomach gives off a particularly loud grumble. The room is silent for a moment before Pinkie and Rainbow started giggling. \"Shut up, I used up too much energy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight looked around at her surroundings, not noticing the other pony present until she looked up into her teal, draconic eyes. \"Hi, mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike was busy cooking up some grub for dinner that night, sucking on a small emerald as he worked. \"... KYYYYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!\" Pots and pans clattered and fell from their hooks as a yell- a very <i>familiar</i> yell- cut through the peaceful quietude of that simple afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight! Twilight, are you alright?!\" Food abandoned on the stove (after turning flicking the stove top down to 'simmer', of course), Spike ran out into the library's main room, and then up the stairs, where he found Twilight sitting on her rump before her desk, face splattered with ink. \"Twilight, did you get ink in your eyes? Oh my goodness, that was scary! Why'd you scream so loudly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...\" Twilight cleared her throat, a magically procured towel wiping ink off her face. \"Th-that wasn't me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom,\" Nyx cried out as she ducked beneath a gout of flame. \"Mom, it's me! Nyx! Your daughter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I'm not gonna fall for th-that! I know w-who you are, N-Nightmare Moon, and we shall defeat you, and stop Lavos from ever destroying the world!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, woah, woah, destroy the world?! Why would I want to do that?! I live here! My friends live here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight, still in hysterics, cackles. \"Friends?! What friends?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx stands up proudly, a smile spreading wide across her face. \"Why, the rest of the Cutie Mark Crusaders, of course! Me, Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle, and Scootaloo have been friends for years now!\" Her smile faltered when she saw the crazed look in her mother's eyes go from 'Freaking out!' to 'What's sanity? I got fire!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buuuuurrrrn the witch!\" Twilight shrieked as she let loose a terrifyingly large fire spell. Nyx brought up her Shield spell just barely before the fire spell's impact, sending her careening towards the wall, before bouncing off of it, her spell dropping with a <i>pop!</i> as she charged up a stun spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, stop this!\" Nyx released her spell, hitting Twilight square in the chest and staggering her, but the armor she wore seemed to diminish the spell's effect. \"I- I don't want to hurt you!\" Nyx was getting scared, and Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie were not being very helpful, to her or her mother, as they sat huddled against the wall, staring wide-eyed at the two combatants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx gasped for breath, tears of confusion blurring her vision. \"M-mom,\" she said, her voice straining with emotion. \"I... I just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just don't know what's going on!\" Twilight ran through Ponyville's streets, Spike bouncing along on her back as Pinkie and Rainbow Dash bounced and flew along beside her, respectively. \"That scream sounded like me, but I know it wasn't me! The only other pony I can think of whose vocals might sound similar would be Nyx! I'm glad you two could drop everything and help, I don't know what I'd do if I had to fight something that made <i>Nyx</i> cry out in fear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Twilight! We're your friends!\" Dash gave Twilight a smirk as she started pulling ahead. \"We're always here to help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why aren't you helping me kill her?!\" Twilight roared in anger and pain as she sent yet another Firewall at Nyx, the young Alicorn teleporting closer to her so the spell harmlessly sailed past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, I don't kill ponies! I could've killed Nightmare Moon's general when we had her and her two friends, but I didn't because that would be wrong!\" Dash flew up to Twilight's side and wrapped her forelegs around the purple unicorn. \"You don't have to do this, Twi. I freaked out a bit when I first saw her, but she hasn't done anything to hurt us since we woke up. Fuck, she even healed <i>you,</i> and unless she's the stupidest villain in the universe, she's not the Nightmare Moon we need to defeat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight sagged into her friend's reassuring grip, tears welling in her eyes. \"I'm sorry,\" she whispered. \"I'm sorry... I'm sorry...\" Nyx folds her wings and slowly trots forward, giving her- no, this wasn't her mom, it seemed- a reassuring nuzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. I'm sorry for startling you. I guess-\" Pinkie let out a gasp,and promptly fell on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pinkie Pie, are you okay?\" Twilight slowed to a stop and looked at her pink-coated friend. They were in the castle's courtyard, and Pinkie had tripped right as she entered through the gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, I'm fine,\" Pinkie said, her voice wavering as her teeth chattered. \"T-teeth chatter... eye twitch... Hoof flutter... nose itch, I-I'm getting a doozy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A d-doozy,\" Pinkie repeated as she began to vibrate, slowly advancing across the floor. \"I guess I never told you about my Pinkie Sense, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I guess not.\" Twilight's tears were forgotten as she saw her friend's body twist and convulse into patterns not even she could perform when drunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, it's a little bit of an e-e-early warning system, like wh-wh-when my tail twitches, it means something's g-g-gonna fall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, like when we fell from the Gate while trying to get the Moonstone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly!\" Pinkie's body was now vibrating so quickly, it was like there was a large earthquake happening, and only affecting her. Suddenly, she shot straight at the door, stopping just short of it, and landing on her hooves. \"Huh, that was new. What? Hello? Weeeeiiiirrrrd. Eeeechoooo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pinkie, what are you doing?\" Pinkie turned to look at her friends running down the corridor towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This door is saying the same things that I am, exactly as I say them! Isn't that neat, Twilight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... is this the doozy you were talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, nope! the doozy's on the other side of that door, though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then let me pull it open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Thumf, thumf, thumf.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's stuck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because you gotta push it, not pull it!\"<br>\r\n\"That's because you gotta pull it, not push it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie blinked and looked at the door, before grasping the handle with her hooves. \"And... no-woah-oof!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie lay sprawled in front of the open door. \"Oww...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie rubbed her head, hissing in pain at the bump. \"You said it. Can you get offa me, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie grunted, a hoof to her head. \"Yeah, hold on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Pinkies suddenly stopped moving, before turning their heads towards each other, their noses barely a centimeter apart. \"Hi, I'm Pinkie Pie! It's good to meetcha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight groaned. \"There's two of them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight whimpered. \"I'd just gotten my sanity back...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will happen next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1: The Doubled Dashes and Twin Twilights are immediately suspicious of their doppelgangers, causing tensions to build again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2: Curiosity wins out over suspicion as Nyx moderates between the two groups.</span></div></div>",

Her mind raced, trying to figure out what was wrong, when a logic circuit tripped. <i>Wait,</i> she thought. <i>I left Mom at home. She said she was going to be there all day, reading some of the new stock that came in. How did she get here ahead of me, and...</i> she leaned closer, taking a whiff before recoiling, <i>and why does she smell like she's been on the road for a while?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Looking the unicorn over, Nyx could tell there was something amiss. Twilight didn't keep herself up to the fastidious standards of Rarity, but Nyx knew her mom had gone through a shower that morning, and was generally clean more often than not. The mare on the ground, though, had not gone through a thorough cleaning in some time. This, combined with the fact that Twilight wasn't prone to changing plans on a whim, left Nyx confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Only one way to find out what's going on,</i> she thought. She carefully poked the unicorn with a hoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight Sparkle groaned as she felt a hoof poke her. The spell she had used to escape from Shining Armor had taken a lot more out of her than she'd thought. <i>Then again,</i> she reasoned, <i>he is the most powerful shield-caster alive, so breaking through his shields take proportionately more energy.</i> She groaned again as she took stock of her magic reserves. <i>I'm going to need an ether potion soon. I didn't quite overchannel, but close enough to be dangerous.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A hoof prodded into her side again. Careful not to strain herself, Twilight opened her eyes. She promptly shut them when the sunlight set off an explosion in her brain. \"Ow... is this what a hangover feels like? Because if so, I'm never going to drink anything alcoholic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Probably for the best,\" a young female voice said. Twilight placed the age range somewhere in the teens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Who are you?\" she asked, carefully cracking an eye open. There was no explosion this time, so she opened it wider. She was in a dark room, made of stone. Glancing around, she couldn't see the speaker, at least not from her position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was a slight pause. \"My name isn't important. What's yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight carefully started twitching various limbs, testing which ones were in working order. \"Twilight Sparkle, daughter of Viceroy Night Light of the Lunar Court.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I see...\" There was another pause. \"I don't mean to sound rude, but you sound like you may have overchanneled a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight opened her other eye at that, just to roll it. \"Not quite, but close enough for government work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"In that case, I'll ask a couple more questions, just to make sure your head is all right. If that's okay with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The unicorn was about to protest, but thought better of it. <i>Better safe than sorry, as the saying goes,</i> she thought. \"Alright, shoot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What's the currency in Equestria?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight stretched a foreleg. \"The bit, with ten jangles per bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Who's the current head of state?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The other foreleg stretched. \"Princess Luna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A brief pause. \"Right. Do you have any siblings or children?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hind legs, both at the same time. \"One sibling. He's Captain of the Royal Guard. As for children, no. I've never been interested in that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"One last question. Do you know of Celestia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight shuddered at that. \"Yes, I know of her, though she's commonly called the Tyrant Sun, Corona. She went mad with power one thousand years ago, and Princess Luna was forced to seal her away into the sun, although she recently escaped. She's currently at large somewhere in the Everfree Forest, last I heard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I see...\" the voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight, now feeling able to stand, did so, glancing around. However, she still couldn't make out who was speaking. Perhaps they were hiding in the shadows, though their coat had to be pretty dark for that to be true. \"So, am I mentally sound?\" she asked sardonically. She knew she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, a few things you said don't add up with things I know,\" came the response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight blinked. \"Such as?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"First of all, while there is a Night Light living in Canterlot, he is not a Viceroy, nor does he possess any noble title. He's just exceptionally well-off. Second, while Princess Luna is Co-regent, she is not the head of state. Third, your description of Celestia is somewhat of a mirror of what is commonly known to have happened to Luna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And finally,\" the speaker said, emerging from the shadows, \"the Twilight Sparkle I know calls me her daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight took one look at the pitch-black alicorn, and screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx's ears folded back at the shrill shriek that came from the mare before her. <i>At least it's not as bad as when Rainbow Dash snuck a joke snake into Mom's chem lab. I think more beakers popped from her scream than from her magic spazzing out.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The unicorn's next words surprised her. \"Please don't hurt me, Princess Luna! I swear I didn't mean to run, I just didn't want my dad to be disappointed in me, and - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A swift application of a hoof later, the stream of words had been silenced. \"I believe we have a communication problem here,\" Nyx said, rubbing her head with her other forehoof. \"I never claimed to be Princess Luna.

She was familiar with changelings (as familiar as she could be, given that the changeling invasion of Canterlot had occured prior to her creation). There were a few things she knew about them. One, they were pony-sized and proportioned, for the most part. Two, they had black chitin and dark blue shells around their barrels. Three, their eyes were typically a featureless blue. Four, they had teal-ish short manes and tails, if they had any at all. It was theorized that changelings who deviated from this design were royal changelings, and therefore greater threats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx's concern was understandable, given that the creature before her, while sized like a typical changeling, had several key differences in appearance. The first was that its shell was a deep orange, as were its mane and tail. The second was that said mane and tail were much longer than the norm, and styled in ponytails. The third was the presence of a crown, studded with topazes, atop the changeling's head. If that wasn't a clue that this changeling was royal in nature, nothing was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay, get a grip, Nyx,\" the alicorn told herself. \"You've just found a royal changeling in the castle, so there's plenty of time to deal with it before it becomes a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Still, something seemed amiss. Why would a royal changeling be here, in the middle of Castle Nightstone, in its true form? Nyx frowned. It seemed like the only pony who could answer the question was the changeling itself. Nyx walked towards it, charging a spell, ready to let fly at the moment of treachery. She then prodded the changeling with a hoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She groaned. <i>What did ah drink last night?</i> she wondered to herself. <i>Oh, right. Last night was Pinkie's 'Welcome to Ponyville Again' party. Ah think ah got a little wasted.</i> She smacked her lips a couple of times, then grunted as she felt her fangs. \"Consarnit, must've changed back sometime while ah was drunk,\" she mumbled. Oddly, though, she didn't feel the trademark headache that came with having a hangover. \"Mebbe ah didn't drink as much as ah thought?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good, that'll keep your head clear while you answer some questions,\" came a cold, yet youngish voice from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The unfamiliarity with the voice caused her to snap her eyes open, and look up. Whatever retort she had on her mind was instantly swapped for yelping in mortal terror. \"<i>Nightmare Moon</i>?!\" She scrabbled away from the midnight alicorn, but didn't get too far before she slammed headfirst into a wall. Rubbing her head with a hoof, she spun around to face the menace. \"T'day just keeps gettin' better 'n better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nightmare Moon's horn was glowing, though her eyebrows had arched. \"Been a while since I've heard somepony call me that name. I go by Nyx, these days. Or does information not get to the hive like it used to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She felt her temper flare. \"Ah dunno what yer talkin' about,\" she said shortly. <i>Gotta get to Twi somehow, she'll know what ta do about Nightmare Moon</i>, she thought to herself. Out loud, she said, \"So, why kidnap only me? What makes me special, aside from the obvious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nightmare Moon blinked repeatedly. \"Kidnap? I'm afraid you're mistaken. I found you here in Castle Nightstone, unconscious. I was wondering if you could tell me how you got here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She narrowed her eyes. The midnight alicorn didn't seem to be lying. <i>Then again, she's probably had centuries of experience,</i> she reasoned to herself. She decided to ask about something else. \"Castle Nightstone? Never heard of it. Where's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The eyebrows came up again. \"You must be really behind the times in the hive. Castle Nightstone is where I ruled Equestria for two weeks before giving up my authority to the Princesses again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She stared, then uttered a single word. \"Horseapples. Ah was there, ya got beat by me, Twilight, and the others usin' the Elements of Harmony. Yer reign didn't last a day, much less two weeks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The alicorn's nostrils flared. \"I find it hard to believe that a changeling could claim to bear one of the Elements of Harmony. Who do you think you are, you bug?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>That</i> got her dander up. \"Who do ah <i>think</i> ah am?\" She willed herself to change, emerald fire changing her into her familiar earth pony guise. \"Ah'm Applejack, Bearer of the Element of Honesty.\"</span></div></div>",

The gold leaf around the sleeves and neck, while undeniably stylish, did little to change Nyx's first impression. For all she knew, this pony could be a leader of such a cult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made it to the prone pony without incident, however, her senses detecting no threat, and the mysterious pony showed no sign of consciousness. Paranoia and past traumas giving way to concern, Nyx pulled the hood away from their face and gasped in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying there, dead to the world, the pony appeared to be a stallion, albeit a rather slim, almost androgynous one. A stallion with a black coat to make the coat he wore, much like Nyx's own, but also a bright pink mane. What had startled Nyx, however, was none of these factors, but rather that he possessed the tufted ears and fanged mouth of a thestral. A brief lift of his coat's tail confirmed it as Nyx saw the large bat-like wings tucked against his sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThestrals (or \"bat ponies\" as they were more informally known) were a rare sight, as most of them kept to themselves in their colonies in mountain caves. Most of the exceptions that other ponies saw were either merchants trading for the fruits they ate, or those who left their colony to join the Night Guard, which had understandably grown in the years since Princess Luna's return. To see one in the light of day was still extremely uncommon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thing that Nyx found curious was that the mysterious thestral was clutching several books between his forelegs, but was wearing no saddlebags with which to carry them. Nyx carefully cracked one open with her magic, but found it written entirely in a foreign language that she couldn't even recognize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were many questions surrounding this stranger, but Nyx decided that she should try to wake him. If she couldn't, then she would have to take him to the hospital. And let her mother know about him and his books, in case she could figure anything out.</span></div></div>",

YOU WOULD... NOT DARE!</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would and I will. The evils you would visit on this world are unthinkable...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven now, he knew that he could stop. Chrom was racing across the battlefield to reach them, Falchion in hand. All Robin would have to do would be to wait long enough for the young Exalt to land the finishing blow and Robin's counterpart from another world would fall, but the power of Chrom's strike would only send Grima into a state of hibernation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt could be centuries, or even millennia before the fell dragon rose again, but it would still rise to threaten the world once more. Only Grima's own power could truly kill him, but there was a price to be paid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a price that Robin was willing to pay, as one who had been bred to be Grima's host. Throughout the wars which he had taken part in as Chrom's tactician, he had always strived to protect everyone he could. This was no different. His essence was identical to the version of himself who had become Grima, and by extinguishing the fell dragon's existence, it was virtually certain that he would be destroyed, himself. Yet even if he ceased to exist, and could never again be with those he loved, he knew that this sacrifice would secure the future of countless generations to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In some ways, I--we share the blame. It's only right we meet our end together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"clred\">...NOOOOOOO!</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrima howled in fear and despair as Robin gathered the dark magic into a ball and cast it at his dark doppelganger. The dragon's body on which they stood let out an ear-splitting roar as the sorcery ate away at its human body until nothing was left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence reigned over the battlefield as the undead Risen Grima had summoned to protect itself began to fall and crumble into dust. Chrom and his army lowered their weapons and looked toward Robin, unable to celebrate their victory just yet as they all knew what this meant. Sure enough, a black mist began to emanate from Robin's body as the very same sorcery he had used against his double now began to claim him as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin! No!\" Chrom finally reached his friend, clenching his teeth in grief as he knew that it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the dark magic slowly began to eat away at Robin, the pink-haired tactician turned and gave his lord and good friend a peaceful smile. As much as it pained him to leave his friends and family behind, there was no turning back now, so Robin thought back to the times that they had all shared, all the way back to that field in which Chrom and his sister had found him and taken him in like a stray pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as his body began to dissolve away, Robin's memories of his time as Chrom's tactician shone in his mind like precious gems. The conversations they had shared, the odd assortment of characters that had joined them... his rather unorthodox marriage proposal to the dark mage Tharja... meeting Noire and Morgan, their children from an alternate future that Grima had destroyed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs sad as he knew that he should be to think that he would never be with them again, Robin couldn't help but laugh happily as the memories filled him with such love and joy. Unlike Grima, he had lived a full life in the few years since he had woken up in that field, surrounded by the most wonderful people he could imagine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Chrom. For... everything... Tell the others... my last thoughts were of them... May we meet again, in a better life...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin! No! Ah gods, NO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin's smile widened, and he waved one last goodbye to his friend before his vision faded away entirely.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--ever seen this language before. This one looks like a spellbook, but these diagrams... if they're spell matrices, it's unlike anything I ever learned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think we should tell the Princesses about this, mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely. Spike...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already on it, Twilight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my... Twilight, I think he's waking up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin fidgeted slightly as consciousness slowly returned to him. He made out voices, though his sluggish mind took a while longer to process what they were saying. The fact that he was hearing anything at all was something of a surprise, but his body felt too weak and tired to respond in any way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, he cracked one eye open and immediately winced as the bright light stabbed into his brain like a hot knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear, he's in pain,\" one of the voices exclaimed, followed by a stern male voice demanding to know, \"Hey! Who opened the blinds!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that was me, doctor. It was far too dim and gloomy in here,\" a posh woman's voice replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because thestrals are nocturnal! They're sensitive to bright light,\" the doctor snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I'll get it,\" stammered one of the other voices... the soft, gentle one who had noticed him waking up. In moments, the intense brightness faded to a more tolerable level, and Robin slowly tried to open his eyes again. They still needed time to adjust, but as he peered through a fog of blurriness, he made out a faint shape hovering over him... one with pink hair like his own. \"I drew the blinds. Is that better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Robin's mind put together the soft voice and pink hair, creating an image in his mind of his elder daughter. \"... Noire...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother voice asked, \"Noire? Isn't that Prench for 'black?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin ignored it, though, instead summoning all of the strength he could gather into his tired body. He suddenly pushed himself up, wrapping his arms around the shape in front of him. \"Noire...! I'm... I'm so glad to see you again... Your mother... and Morgan... are they here too...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of answering, 'Noire' simply let out a startled squeak as Robin embraced her, his arms wrapped around her to the wings sprouting from her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Wings...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let go of Fluttershy, buster, or I'll buck you in the head!\" This was a new voice, sounding raspy and gruff, but feminine like most of the others. He suddenly felt his embrace getting broken as he was shoved roughly down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rainbow Dash, stop! He's obviously disoriented!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Twi, he attacked Fluttershy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eep...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seemed more like he mistook her for someone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter if he did or not, this is a hospital, for Celestia's sake, and only I get to assault my patients! So move it on out of here so I can do my sun-blasted job!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the confusion and shouting, Robin rubbed his head and tried to clear it as he felt himself waking up more completely. In doing so, he felt his hoof touch one of his ears, which was long and tufted. Then, he started to realize that he had a hoof instead of hands. Then his vision cleared, and while the sunlight still seemed quite harsh despite being filtered through the thin blinds, he was still able to get a clearer view of the beings that were surrounding him, including the one he had mistaken for his future daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one word, the tactician once again drew everypony's attention back to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... What...?\"</span></div></div>",

He had seen many horses, pegasi, and even the occasional unicorn in the Ylissean army, of course, though never ones so... colorful, let alone capable of speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Seven females, one male, and a small purple reptile,</i> he thought quickly as his mind quickly analyzed the ponies. <i>The stallion is the only one clothed, aside from the orange mare's hat. He referred to me as his patient, so he is the physician. The reptile is holding a quill and parchment in his claws. A scribe or servant, perhaps. One of the mares is unusually large and possesses both wings and a unicorn's horn. Unique eyes as well. She and the others are glancing toward the purple unicorn, however, including the doctor. SHE is the leader, here.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an unique ability of his, to size up the capabilities of others at a glance, especially while in a combat situation. His uncanny abilities in this regard were somewhat less honed outside of war and battle, but he could still be a decent judge of character, most of the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies,\" he said, addressing the pink-maned pegasus in particular, whom he had mistaken for his daughter. \"I'm... rather disoriented. My name is Robin. Did you all bring me here?\" <i>Most likely I've somehow ended up in an Outworld. One in which equines are intelligent, rather than mere steeds. Given that I have hooves, I would seem to have been transformed into one of their sub-species. The Outworld gate never caused physical transformations before, but I have never visited one like this, either.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unique black-coated mare raised one of her wings. \"I did. I found you unconscious in Nightstone Castle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A castle, this time? A step up from a field, I suppose,</i> Robin sardonically thought to himself as he recalled his first clear memory. At least he still had those, this time, from being found by Chrom to saying goodbye after striking the final blow against Grima.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found his mind drifting through his memories, grateful that the names and faces of his companions still came to him so readily. He was alive... and so were all of them. That meant that there was still a chance to see them again, if he could find this world's Outworld gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't realize that his eyes were tearing up until the completely pink one offered him a handkerchief. \"Awww, it's okay! I mean, sure it's not a <i>great</i> place to fall asleep in, but you're okay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin shook his head and chuckled as he took the handkerchief to wipe his eyes. \"No, no, it's alright. I'm just happy to be alive. My friends and family are going to be waiting for me to get back to them. How long do you expect I will have to stay here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis question was directed toward the doctor, who grumpily replied, \"Well, we didn't find any obvious signs of trauma while you were out, but we'll need to give you a check-up just to be on the safe side. After that, we should be able to sign you out, and then you aren't my problem anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin nodded, only to be startled by the sight of the purple unicorn's horn began to glow with a violet aura. In a similar-colored field of magic, a book which he quickly recognized as his Nosferatu tome levitated in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll get out of your way then, doctor. It's nice meeting you, Robin, and we'll talk after you've gotten your check-...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put that down!\" Robin's voice snapped through the room as he practically lunged out of his bed, only to stumble as he was unfamiliar with his body's new center of gravity. Bat-like wings flapped and flailed with the rest of his limbs as he struggled to reach the book, only to get blocked by the orange mare and an incredibly multi-colored pegasus. The tall black mare also stepped in front of the started unicorn protectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder other circumstances, Robin would not have reacted so violently. The Nosferatu spell was dark magic, designed to draw the life force from a foe into the caster, healing their own injuries while harming their enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs dangerous as it could be in the hands of a skilled practitioner, the book itself was merely an ornate paperweight to anyone untrained in the dark arts. Robin had never seen someone use magic itself to carry magical tomes before, though, and the potential dangers of the interaction between such magic and the spells within the tome were what drove the tactician into such a blind panic.</span></div></div>",

Not all of it, anyway.\" She took a deep breath. \"Okay. Do you have the legend of Nightmare Moon in your dimension?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Calliope nodded. \"Yeah, I'm from one of the dimensions where Aunt Luna went nuts 1000 some-odd years ago, and tried to blanket the world in eternal night, yadda yadda.\" She glanced at Nyx. \"Y'know, come to think of it, you kinda look like her when she went Nightmare on us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx sighed. \"Okay, so I don't have to give you Nightmare Moon's history... good. Well, about two years after Luna's return and purification by the Elements of Harmony, a cult dedicated to Nightmare Moon foalnapped Twilight Sparkle. Do you know her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Calliope nodded again. \"Yeah, she's Mom's apprentice.\" She looked left, then right, then leaned across the table. In a conspiratorial whisper, she added, \"I think Mom's secretly grooming her to be a Princess herself someday, but you didn't hear that from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The black alicorn arched an eyebrow. \"Right... Well, anyway, this cult foalnapped Twilight, and used her blood in a ritual designed to resurrect Nightmare Moon seperate from Princess Luna. But, the spell got interrupted mid-cast by Princess Celestia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, I think Mom wouldn't have taken kindly to her apprentice getting foalnapped,\" Calliope remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx nodded. \"But, since the spell was interrupted mid-cast, it managed to form something. A small blank-flank alicorn filly, caught in a thorn bush in the middle of the Everfree Forest.\" She shivered. \"That used to be one of the worst experiences of my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Whoa, stop the music!\" Calliope was slightly wide-eyed. \"You mean you're the product of an interrupted spell designed to bring back one of the worst evils to walk Equestria?\" She whistled. \"Heavy stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're telling me,\" muttered the black alicorn. \"I didn't have any of Nightmare Moon's memories, and I was just a filly, in the middle of nowhere, for a whole night and day. I was scared to death. Luckily, Twilight came back to the clearing to get the saddlebags she'd had when she was foalnapped, and found me. She brought me back to the library and cared for me. She knew what I likely was, but she decided not to tell the princesses about me, simply because I didn't <i>act</i> like Nightmare Moon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Heh. Bet Mom was really understanding when she finally found out,\" the white alicorn said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx grimaced. \"I wish. After I'd been living with Twilight for a while, I started calling her 'Mom', simply because that was how I saw her. A few days later, Princess Celestia showed up at the library, and took me away. Turns out she was scared of what I could be, and she didn't want to wait and see what would happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Calliope blinked. \"Huh. That doesn't sound like Mom at all. She usually has a lot more patience and understanding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx winced. \"Well... I asked Princess Luna about it once. She said she asked Celestia about that at one point. Celestia's response to Luna was, and I quote, 'The last time I waited to do something, I lost you for a thousand years.' So, yeah, she was not willing to wait and see what happened to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So... she tried to kill you? A filly?\" Calliope looked aghast at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, she took me to a unicorn who had a scanning ritual ready to determine whether or not I was actually Nightmare Moon,\" Nyx replied. \"At least, that's what Celestia thought. As it turns out, he was the leader of the cult that had foalnapped Twilight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Calliope winced. \"Ouch. So... lemme guess. The 'scanning ritual' actually gave Nightmare Moon's powers to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"More than that, I received her memories as well. And, less than a week later, I subdued and sealed both Celestia and Luna into the sun and moon, respectively. I took over Equestria without a single drop of blood being spilled.\" Nyx sounded anything but proud at the 'accomplishment'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Calliope, on the other hoof, was stunned. \"You took out both Mom <i>and</i> Aunt Luna? Wow. Remind me not to tick you off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx sighed. \"Yeah, well... As it turned out, I was anything <i>but</i> happy at what I'd done. I eventually abdicated my status as ruler, and cut the cultists loose. A few days later, I ended up saving Ponyville from a bunch of monsters that had come out of Everfree, but I was heavily injured in the process. At Twilight's urging, I freed Celestia and Luna from the sun and moon, and I let Luna pass judgement on me.\" She smiled for the first time during the story. \"Luna took most of the power I had as Nightmare Moon, and sentenced me to be the ward of Twilight Sparkle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Calliope burst out laughing at that. \"That's Aunt Luna for you! Some 'punishment', huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx nodded, then inclined her head at the white alicorn. \"So, how about you? Judging from what you've been saying, you're the daughter of your version of Celestia, right?\"</span></div></div>",

I always was a bit more of a Daddy's girl, but unfortunately my mortal father was captured and killed by unknown hostile forces when I was young.\" Calliope said. \"Things got rough after that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can Imagine they would. It's a horrible thing, losing a member of your family.\" Nyx replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, it was only made worse by the muttering nobility always pretending like they cared so darn much about a no name soldier they'd never heard of before. He wasn't a war hero or an outstanding captain. He was just a normal guard and a commoner...and I could hear every awful thing they said about him behind our backs. Mom tried to handle the pain by throwing herself into Twilight's training, upping the difficulty of their lessons dramatically, while I tried to focus on learning to fly. They'd hired the wonderbolts to teach me, myself being disguised as a pegasus named Morning Song.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, disguised? Why were you disguised?\" Nyx asked, curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because nopony outside the palace was supposed to know I existed. My mother wanted to spare me from a life of politics for as long as possible, and once I realized the full implications of what me being royalty meant, I was grateful for it. I don't think I could have handled the loss of my father if I'd been having all those responsibilities forced on me at the same time.\" the Ivory alicorn let out a heavy sigh, and hung her head. \"To be completely honest, I'm still looking for a way out. The thought of me being a Princess terrifies me to no end...I mean,  technically I've already been one since the day I was born, but actually getting up their and leading the country, everyone in equestria watching me and judging my actions? Did you know I once almost accidentally killed Fancy Pants and Countess Chocolate because I couldn't make up my mind on which desert I wanted for my birthday? There's a lot of pressure in this being royalty thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can relate. Being the 'Queen of Equestria' was absolutely horrible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can imagine. I have issues with just being a princess, I shudder to think what would happen if I had to run the country by myself. Anyways, after a while I got careless, and as a result 'Morning Song' had to turn up in the obituaries. A few years later, 'Vinyl Scratch' arrived out of nowhere and started DJ-ing around canterlot, and she kept to herself, interacting with the world at a bare minimum. And that was my life until slightly over a year ago, when I moved in with Twilight, learned to make true friends, and even managed to fall in love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx smiled. \"Sounds like your life took a turn for the better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalliope didn't return the smile, instead scowling a bit at her own memories. \"Yeah, well then i found out my boyfriend was actually a changeling queen who was tricking me into telling her everything she needed to know to impersonate me. She went on to replace me and begin her second hostile invasion of Equestria, during which I learned that she was the one who killed my father and that on some sick level of her mind she was actually attracted to me. As you can imagine, I didn't take that too well. the resulting battle showed me that there was a difference between being nigh immortal and actually being immortal. I spent several months in the hospital after that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think that was bad? You should have seen the bug by the end of out fight. She's probably still wearing bandages and casts after what I did to her.\"</span></div></div>",

Lemme tell you, castle life? It royally sucks when you're not allowed to go anywhere in your natural form. So, I came up with the alias 'Vinyl Scratch' to get out of there, and enjoy myself once in a while.\" She frowned. \"Still, royal politics have a way of following the family, even in disguise. That's actually why I'm here, to get away from politics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"And... you're not worried that your Celestia might be worried sick about you?\" Twilight asked, concern lining her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Calliope waved her hoof dismissively. \"After I practically pulped Chrysalis, Mom's let me have a lot more leeway when it comes to doing my own thing.

I'm my own mare, and I deserve to spread my wings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Further conversation was interrupted by the waiter's return, bearing a huge tray on his back. On the tray was Calliope's meal: four Humongo veggie burgers, two with fries and two with onion rings, an order of hay bacon, mozzerella sticks, and a large orange soda. The waiter carefully slid the tray in front of Calliope, then deposited Nyx's salad in front of the midnight alicorn almost as an afterthought. \"Your meals, madams,\" he said, before stepping away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Calliope licked her lips, before grabbing the first Humongo burger. To the surprise of everypony present, her first bite took nearly an eighth of the massive sandwich. She chewed, swallowed, then bit down again. Within two minutes, the first burger was gone, and Calliope was washing it down with a bit of orange soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"WOW! Not even I've finished one of those things before!\" Pinkie exclaimed. \"You must've been hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, interdimensional travel can do that to ya, I guess,\" Calliope snickered, before letting out an almighty belch that shook the tables of the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good heavens, dear, must you be so uncouth?\" Rarity asked, waving a hoof in front of her face. \"I realize you dislike formalities, but even so, there is such a thing as proper behavior!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I consider it to be a compliment to the chef,\" the wayward princess retorted, picking up the second burger. She paused when she realized there was a faint purplish glow around her. \"Um, Twi, honey, what're you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Just a simple scan,\" the purple unicorn replied. \"Looks like I was right. Your magic reserves have been drastically drained, probably from passing through the dimensional barriers.

Calliope had been given a tour of Ponyville, although it had been largely unneeded. She knew where everything in the town was, thanks to her stay in her dimension's Ponyville. For the most part, the tour had been a distraction on the part of Twilight and Nyx, because they knew there would be much to talk about later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As the day went on, the ponies split away from each other, until only Twilight, Nyx, and Calliope were left heading to the library. The white alicorn glanced at the two natives. \"Okay, as much as I love playing dumb, what was the point of dragging me all the way around a town I already know like the back of my hoof? I'm guessing you two have something planned for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight chuckled nervously. \"Well... okay, we were planning something.

Her mane and tail both blew in an unfelt wind, their pastel colors seeming to blend together as they did so. Her pink eyes regarded the smaller alicorn, whose own eyes had widened in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"M-mo - !\" Calliope cut herself off. She realized, half a second after she'd started to speak, that this was not her mother, but rather the native version of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia chuckled. \"It's quite alright.

I went ahead and informed your mother of the situation.

These thing's will heal up in no time by themselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you broke out of a hospital? And you jumped the dimensional barrier while injured? Do you have any idea how dangerous that is?\" Twilight asked. She then paused before adding. \"In theory of course; there have never been any reported cases of this happening before to my knowledge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, dangerous for you mortals, maybe, but I'm a Demi-god. A few little burns aren't going to do anything to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but if your still healing, then it sounds like Chrysalis did an even bigger number on you than what you led us to believe.\" Nyx said. Calliope's response was the strangest yet: She laughed. She laughed loudly and obnoxiously, falling over and rolling on the floor in laughter. She laughed and it worried Nyx slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so funny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think Chrysalis was responsible for these?\" The young alicorn asked as she gestured to her injuries. \"Ha! Even if she did have the power to pull it off, she was way too busy being creepy and trying to stay alive to do any real harm.\" She stopped laughing and let out a tired sounding sigh. \"I got these from a solar flare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that means...your <i>mother</i> did that to you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalliope looked at Twilight. \"In her defense, I was kind of going Nightmare Moon. Between me and chrysalis we nearly demolished the entire east half of the castle...then I nearly destroyed to west half when aunt Luna stepped in to keep me from killing her. After I took her out, Mom really didn't have any options left to save me from myself, what with some of the element bearers being unconscious. So, she blasted me with the fury of the sun...and it was one of the best things she's ever done for me. If she'd let me kill the bug, I'd probably still be stuck like that, rampaging around, hurting countless innocent ponies.\" She turned her head to look at Celestia. \"Let me guess; Mom want's me to have your Doctors take a look at my injuries, doesn't she? Don't bother. It's just a matter of time now, and I intend to spend that time relaxing and staying out of the spotlight...with the exception of maybe just one concert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it would help all of us to worry less if you'd allow my best doctors to look at those injury's, just to make sure your trip to our world didn't cause any problems for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smaller alicorn let out an exasperated sigh. Her eyes darted to the window, and suddenly she smiled. \"Okay, but only under one condition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that would be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Catch whoever the heck has been spying on us since we left the burger place.\" The young princess Pointed towards the window, and everypony looked just in time to see a shadowy silhouette disappear from it.

Still, she wouldn't give up. She flew after them, noting that the runaway was heading for the outskirts of town. Since it was afternoon, there weren't many ponies on that stretch, so catching this rogue would be child's play. She flew low, intending to tackle the pony, when they suddenly cut a sharp left, heading back into town. Nyx, unprepared for the change in course, overshot the turn, but quickly compensated, flying up and over the buildings, intent on intercepting the pony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0However, when Nyx cleared the rooftops, she couldn't see her target. All she saw was the typical afternoon market crowd. There was no trace of a cloak anywhere, seeing as it was a warm summer day. Nyx hovered there, baffled for a moment, before a thought came to mind. Her eyes narrowed. \"Looks like we're about to have changeling problems of our own,\" she muttered. With nothing to chase down, Nyx flew back to the library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Nyx opened the door to the library, she noticed it was much like she had left it. The only difference was that Calliope and Twilight now had some tea as well, and Spike was bringing out a tray of biscuits. Calliope looked up at her. \"No luck?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx shook her head. \"I didn't catch them, but I have a pretty good feeling that they were a changeling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight nearly dropped her teacup. \"A changeling? Here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Calliope groaned, and banged her head into the table. \"Great. I thought I'd seen the last of those bugs when I sent my Chrysalis home in a body cast. Ugh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia frowned. \"The changelings here have been quiet ever since the failed invasion of Canterlot.\" She looked thoughtful. \"In fact, I've been sending envoys to them, in the hopes that we could have peace talks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How's that been working out for you?\" the smaller white alicorn asked, looking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's been going rather well, actually,\" Celestia noted. \"It seems the invasion was spurred by equal parts desperation and lack of communication. You see, for months before the invasion, Chrysalis had tried to send envoys to us, to try to open diplomatic relations. But, the guard captain at the border always turned them away... sometimes forcefully. When I sent my own envoys, the changelings were hostile at first, but eventually, Chrysalis saw that I was sincere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wait, but if Chrysalis is open to peace talks, why would a changeling be running around in Ponyville?\" wondered Twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Celestia frowned again. \"From what I've been able to tell, Chrysalis is not the only changeling queen out there. She's merely in charge of her own hive. Other hives exist, with their own queens. And, from what she's told me, some of those queens think far less of ponies than she does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Why didn't we know you were having peace talks with Chrysalis?\" asked Nyx, a bit miffed that something so important had not been relayed to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I was keeping it a secret, and for good reason,\" replied Celestia, looking stern. \"If I let everypony know that I was opening peace talks with the changelings, it would cause a panic. Even had I just let my faithful student in on it, the odds were high that unauthorized ponies might catch wind of it, and blow things out of proportion. Far better that I keep it close to the vest, so to speak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight nodded. \"Makes sense. Secrets are hard to keep in this town, it seems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Calliope coughed. \"Getting back on topic... so what happens now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Now, I go back to Canterlot to deal with royal business,\" Celestia said. Her horn lit up, encasing Calliope in an aura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey, HEY! What gives?!\" yelped the younger alicorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm taking you to my royal physician in Canterlot, so that he can take a look at those injuries,\" replied the elder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But Nyx didn't catch the eavesdropper!

Be advised, she seems emotionally volatile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0While Twilight was dictating this letter, Rainbow Dash approached Nyx. \"Well, that was odd, don'tcha think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx didn't reply, merely opening and closing her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uh, Nyx? You okay? I know that was a bit of a shock, but...\" Rainbow trailed off when she noticed that Nyx's mane and tail were beginning to writhe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight, having just finished dictating, noticed this as well. \"Nyx? What's wrong?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now, it must be understood that Nyx, while having had bad experiences with being a Queen, was still very much a 'girly' mare. She had dreams. Dreams of meeting a kind-hearted stallion with whom she'd share her first kiss, first date, first... everything. And now, part of that dream had been dashed. By a wounded changeling queen, no less. Mt. St. Nyx was about to erupt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pinkie Pie, having been in the crowd, popped up next to Rainbow, and quickly pulled her away from the alicorn. \"Everypony, you might wanna step back! This one's gonna be big!\" She dived behind a cart, while the other ponies in earshot who heard her took cover of their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finally, Nyx blew her top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><u><b>\"I AM GOING TO KILL HER!!!\"</b></u></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This thundering statement was followed by Nyx vanishing in a blinding flash of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight gulped. \"Spike, add a P.S. to that letter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, no problem,\" Spike muttered, his eyes wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"P.S.: Nyx was... molested by this version of Chrysalis, and is taking it quite poorly. She is on her way to exact vengeance. Be prepared.\" With that postscript, the letter was rolled up and sent on its way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rainbow Dash simply gaped. \"Wow. Never would've guess Nyx had it in her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What happened?!\" Looking around, Rainbow saw Rarity running up. \"I heard Nyx shouting something about wanting to kill somepony. What could drive her to such an extreme measure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well...\" Rainbow trailed off, unsure how to answer that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"She just got kissed by Calliope's version of Queen Chrysalis, and now both of them are on their way to Canterlot,\" Spike said succinctly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh.\" Rarity blinked a few times. \"Oh, dear. I do believe that was Nyx's first kiss.\" Her eyes narrowed. \"Oh, that is unforgiveable! To steal a lady's first kiss in such a manner! This cannot stand! Twilight, you fetch Applejack, I'll retrieve Fluttershy! We're going to Canterlot after them, to avenge Nyx's loss of innocence!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rainbow blinked. \"Uh, Rarity? Chrysalis didn't... you know, end up in bed with her. How is that a 'loss of innocence'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The fashionista rolled her eyes. \"There are different types of innocence, darling. But, no time to explain. We must get to Canterlot as soon as possible!\" The unicorn ran off towards Fluttershy's cottage.</span></div></div>",

Not as powerful as my love or myself, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx smiled. \"Oh, thanks for reminding me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The changeling blinked again. \"Reminding you about what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx smirked, and her horn flared. \"Nighty-night, changeling.\" Then Chrysalis's world went dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Calliope stared at the snoring changeling. \"What did you <i>do</i> to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, when I encountered her in Ponyville, I shot a delayed-action 'Sweet Dreams' spell at her,\" replied Nyx. \"I used a delayed version so it would have time to adjust to her natural magic and circumvent it when it went off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Quite clever, Nyx,\" Celestia noted as she stepped forward. \"I see Twilight's lessons have been paying off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay, so the bug is down. Can we toss her into the sun so I never have to deal with her again?\" growled the younger white alicorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Not without knowing how or why she pursued you in the first place,\" replied Celestia. Her horn began to glow, and she lifted the sleeping changeling off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Why? Ain't it obvious? She's out of her gourd!\" exclaimed Calliope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Perhaps, but I sense there is something deeper to her... desire,\" the solar princess said. \"I will study her myself, and keep her sedated until further notice.\" With that, she and Chrysalis vanished in a flare of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With the threat gone, the guards began to disperse, leaving Calliope, Nyx, and Rainbow behind. The pegasus coughed. \"So, what now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Looking at the wreckage, Calliope sighed. \"Now, I rebuild what I broke.

Said pegasus was lying on her side in the middle of the room, and appeared to be asleep. Her coat was a deep red, almost black, while her short, messy mane and tail were only a couple of shades lighter. A bright red cloak was wrapped around the young mare's shoulders, extending back past her flanks, on which Nyx could make out the red symbol of a rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx's attention was drawn, however, to an odd metal device that she could see under the cloak. Strapped to the pegasus's back, Nyx couldn't see precisely what it was, or what it was meant to do. Still, as the pegasus began to stir, Nyx supposed her curiosity about the device could wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ow... my head...\" moaned the pegasus. She didn't bother moving much, aside from opening her eyes briefly before squeezing them shut again. \"What did I <i>do</i> last night to make me feel like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx, recognizing the signs of a severe headache, thought for a moment. \"Well, there could be a few reasons. Excessive consumption of alcohol can cause headaches, as can high blood pressure, tension, or being struck on the head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I don't drink, so that's out,\" replied the downed pegasus. \"And I've never been diagnosed with blood pressure problems, and I'm not the most tense girl out there. Being struck, though, is a likely possibility.\" She slowly opened her eyes, revealing them to be silver in color. She glanced around. \"So, who are yooooOUUU!!!\" The last word ended in a yelp as her eyes fell on Nyx, and she reflexively scrabbled backwards. However, she didn't get far before landing flat on her back. \"Ow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx sighed. \"Look, despite my appearance, and no matter what you've heard about me, I'm not going to eat you, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The pegasus blinked. \"Uh... okay?\" She shook her head. \"I'm more concerned with why my body doesn't... feel... right...\" She trailed off as she brought her forehooves up, presumably to rub her head, only to stop and stare at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Noticing that the young mare's irises were starting to shrink, Nyx tried to break in. \"Uh, miss - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The pegasus started letting out a yelp, before slapping herself with a forehoof. \"No, no, calm down. There's got to be an explanation for this. There's got to be a reason why your hands have been replaced by hooves. Keep calm, and nothing will - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hands?\" Nyx broke in. \"You mean you weren't always a pony?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uh, no, no I wasn't,\" replied the pegasus. She rolled over onto her belly, before attempting to stand. \"Easy does it, Ruby...\" she muttered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"'Ruby'? Is that your name?\" Nyx asked, moving in to give the newcomer some help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, Ruby Rose. That's my full name,\" the pegasus said. With Nyx's help, she was soon standing on all fours. \"This feels so weird...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What were you originally, before becoming a pony?\" Nyx asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ruby blinked. \"You... you just believe me? Just like that? No questions about if I'm crazy or anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx rolled her eyes. \"In my town, we get all kinds of weird things happening. Someone claiming to be something other than a pony is new, but not that special. 3 out of 10 on the weirdness scale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ruby blinked several times. \"Your town must be <i>crazy</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyx laughed. \"My dear, you have <i>no</i> idea.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nNyx looked the stranger over, uncertain what to make of the mare. She was a mare, Nyx could tell from the rounded snout and slight build. Her coat was a deep shade of blue, nearly black, which stood in contrast to her long light grey mane. A leathery wing was folded up on her side, and Nyx assumed that it had a partner on the other. Despite the leathery nature of the wing, the mare lacked the tufted ears common to thestrals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were two features about the mare that stood out the most, however: the first was the gilded sword that was strapped across her back. The second was the armored plates that adorned her body, from the neck down. This mare was girded for battle... and had recently come from one, to judge by the burns that marred the armor plates and her exposed coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx bit her lip. On the one hoof, she was nervous about the fact that this mare seemed to be geared for conflict. On the other, she was clearly injured, and needed attention. Making up her mind, the alicorn picked the mare up in her magic, and dashed away, heading for Ponyville General.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin had never felt this much pain in her life. She wasn't certain it was normally <i>possible</i> to be in so much pain. <i>What in heaven's name happened to me?</i> she wondered, doing her best to keep still, as even the slightest movement brought agony. As more of her senses returned, the pain was joined by a sense of <i>wrongness</i>. Her body felt completely off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how long ago did you find her?\" asked a male voice. It wasn't familiar to her, which filled her with dread; had she been captured by Hoshido on the way back from the Sevenfold Sanctuary?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more than half an hour,\" an equally unfamiliar female voice replied; it sounded young, not as young as Elise, but definitely younger than Camilla. \"As soon as I found her, I brought her here for treatment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you did the right thing,\" the male voice said. \"And it was a good thing you removed her armor, too; having any sort of cover over those burns would have exacerbated the condition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was around that point that Corrin realized that she could feel the sheets of the bed she was in, but the feeling was odd. She wasn't feeling the sheets on her bare skin; rather, it seemed like there was something fuzzy in between her skin and the sheets. <i>My body feels completely off,</i> she thought, <i>and I need to know why!</i> Mustering her resolve, she started to crack her eyes open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was dimly lit, she noted, which was a blessing on her eyes. Opening them wider, she glanced around. She was in a sterile white room, which immediately ruled out any room at Castle Krakenburg; the rooms there were made of hewn stone. She was lying on a simple bed, on top of the sheets it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of her were two horses, though they were markedly different from any horse Corrin had seen before. One was a light brown, with a darker brown mane and tail. It appeared to be wearing a white coat of some kind, as well as a metallic disc on its head, just below its horn. Corrin remembered tales of such horses, and knew that the term for them was 'unicorn', an archaic word meaning 'one horn'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other horse was far stranger looking. Standing a good deal taller than the unicorn, it was a pure black, with a purple mane and tail. Unlike the unicorn, it was without adornment of any sort. Like the unicorn, it had a horn, but Corrin could also see a feathered wing that was folding up at its side. <i>What do you call a horse that has wings and a horn?</i> she wondered briefly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer puzzlement increased to incredulity as the strange dark horse opened its mouth and <i>spoke</i>. \"How long will it take for her to recover?\" it asked, in the female voice from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've ordered burn salves to be brought in on the double,\" the unicorn replied in the male voice. \"In the meantime, I should probably cast a painkiller spell on her. Those burns have to hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as though merely being told of their existence caused them to react, a flare of agony raced along the burns on Corrin's skin. She hissed, drawing in a breath, which caught the attention of the two horses. \"Yeah, that might be a good idea,\" remarked the dark-colored horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unicorn's horn glowed with a teal light (what sorcery was this?!) and almost immediately, Corrin felt the pain recede into a dull, tolerable ache. She sighed in relief. \"T-thank you,\" she managed to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks necessary, my dear, I'm doing my job, after all,\" the unicorn replied. \"I'm Dr. Stable, and I'll be taking care of you while you're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin nodded in response, then started twitching her limbs. \"I am Corrin. A pleasure to meet you, sir. And you as well, miss...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nyx,\" the dark-colored mare replied. \"I'm the one who brought you to the hospital, Miss Corrin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin blinked at the familiar name, but immediately dismissed the notion that this Nyx was in any way related to the snarky mage she'd met up with outside of Fort Dragonfall. \"Then you have my thanks, Miss Nyx. I'm uncertain myself as to how I became injured, so your aid is greatly appreciated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyx smiled. \"It's no big deal, I'd do the same for anypony in your position.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Any...</i> pony? Corrin thought, and for the first time, she glanced at herself, to find that she was, indeed, a horse of some sort.</span></div></div>",

Exploring youthful romance is fine, but please keep it tasteful.<br>\r\n* Character death should be kept to an absolute minimum, if used at all.
