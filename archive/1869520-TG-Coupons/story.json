You have got to be kidding me!\u201d Rick mutters to himself as he sees yet another store close its doors to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick is a married man that had forgotten his wife\u2019s birthday one time too many, causing her to unload all the frustration she had been holding in all at once. He didn\u2019t see what she had to be stressed about but since he was just rushed out of his own house he really didn\u2019t put much thought into why she was made he just wanted to find something to quickly diffuse the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for him he had completely forgotten about her birthday and spent the whole night at the office so now the jewelry store was closed and so was the flower shop. He was now all alone walking down the vacant sidewalk casually peering into the dark store windows when he heard someone whistling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked up to see a shady figure pushing a cart with a single lamp to light his way in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell hey there, now what might I ask has you out this late?\u201d the man asks, Rick pauses for a moment to look the guy over, \u201cWell I could ask you the same question, I can\u2019t imagine you get much business out this late.\u201d He says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you would be surprised how many times I find a young man like yourself rushing down these streets looking for something at the last minute.\u201d He says smiling, Rick was stunned and a little concerned as to the accuracy of the man\u2019s response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo is there something I can help you with or do you always take walks this late at night?\u201d he asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay normally I would say you\u2019re crazy but right now I don\u2019t have time to argue, let me see what you\u2019ve got.\u201d Rick says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh I\u2019ve got just the thing for you.\u201d The man says rummaging through his cart, \u201cHere we are, the perfect thing to show a woman how much she means to you.\u201d He says, Rick begins to smile from the description but looks down in disappointment as the man hands him a small booklet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait what are these?\u201d he asks, \u201cLove coupons of course, any man can buy a big bouquet of roses or an expensive piece of jewelry when he is looking for forgiveness but Love coupons say that I\u2019m willing to put forth the effort to make you happy.\u201d He says smiling<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick looks down at his watch, \u201cOkay okay how much?\u201d he asks, \u201cIt is on the house, now just sign here.\u201d He says flipping the booklet over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you so much.\u201d Rick says as he shakes the man\u2019s hand and rushes back to his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stands at the front door he takes a deep breath, stands up straight and opens the door.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I mean I\u2019m sure there are plenty of fun coupons in there but I don\u2019t plan on honoring any of the sweet sappy ones.\u201d He thinks to himself sneaking around the house to see where she put the booklet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe peers around the corner to see her place it on the kitchen table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey baby, are you ready for me?\u201d she exclaims still thinking he is in the back of the house. He quickly rush back to make it looks like he was coming to get her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah baby.\u201d He says <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them then proceed back down the hall and enjoy their shower. Afterwards the fun continued in the bedroom. And when she was satisfied and resting, Rick made his way back to the kitchen to clear off the table and the counters, he even washed the dishes all to mask his disposal of the booklet into the trash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil he turns around to see her standing there, \u201cWow this is a surprise.\u201d She says smiling, \u201cBaby I swear it\u2019s not what it looks like\u2026\u201d Rick says quickly, \u201cWait so you\u2019re not cleaning?\u201d she says laughing, \u201cAh\u2026 I mean...

You wanted to make the gesture without having to do anything!

She was so frustrated last night she must have forgotten to set her alarm clock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumps out of bed, strips off her pajamas and quickly jumps in and out of the shower. Then she rummages through her closet to find something to wear and quickly throws it on, no time to iron anything. She grabs her purse and rushes out the front door but she quickly realizes that she doesn\u2019t have her keys, so she rushes back into the house, passing Rick on the couch and waking him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow hey what\u2019s the rush!\u201d he asks half way asleep, \u201cNot now Rick, I\u2019m late for work and I can\u2019t find my keys!\u201d she says rummaging around the kitchen. \u201cAH! This is all your fault!\u201d she exclaims, \u201cMe? It\u2019s not my fault you\u2019re not organized.\u201d He says getting up off the couch, \u201cDon\u2019t start that again, and after your stunt last night I forgot to set my alarm!\u201d she says rushing past him back to the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah yeah find your keys and yell at me later, I\u2019m going back to sleep.\u201d Rick says. \u201cRick! All of us aren\u2019t lucky enough to have weekends off.\u201d She says out of frustration, at this point she didn\u2019t know what to say anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pauses from her search to catch her breath and calm down. She was going to be late if she didn\u2019t get on the road quick but she really didn\u2019t want to, she couldn\u2019t remember the last time she had a day off. And with that a strange light caught her attention, she looks over to see the coupon booklet glowing and right next to it lay the keys she had been looking for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelieved she walked over to the dresser and picked up her keys, she had just enough time to get to work. But it was hard to ignore a glowing stack of paper just laying there. So she picks it up and flips it to the first coupon which read: \u201cThis coupon entitles the holder to one day off from work.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first she was confused and a little upset that the coupons were just a joke gift, because she highly doubted her boss would accept it. But then she thought it might be worth a laugh later so she ripped it out of the booklet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later she found herself laying on the couch. And it didn\u2019t take her long to realize that something wasn\u2019t right. Suddenly she hears a very familiar scream coming from the bedroom. She jumps up and rushes to see what happened, only to confirm what she had expected. She was looking at herself standing in front of the dresser holding the coupon, she the catches her own reflection in the mirror, she was in Ricks body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Who are you!?\u201d She asks, \u201cI\u2019m Rick! Who are you!?\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cSo wait we\u2019re in each other\u2019s bodies? But how?\u201d Rick asked taking a good look at his current body in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I ended up on the couch after I ripped that out of the coupon book u gave me.\u201d She says pointing to the coupon in Rick\u2019s hand, Rick then reads the coupon, \u201cWhat? A day off?\u201d he asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I was frustrated and then the thing started glowing and then I ripped it out and this\u2026\u201d She says gesturing to her new body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait how does this give you a day\u2026 oh\u2026\u201d he says looking in the mirror at his female body dressed for work, he then looks up to see a smile on his former face, \u201cNO, this is my day off and im going back to bed, then I\u2019m going to wake up and everything will be back to normal.\u201d He says walking back to the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so, you have 10 minutes to get to work, so don\u2019t forget your keys and have a good day sweetheart.\u201d He says guiding him to the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I can\u2019t do this.\u201d He says, \u201cOf course you can, and chances are you don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d She says, \u201cWait what do you mean?\u201d he asks, \u201cWell if the coupon is for a day off then it probably won\u2019t ware off until after you do it.\u201d She says smiling <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChills run down Ricks spin at the thought but he decides not think about it and get to work first. He rushed to the car and hits the road. Meanwhile his wife takes his body back inside and sits down on the couch<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lillie plopped down on the couch shaking her head in amazement.  \u201cWell, this is definitely not what I had expected from that little card.  Serves that asshole right, after all he hasn\u2019t done for me,\u201d she said out loud.   Five years of marriage and he hadn\u2019t remember one single important date; birthdays, anniversary, she thought to herself.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat and stared at her hands, arms and body.   This was so surreal and yet incredible.  This can\u2019t be real she thought as she felt her now flat chest but yet it felt real.   Lillie got up and went to the bathroom to look at herself closer.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was amazed as she looked at the reflection.   She was Rick.   She continued to touch and feel herself all over trying to make sense of it.  It was so strange to look down and not see her breasts, instead seeing a muscular chest.   Her whole body really was his, she realized.  Lillie was quite familiar with her husband\u2019s member, but this was a whole new perspective.  She took a few moments to check it out.  It was very strange seeing a man\u2019s genitals hanging between her legs.    She wondered if there were any coupons that would allow her to put this to use as she reached down to touch it.   <br>\r\nHaving felt satisfied with her exploration at this time, she put it back in her underwear and pulled up her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lillie washed up her stomach growled so she decided to go to the kitchen and look for something to eat.  An urge to eat some of his unhealthy cereal coming to her.   Lillie wondered what to do with the day.  There were two options that came to her, one was to just be like Rick and laze around doing nothing, but that would just most likely result in her having more work to do when she got back to her body.  The second was to take advantage of this time to go and buy herself some gifts since Rick had forgot yet again.   It be her gifts to herself from Rick and even though he won\u2019t have to do it, he\u2019ll be the one to pay for it.   Lillie struggled with making a choice, the first one was becoming appealing to her, she almost felt as if she wanted to act like him.  It had been his day off, but now it was her's and the thought of laying around watching T.V. and sports was really sounding good.  That disturbed her as she never had any desire to watch sports.     The second was a better choice in her favor, his money and presents for her.  She would be able to buy herself something nice, though she wouldn't be able to try anything on.  But she would come off looking like a loving husband.  Maybe Rick would learn something from it.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked along she unconsciously reached in pants pocket and pulled something out.   Without thinking about it she put it in her mouth and flicked a lighter she had pulled out of the other pocket.   Lillie found herself taking a drag off of a cigarette.   \u201cAw shit, I just lit a cigarette and didn\u2019t even realize I was doing it.   Well, that\u2019s great, I got his friggin\u2019 habit,\u201d she said out loud to no one.   Damn Rick and his bad habit, which was another issue that Lillie hated.  She had never taken up the habit nor cared for it, even though he had tried to get her to try it.  She had been on him to quit for sometime and now she was standing here smoking.  She felt like a hypocrite.   She walked into the kitchen with the intention of putting it out, but instead found herself just flicking the ashes in an ashtray and taking another drag.   Shit, I can\u2019t even make myself put it out she realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found the thought of eating the sugary mess becoming more desirable as she started grabbing a bowl, milk and a box of cereal.  Lillie felt relief as she took one last drag from the cigarette and snubbed it out in the ashtray, then disappointment as she was already wanting another.    She pushed to the back of her mind and started fixing a big bowl of cereal.   She eagerly ate it, disgusted at her husband\u2019s habits that she wasn\u2019t able to control.   Three bowls of cereal later she put everything away and cleaned up, although she came close to just leaving it. </span></div></div>",

She kept thinking and thinking about the things she could be doing right now, but instead she was just sitting there.  Before she knew it an hour had gone by and the only productive thing she'd done was make a dent in the pack of cigarettes.  \"I can see how Rick can just lose track of times like this, but that's not an excuse!\"  Lillie said to herself as she lit another cigarette and thought about all the things that her husband did that made her so mad.  \"He's such a lazy slob.  All he does is work when he has to, eat, smoke, sleep, and repeat.  He could be out there making a real difference in the world but no.  Whenever he has the time to do something for us he just does nothing.  I can't believe that man.\"  She went for another cigarette but found she was out, \"I'm going to have to go out and get more of these.  After I get something to eat.\"  With the Lillie stood her husbands body up and got a new bowl and put it down beside the dirty one and poured up another bowl of cereal.  She sat eating before deciding she needed to go out and do the shopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before she could even make it out of the kitchen she said, \"Well...it is getting late. And I would have to shower and get dressed in order to go out.  Besides, Rick will be back any minute and he'll probably want to talk or something.\"  So after a day of accomplishing nothing, Lillie went back to the couch, turned on some college football for background noise and fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was awakened a few hours later by the sound of Rick pulling up in her car.  \"Looks like the missus is home.\"  Lillie chuckled to herself as Rick entered the couples home.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rick entered the house, scowling at Lillie in his old body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell?\u201d he demanded in her voice, with his hands on his hips in that same angry, impatient gesture she had used on him so many times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell what, babe?\u201d Lillie grinned, sipping at her beer and letting out a belch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want my body back!\u201d Rick demanded, stomping his dainty little foot on the floor. \u201cI thought your stupid little coupon gave you <u>one</u> day off. Why am I still you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess my day off isn't through yet,\u201d Lillie said with a wink. There was something cute about Rick getting all angry and flustered while in her old body. Lillie reached down to her crotch and scratched her new anatomy, not consciously noticing it was becoming a bit aroused. Perhaps it was the beer or perhaps it was just spending the day with a bloodstream full of testosterone? But for the first time in her life, Lillie genuinely admired her own former body as being truly beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, <u>my</u> day is through,\u201d Rick said angrily, dropping his purse on the floor. \u201cI slaved away as you all day, Lillie. And I can tell you, I don't like being a woman! So, yes: fine, you win that argument. Guys have it better than girls. Being a woman sucks. I was wrong, blah blah blah, learned my lesson. Now change us back. Please!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn't switch us around,\u201d Lillie said calmly, a tranquil smile on her face as she relaxed and stretched out. \u201cThe coupon changed us, babe. The coupon will change us back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen?\u201d demanded Rick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably when the day is done,\u201d Lillie said, admiring the curves of Rick's womanly figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe day <u>is</u> done!\u201d whined Rick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe workday is done,\u201d corrected Lillie. \u201cThe day continues. Who knows when we switch back? Maybe at sunset \u2026 maybe after twenty-four hours have passed \u2026 maybe just after you've done all my chores for the day? After all, the coupon was intended for me to get a full day of peace and quiet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want me to cook dinner for you?\u201d gasped Rick, his little jaw dropping in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are my wife,\u201d grinned Lillie. \u201cAnd normally, yes: I cook dinner for you each night after I get home from work. After that, I usually run a load of laundry for you, so there's clean clothes for you in the morning. I think that's it though \u2026 no, wait! Tonight I've got Zumba classes at the adult learning annex. So you'll have to go work out as me. Gotta keep that girlish figure of yours, Rick!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Lillie winked lasciviously at her husband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLillie, please,\u201d he implored. \u201cI've learned my lesson. Can't we just call the whole thing off?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm not in control,\u201d said Lillie with an innocent smile. \u201cIt's the coupon. Now get into the kitchen, little lady. I'd like to enjoy dinner before I'm eligible for social security. And don't forget to start a load of laundry right after dinner. You can fold clothes after you get back from your Zumba class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hate being you,\u201d groaned Rick, wandering back to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, don't start cooking in my professional work clothes!\u201d shouted Lillie. \u201cGo change clothes. I don't want you spilling stuff and staining those.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hear and obey,\u201d sighed Rick, trudging away from the kitchen and off to the bedroom.</span></div></div>",

Stupid stupid stupid.\"  Rick said to himself as he looked in the refrigerator for inspiration.  After staring into the mysterious giant rectangle of food Rick finally decided on the uncooked roast.  \"This will do, while it cooks I can do that other stupid stuff.\"  Rick had never really done any real cooking before outside of using the microwave but that didn't stop good old Rick who straight up put the unseasoned roast in the oven and turned the oven on for two hours without even preheating.  \"There, now onto the laundry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick went around the house scavenging for every bit of loose clothing that he could find, and scavenge was the correct word.  He was finding cloths behind cabinets, under chairs, and even under his former butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Lillie, get up, you want me to do the laundry, now help me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\"  Said the irritable Lillie who instead of actually standing up and giving Rick the dirty cloths simply rolled over as far as he could without actually getting up so that Rick could grab it.  \"There you go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really Lillie?  You can just grab it and hand it to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to miss a second of the game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't be missing anything!  Besides it's a freaking commercial!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meehh,\" Lillie groaned rolling back to her place as soon as Rick grabbed what appeared to be a dirty sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Rick through all of the cloths and towels into one load and managed to shove everything into one load after squashing everything down.  \"Man, how the hell does she do this?  It's going to need lots of soap.\"  And so Rick tossed a couple of cups of detergent into the washing load and started it.  \"I'm off to that Zumba thing!\"  Rick shouted and after Lillie grunted in recognition Rick headed off to Zumba while still wearing Lillies work cloths.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later Rick stumbled back into the living room dripping in sweat.  Turns out Zumba isn't very fun or comfortable when done in work cloths.  First thing he did was grab the roast out of the oven and put it on the table and next he put the very soapy dirty cloths out of the poor washing machine and stuffed it in the dryer.  Letting out a sigh of relief Rick shouted out to Lillie.  \"Okay Lillie, I'm done!\"</span></div></div>",

Giddily stunned to be back on the couch Rick gave himself a quick pat down to make sure he was 100% Rick again.  \"I'm back baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so am I.\"  Lillie said entering the room with a beer, \"Scoot over, I want to finish watching this game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sound great Lil.  You mind grabbing me one...\"  Rick stopped himself remembering the coupons, :\"You know what, I'll get my own beer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit yourself,\"  Lillie said plopping down back in Rick's old spot, when Rick got back he made a mental note that he should probably let her do whatever she wants, atleast for a while.  One football game later the two continued to sit on the couch lazily.  \"Honey?  Did you not give me a shower after the Zumba class?\"  Lillie asked.  \"Nope.\"  Rick said, \"But judging by the way I smell now you didn't exactly keep my body in pristine shape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had stuff to do.\"  Lillie said feebly.  \"I think I'll go ahead and get a shower now.\"  Lillie said finally getting up and just before leaving the room said to her husband as she started to strip down, \"Care to join me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm going to get a bite to eat fir...oh!  I'm right behind you babe!\"  Rick said after reading through Lillie's not so subtle offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thanks to the coupons Rick and Lillie had their first great night together in ages.  The only question is, how long before Lillie would go back to the coupons and for what reason?</span></div></div>",

Every day after he got back from work Rick was making sure that he would always ask Lillie how her day went and even made a few feeble attempts at cooking again.  Lillie noticed the little changes in Rick and although she suspected that it was only out of fear that she would use the coupons (which she kept on her at all times), but she appreciated what Rick was trying to do and hadn't touched the coupons since the first incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now it was a new Saturday and Rick was back to his old habits of  being lazy and sitting on the couch watching the ballgames.  Lillie came into the living room fully dressed with her purse in tow and looked at Rick disappointed.  \"Rick, what are you doing sitting there?  You promised me weeks ago you'd help me go shopping for a new outfit for the party next month.  I got the day off and everything for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh uh, I didn't agree to that.  Why would I say something dumb like that?\"  Rick said accusingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you were sitting in that exact spot watching the same channel watching the same sport.  Now get dressed, we've got a long day ahead of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning Rick said without thinking, \"Why can't you just get on of your girlfriends to shop with you, they'd probably be more useful than me anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillie was about to snap, but her tensing up face suddenly turned into a big grin, \"You know what, that sounds like a good idea.  Good thinking Rick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"  Rick said as he turned his attention back to the tv.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see let's see.  I know, let's try a 'special' day pass.  I think that sounds like it could be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, whatever.\"  Rick said assuming that Lillie was talking into a cell phone when he saw that her cell was on the table.  Confused he turned to look at his wife and saw her rip out a coupon before he could protest.</span></div></div>",

After a second he realized that he was still siting on the couch and assumed that the magic didn't work this time around.  \"Hah!  Didn't work!  In your face!...Hey, what's with my voice?\"  Rick said suddenly realizing his voice sounded a bit...higher than normal.  Then Rick suddenly noticed a lot of other changes.  He realized that his undershirt was occupied not by his normal man boobs, but with significantly larger full fledged womanly bosoms.  As he looked down at them in awe he saw his now very long bangs fall down in front of his face, he quickly brushed the hair out of his eyes and noticed that his hands were very smooth and had long fingernails extending out.  Rick stood up to take in the rest of the changes that he didn't even need to check to know had happened.  His hips and ass were extended out, his legs were now smooth and hairless, he seemed to be quite a bit shorter, and after a quick pat down he noticed that 'Rick Jr.' was no longer present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha very funny.\" Rick said as to his wife who was holding her side she was laughing so hard, \"But just because you did this to me doesn't mean I have to go with you.\"  Rick said as he sat back down on the couch, now with significantly more bounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No can do.  Take a look at the coupon Ricki with an I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick took the coupon and gave a groan at what it said as he read it out loud, \"This coupon entitles the holder to a girl's day out.  Failure to do so will result in a serious penalty.'  What the hell does that mean?  Serious penalty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillie shrugged, \"I don't know.  Maybe I decide that, maybe the coupon decides it.  We won't find out til you test it.  But do you really want to test it?\"  Lillie couldn't help but smile at the last statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick shuddered, \"No no no I do not.  Come on, let's get this over with.\"  Rick said getting up and heading for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?  You're not going out like that!\"  Lillie said mortified at her girly husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'll put on some jeans, quit nagging at me.\"  Rick said as he staggered back to their room in his white undershirt and hole riddled sweat pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me help you out.\"  Lillie said leading Rick to her half (more like 4/5) of the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!  I'm still me and I'm still wearing my cloths.\"  Rick said stubbornly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rick, first off no self respecting woman would wear your normal cloths.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a self respecting woman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Second,\" Lillie said plowing on, \"look at your size, you couldn't fit in your cloths, you'll fit much better in mine...as a matter of fact...\"  Lillie said eyeballing her husband from head to toe before grabbing a sundress from the closet.  \"Here, put this on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but just for a minute to shut...to make you happy.\"  So after a bit of struggling and confusion Rick managed to maneuver his way into the dress.  \"There, it fits I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a prefect fit!  Now take that off and put these on.\"  Lillie said excitedly tossing Rick a pair of her bra and panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I just got this on.\"  Rick wined before ultimately doing as he was told.  \"There, happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect fit again.\"  Lillie said more to herself than anything, \"You know what I think?  I think the magic made you pretty much exactly the same as me at least measurements wise from the neck down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm not you.  I still have my color hair and my birthmark and my face kind of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why I said you had my measurements.  Oh this is going to be great!  We can go dress shopping and I don't have to put a thing on, you'll get to model everything for me!\"  Lillie said excitedly giving her husband a boob squishing hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay.\"  Rick said less than enthusiastically.</span></div></div>",

Rick didn't say a word and turned back to take of this dress and try on another.  After about the 20th dress he tried on he figured out if he talked, Lillie would talk back, and he'd be stuck trying on dresses even longer than he already had been.  Pretty soon in just a minute or two he had stepped out for another critic as the process repeated in a seemingly endless look.  Throughout his marriage he'd taken dresses off his wife before plenty of times, but now he was a bit ashamed to admit, he'd become proficient in putting them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that blue is absolutely perfect on you, very kind to your body and eyes.

Erika beamed back, before turning to Ricki and Lillie. \"So which one is my victim?\" she enquired, teasingly. Ricki seemed to shrink from her, making Lillie smirk. \"This one!\" declared Lillie, pointing at her wife. \"What's your name, naughty girl?\" she questioned Ricki in a fake stern voice. \"R-Ricki!\" she stammered. \"I'm Lillie, Ricki's wife! Ricki has been naughty!\" revealed Lillie, enjoying Ricki's nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what horrendous crime or crimes has she committed?\" asked Erika. \"She tried to take back a last minute gift, love coupons! And before that, she would just drink beer and not help with the chores!\" exclaimed Lillie. \"My, that is terrible. Someone has been naughty, hasn't she? Well then, a full massage will teach her to be a better wife!\" pronounced Erika with a very imperious voice. Ricki could only squeak as Erika led her away.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lillie forgot her troubles with a series of treatments. First the familiar resting in mud, while her fingers were done. The Spa had the added advantage of fixing her hair while she rested, unusual for most centres. She could hear the gentle music as she found her stress unwinding. Those coupons were a god sent. Whoever tricked Ricki into getting them was her hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor darling Ricki!\" she thought, giggling. \"I wonder how vulnerable she is to a well placed finger! Maybe until she turns back, I might introduce her to a few giggles. After all she never hesitates to give me a few!\" she thought. The thought of Ricki, without her clothes, bound and howling with laughter as her little hollows were explored or her soles stroked brought an immediate reaction from Lillie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew that Ricki was a very sexy woman. It seemed that being female simply enhanced that side of her. She wondered if she wouldn't prefer Ricki stayed that way. She was so nice and well less argumentative this way. She was so vulnerable and maybe Lillie wanted to be the loving protector for once. But she dismissed those thoughts immediately. That simply wasn't being fair. Ricki wasn't a woman and it would be cruel to put her through that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo beautiful women entered the room. One was tiny with blonde hair (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://ilbucodellorsono.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/dany.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://ilbucodellorsono.files.wordpress....</a>). While the other was a blonde/brunette (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img004.lazygirls.info/people/tamzin_merchant/tamzin_merchant_the_tudors_premiere_4YsnA8Y.sized.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://img004.lazygirls.info/people/tamz...</a>). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the way, the little blonde was pressed against her taller friend, it was clear these two were not platonic. This was underscored when the brunette lifted the light haired blonde into her arms as she climbed into the mud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillie couldn't help but watching them jealously as the little blonde cuddled up to the brunette, resting her head against her chest. They were so adorable and sexy. The women served them in no way different to Lillie. Lillie requested for the cucumber eyes as she had no desire to watch the two pretty girls jealously. After a quick nap, she awoke to find herself getting a through massage. It was relaxing as the pampering left her feeling magnificent. As she felt her body starting to react, the young masseuse intensified her rubbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an expected climax, she left for a nice shower. Her thoughts felt again to the two beautiful girls and again to Ricki. Ricki laughing, Ricki's body, Lillie's tongue travelling to her centre. After a series of release that made Lillie feel somewhat promiscuous, she nevertheless made it back to the counter. Magnilla and Erika were there, their lips locked together. Ricki was waiting for Lillie, looking a little shaky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillie ran up to her, hugging her tightly. To her surprise, Ricki held her just as tight, relief clear in their reunion. Erika separated from Magnilla, giggling as she watched you both. \"I hope you don;t mind, Lillie. I had a heart to heart with your wife about her behaviour. She truly does love you and is quite contrite! I think you will find your married life much approved. That's how it is between Magnilla and I!\" she revealed as she pressed herself against Magnilla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRicki was far quieter as the two of you had a quiet dinner. She was affectionate though, every so often surprising you with kisses. When the dinner was finished, she helpt you with the plates. \"You're being very helpful! I like this part of you!\" Lillie declared. Ricki blushed adorably, before answering \"Erika told me a weird story about her brother. That he got turned into a girl and punished by his girlfriend. It freaked me a little and I realised how much that selfish jerk sounded like me! I don't want to be that guy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillie put the dishes down and grabbed Ricki, firmly pressing herself against her wife. Ricki's surprise quickly turned to reciprocation and all thoughts left them as they dashed to the bedroom to express their love. \"Wow, that....wow!\" was all Ricki could say as she rested her head on Lillie's chest, just as the blonde girl had with the brunette. \"Well I guess it's time to turn you back....unless you want to stay like this a bit longer?\" suggested Lillie, hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly I'm worried that if i don't go back now, I never will; so we should get the coupons to turn me back now!\" admitted Ricki. Lillie agreed, though she hid her disappointment. She reached for the coupons and stared at them horrified. \"What?\" asked Ricki, terrified. Lillie showed Ricki what the love coupon showed, shakily.</span></div></div>",

Please Lillie, NO!\" she screamed, before bursting into tears. Lillie held her wife tenderly as she bawled her eyes out. \"It's alright, baby! We will think of something! You just cuddle up to me, it will be ok!\" Lillie lied, stroking her wife's hair. She didn't understand it herself. Hadn't Ricki done exactly what she was asked to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erika!\" gasped Lillie. Ricki looked up, confused. Her eyes were red from crying. Lillie wiped away her tears before explaining. \"Erika that masseuse must have done something to you! Erika told you that story about her brother. It must have been deliberately aimed at you! Somehow she did this, so you couldn't turn back! Remember what she said about our married life being much improved!\" Ricki paused before gasping. \"What if Erika is her own brother? Didn't that girl Magnilla say she punished her boyfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillie took a moment before nodding. \"It makes total sense! Those two girls must know what happened. Tomorrow we will go and confront those two evil cows! For now, just go to sleep, honey!\u201d she advised her new wife. \u201cB-But I-I have no pyjamas that will fit!\u201d she complains, stammering. \u201cSweetie, we will just both have to go to sleep n***. If you are okay with that, that is?\u201d Lillie offered. Ricki nodded in a very enthusiastic manner. Lillie ran her fingers through Ricki\u2019s hair, stroking her tenderly. Ricki closed her eyes and quickly entered the land of NOD.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillie watched Ricki fall asleep, resting on top of her. She suspected that Ricki might never go back. She felt a stab of guilt that this was all her fault, especially since she wanted Ricki to stay a girl. \u201cShe\u2019s just so beautiful! Am I secretly gay or is this just a result of whatever the coupons actually do?\u201d she wondered. She tried to think about what Ricki looked like as a man, but found it too uncomfortable, squinting and having facial tics at the thought of Ricki as anything but the sexy woman, resting against her. \u201cI need to sleep, tomorrow I can figure this out!\u201d she concluded as she closed her eyes, her mind finally closing off for the night. </span></div></div>",

No men! Right, baby?\" exclaimed Ricki, his nervousness obvious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillie grinned evilly, but decided to take pity on Ricki. \"You needn't worry, ma'am! The spa only hires female masseuses! Is someone in trouble?\" she asked, smirkingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ricki forgot my birthday!\" revealed Lillie. \"My, my! That is naughty! Do you would Ricki to get a special massage?\" the receptionist asked. \"NO! Please no! Whatever the hell that is, no!\" squealed Ricki. The receptionist giggled. \"My boyfriend is the same as your wife! He never remembers my birthday!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this is not the first birthday, Ricki has forgotten!\" pointed out Lillie, annoyed. \"I...but I got you the gift at least, this year!\" stammered Ricki, his nerves still on edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ricki got me a love gift, she tried to take back!\" explained Lillie. The receptionist shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My boyfriend tried some Love coupons and tried to skim out! But I taught him a lesson or two!\" she replied, giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLillie stared at the receptionist who winked at her. Lillie beamed back. Ricki looked between Lillie and the receptionist and gasped. \"You...I mean....What...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your 'wife' isn't always coherent. I guess the love coupons haven't been totally effective.\" suggested the receptionist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Lillie could respond, a redhead entered. She was wearing only a bikini top and a sarong. She looked like a redheaded Summer Glau. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! Baby, you won't believe...oh hello!\" she stated upon seeing Lillie and Ricki. </span></div></div>",
