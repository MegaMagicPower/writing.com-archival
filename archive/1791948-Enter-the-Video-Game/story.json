Posing to nothing in particular just placing an over importance on your video game victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly out of no where an unknown force struck you in the back sending you flying and landing flat on your face.

Cammy flipped over and brought your body with her. With a crash you body hit the floor and pain ran up your spine. Cammy didn\u2019t relent though she applied more pressure to your neck with her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were slowly chocking, your hands banged uselessly on her strong legs. From under her butt Cammy observed your chocking face with a merciless expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were about to pass out Cammy flipped your body like a doll and threw you into the TV.<br>\r\nYou into the screen and disappeared into the world of Street Fighter.

Apparently the big boobed woman had an ability that made her do more damage to males.  <br>\r\nThis game was going better for you. The game announced FINAL ROUND with you and Ivy tied at 4 rounds each. This round went very badly for you. First Ivy launched into a fury of blows with her whip which all connected because you were to slow to block. With your character lying of the ground Ivy stomped him with her heel. You rolled away only to have Ivy grab you and pull you over with her whip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is when your character disappeared off the screen. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d you said.<br>\r\n Ivy was looking around as well, as if she was real. Then she looked right at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCurse you fate for running into me\u201d she said to you. <br>\r\nIvy leaped out of the TV and into the room. She appeared standing right in front of you, a fully grown woman with massive breasts ready for battle. <br>\r\n\u201cOK\u201d You said slowly as you stood up.<br>\r\nYou were the same height as Ivy, but judging by the size of her breasts and thighs she would weight more than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a lighting hit Ivy punched you in the jaw, the blow knocked you back down onto the chair. <br>\r\n\u201cOw fuck!\u201d you yelled <br>\r\nSitting down you were face to bellybutton with Ivy.<br>\r\n\u201cStay down\u201d ordered Ivy <br>\r\n\u201cNo! You\u2019re just a video game character\u201d you said standing up, angry now <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning Ivy knees you in the stomach you double over coughing Ivy stepped back and kicked you in the face. You hit the floor hard head spinning and winded Ivy walked over to you. She lifted her foot smiling and stepped on your chest then she twisted her foot, grinding it down onto your ribcage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy forced you onto your feet and then threw you into your TV.<br>\r\nAs your body disappeared into the screen and the world of Soul Calibur a voice said \u201cwhat lies with in your soul?\u201d      <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fly through the void between worlds and come out\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Time seems to slow and you dodge aside the whip at the very last second.  Your reflexes seem to have been enhanced as well.  Filled with renewed confidence at your quick dodge you crack your knuckles and says, \"All right bitch, lets see what you got.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a roar that shocks her you sprint toward her full speed.  Her whip lashes out and you roll underneath it and deliver a devastating blow to her sexy stomach.  She is rocked by the blow but her abs may be shapely but they have strength behind them.  She dries to smash your head with the hilt of her blade due to you being inside her guard.  You react quickly and grab her arm and use her own forward momentum to roll backwards and toss her 15 feet away.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle.  She wasn't so tough.  Well you spoke too soon.  Her whip was already lashing out even as she was falling and before you realize it, its grabbed you by the ankle and you are ripped off of your feet.  You land hard on the arena floor, again not as damaging as you thought it would be but the wind is temporarily knocked out of you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you lay on your back Ivy starts to lash out with her whip in rapid succession.
