It's a bright cloudy day, but something seems very off to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're on some sort of farm land, and the trees don't look quite right to you.  There is something unnatural about them.  You're pretty sure a branch on one of them is made out of candy cane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk towards the fence in the distance, you feel a weight press down against your shoulders and push you to the ground.  You knees and hands are now stuck in a pile of mud.  At least you hope it's mud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you push your hands up, you find that your fingers have somehow webbed together in each hand.  Another push hardens them, and you try desperately to push yourself back.  But no matter how hard you push, the unnatural gravity pushes you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou land in the mud again, and expect all your fingers to be broken, but as you look down, see that you no longer have hands, but some sort of hooves.  You scream for help, but only a giant 'neigh' is heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrified, you feel you neck spurt out more, and are pretty sure that you crapped during the process.  Another scream of terror lets out a giant 'neigh' and you see a farmer and a little girl hop the fence to come to your aid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she alright dad?\" the little girl asks.<br>\r\nHer dad strokes the back of your neck, and you calm down a bit.<br>\r\n\"This horse is a 'he'.\" he corrects her.<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" she asks.<br>\r\nHe dad gives you a quick examination.<br>\r\n\"Nothing looks wrong, he just seems a little spooked.  Maybe he say a bear in the woods, or a giant fox.\" the dad says, adding the second example not to scare the child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe farmer goes right up to your face, and you realize it looks like your neighbor.  Not exactly like him, he hands seem freakishly big, and he seems more muscular and handsome than he does in real life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at the girl, it's his six year old daughter.  Nessie, or Vanessa, or something with an 'S' in her name.<br>\r\n\"Can I feed him an apple?\" she asks gleefully.<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" he father says, taking an apple out of his pocket, and sticking it in front of your teeth for a bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're about to crunch down, when suddenly you wake up.<br>\r\n\"Ah, I was about to get an apple.\" you think.</span></div></div>",

The woman gives you a strange look, \"Glenn, are you feeling alright?\" She asks, concerned. You nod and smile. \"I'm fine.\" You say, and she nods. \"Good.\" She says, smiling sweetly as she gets out some pink nail polish and wipes it on the rim of the bottle. You give her a strange look, \"Umm... what are you doing?\" you ask her. She nonchalantly starts painting your toenails bright pink, \"Giving you the pedicure you asked for?\" she asks, confused as she continues them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe does your hands, and you can't move or tell her you don't want her to. She just smiles at you, continuing your makeover with pink glittery lipstick. You pucker up instantly, unable to control yourself. You try to tell her no, and to stop, but your mouth just waits for the lipstick. She puts it on rather heavy. \"Smack your lips together, Glenn.\" She says with a smile. You obey, smacking your lips and tasting it. You gag, and you feel the dryer on your head turn off. You blink and the girl smiles at you again. \"We'll do the rest after your hair.\" She says, and you smile. \"Thanks miss.\" You say, your voice sounding high.</span></div></div>",

Her horn glows slowly as you rub her, and you swear you can see her start to smile. Her horn glows, and glows more, now a vibrant pink aura around it. You touch her horn, and are surrounded by the same aura very slowly. You feel a sensation around you as her magic takes effect, giving you a blissful feeling. You feel different and you look in her eyes, which are very beautiful and as blue as the sky. The glow soon fades, and you realize that the aura did something.</span></div></div>",

You feel your bones move around to match a unicorn, your butt feeling a jab as a tail shoots out of it. You whinny and snort, while the other unicorn just smiles. You feel a jab in your forehead as a horn grows, pink like your hooves. Your face contorts and stretches for the nose of a unicorn, and soon the rest of your body matches hers. You feel something on your eyelashes, and you notice she has makeup on her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aura fades, and you start to graze before stopping yourself. You look at the unicorn, curious as to what this dream is about... or is this real? You think it over, starting to graze again and this time going through with it. She joins you in grazing, clopping her hooves and whinnying. You soon start to copy her, and she smiles. You hear a voice, but can't make it out... then you hear it again.</span></div></div>",

What exactly is going on?\" She just smiles, as you suddenly feel a soft hand on your butt. \"Come along, Sir Princess.\" a little girl says to you, the name not sounding odd to you. It appears she treats you like a mare, though she knows you are a man still. Once you turn around, you feel a bridle appear on your muzzle and a lead in her hand. The girl is close to pale, in a pink dress with a design of a unicorn fighting a cutesy-looking dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a short tug you begin walking with her, noticing world around you seems off. The trees all look the same, the flowers are all perfect, the animals have flat-colored fur, and there are a lot of them. You don't feel tired, or even awkward, walking in hooves. As you follow her, she mutters things that must be her real thoughts. Questions about her friends, and she mentions you briefly before she stops in front of the garden. You find out, in real life, she's the sister of a close friend of yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, you see a carrot patch, an apple tree, a sugarcane plant, and a tree made of hay. You blink at this, feeling a sudden urge to eat. The girl smiles, petting your mane and making you twitch at the feeling. \"Go on, you must be starving.\" Just as she says that, your stomach grumbles loudly and you feel like you haven't eaten in days. </span></div></div>",

Though you haven't eaten the plant, the taste surprises you. The texture is much like wet grass, and the taste reminds you more of honey than pure sugar. You can't seem to help wagging your tail, and after eating and taking a second bite you feel a pat on your neck. \"Thata girl.\" she tells you as she rubs your neck and shoulders. Your tail wags like a dog's, twitching when she stops however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the taste not being the best, you keep wanting to eat until you are almost stuffed. Strangely, you can't stop yourself from eating the sugar cane until you really are stuffed, your lips covered with sugar. After another firm pat on your chest, you feel the girl climb onto your back. The lead completely disappears when she grabs the reigns, and you follow how she moves them. You try to resist following the reigns, but the bridle squeezes your face briefly to break your focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA kick to each of your sides puts you into a gallop, where things get even stranger than they have been. You run in a straight line, until you think about turning and do so without being guided. Gradually, you gallop in circles and see that she moves the reigns how you are choosing to turn. You slow down to test this theory, and she immediately tugs them, making you close your eyes a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe child yells \"Whoa girl!\" and brings you to a complete stop as you open your eyes; they go wide at the sight of a huge castle. You are certain there wasn't one before you stopped. It is medieval, with two large towers on each side and surrounded by a moat but without any animals in view. The drawbridge lowers, hitting the ground in front of you with a thud. The girl kicks your sides again, \"Hi-yah!\". You trot into the castle, your hooves pounding the wood.</span></div></div>",

Feeling strange, you stand up and try to shrug off the odd dream and head to the kitchen for breakfast. Your sister has cooked you some waffles, which you devour before she returns downstairs to watch TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dream doesn't seem as odd when you notice your sister watching a show about horses, she always liked them and you must have been annoyed so much you dreamed about them. Now that you think of it, the girl might be a character from another show your sister watches. Feeling at ease, you quietly go into her room to see if you recognize things from your dream there, you can think of several excuses to just look in her room, even the truth would keep her from being mad... maybe it's more than a dream and she could help?</span></div></div>",
