He has chosen to give his life, be it as food or a lover, to one of his coworkers at the local public library. Most of his coworkers are female, and older than him by some margin, but there are a few of his age, and whether or not he's chosen to give himself to a specific person, or will take the first out he finds, is up to you. Of course, it's possible he may end up in, or with, a customer instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames Alexander: A teenager, with brown hair, brown eyes and a slim, but not exactly skinny, body. He is rather meek in personality. James has decided that he wants to make the ultimate sacrifice for his friend, Jessica. A girl of equal age, with blonde hair, brown eyes, and a thin body that manages to be curvy, if not exactly large, in all the important places. Jessica lives with her mother Donna, her grandmother Daisy, and her pet cat Maudeline (Maude for short). James may find himself succumbing to any of these individuals, if you so choose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there are always more stories to be told...</span></div></div>",

Classmates, people around town, and even family members tend to treat you as either a whipping boy or a welcome mat. You strongly suspect that it's nothing about you causes people to dislike you, rather, your inability to fight back makes you an easy target. This only frustrates you more, as you feel that you've located the source of the problem, but you're powerless to correct it. There's also the creeping fear you have that you may crave the abuse, subconsciously or otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless of all that, you've managed to hold to onto one genuine friend. Jessica. A blonde, skinny girl who should be about a thousand miles out of your league, but for some reason, she really likes you, meekness and all. She's always happy to see you, and more than once she's warded off people calling you names. Even her family treats you better than everyone else does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe point being, you've decided that today, you're going to give your life to Jessica. She and her mother and grandmother are the only ones who treat it like it has value, so as far as you're concerned, it already belongs to them. Of course, you're not going to know which one of them gets it until you go up her porch and knock on that door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climb the stone steps leading up to the split-level home, and give the door four solid raps.

No friends, no family, certainly no future with Jessica. But, even still, you were ever so willing. It's not like Jessica was incapable of doing so.

You helpfully put your hands straight up, intending to slip into her gut as smoothly as possible.<br>\r\nTo your surprise, you don't fall in. You don't even feel the bottom, she's holding you in place with her throat. She grabs your arms and lowers them, placing them onto her bra, before slipping your hands underneath it. You get the feeling that this is why she had you lay down the way you did, and begin feeling her up. As you guessed earlier, her boobs have very little sag despite her age, but thoughts of the age barrier vanish as you realize you've never felt a woman's breasts before. They feel warm and soft and smooth in your hands and you make sure to give every inch of them a squeeze, in a process that lasts longer than your entire swallowing up to this point.

The old woman notices that you've given her a small increase in gut size, and she wonders if her eyes are playing tricks on her or if her boobs have gotten just a little larger.<br>\r\nEither way, she's glad to have had her first solid bowel movement in a week.</span></div></div>",

Some parts of the law make it clear that one person can exist solely for the pleasure of another person, and while vore and sex-slavery are heavily regulated, when both parties are willing, it becomes a simple matter of filling out some paperwork to make you a kept man of Daisy. You live with her now, with the government even providing a stipend for your upkeep, due to the fact that you are extra mouth to feed who isn't expected to find employment.<br>\r\nOf course, this woman is the grandmother to one of your closest friends which you feared would make things somewhat awkward, but not only are Jessica and Donna accepting of it, Jessica actually tells you that she knows her grandma's been hot for you, and the the three members of the household has discussed you and her forming a relationship, and your meek demeanor had them considering voluntary slavery as one of the likelier options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour day to day life is an odd one now. You maintain a number rights, but legally, you only exist to please an 80-year old woman sexually in whatever manner she chooses. But it's mostly good news; Daisy is not a cruel woman, though she can be kinky at times. She's peed down your throat more than once, and it's clear she loves to do it. Sometimes she'll bring out leather and a whip, but it usually stays there; it becomes apparent that she likes the look of BDSM more than anything else, but she does get a kick out of the fact that a young man such as yourself would let her hurt you if it turns her on. Even then, you have plenty of vanilla sex, but you have it in every position, and every one of Daisy's orifices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're also happy to learn that Daisy is not a possessive woman, and being that no one in a house of three women had a boyfriend for years until you walked in, you see a share of action with Jessica and Donna as well, although Daisy's needs always come first. Legally speaking, you are only bound to do whatever Daisy says, but you usually let Jessica and Donna have their way with you, as long as it doesn't go further than Daisy's kinks. You also make regular appearances under the kitchen table during every meal of the day, using your mouth on Daisy, but occasionally someone else, if Daisy tells you to, and you're not always tonguing the front entrance. To say that Donna and Jessica are happy to have their grandmother ordering her slave to please them with no promise of a return favor, is a gross understatement. Between your lickings and dickings the Setters ultimately become a closer family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of sex, you do odd jobs around the house. Raking leaves here, cleaning the windows there. It's nothing you can't handle, and you ARE a member of their household after all. You also spend plenty of time with Jessica, playing video games and hanging out in a way that would suggest your relationship hasn't changed much, excluding the fact that you're banging every member of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**** ****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYears go by, and Daisy, as women of her age are wont to do, passed away. You, along with Jessica, and Donna, are surprised to find out that you are nearly the sole beneficiary of Daisy's will. You've got a more than decent amount in your bank account now, and you were happy to learn that the Setter's home was completely owned by Daisy, making you James Alexander, property owner.<br>\r\nJessica's going to college now, and Donna's received a promotion or two in the time since you pledged yourself to an 80-year old woman's pussy. You decide to go right on pleasuring both women. After all, neither Jessica nor Donna had reason to look for another boyfriend since you've joined their home. Why would they? And you never forgot that these women liked you on a personal level long before you found yourself in their beds.<br>\r\nYour union, a mother, a daughter, and their shared boyfriend, is a weird one, but you love them both, and they love you. Who would've guessed that the day you decided to ask your best friend to eat you would've been the day you gained three long-term lovers, and went from being the most pathetic boy in the neighborhood to the most envied?</span></div></div>",

The end result was him forcing you to leave the house, claiming it wasn't safe for either of you. Luckily, you had Sakura's contact on your phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sat on the sidewalk, shaken and distressed, you decided that now was finally the time to stop beating around the bush. You were going to call Sakura, you were going to tell her your feelings and you were going to ask for her to eat and digest you into poop and ass fat. All this misery, all this turmoil that had hit you and your relationship with Sakura had happened for a reason and you took your forced removal from the house as a sign that things needed to happen sooner rather than later. You could sense she wanted this just as much as you and would, if anything, jump at the opportunity to digest her friend Marc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou texted Sakura to come pick you up as a Green Honda CR-V slowly pulled up in the night. The driver lowered her window to reveal...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the driver's seat of the CR-V, you were surprised to see not Sakura, but her mother Aki. Aki's black hair was tied back in a bun, delicate glasses lay over her cute little nose. Her skin was rather light, her eyes black with light purple eyeliner surrounding them. She had a laid back, relaxed expression to her face, not the kind you would expect from a High School teacher. She was the kind of teacher you could easily see yourself talking to as a friend outside of school. Her body was curvy and plump on her chest and hips (With a bit of pudge on her belly), but her butt was absolutely to die for. It was massive, round and you were tempted to ask for a one stop trip out of it rather than Sakura's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Marc.\" Aki said pleasantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" you responded, smiling immediately. Aki certainly had that affect on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I probably should have given you a heads up, Marc.\" she sighed. \"Sakura has a rough night of her own last night and I took her phone. Tried not to pry, but I know how dramatic things get with you and your dad. And when I saw the message was about him, figured I owed you a place to stay. At least for a night or two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled weakly as you got into the shotgun seat of the car. \"Thank you,\" you nodded. Aki really was something special. She'd always give 100% of her effort if it meant she could help somebody; whether it was her daughter, her friends, her students...Or, perhaps, her future meals. After all, she had always been kind to you and she was pretty much the most gorgeous woman imaginable for her growing age. She could use a good gut slut.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The drive back to Aki's place was long, but...Relaxing. Soothing. There was very little traffic and the moment felt oddly intimate between you two. The wind rushing through the window, the cool and calming temperature putting you both in a tranquil mood. Aki was a big David Gray fan, and there was just something so emotionally charged about his tunes, they made you feel things you never thought music ever could. Looking at Aki, her aged beauty shining in the moonlight like an ocean...How did you never notice how perfect this woman was before? Empathetic, beautiful, sophisticated...If only she had been younger. Maybe you could have had something special together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAki briefly removed her gaze off the open road to give you a look of amused confusion, followed by a short laugh. Her smile was contagious, causing you to slightly laugh in impulsive, contagious response. \"Why are you staring at me like that, Marc?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...Stupid,\" you told her dismissively. The last thing you wanted was to come off as a creep. This woman had been so good to you, you really had a good thing going. The last thing you wanted her to believe was that you were some entitled pervert who wanted to take advantage of her hospitality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no such thing as stupid feelings.\" she countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raised an eyebrow, \"I thought the saying was 'There's no such thing as stupid questions?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, that too.\" she laughed. Again, you laughed at her cute, little quip in spite of yourself. In her moment of lighthearted banter, you mustered up the courage to try and confess your feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aki...\", you sighed, hesitantly. \"I...Really like you. Like...More than just as a friend. Maybe, subconsciously, that's why I've been trying to remain single for so long. So I could maybe have a chance to be with you. And I was hoping...Maybe...Maybe we could just try things out. See if we like each other, like a trial run. Or, maybe...Maybe you could digest me. Because, I'm telling you Aki...If we can't be a couple, there's always going to be a part of me that wants to be together. Either through my body being digested into yours, into your fat and your shit and everything, or through...Well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAki was dead silent the whole time. As you turned over, her eyes were completely on the road. Her mouth hung open slightly. Whatever she had expected your admission to be, you couldn't have caught her more off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt terrible. \"Aki, I am so, SO sorry!\" you tried to tell her. \"I didn't mean to take advantage and I didn't want to come across as entitled or creepy or weird...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not creepy.\" she calmly responded, her eyes still deadset on the road. \"It's not weird either.\" Neither of you spoke a single word for the next 20 minutes as she drove you home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you arrived at her house; a 3 story marble building with a pool built outside, deep in the countryside. You could only imagine how strenuous it must have been for Aki to drive Sakura to and back from here. You walked inside, being careful not to make too much noise, as Aki stopped you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Marc,\" she told you. \"I thought about what you said. I do love you, Marc. I've loved you for a very long time. And we both have...\"Needs\" from each other...That need satisfying. And I think...\"</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This is a vore interactive wherein the main character, due to dissatisfaction with their life (or any other reason you come up with), has resolved to either end their life in a vorish fashion, or change their life for the better through romance (which is to say, every protagonist either wants to be eaten, wants to have a relationship with another character, or both).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the actual rules/guidelines:<br>\r\n1) <b>The premise of this interactive involves people WANTING to be digested.</b> Obviously, it's possible for something to change and for them to go unwillingly (including being eaten by a person, or in a way, that they don't want to), but if you take it down that road, you have to at least acknowledge the fact that this person does WANT to be eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Due once again to the premise of this interactive, a typical plotline should end with the protagonist either dying inside of someone's body (ie: due to vore), or entering a committed and romantic relationship with another character. However you want to do the second one is fine: you could just say that the main character decided to live now that they have someone in their lives and end it there, you could allude to them starting a family in the future, or you could skip the whole thing and say they would live to 80 and then die in each other's arms, or you can do anything else you come up with; <b>the important thing is 'romance' plots should END, and they should do so in a timely fashion, but with some kind of actual conclusion</b>. This is done so that those stories actually END, instead of contributors just popping on over and over again to write about the same two characters having yet another sex scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Due to personal preference, the protagonist can only be eaten by women. You can assume the setting involves people of both genders being preds, and can make as many references to men devouring others as you want, but<b> the main characters themselves can only be eaten by women.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) For the same reasons as above: <b>No macro preds, and no shrinking</b>. Obviously people can be taller than the main character, but keep it within reason. As a rule of thumb, if a character is taller than an NBA player, they are too tall. If you want to have small preds (including children, little people, animals, or even a small magical creature such as a fairy, that fine; but NO macro preds) then that's perfectly fine. If you absolutely NEED a giantess or a male pred to enjoy one of these things, you should have no problem locating such material on Writing.com, or the internet at large. Further, you can always create your own erotic material. I did, and there's no reason you can't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5) That said, any kind of vore is fine. Soft, hard, cooking, oral, anal, unbirth, it's all allowed here. Scat and watersports are also allowed, but a warning is appreciated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6) You can write sex if you want. You can write any kind of sex act you want. However, if you couldn't guess from rule 3, <b>there is to be no m/m sexual content in this interactive</b>. m/f, f/m, and f/f are all fine. If you want to do a group sex scene, that's fine, the only caveat being that if there is more than one male involved, they can't do sexual things to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7) Following from rules 3 and 6, a male protagonist cannot form a romantic bond with another man. Any other grouping (including more than two, for the polyamorous out there), is fine.</td>",
