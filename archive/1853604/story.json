Josh's eyes went wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god. You're Neil Patrick Harris!\" Josh exclaimed (That's right, I'm giving Eros the appearance of TV's Barney Stinson, renowned playboy)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Close. My name is Eros, god of sex.\" he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, forgive the skepticism, but I have a hard time believing that you're a god.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, a demonstration is in order. Observe.\" said Eros<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waved his hand at one of the cheerleaders from Josh's high school, who happened to be walking by, and she fell to her knees, crying out in orgasm. When she regained her senses, she quickly fled. Leaving Eros and Josh alone in the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me now?\" asked Eros<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. If you're not a god, then at very least you're psychic.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now, I've been watching you for a while, and I think you deserve better than the life you have been given. So receive my blessings now.\" said Eros, and he put his hand on Josh's head<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEros gifted Josh with the power to teleport anywhere in time, space and between universes. He also imprinted Josh's mind with the knowledge on how to use his powers, and the magic collars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, why do I suddenly have knowledge about magical collars and how to use them?\" asked Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right. I almost forgot.\" said Eros<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took off his backpack and handed it to Josh. Josh opened it to find countless black leather collars inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also replaced your old bank cards and other forms of identification with better ones you will need for your adventure.\" said Eros<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh took out his wallet, and sure enough, all his cards had transformed into blank white cards with simple black writing on them. One said 'Student ID', another said 'Bank Card', and he didn't bother checking the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Eros.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, Bro.\" said Eros<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEquipped with everything he needed, Josh decided to start his new adventure. But what movie/TV show would make for a good first target?</span></div></div>",

He was about to go inside the Pokemon centre, when Eros re-appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey man, since you decided on the Pokemon world, I have something else for you.\" he said, holding out a bag<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh looked inside and it was full of Pokeballs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any Pokemon you catch with one of those will become a sexy anthropomorphic version of itself that will be female. Also, you can attach them to the collars, which will make the woman you put it on able to transform into a sexy anthropomorphic version of her favourite Pokemon and back to normal by your command.\" explained Eros<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet, thanks.\" said Josh, and he stowed the bag in his backpack<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, bro.\" said Eros, before disappearing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he disappears, who do you see run by?</span></div></div>",

She was so intent on getting it to the Pokemon Centre that it seemed it was only sheer willpower that allowed her to run so fast in such high heels without wiping out even once. He followed her into the pokemon centre, and watched her hand the Pikachu to Nurse Joy. He followed her to the deserted waiting room. She was sitting down, sulking. Josh sat down next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked at him with teary eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A flock of Spearow happened. They chased us down, and Pikachu had to use all the energy it had just to get rid of them. I just feel so helpless.\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I told you I could give you the ability to protect your Pikachu, and prevent things like this from happening again?\" asked Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at him with wide eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is that possible?\" she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh pulled out a collar with a Pokeball affixed to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you put this on, that power will be yours.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached for it, but Josh stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go out back first.\" said Josh, and they both stood up<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked out back, Josh had a couple questions for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So tell me about yourself.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Ashley Ketchum, from Pallet Town. I just turned 17, so I've started my Pokemon Journey on my way to becoming a Pokemon Master.\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hmmm this must be an alternate version of the Pokemon world where Journeys start at 17, all the pre-teens from the show are older, and apparently Ash is a girl.' thought Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stood outside of the Pokemon Centre. Josh handed Ashley the collar, and she put it on. Her entire body began to emit a bright white light, like a Pokemon evolving. Her body began to change shape, and when the light disappeared, she had become a human shaped Pikachu. She looked at her new body in awe for a moment. Then she focused. She gestured with one arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pikaaaa CHU!\" she cried, and a lightning bolt shot from her hand and charred a nearby tree<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared in awe at her handiwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pikachu, return.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA red light shot out of the collar around Ashley's neck. It covered her entire body, and then retreated back into the Pokeball hanging at her throat. When the light was gone, Ashley stood there, human again in her normal clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Master!\" she cried, and leapt into Josh's arms<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my pleasure to help a beautiful girl in need. Now, let's go back to the waiting room and wait for news about your Pikachu.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was more than happy to comply with that, and she accompanied Josh back into the Pokemon centre, hugging his arm. But just before they walked back into the Pokemon Centre, a girl ran up to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are!\" she yelled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" asked Ashley<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you! My name is Misty, the girl whose bike you stole, then destroyed!\" she cried, gesturing at the nearby wreckage of what used to be a bicycle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I needed that bike to get my Pikachu to the Pokemon Centre.\" said Ashley<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh decided to put an end to this before it got any worse. He slipped behind Misty and locked a Pokeball collar around her neck. She was consumed with the same white light, and became a human shaped Vaporeon. The newly transformed Vaporeon-Morph charged at Ashley, but Josh stopped her by grabbing her by the collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm very disappointed in you. Vaporeon, into your Pokeball.\" said Josh sternly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe straps of the collar retracted into the Pokeball, which fell to the ground. Immediately the Vaporeon morph transformed into red light and was pulled into the ball. Josh picked the ball up and attached it to his belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can take the time to teach her manners later.\" said Josh, and they entered the Pokemon Centre<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for them to hear from Nurse Joy that Pikachu was fine and just needed a good night's rest. Ashley decided to make a call home. The call was picked up, and a beautiful woman appeared on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hello Ashley.\" said the woman<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Professor Juniper.\" she greeted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you're calling me from Viridian city. My daughter Bianca just left there this morning.\" said Juniper<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I guess things were more different than expected.' thought Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging by Ashley's reaction to Bianca's name, he guessed that she was Ashley's rival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who else has already passed through here?\" asked Ashley<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Bianca you know, also Dawn, Hilda and Mei. But May hasn't called yet, so I suppose she'll be getting there sometime tomorrow.\" said Juniper<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least that's something.\" said Ashley<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Ashley. I'm sure you'll catch up to them.\" reassured Juniper<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Professor. I think I'm going to get some sleep now.\" said Ashley<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then. Goodnight, Ashley.\" said Juniper<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight Professor.\" said Ashley, and the screen went dark<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you go get some sleep, Ashley. I just need to talk to Nurse Joy for a minute before I join you.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley nodded, and set off towards the bedrooms. Josh walked up to the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you?\" asked Nurse Joy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, do you have any guide books for the Pokemon League challenge?\" Josh asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" said Nurse Joy<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached under the counter and produced a small handbook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That book has all the essential information on all the Gyms, and the Pokemon League, as well as information on how to get from one city to the next and what you need to know about when travelling through certain dangerous areas.\" said Nurse Joy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" said Josh, taking the book<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh walked to the bedrooms and found the one where Ashley was sleeping. He found her already asleep in the bed. Not wanting to disturb her, you took a black scarf out of her bag and blindfolded her with it, so that the light from the reading lamp wouldn't wake her. You sat down at the desk, turned on the small light, and began reading through the handbook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed there was a great deal different in this variant of the Pokemon World. You needed to travel across all 8 gyms in both Kanto and Johto, and earn 16 badges before challenging the Elite 4 at the Indigo Plateau. The gym leaders were also mixed around. The first gym in Pewter City was Roxanne instead of Brock. The second gym in Cerulean City was Daisy, Violet and Lily, the sensational Cerulean Sisters, so that was still the same. The third gym in Vermillion City was Elesa, instead of Lt Surge. The fourth gym in Celadon City was still Erika. The fifth gym in Fuchsia City was Roxie instead of Koga. The sixth gym in Saffron city was still Sabrina. The seventh gym on Cinnabar Island was Flannery. The eighth gym in Veridian City was Kate and Liza. You noted that the former gym leaders of Mossdeep City were twin girls, instead of a twin boy and girl. Next would be travelling from Viridian City, past the Tohjo Falls to New Bark Town, where the Johto part of the Journey would begin. The ninth gym in Violet City was Skyla and Winona, instead of Falkner. The tenth gym in Azalea town was Gardenia. The eleventh gym in Goldenrod City was still Whitney. The twelfth gym in Ecruteak City was Fantina and Shauntal. The thirteenth gym on Cianwood Island would be Maylene. The fourteenth gym in Olivine City was still Jasmine. The fifteenth gym in Mahogany Town would be Candice. The sixteenth gym in Blackthorn City was still Clair. From there, it was an easy trip back to New Bark Town and up through Victory road to the Indigo Plateau and the Elite Four. The first of the Elite Four was still Lorelei. The second was Caitlin. The third was Phoebe. The fourth was Karen. The standing Champion was Iris. There was an after-note saying that only one trainer had beaten Iris, but didn't want to be Champion. This trainer named Cynthia had then gone to Mount Silver in Eastern Johto to continue training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled as he imagined each of the members of this all female cast of gym leaders and elite four members. He closed the book and turned off the light. He crawled into bed with Ashley and drifted off to sleep holding her in his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do they wake up the next morning?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA/N: If you're wondering about Team Rocket's debut appearance, I'm saving that for something special. I have devious plans for them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Josh woke up to see Ashley getting dressed. She had slept in just her black shirt, panties and stockings. But now she was also wearing her hat, gloves, jacket, skirt and belt. She had just put her high heels on and was putting on her ankle warmers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good Morning, Master.\" said Ashley<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You going to check on Pikachu?\" asked Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley nodded. She finished putting on the ankle warmers and stood up straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll join you in a minute.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley smiled, and left the room. Josh rolled out of bed and smoothed his clothes out. He decided to shower, so 15 minutes later he left the bedroom clean and fully dressed. He came into the waiting room and found a smiling Ashley holding Pikachu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see Pikachu is doing good.\" commented Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it's great! Pikachu's all better!\" cried Ashley happily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great! Let's go back to our room and get our stuff. I have something for you.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley happily followed Josh back to the room. Back in the privacy of their room, Josh handed Ashley one of the special Pokeballs from his bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to make your connection to Pikachu even stronger, then transfer it into that Pokeball.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Pikachu hates being inside a Pokeball.\" said Ashley<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pikachu only has to go inside the ball for about three seconds, then it never has to again.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" said Ashley<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put Pikachu down, and put the Pokeball on the floor a foot away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's your decision, Pikachu.\" said Ashley<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu looked to be contemplating the decision for a moment. It looked at Ashley and nodded, before stepping forward and touching the button on the Pokeball. It was absorbed into the ball, which clicked a couple seconds later. Ashley collected the ball and sent out Pikachu. Pikachu now looked almost identical to Ashley's transformed state. Pikachu looked at her new body in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pikachu, I choose you.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokeball on Ashley's collar released a white light, which covered her, and when it faded she was once again in her human-Pikachu form. The two Pikachu's ran together and hugged each other tight. They talked to each other in Pokemon speech for a minute, before they started making out passionately. Josh decided to leave the room. Ashley and her Pikachu loved each other so much that it just felt wrong to intrude on their first time together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went into the woods near the Pokemon Centre, in order to have a talk with the rude Vaporeon. He released her from her Pokeball, which once again became a collar around her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vaporeon return.\" said Josh, and in a flash of red light, Vaporeon was a girl again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Master.\" she said submissively<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright. You just got carried away. You can apologize to Ashley for trying to attack her later, but first let's take a walk and you can tell me a bit about yourself.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well my name is Misty. I'm 18 years old and I come from Cerulean City. My sisters run the gym there.\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued to talk as they walked. Suddenly, they stopped. Misty could smell something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you smell that?\" she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. You must retain Vaporeon's sense of smell even when in human form.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey followed the scent, until they found the source. It was a girl stuck in a big spider web. But it wasn't just any girl. It was May. She had fallen asleep stuck in the web, and seemed to be having a wet dream. She was unconscious and moaning. The bug Pokemon must have gotten tired of hearing her, because her lips were stuck together with string shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than miss this golden opportunity, Josh walked up to May and locked a collar around her neck. As the transforming white light engulfed her, the webbing that was touching her disintegrated, and she fell away from the web. Josh caught her before she hit the ground. By now, the light had faded and she was now a human shaped Glaceon. She woke up in his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glaceon, return.\" said Josh, and with a flash of red light, he now held a human May in his arms<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much, Master.\" said May<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at Misty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this my new sister?\" she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh nodded. May leapt to her feet and tackled Misty. She pinned the redheaded girl and started kissing her passionately. Misty rolled over beneath May and tried to get away, but may hugged her waist tight. Misty got to her feet, but May just continued to stand, bent over, and hugging her hips. Suddenly out from the trees came a string shot. It hit Misty in the hips and wrapped around her, effectively keeping Misty and May stuck together as a human pony. A Pokemon soared down from the trees, and plopped down on the newly made pony's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Butterfree.\" it said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a mischievous little one, aren't you?\" asked Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe butter free nodded happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you come with me, and there will be lots of chances for mischief in the future.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButterfree nodded emphatically, bouncing up and down as it did. Josh took a Pokeball out of his bag and tossed it at the Butterfree. It easily captured the willing Pokemon. Josh called it out, and gazed upon it's transformed state. She was now human-sized. She had purple skin and a gorgeous figure. She had knee-length highheeled boots, elbow-length gloves and lips all the same shade of turquoise. Her eyes were big with red irises. She had long purple hair that matched her skin, and of course, a pair of large Butterfree wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you gorgeous.\" commented Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButterfree blushed shyly. Josh smiled and returned her to her Pokeball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vaporeon, Glaceon, full morph.\" he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe string shot disintegrated and Misty and May transformed into their Pokemon states. But the full morph meant that they were currently normal Glaceon and Vaporeon now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, girls. Lets go back to the Pokemon Centre.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon and Glaceon played with each other as they followed Josh. They soon reached Josh and Ashley's room in the Pokemon Centre and found the pair of anthro Pikachu's naked in bed together. They were finished their activities and now just cuddling. One of the Pikachu sat up when Josh entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pikachu, Glaceon, Vaporeon, return.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt his command, Glaceon changed back into May, Vaporeon changed back into Misty, and the Pikachu sitting up changed back into Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May?\" asked Ashley<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More sisters!\" cried May<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leapt into Ashley's lap and started kissing her hard. Ashley had to roll over and pin May in order to get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, how do I change Pikachu back to normal?\" asked Ashley<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll show you.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe called out Butterfree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's a beautiful Butterfree, Master!\" said Ashley<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, now watch. Butterfree, full morph.\" commanded Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButterfree turned white, and morphed into a normal Butterfree. Ashley did the same thing, and Pikachu became a normal Pikachu again. They collected their bags and set out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soon enough, Josh and friends were in Pewter City. After a good night's rest in the Pokemon Centre, they were ready for a gym battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misty, May, are you ready to help win your sister a gym badge?\" asked Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" they cried<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Vaporeon, Glaceon, full morph.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like that, there was a Vaporeon and a Glaceon at Ashley's feet. They entered the gym, and Ashley stepped forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here to challenge the gym leader to a battle.\" she said boldly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gorgeous brunette girl in a school uniform stepped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Roxanne, leader of the Pewter City gym, and I accept your challenge. This will be a 2 on 2 battle with no substitutions.\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed. I choose you, Vaporeon!\" cried Ashley<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go Geodude.\" said Roxanne<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vaporeon, Water Spout!\" commanded Ashley<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon struck Geodude with a powerful blast of water, rendering it unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Return, Geodude. Go, Nosepass.\" said Roxanne as she swapped her Pokemon<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vaporeon, Whirlpool!\" ordered Ashley<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whirlpool didn't take Nosepass out, but it trapped it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now use Water Pulse!\" cried Ashley<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNosepass was quickly knocked out. Roxanne recalled it and walked up to Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You fought well. This Boulder Badge is yours.\" said Roxanne<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh walked up to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please accept this. It's a little something to help humans and Pokemon better connect.\" said Josh, holding up a Pokeball collar<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxanne looked at it, then looked at the one around Ashley's neck. She took the offered collar from Josh and fastened it around her own neck. The white light overtook her, and when it faded, she had transformed into an anthro Sudowoodo. It looked much the same, only she had a woman's figure, long brown hair, a human face, and her feet had built in high heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a command from Josh, Sudowoodo found herself surrounded by 2 anthro Pikachu's, an anthro Vaporeon, and an anthro Glaceon. She stood there blushing fiercely as their hands roamed across her skin. She moaned loudly as the hands found her breasts and ass and pussy. Soon she couldn't take it any more and dropped to her knees as she came hard, wetting the stone floor of the empty gym with her juices. Josh walked up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sudowoodo, into your Pokeball.\" he commanded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a flash of red light, Sudowoodo was pulled into its Pokeball. Josh collected the ball with a smile. He ordered Vaporeon, Pikachu and Glaceon to return to normal, and Ashley had her Pikachu return to normal. They returned to the Pokemon Centre for a good night's rest, and had Roxanne call in a replacement since she was going with them. She called in Brock to take over the gym while she traveled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext morning they decided to...</span></div></div>",

Ashley's battle was against the Cerulean Sisters, Daisy, Violet and Lily. Also known as Misty's older sisters. Ashley sent Misty forward to battle, and the sisters sent out a Goldeen. But as the battle went on, it quickly became apparent that Goldeen was losing the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrr I'm so sick of just handing out Gym Badges. Go, Staryu!\" Violet sent out a Staryu to join the battle and attack the Vaporeon<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too. Go, Psyduck.\" Lily sent out her Psyduck to add to the advantage<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut despite the advantage of numbers, all three quickly fell to Misty's attacks, co-ordinated by Ashley. The teamwork between the three sisters was easy to pick apart, and soon, all of the sisters' Pokemon were unable to continue. And as soon as the Pokemon could no longer fight, thats when the sisters started to fight. With each other. THey got in each other's faces. Daisy complained that sending out more Pokemon in an official match could get the gym shut down. Violet complained that she was sick of their losing streak, and Lily just blamed everything on her sisters. They were so focused on fighting, they didn't see Josh coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You three have a lot to learn about Pokemon, and teamwork.\" he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sisters were so close together, that it was almost too easy for Josh to take an extra large collar and put it around the sisters, encompassing all three of their necks. They didn't even know that Josh was there until the collar clicked shut, and by then it was too late to escape. The collar tightened, forcing the three older girls together. But even as the proximity made their heads clunk together, they continued to fight and blame each other. THeir bodies glowed white with evolutionary light, and they fused together, and reshaped. When the light faded, they had become an anthropomorphic Dodrio. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dodrio, into your Pokeball.\" you commanded, and the newly transformed Dodrio vanished inside her ball, which you picked up<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext up is Cerulean Cape.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>They departed Pewter City and travelled east towards Mount Moon, and afterwards, Cerulean City. They found the cave that cut through the mountain to be very quiet. There was no sign of other trainers, so Josh had Ashley, Misty, May, Roxanne, and Butterfree all in their anthro forms. Misty and May were running around on all fours, despite their bipedal shape, and chasing each other's tails. Roxanne hobbled along, since Butterfree had stuck her legs together. Ashley and Butterfree were currently hugging your arms happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to hand them over, right now!\" commanded a voice from up ahead<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou returned Roxanne and Butterfree to their Pokeballs, made Misty and May full Pokemon and returned Ashley to human before moving forward to investigate. They peeked around the corner and saw a pair of women dressed in black hurting a cute, nerdy looking young woman. The women in black wore black, long-sleeved crop-tops each with a red R on the front, as well as short black tight skirts, white elbow gloves, and white knee boots with 6\" heels. One had blue hair, and the other had brown hair. The nerdy girl was wearing a closed white lab coat, light pink stockings and white 4\" heels. She had dark brown hair with pink streaks. She seemed to be standing between the other two and a pair of strange rocks. One looked like a misshapen dome, and the other looked like a spiral shell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we'll just play with you for a little while. Soon enough, you'll beg us to take those fossils off your hands.\" said the bluenette<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette stepped forward and ripped open the nerdy girl's lab coat. Underneath, she was wearing a hot pink leather corset that covered from halfway up her breasts to halfway down her midriff. The matching hot pink leather panties she was wearing were also exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well well, look what we have here.\" said the brunette<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nerdy girl blushed as the villainous pair groped her exposed breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vaporeon, Glaceon, use tackle.\" you quietly commanded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fully transformed Misty and May charged the villains, who were knocked away. Josh rushed forward and caught the nerdy girl before she fell, dropping his bag in the process. Her cheeks were still pink as she looked up at you with big brown doe eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My hero\u2026\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled, and turned to check on his bag. But turning around, he kicked the bag, and it fell over. Two Pokeball collars fell out of the bag, and when they made contact with the fossils, they were absorbed into the prehistoric artifacts. He didn't have time to wonder, because the villain pair had recovered, and pushed him and the nerdy girl aside. They stood triumphantly over the fossils, but after they charged Josh, Ashley charged them. She knocked them over, and the bluenette face planted onto the Helix Fossil, while the brunette face planted on the Dome Fossil. The strange thing was, that upon their skin making contact with the fossils, they were absorbed into them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did that happen?\" asked the nerdy girl<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley helped Josh and the nerdy girl to their feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. Are you okay?\" asked Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who were those women?\" asked Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They looked like Team Rocket.\" said Ashley<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was Team Rocket?\" asked Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that bunch of villainous bimbos.\" commented Ashley<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh turned back to the nerdy girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Josh, what's your name?\" he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Clary.\" she replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClary found herself staring at the collar around Ashley's neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you get that cute collar?\" asked Clary<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley blushed, and toyed with her collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh gave it to me.\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you put one on me?\" asked Clary, her cheeks red<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled, and drew a fresh collar from his bag. He turned back to Clary. Misty and May were nuzzling the girls stocking-clad legs, and Ashley gathered her long hair and raised it so that her neck was bare all the way around. Josh put the collar around her neck, and locked it snugly. Her body became consumed with evolutionary light. When it faded, she had become a sexy anthro Clefairy. She looked down to check herself out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so amazing.\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou loaded the fossils into the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clefairy, return.\" Josh commanded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClary changed back to normal, and buttoned up her lab coat. As a group, they finished the remaining trip through Mount Moon. Breathing in the fresh air, they could see Cerulean City in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You heard footsteps and saw a blonde woman walking up to an ugly yellow car. She looked to be in her early 20's and was waring black boots, a long plaid skirt and a leather jacket. Her hair was drawn back in a ponytail, she had a bag slung over her shoulder and black rimmed glasses sat on the bridge of her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were going to sneak up to her and use the collar on her, but you noticed what was in her left hand: the classic tool of a car thief, so you decided to have some fun. So just as she was about to break into the car, you spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have awful taste in cars.\" you commented<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swirled around at ludicrous speed and braced herself against the car behind her, her eyes wide. You laughed just a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, I'm not gonna turn you in to the police.\" you said, and she seemed to relax a bit<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want then?\" she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three wishes.\" you said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three wishes? What do you think you're in some kind of fairytale?\" she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a way, yes.\" you said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then. Why don't you explain how this is supposed to work.\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I will make three requests of you, and i will tell you which ones are wishes, and you have to do whatever it is I've asked of you. I won't ask you to do anything beyond your power, anything criminal, or anything sexually degrading.\" you said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I guess there's no harm in that. What happens if I refuse to do something?\" she asked the last bit nervously<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed and waved off her concerns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you think I'm going to get angry and hit you, or something to that effect, perish the thought. I only want to have some fun with Portland's most beautiful car thief.\" you said with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed and looked down, but you could tell she was smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, I agree. What is your first wish?\" she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I suppose my first wish would be to learn the name of Portland's most beautiful car thief.\" you said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Emma. Emma Swan.\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, Emma Swan, how about I treat you to some delicious food, and you can tell me more about yourself.\" you said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded and the two of you conversed amicably as you walked out of the alley together, leaving the yellow car behind.</span></div></div>",

When I saw you I thought you were in your 20's at least.\" you said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. I took off from my foster home a few months ago, and I doubt they ever even reported me missing.\" Emma replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well your life is better without them in it.\" you said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.\" she said \"Where are we going next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down the street and saw a place called Cosplay Land. You led Emma to the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's check out this place.\" you said, and the two of you walked inside<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside there was a beautiful blonde woman in her 20's wearing a Supergirl costume waiting to greet them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello and welcome to Cosplay Land. Admission is $100 for 3 hours, $150 for 6 hours, and $200 for a full 12 hour day. Which would you like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two 6 hour sessions, please.\" you said, and held up the credit card that Eros gave you<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman handed you the little machine and you swiped the card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why so expensive?\" asked Emma<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well unlike most amusement parks you may have been to in the past, Cosplay Land is like an all you can eat buffet. Once you pay to get in, everything is free, including food, drink, photo-ops and prize winning games.\" said the woman<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you finished paying, Supergirl led you into the next room. She handed you both a pair of skin-colour lycra bodysuits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normal clothes aren't permitted inside. Strip down to your underwear and put these on.\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma blushed fiercely, but complied nonetheless. You both put the bodysuits on. They covered your entire bodies, except for your face. You both had to tuck your real hair inside the hood, but the hoods had their own hair on top. Yours was a mop of brown hair, and Emma's was a long wavy blonde. You both checked your clothes with your other stuff in a locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now, I'll explain how it works inside. The park is filled with winding streets of games, and food and rides. There are plenty of map stations so you don't need to carry a map. Now, there are 10 levels. You start at 0. There are 5 different level stations for each level. You can only play games and go on rides that are the same level or lower. Also, you can only challenge a level station that is one level above your current level, and you cannot challenge the same level station twice. If you fail all 5 level stations, you level up by default. But when you fail a level station, a penalty article will be attached to your suit, and you will not be able to take it off until you leave the park.\" Supergirl explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Emma, are you sure you're up for this?\" you asked her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounds like fun. Let's do this.\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. In you go then. Have fun.\" said Supergirl<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the door to a staircase. You both ran down it, and at the bottom, you found yourselves in a massive amusement park. You walked up to the map, and noted that you were at the south end of the park. Emma looked around and ran towards a nearby ride that looked like a lot of fun. But she was stopped at the entrance by a girl dressed as Sailor Moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What level are you?\" she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Level 0. We just got here.\" replied Emma<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you have good taste, since Updraft, here, is our most popular ride, but it's also a Level 10 ride. Sorry.\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma walked back over to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no way I'm leaving here without going on that.\" said Emma<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I might as well make it a wish. You have to get to level 10 and ride the Updraft before we leave here today, even if that means failing through all 50 level stations.\" you said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get moving.\" she said with a determined smile on her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked to the nearest level 1 station. There was a girl who looked like a stylized teen librarian sitting there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the Level 1 Mind Station. I will ask you both 5 questions, and if you answer them all correctly, you will be upgraded to level 1. Who would like to go first?\" she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go first.\" you said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is Ash Ketchum's dream?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To become a Pokemon Master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the name of Goku's firstborn son?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gohan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What Legend of Zelda N64 game followed Ocarina of Time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Majora's Mask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did Ash first encounter Team Rocket?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Viridian City Pokemon Centre.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the name of the region where the early episodes of Pokemon take place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Kanto region.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All correct. Well done. You have earned the level 1 pass.\" she scanned your suit, and pressed a button, which made the roman numeral 1 appear in gold on the back of your left hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Emma, and she looked nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" you asked her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm okay. Let's do this.\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What Pokemon game followed red version and blue version on the gameboy?\" asked the girl<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yellow version?\" Emma replied, sounding unsure<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct. How many controllers can the N64 manage at once?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct. What Pokemon did Ash start out with in the TV show?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pikachu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was the protagonist of the anime Cardcaptors?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct. What two colours are the standard Pokeball?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Red and white.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct. You have also answered all of them correctly and have earned level 1.\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow both level 1, you approached a nearby map station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's keep going. I don't see any worthwhile prizes or rides below level 4. They're all kiddy rides.\" said Emma<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Let's keep going then.\" you said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you walked around, each of you managing to successfully level up without fail. Until you reached the level 5 station. It was another Mind Station, which meant 5 trivia questions. But these questions were more difficult than the first mind station, but you had managed to answer them all correctly, and Emma had answered the first four.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many attacks can the Pokemon Magikarp learn before it evolves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two.\" answered Emma<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is incorrect. The correct answer is three.\" said the station monitor, who looked like Bulma from Dragon Ball Z<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma face-palmed at how narrowly she had failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please step this way to receive your penalty article.\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma walked around to where she was, and Bulma had her sit down. She slid Emma's feet into a pair of high heels, which had a little lock on the strap across the ankles. So when Bulma closed the strap, there was a click, leaving Emma stuck in those heels. She got up and stumbled back over to you as she started to get used to the heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we get something to eat, and then we'll continue on.\" you suggested<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma nodded, as she stumbled along, blushing from her embarrassment of not being able to walk properly.</span></div></div>",

He watched her standing there, studying the white ball and the 8 ball, trying to figure out to sink it. As fate would have it, she was playing by herself, and nobody was watching, which allowed Josh to sneak up on her easily. She never even saw it coming when the collar slipped around her neck before locking. Her body tensed as the collar tightened around her throat, but she didn't cry out. Her hands had shot up as if to pull the collar off, but they were stopped halfway there. Her hands fell onto her chest and started massaging her gorgeous body through her clothes. She met Josh's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Master.\" she said seductively<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh responded by crushing her against himself and kissing her hard. She moaned into the kiss when Josh grabbed her ass. Josh let go of her and she regained her composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you finish that last shot?\" offered Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena smiled and turned back to the pool table. She retrieved the pool cue from the floor where it had fallen, and bent over the table. She was lining up the shot when she felt her beloved Master pressing up against her backside. Revelling in the way her Master made her feel, Elena took the shot and the 8 ball fell into the corner pocket with a sharp <i>CLACK</i>. Elena straightened up and turned to face Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who shall we claim next?\" asked Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*I want to save Caroline until she becomes a vampire, so if you want to see her captured, then either be patient or refer to the option to claim her first in the previous chapter*</span></div></div>",

She walked over and sat down across the table from her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Bonnie, what's up?\" asked Elena<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonnie closed her book and set it down. It was a copy of Game of Thrones by George R. R.

He looped the collar around the young witch's throat and tightened it to lock with a click. As it locked, there was a strong but subtle burst of energy that had Bonnie's hair blowing in an imaginary wind. Josh sat down next to Bonnie, and Elena rounded the table to sit beside Josh on his other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Master.\" said Bonnie<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello to you too, Bonnie.\" replied Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you'd like, Master, Bonnie and I could demonstrate just how close two <i>BEST</i> friends can be.\" said Elena in her sultry voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we would be happy to put on a show for our Master.\" agreed Bonnie<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn't wait for permission, not that they needed to. They slowly moved their faces closer to each other's. Their faces were both directly in front of Josh's when their lips met. It was a thing of beauty to behold, watching the two girls massage each other's lips and tongue with their own. Josh couldn't imagine any way to improve on the moment at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

It was a form-fitting leather dress that was tagged 'Kahlan Amnell, Legend of the Seeker', with a pair of dark brown, thigh high, high heeled leather boots to go with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://images2.fanpop.com/image/photos/12000000/Kahlan-Richard-bridget-regan-12003017-2560-1714.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://images2.fanpop.com/image/photos/1...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look beautiful.\" Josh told her after she came back from the changing room<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Master.\" said Elena<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Master' is for my common pets, and you are anything but common. As my Alpha you may call me Josh.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena said nothing, but her eyes teared up and she wrapped Josh in a tight hug. Josh returned the hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey now, what's wrong?\" asked Josh compassionately<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing. That's just it. For the first time in a long time everything just feels right. I don't know if this is just because of the collar, but I love you. With all my heart.\" said Elena<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finished, there was a bright golden light. They separated and Josh found that Elena's collar had crumbled to dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened asked Elena<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The collar was no longer needed.\" said Eros, who had just reappeared<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The collar acts as a catalyst for love and lust. But when Elena fell for you for real, it was no longer needed.\" explained Eros<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh put an arm around her and smiled at her. She did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your ponies are in the stables. There is an exit there.\" said Eros<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Eros.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, bro.\" said Eros, and then he was gone<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh and Elena walked through the door labeled 'Stables'. Inside was a bunch of wooden stalls, with straw covering the floor, and double sliding doors which presumably lead to outside. The two lovers walked to the only two closed stalls and opened them. When they laid eyes on Vicki and Jenna they saw just how much effort Eros had put into dressing them up. They were both on all fours with a chain locking their collars to their stalls. They had been stripped out of their clothing and re-dressed. They each had a saddle strapped to their backs, the harnesses criss-crossed across their bare torsos. They had pony boots and gloves, each ending with a hoof, with laced up leather sleeves reaching past their knees and elbows. The pony gloves seemed to have an extension to compensate for their legs being longer than their arms. They both had pony tails attached to plugs in their asses. As for their heads, the twin ponytails had been released so their hair flowed freely. They had bridle bars in their mouths and blinders beside their eyes. They now had proper leather reins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which one would you like, My Lady?\" asked Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Elena decided to ride Vicki. She climbed onto her back and settled in the saddle. Josh smiled and climbed into Jenna's saddle. They both unlocked the chains keeping them in the stables and set out. Josh hit the open button on the wall and the sliding doors opened. They rode their mounts out the door and it closed behind them. They rode side by side all the way home, occasionally leaning over to kiss each other. Before long, they reached the house. Elena went up and made sure that Jeremy wasn't home before leading Jenna and Vicki inside. Josh led the three of them upstairs, and curiously there was a letter taped to Jeremy's door that was addressed to him and Elena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dear Lovebirds,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI figured you would want some privacy, so I tweaked the timeline a bit. Jeremy was accepted for a prestigious art scholarship in New York, so he will be safe and far away from all the coming danger. I also took care of his drug problem and set him up with his beloved Anna, so they are now as in love with each other as they would have been in a year without my intervention. I told her that she didn't have to worry about freeing her mother, so you should probably take care of that. Also don't worry about Pearl killing him for revenge, because if you don't claim her, I will put a non-aggression tweak in her head. Don't worry about thanking me, just come by my store from time to time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour friendly neighbourhood sex god,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEros</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that was nice of him.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I don't want Jeremy here when the vampire activity starts.\" said Elena<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey peeked inside Jeremy's old room to find that it had been turned into a second guest bedroom. They closed the door again and led Vicki and Jenna into Elena's room. He sat them down and took the bridles out of their mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you enjoy that?\" Josh asked them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was fun, Master.\" said Jenna<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I stay like this?\" asked Vicki<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not like that, but if you want to be a petgirl, then I can ask about it next time we're at Eros' store.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Master. Thank you.\" said Vicki<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you can stay like this until then.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I get changed now, Master?\" asked Jenna</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Yeah sure. Elena, please help Jenna change into something else.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh led Vicki out of the room, leaving Elena and Jenna to their business. They walked to the master bedroom and surveyed it. Josh took stock of everything in the room from clothing to the weapons in the concealed compartment in the closet. By the time he was finished, Elena and Jenna walked in. Elena had dressed Jenna in her sexy nurse costume(see s01e07). She was wearing the dress and the cap and the stockings, but had swapped the white sensible shoes with bright red 5\" pumps to match her lips which had been painted the same colour. The dress seemed a little tight in the chest, but that only served to enhance the view of cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I look, Master?\" asked Jenna<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the doorbell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get it.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe descended the stairs and opened the door. But there was nobody there. Only a package sat on the doorstep. Josh picked it up and read the note on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I hope this helps with breaking in the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Eros</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took the package upstairs to where Elena and Jenna were waiting. When he entered the room he found Elena and Jenna waiting eagerly, but Vicki had found a comfortable spot on the floor to pass out. Josh put a blanket over her body and a pillow under her head before tending to the two girls still conscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was at the door?\" asked Elena<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delivery from Eros.\" said Josh, holding up the package<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" asked Jenna<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's find out.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tore away the packaging and opened the box to find a mass of straps and buckles. It was only when he laid it out on the bed that he figured out what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bed restraints.\" stated Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes met Elena's, and they both looked at Jenna before looking back at each other and smiling. They set up the restraints, and put the leg and arm straps up on top of the bed for easy access. They both grabbed one of Jenna's hands and led her to the bed where they lay her down. They strapped in her wrists first, then her ankles, before stepping back to admire the result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a work of art right there.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I feel like something is missing.\" said Elena<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went into deep thought for a moment, before snapping her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got it.\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe un-strapped Jenna's ankles and reached up under the nurse's skirt. She pulled down Jenna's soaking wet panties and pulled them off her legs. She then strapped the older girl's ankles back in and inserted the balled up wet panties into Jenna's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. That's perfect.\" said Elena, satisfied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God you're amazing.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why thank you.\" said Elena with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled her close and kissed her passionately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What better place for our first time than on top of a sexy girl in a slutty costume tied up and helpless?\" said Josh when they broke apart<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena groaned with longing as she looked at where Jenna lay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you so much.\" she said to Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh kissed her lips sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get started. Why don't you start by warming her up.\" Josh suggested<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena climbed onto the bed from the foot and settled down between Jenna's legs. She put her head under the hem of the nurse's skirt and Jenna started moaning through the panties in her mouth as Elena started licking at her wet pussy. Josh climbed up behind her and started unlacing her dress, but Elena stopped what she was doing and turned to face him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't take it off. Fuck me in it.\" said Elena<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe area around her mouth and chin was covered in Jenna's juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's constricting and hot. Why do you want to keep it on?\" asked Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love everything about this dress. I love the way it feels, the way I look in it. I never want to take it off. But most of all I want to wear it in the future and every time I do I will remember our first time.\" said Elena<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. If that is your wish then I would be happy to comply.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stripped out of his own clothes and Elena went back to licking Jenna. He hiked up her skirt, exposing her bare ass and pussy. He dipped his fingers into Elena's pussy and they came out covered in fluid. He rubbed the wet fingers over her ass to lubricate it, before lining himself up. He plunged deep into her ass with a single thrust before continuing to thrust in and out rapidly. This caused a chain reaction. Elena started squirming and moaning in delight, and her mouth took up a frenzied pace on Jenna's pussy, causing the young woman to echo with her own moans of pleasure. The chorus of moans and flesh continued until Josh reached climax and came inside her ass. But he wasn't done yet. He pulled out of her, and his dick was soon hard again. He had an idea to change the positions. He pulled Elena out from between Jenna's legs, turned her around and lay her down so that her head rested on Jenna's breasts. Jenna was now writhing against her restraints from lack of release. Josh released the restraints on Jenna's wrists and tightened them onto Elena's wrists instead. Now Jenna's hands were free, but she was still pinned under Elena. Josh reclaimed his spot between Elena's legs and lined himself up with her dripping wet pussy. No sooner had he done so then Jenna's freed hands started working the only thing they could reach: Elena. It took all the willpower she had to maintain eye contact with Josh while he pounded into her with Jenna groping her breasts all the while. Elena just wrapped her thigh-high-leather-boot-encased legs around Josh's waist and held on for dear life as the world turned white and she forgot everything but her pleasure and her love for Josh. With one final thrust, Elena came with torrential force. Her inner walls clamped down on Josh as they climaxed together. Josh collapsed on top of Elena and they both passed out. Unable to reach climax herself, and unable to finish herself off, Jenna went to sleep horny, but happy about the role she had been allowed to play in her Master and Mistress' first time together. She couldn't be more proud.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Josh was the first to wake in the morning. He undid the restraints on his two bedmates' ankles and wrists. Then he rolled Elena off of Jenna and lay down between them. He slipped his arms beneath them and managed an arm around both of them. He pulled them close and drifted back to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe woke again later to a very pleasant feeling. He opened his eyes and looked down to find Vicki between his legs with her mouth enveloping his dick. He moaned as she licked and sucked until he came in her mouth. She swallowed it all before releasing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Master.\" said Vicki<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Vicki.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress Elena's pussy is very messy. She's leaking Master's cum onto the sheets. Should I clean her up like a good pet?\" asked Vicki<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, please do.\" said Josh with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicki planted herself and started licking at Elena's crotch. The sleeping girl started stirring and moaning. Josh lay next to her, watching her face unconsciously contort in pleasure. Her reactions became more and more intense until she woke as she climaxed, showering Vicki's face with her juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, sleepyhead.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena rolled her head sideways to face him. Josh leaned in closer and kissed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning.\" replied Elena<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cleaned you up, Mistress.\" said Vicki<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Vicki.\" said Elena, and she kissed her, tasting her own juices on the younger girl's lips<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena climbed out of bed and straightened out her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You smell amazing.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I smell like sex.\" said Elena<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\" replied Josh with a smirk<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena smiled and shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna go shower now.\" said Elena<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh watched her ass sway as she walked out the bedroom door. Vicki followed her, leaving Josh and Jenna alone in the bedroom. She started to wake up, so Josh took the panties out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Master.\" said Jenna with a sleepy smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Jenna.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she became more awake, she seemed to remember just how horny she was. She started moaning and writhing on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want it bad, don't you?\" questioned Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded frantically, her mouth still stretched in a moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe promptly spread her legs and entered her with a thrust. He pounded into her until they both cried out in ecstasy. Josh rolled off of her when they were done. Josh sat up and grabbed Jenna's hand with his own. He lead her out of bed and into the adjoining bathroom. Josh was already naked, but Jenna wasn't. He stripped her out of the nurse costume she was wearing and led her into the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you wouldn't rather do this with Mistress Elena?\" asked Jenna<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will do this with her. Many times. But right now it's your turn.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned on the water, and the fun started. Josh had her go about her normal shower routine while he fucked her up against the wall. They fucked and fucked until Jenna's legs grew so weak they collapsed beneath her. That was when she took him in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they exited the shower, they were both wet, tired and satisfied. They dried off, and Josh followed Jenna into the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does my beloved Master want me to wear today?\" asked Jenna<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh picked out a pair of leather pants, a tight leather jacket, and a pair of black strapped high heels. Jenna dropped the towel and reached for underwear. Josh stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just this.\" ordered Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cheeks flushed. She loved the way it made her feel when he ordered her. She put on the leather pants on first. She smoothed out the wrinkles and ran her hands up the inside of her thighs once more after she was done. Next came the heels, which were simple enough. Once they were on she put on the jacket. She zipped it up just enough so that there was a good amount of cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go do your makeup and hair. I'm going to check on Elena.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Master.\" said Jenna<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh left the room and walked down the hall and into Elena's room. He found her smoothing out her dress on a hanger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I could wear it all the time.\" said Elena thoughtfully<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Vicki?\" asked Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the shower.\" said Elena<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, the sound of running water began. Josh sat on the bed next to Elena and hugged her naked body from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to wear today?\" asked Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena picked out a form-fitting red t-shirt, blue skinny jeans, and a brown leather jacket. She picked a pair of brown heeled boots to go with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you gonna wear, Josh?\" asked Elena<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh had completely forgotten that he had no clothes. But another thought occurred to him, so on a hunch, he entered Jeremy's old room. He opened the closet and found a full wardrobe in his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eros, you really did think of everything.\" he said to himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to go with the basics for his first day. Blue jeans. White t-shirt. Black leather jacket. He chose a pair of hiking shoes to go with it. He went downstairs fully dressed, and found Jenna and Elena putting a small breakfast together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh, Bonnie is picking me up soon to go to school, but Jenna is driving Vicki later. How do you want to get there?\" asked Elena</span></div></div>",

Once he was finished, he looped an arm around her waist and pulled her close, leaning back in his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my dear pet, who shall we claim next?\" asked Josh</span></div></div>",

Josh stood first, and pulled Faye up by her collar. He led her out of the Boathouse to her car. After another rough kiss and slapping her ass, Josh got into the passenger seat, and Faye drove them to her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, Faye rushed up the stairs to her room. Josh smiled after her and slowly followed. When he found her, she had already changed into her slutty Red Riding Hood costume from the Halloween episode, Masked. She turned to face him and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been a very bad girl, Master.\" said Faye, while emphasizing her boobs by bringing her elbows together<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you know what happens to bad girls, don't you.\" said Josh, slowly walking towards her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They get punished.\" answered Faye<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh seized her waist and lifted her up. Faye wrapped her legs around his waist and her arms around his neck. Josh pushed her up against the wall and started kissing and biting down her. He stopped for a moment and stepped out of his pants, ripped off her panties and started fucking her pussy while resuming his earlier action. They continued, bouncing from wall to wall, until they climaxed and fell onto the bed together. But Josh wasn't done. He pulled out of Faye and rolled her onto her front before lifting her hips and entering her ass. Faye just moaned louder and louder as she went through orgasm after orgasm. When they were finished, Josh collapsed next to Faye. They drifted off to sleep together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was beginning to set when they woke up again. Josh got out of bed to put his pants back on. Faye tried to get out of bed to get a new pair of panties, but her legs failed her and she collapsed to the floor. Hearing the thud, Josh turned to check on Faye as he pulled his pants up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't walk!\" exclaimed Faye, \"You actually fucked me so hard that I can't walk. I thought that only happened in trashy romance novels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh thought for a moment, then he got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what, if you can get over here to give me a blowjob, then I will give you a present.\" offered Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Master.\" said Faye<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, Faye. This isn't an order. You don't have to do it if you can't handle it.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I can handle it.\" said Faye confidently<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. One more thing though.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe retrieved a pair of handcuffs from Faye's nightstand and locked her wrists behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No cheating.\" finished Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe returned to his earlier spot and dropped his pants again. He watched Faye slowly stagger to her feet. She slowly started to make her way over to him. It was funny for him to watch her fall, considering that her arms were locked behind her back. After a few falls, she made it to Josh. She dropped to her knees and wrapped her lips around his dick. She licked, sucked and throat fucked until Josh finally came in her mouth. She swallowed all of the cum, and licked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's my present, Master?\" asked Faye<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see. First, I need to catch your mother.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picked Faye up bridal style and lay her down on the bed. Then he teleported away to get supplies. He returned with industrial glue, solvent, and an unmarked box. He put the box down next to Faye's bed, and unlocked and then re-locked Faye's handcuffs so she was tied to the headboard now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No peeking.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then winked at her before going downstairs with the glue. He realized the timing was perfect as he looked out the window to see Dawn's car pulling into the driveway. He quickly spread the glue all over the floor just inside the front door. As the key entered the lock, Josh hid behind a nearby curtain.</span></div></div>",

She stepped right into the glue with her high-heeled shoes and completely immobilized herself without even realizing it, since she took a moment to put down her purse and take off her jacket. Avoiding the glue, Josh sneaked up behind her and pushed her. She pitched forward, out of her stuck shoes and planted her shins and hands in the glue, immobilizing herself completely. Josh hopped onto her back, to keep himself out of the glue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take anything you want. Just please don't hurt me.\" pleaded Dawn<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want your stuff, Dawn. And don't worry, I'm not going to hurt you.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh pulled a collar out and locked it around Dawn's neck. She immediately stopped struggling. Josh pulled out the solvent and sprayed it all over the glue-covered areas, turning the glue into water and freeing Dawn. He climbed off her back and pulled her to her feet by the ring on her collar. He led her up to Faye's room, where mother was forced to kneel before daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell her everything.\" Josh ordered Dawn<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by-\" Dawn was cut off by Josh slapping her across the face<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye was surprised to see this angry side of her Master, though seeing her mother put in her place kind of turned her on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know exactly what I mean.\" Josh said coldly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, please. Anything but that.\" begged Dawn<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh slapped her again. Seeing Faye's nervous expression, he unlocked her handcuffs and sat her up next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Faye. It's because I love you that what your mother has done angers me so much. You deserve to know all the terrible things she has done for power.\" explained Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye looked Josh in the eye for a long moment, before kissing him passionately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too, Master. No one has ever loved me as much as you do. I would do anything for you.\" said Faye<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said those last few words, her collar glowed gold, and fell apart, turning to dust as it touched the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" asked Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Master. I don't feel any different.\" said Faye<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh thought back to what Faye said just before the collar broke. Then it hit him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was no longer needed. When you said that you would do anything for me, that you loved me, that was genuinely you saying that.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh held her close and kissed her tenderly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Dawn. I believe you were about to share with your daughter.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tear fell from Dawn's eye as she recounted all the things she and Charles had done. Only the soothing effect of Josh's arms around her and her inability to walk kept her from striking her mother. Once Dawn was finished, Josh spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, give it to her.\" he ordered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no.\" stuttered Dawn<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give her the crystal, Dawn.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-never.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take off your clothes and lick Faye's pussy.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took only a few seconds to remove all her clothes and put her head between Faye's legs and start licking. Faye started moaning as Dawn teased her still hyper-sensitive pussy. Meanwhile, Josh went through her clothes and retrieved the crystal from her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn realized what Josh was doing and stopped what she was doing. She got up and charged at Josh. But halfway there, her collar glowed. But not the gold colour Faye's had been. Her collar turned pink and stayed that way. When the glow faded, she crouched on her heels with her knees spread wide and her hands planted on the ground inbetween and her boobs pressed out between her arms. She must have also been rendered very horny because her pussy was so wet it was dripping onto the floor. (The pink collar restricts their free will and makes them sluttier. But it only forms after an act of aggression towards the master is made)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stand up.\" Josh ordered<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn stood up. Josh handed her the box that was sitting next to Faye's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go put this on and put your hair in a double braid.\" ordered Josh (by double braid I mean the hair style that Faye had with her costume in Masked)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Master.' said Dawn, and she left the room with the box<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh handed the crystal to Faye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I give you the key to solo magic.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye's jaw dropped and her eyes went wide. Josh placed it in her hand and closed her fingers around it. Faye's eyes filled with joy and she wrapped Josh in a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Master. Thank you so, so much.\" cried Faye<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh returned the hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only the best for you.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye put the crystal in her nightstand for safekeeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir attention turned to the door as it opened. In walked Dawn, with her hair pulled into two braids, one on each side of her neck, and a leather strap harness criss-crossing her torso, but leaving her boobs free. Josh walked over to Dawn and led her over to Faye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get down on all fours.\" ordered Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn got down on hands and knees, rendering Faye able to see what the harness was for. On Dawn's back, was a saddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like your prize?\" asked Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like it? I love it.\" said Faye<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the earlier fucking, and the challenge that won her the prize, Faye's legs were completely worn out. So the saddle was very appealing to her right now. Faye put on a new pair of panties and Josh lifted her into the saddle and strapped her legs in. She quickly became acquainted with how to control her temporary method of transportation. She used the two braids as reins, and slapped her ass to move forward. After testing her out a bit, Faye steered Dawn over to where Josh was sitting on the bed. Faye leaned forward and undid Josh's pants, freeing his dick. Dawn was so horny that as soon as she caught sight of the male sex organ, she captured it in her mouth and started to suck on it. Josh captured Faye's lips with his while she played with Dawn's boobs. Faye broke the kiss and started slapping Dawn's ass. This drove her crazy and made her blowjob more intense. Josh climaxed soon after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh got up and helped Faye out of the saddle and onto the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, does Faye still need the saddle?\" asked Dawn<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She might still need it in the morning, so leave it on.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh turned to Faye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy the show.\" he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned back to Dawn and grabbed her waist. He fucked her pussy until they both climaxed, then pulled out and started on her ass. All the while, Faye watched, mesmerized by the display before her. She couldn't help but play with her boobs and pinch her nipples until she too climaxed. After Josh and Dawn were finished, Josh climbed into bed with Faye, and pulled up the covers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where will I sleep, Master?\" asked Dawn<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Climb under the covers and curl up with our feet to keep them warm.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn had expected her Master to send her to sleep on the floor, or even outside. So she was ecstatic to receive a position not just in the bed, but under the covers too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Master.\" Dawn said happily<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn eagerly climbed under the covers and cuddled her Master's and Faye's feet. Feeling content, she drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been quite a day, hasn't it Faye?\" asked Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That it has, Master. That it has.\" said Faye<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh gave Faye one last kiss, before they both fell asleep in each others arms.</span></div></div>",

Thanks to you, Master.\" said Daphne<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, I want to thank you for yesterday. Sincerely. I don't know what I would have done without you there. I probably would have bottled it up like I always do. What I'm trying to say is that after yesterday, I would do anything for you. I love you, now and forever.\" said Daphne<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said those last few words, her collar glowed gold, and fell apart, turning to dust as it touched the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" asked Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Master. I don't feel any different.\" said Daphne<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh thought back to what Daphne said just before the collar broke. Then it hit him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was no longer needed. When you said that you would do anything for me, that you loved me, that was genuinely you saying that.\" said Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh held her close and kissed her tenderly.</span></div></div>",

With his arms around Daphne's lower back, he began to kiss her neck. Daphne's head tilted back as she moaned loudly. Josh stood up, still holding and kissing her. Daphne wrapped her legs around his waist, grinding her pelvis against his. She put her arms around his neck, freeing his arms to undo his pants, which fell to the floor and he stepped out of them. He hiked up her skirt and tore off her matching set of bra and panties before pinning her against her bedroom wall and he lined the head of his dick up with the mouth of her wet pussy. He paused, both of them were breathing heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's your first time. Do you want me to take it slow?\" asked Josh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Master.

So her pussy was very tight. Which as he fucked her hard and rough, turned out to be extremely pleasurable for both of them. When they finally climaxed, Josh backpedaled and landed both of them on the bed. They shared another kiss and stared into each others eyes.</span></div></div>",

Shunned by his peers for no reason, and burdened with unrealistic expectations by his parents, Josh jumps at the chance for the adventure Eros starts him on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEros: ???, sex god. When he was a mortal, he was in a situation similar to Josh's. So when he became a hero of Olympus and offered ascension to god-hood, he claimed dominion over sex. Seeing much of himself in Josh, Eros aspires to help the poor boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEros gives Josh the ability to teleport in space, time and between universes, and to. He also gave him a bag full of magic collars, which would ensnare any woman once enclosed around her neck. The collar would make the woman into Josh's servant. The collars have a perception filter, which is a psychic field that manipulates how others perceive an object or person. Josh controls the field on each collar, so he can make it so that nobody remembers them, leave them unchanged, or make them completely invisible. The perception filter doesn't work on Josh, or anyone wearing a collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Josh is the centre of this story's universe. If he dies, the universe collapses<br>\r\n2. The power of the collars is paramount; nothing can overpower them<br>\r\n3. The collars do not work on Josh<br>\r\n4. Josh is 100% straight, but his girls will fool around with each other as well<br>\r\n5. The collar also acts to repel other men as well as lesbians so no matter how slutty they are dressed, they do not risk being raped<br>\r\n6. No girls more than 3 years younger than Josh<br>\r\n7. Josh doesn't like cartoons or anime, so he will only visit the universes of movies and shows with real people acting<br>\r\n8. Live action versions of cartoons and anime still count as cartoons/anime<br>\r\n9. Only Josh can use the collars<br>\r\n10. When Josh teleports between universes or in time, all his girls are brought with him<br>\r\n11. Josh isn't into anything gross<br>\r\n12. Poorly written or rule-breaking chapters may be prone to mysterious disappearances<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, have fun</td>",
