It felt strange to him, already he was 18 and yet he felt like he barely had anytime at all to live his life. Soon he would be off to college and saying good bye to all the friends he knew and parents he loved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small party he was having at his house was just for close family and friends. His parents, his best friend Eddie, and his friend Jessica. (He had a crush on Jessica for years, and while they had come close a few times, the timing never seemed quite right.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine first!\" Eddie said tossing a small but heavy package at Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing Ethan took it and opened it up only to find a giant box of condoms waiting for him....Eddie burst out laughing so as Ethan's face turned such a bright shade of red in front of his parents who were now laughing themselves. \"I figured college boy will need his protection!\" Eddie said as Jessica rolled her eyes pushing the big dummy out of her way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here..Mine is a little more personal..\"  She said smiling handing Ethan a modest sized box. Opening it up Ethan pulled out what looked like a nice pair of sandals except they were pink....\"I know they're pink...but that's my favorite color, so maybe if you wear on the beach or something you can remember me?\" She said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan wasn't sure if he was touched or hurt at her suggestion that he might ever forget her. His parents were next giving him a simple envelope inside it was a check for $1,000. \"We figured you were old enough now to plan for your future, we hope this gets you started.\" His parents told him as they seemed to be hiding something as several wrapped boxes were still hidden in the closet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with those?\" Ethan said as his curious nature wanted to know what they were hiding. His parents shrugged him off. \"Those are for later, for another time...\" His mom said as his dad quickly jumped in with his friends joking around getting his mind back to the party. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe party was awesome as Ethan felt like passing out from so much cake as he laid in bed that night finding it hard to sleep for some reason, as thoughts of those boxes kept coming back to him. </span></div></div>",

Deciding it might be important he slipped out of bed only wearing a t-shirt and gym shorts as he made his way to the closet he found the boxes laying there neatly still. Finding one that looked easy to open he gently unwrapped it and opened it up, inside what not what he expected to find as he pulled out a matching pink bra and pantie set...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" He thought to himself as he moved over to another box as he pulled out a tank top and short shorts from that box. The next one contained hip hugger jeans and a blouse, while another had a pair of high heels and a dress. All the boxes were filled with girl's clothes and accessories as Ethan began to think. He had no female cousins...no sisters...and they were much to small for his mom or aunt, so who where they for?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up Ethan walking to the window looking outside as he tried to figure out what was going on. However he was soon interrupted by an odd pain in his gut..He rubbed his stomach but for some reason the discomfort seemed to increase...At first he thought he was something he ate but the feeling began to spread all over his body as it soon felt like his whole body was being poked and prodded from the inside. Reaching a hand up to feel his temperature he brushed the hair out of his eyes to get a good feel...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when his eyes widened as he realized he never had to brush any hair out of his eyes before...Rushing to the nearest mirror Ethan saw his normal simple short hair was growing longer past his ears now....Holding up several strands of hair he could actually see it slowly getting longer....\"This isn't possible...\" He said stunned as his eyes soon caught the attention of his hand. It was smaller and thinner, it could almost be called dainty...The nails were also growing longer before his eyes as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was changing....He didn't know how or why, all he knew was that he was changing into something as something in the back of his mind told him what it was as he gazed to the closet.</span></div></div>",

Gripping his sides in pain as he let out moans of agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan's parents rushed downstairs as they burst into his room. What they saw was their son with rapidly growing hair and nails as he looked back to them terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, Dad, something's happening to me!\" He called out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan's parents looked to him then back to each other before suddenly letting out a collective sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank god!\" His mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally we were getting worried.\" His dad replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan was both confused and Terrified by their reaction. His hair was now past his neck in length and his nails were at least a quarter inch long!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry son, we had hoped this first change would happen painless in your sleep. However it seems that's not going to happen. It's best to just relax. Let the changes happen. Once they are finished we will talk.\" His dad said shutting the door to give him some privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan was both furious and terrified. His body was changing right in front of them and they play it off like nothing! Normally he would have said something in protest but the pain of the changes was getting too intense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan took off his clothes in a hurry as he stared at himself trying to figure out what was happening. His hair was now past his shoulders as still growing. It was also changing color. His normal dark brown hair was getting lighter. It was turning a bright blonde color! It continued its growth down his shoulders until it reached his mid back. If he didn't know better he would say it looked just like a girls....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter seeing his hair and nails change it was growing more obvious what was happening to him. Ethan just didn't want to accept it....He was rapidly loosing height and muscle mass as he shrunk down to about 5'5 from his normal 6 foot. His muscles began to retract and withdraw leaving him with much thinner limbs. His body hair was also withdrawing back into his body leaving him with perfectly smooth skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan let out a cry of pain as his bones began to pop and reshape. His hips were pushing out getting wider while he chest and body frame was getting smaller. Leaning against the wall Ethan felt a pressure building up in his backside as his butt began to swell and push out. His figure was quickly turning totally feminine giving him an hourglass shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changes were reaching their climax as Ethan felt a pressure building up in his chest. His nipples were already swollen and the flesh beneath them was beginning to rise....Ethan cried out trying to get them to stop growing only to have the rising flesh continue to push outwards. His new breasts quickly rose pat A cup and B cup sizes. They seemed to swell larger with each breath his took. Soon they were C-cups but still growing. They reached a large D-cup size as they finished their growth as they remained very perky and round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan felt his Adam's apple vanish as his voice got lighter. His face was reshaping and reforming into a very pretty female. All his features seemed to reforming perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only one final change. Reaching down Ethan felt his manhood slipping away from him. It slid away sliding between his fingers as it shrunk away. It was pulling up into something. A new wet and warm slit was taking its place As Ethan finally lost the thing that truly made him a male....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final changes all settled into place as his body finished reforming. Within the span of only about ten minutes Ethan had fully changed from a normal 18 year old boy to a very pretty and sexy girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan was stunned, unable to speak or do anything but stare at his new body. He felt sick, terrified, angry, all these emotions at once. He was hotter than any girl he knew now! How could this happen? Why did this happen? All these questions demanded answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever first there was a knock on his door as Ethan told his parents to wait as he looked for some clothes to wear. Remembering the bag he found a blouse and pair of tight jeans that worked. He quickly slipped them on as he stared at his new body for a moment.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://iv1.lisimg.com/image/8208528/640full-maria-doroshina.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://iv1.lisimg.com/image/8208528/640f...</a></span></div></div>",

It took a lot of energy out of him like a good workout would have. His center of gravity was also off donhis his new frame and the new unfamiliar weight on his chest pulling him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis parents were waiting in the Kitchen for him as he slowly made his way over to the table and sat down. He was both furious and curious, he had a million questions and he wanted answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily please just listen to what we have to say first.\" His mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily? Why did you call me that?\" Ethan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the name we gave you when you were born.\" She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily honey this is not gonna be easy to understand but please  listen. You were born with a very unique chromosome structure. Different from almost everyone else. It's called the XYZ Chromosome. It's a very rare genetic abnormality that causes someone to switch genders under certain circumstances. When you were baby you used to switch genders all the time. However at that age the stress of the changes could have proven fatal. Doctors were able to give us some medication that helped you. At first it stopped the changes all together. However we were warned that when you reached adulthood it would no longer work. We have been preparing for this ever since.\" His Dad explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So am I really a boy or girl?\" Ethan asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There isn't a good answer that question. In a way you are both. Your future now is up to you now. Your condition works on 24 hour cycles for now. This means every 24 hours you will change. However this is just an educated guess by the dicotors. Sometimes it may be more or less. Over time your condition will react to your emotions and feelings too. This means you will spend more time in the form you desire most. There are a few expections however.\" His dad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" Emily....or Ethan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well for starts you won't have periods like a normal girl. This doesn't mean you don't have to worry about getting preganant however....You can still get pregnant and if you do, that's it....You are a girl forever.\" Her mom replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well how will I know when I'm ovulating? What about birth control?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately the pill won't work with you because of your shifting genes. Any sex you have as a girl must be with a condom or someone who can't have children. As for ovulation that will be easy. Your body will undergo a second change during the three day ovulation cycle. During this time your breasts will be bigger and your body will be much more sensitive. Other minor changes might occur but you will feel it for sure. During this time you will remain female and your body will be the most vulnerable to getting impregnated. Any sex during this MUST BE protected or else there is a 99% chance you will find yourself preganant. It will be a difficult three days for you as your body will be very easily turned on by things tempting you. Fortunately for you, the three day cycle you fall on matches the Full moon cycle so you can foresee when your ovulation time is coming and prepare.\" Emily's mother explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god...this seems overwhelming.\" Emily said realizing how much more complicated her life was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer parents seemed to want her to live her life with condition how she saw fit. That meant telling only people she wanted and trying to live as normal life as possible.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Emily thought today was a going to be a very simple day of shopping. Pick up more clothes to fit her new body, nothing too extreme. However Emily\u2019s Mom had other ideas. She wasn\u2019t content with having Emily wearing baggy or simple clothes. In her mind the only way for her to quickly adjust to being female 50% of the time was to take a serious plunge into girly territory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis meant all the clothes and shoes they were trying on were as feminine as possible. The Stop was a shoe store where Emily\u2019s mom showed her all sorts of open toed shoes. Sandals, flip flops, but the worst was when she brought out a pair of heels to try on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo I have to?\u201d Emily pleaded looking at the high heeled sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sweetie, the sooner you learn the easier it will be.\u201d Her Mom replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily reluctantly tried on the heels which weren\u2019t as bad as she thought. However once she stood up she almost immediately fell over. Over the next several minutes her mom showed her all the right ways to balance in walk in heels. Emily slowly got the hang of it as she noticed walking in heels like this made her butt and hips sway a lot more when she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next stop was a clothing store wear Emily was forced to try on all manner of dresses and skirts. The feeling of if a skirt was so alien to Emily. The idea anybody could see up there was so strange it caused her to blush every time she sat down. They left the store with her wearing a cute yellow sundress that matched the white heels she had on nicely, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final stop was a lingerie store. Emily had to learn her bra size and all the right kinds of bras and underwear she looked best in. After measuring she found out she was a 36 D cup. Nice and large but still rounded with no sagging. She tried on several different types of bras until she finally managed to get them on all on her own. She left with several sexy styles mostly push up bras, booty short panties and even a couple thongs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhausted the two ladies went to the local food court to relax and eat before heading home. As they sat down however Emily suddenly froze as her Mom started waving at a very familiar face. It was Eddie....Ethan\u2019s best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there Mrs. Edwards! How\u2019s it going?\u201d He said walking over. When Eddie saw Emily he almost froze too. Not because he recognized her, but because he was looking at a stunningly sexy girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh hey there...I\u2019m Eddie, Ethan\u2019s friend and you are?\u201d He said offering his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily shook his hand politely and smiled back trying to hide her nervousness. \u201cUmm, I\u2019m Emily, Ethan\u2019s...cousin I\u2019m staying with my Aunt for a little while.\u201d Emily said making up the best story she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow Ethan never mentioned he had such a beautiful cousin. We should hang out sometime.\u201d Eddie said as he turned around to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily felt relieved for moment until her phone suddenly started playing the annoying ring tone Eddie had put in there to tease Ethan every time he texted him. Without thinking too much about it Emily picked up the phone and read the text that just came though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude I just met your cousin and Mom at the mall today! You never said you had a cousin so sexy! She said she is staying with you for awhile too! We all need to hang out!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnily was a bit embarrassed at the text but flattered too. Sighing she was about to put the phone down when another message came though from Eddie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook up\u201d Was all it said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily slowly looked up to see Eddie still standing there as he had heard the ringtone come from Ethan\u2019s phone as he stood there both curious and confused.</span></div></div>",

Well, as I said, we should all hang out sometime.\u201d He turns and walks away, with his hand in the air to wave goodbye. Emily let\u2019s out her breath.

On the way there, Emily catches a glimpse of Eddie watching her walk out of the mall. He quickly turns and walks in the other direction when he realizes he\u2019s caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they get outside, the sun is shining bright. It\u2019s a hot summer day. Suddenly Emily is very happy she\u2019s able to wear things like sundresses now. It\u2019s a lot more comfortable on a hot day, or really just more comfortable in general than she expected. Although the feeling of being \u2018exposed\u2019 is still there and is hard to shake off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get home, your mom asks what your plans for the rest of the day are.</span></div></div>",

When she arrived, she saw that she was pretty much the only one there. She put her phone in the center console since she didn\u2019t have any pockets in the yellow sundress she was still wearing. She looks in the mirror to make sure she looks okay before getting out of the car and beginning her walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eventually sat down at a bench to take a break for a minute. This was exactly what she needed to clear her head. This was all so crazy, yesterday the idea of changing sexes was just something out of a sci-fi movie now it's her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she\u2019s lost in her thoughts, staring at the trees, she doesn\u2019t notice that somebody is walking up to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me, I just thought you should know that when you sit like that the whole world can see up your dress.\u201d Emily snaps her legs shut and turns to the voice.

I mean Jessica.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica laughs, \u201cOne of my best friends calls me that, it\u2019s fine if you do too. Well hey, I\u2019ve gotta run. I\u2019ll see you around, Okay?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good, Bye!\u201d Emily says, waving to Jessica as she leaves. It\u2019s getting dark, Emily decides it\u2019s probably time for her to leave too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she gets back home, her mom is in the kitchen making food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh! You\u2019re back just in time for dinner.\u201d She says as she grabs an additional plate from the cabinet and starts putting food on each plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how was the park? Meet any cute boys?\u201d Emily\u2019s Mom asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa-Ha, very funny. No, but I actually ran into Jessica, we talked for a minute. Both of my best friends have officially met Emily now.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell good! Are you going to tell either of them?\u201d Emily thinks about her mom's question for a minute before responding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI might tell Jessica because it would nice to have another girl to help me out. I\u2019m kind of worried that Eddie is into me. I don\u2019t want to ruin my friendship with Jessica if she thinks that Eddie and I are doing anything. I know it would really hurt her since she still likes Eddie. By the way, when will I change back to Ethan?\u201d Emily says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it should be about every 24 hours, and as I said, it could fluctuate. Honestly though, I expected you would have changed back by now. The fact that you haven\u2019t changed back yet might mean that you like being a girl more than you thought you would and your body is already responding to that.\u201d She smiles at Emily with a raised eyebrow. Emily turns a little red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s definitely not as bad as I expected.\u201d Emily finishes her dinner and helps her Mom clean up the mess from dinner before heading to her room. She takes off her dress and puts on a t-shirt and yoga shorts to get comfortable. She falls down into bed and is quickly asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning...</span></div></div>",

See, I have a weird chromosome structure. Rather than the typical XY like most guys, mine is XYZ.

Unfortunately, it doesn't work now that I am 18. So every 24 hours, I turn into Emily. 24 hours after that, I return to being Ethan, and so on.

So sometime tonight, I will become Emily again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica doesn't say anything. After a few minutes, you grow impatient and continue, \"Apparently the changes will react to what I'm feeling. Those 24-hour cycles will be broken and last longer depending on which one I prefer. Right now it seems to be right around 24 hours. I won't have a period as Emily, but I will still ovulate. During those three days, I stay as Emily. The only way to permanently disrupt the cycles is to get pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica is much quicker to respond this time. \"You expect me to believe all that, with absolutely no proof?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, you're welcome to spend the night and see for yourself.\" you retort.

His height shrunk from 6\u20191 to 5\u20197. His weight and body mass shrunk along with it giving him a more petite and feminine frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis dark brown hair turned bright blonde and grew down his back until it touched the top off his butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis nails grew longer as his hands and feet shrunk. His body hair began to disappear into his body. His legs and arms grew thinner as his stomach got tighter and leaner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hips poppped outwards as his butt began to grow into a sexy tear drop shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis nipples grew larger and wider as his breasts began to swell. They grew quickly past A-cups, then B-cups, them C-cups, finally settling at nice large D-cup as they hung naturally with nice tear drop shapes from her chest but retained a nice perky and firm nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis manhood began to shrink and shrivel as a new slit formed in its place. It finally shrank and reformed into a perfect smooth vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan\u2019s face and voice changed last as his voice changed as his Adam\u2019s apple disappeared. His face feminized as his lips grew pouty and his eyelashes longer. His features were nice and soft now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final changes ripples through Emily\u2019s body as she cried out before they finally finished. It took several minutes for her to stand as the transformation was still painful and exhausting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEmily?

His figure began shifting taking on what looked like a very feminine shape as he could feel his hips swaying as his stomach flattened and toned out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon he felt a pressure on his chest as he looked down to his pecs as they began to swell. \"No...\" He said before the pressure began building as he cupped his now swollen pecs as they continued growing in his palms. Letting out what sounded like a soft moan his pecs were forming into what were unmistakable for breasts. They kept growing A...B...C...finally stopping at a light D-cup range hanging perfectly from his chest<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the last remnant of his manhood Ethan soon felt it slipping away as well as he desperately tried to hold  onto it before it felt it slip away between his fingers as a new soft, sensitive, and wet opening formed between his legs...His face soon shifted as well becoming softer and more pert as his features fully shifted to female.

Not only that this body was incredibly sexy and she knew she would be targeted  by horny guys now. Speaking of this body, Elisha realized she hadn't actually gotten a full view yet....I mean this was her body right? She was entitled to take a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up she walked over to the body mirror hanging on her door. She saw how ridiculous her over sized t shirt and sweats looked on this body. She was clearly shorter than before, probably around 5'6 now. Her breasts pushed out against the fabric of the shirt as Elisha noticed the strange new sensitivity of his nipples. Taking off his shirt and sweats he got a full view of his naked body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit....I'm HOT!\" She thought to herself as she turned around slowly getting a nice view of her fuller smooth behind. Spinning around again she noticed the new added weight to her chest from her breasts as she piked them up slowly in her hands feeling their weight in her palms. It felt like holding two over filled water balloons but these were stuck on her chest. Letting them go they dropped quickly as he felt a small singe of pain due to their high sensitivity. He swung around a bit watching his new tits wobble and move with his body mesmerized by their movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do chicks love with these things all the time?\" She thought as she played with her new soft assets. Large ones like these seemed like such a pain to manage as they were clearly bigger than a handful for her. Just one of he many new things she was going to have to get used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this playing about with herself and Elisha didn't even realize the wet sensation building between her legs. At first it felt similar to sweating as she glanced down realizing where the sensation was coming from....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god I turned myself on!\" She said realizing what she did. She looked down seeing the new smoith slit between her long feminine legs. She should continue, pry a little deeper? I mean this is her body right?</span></div></div>",

This was the best experience of your life and she  wrapped her legs around him and moaned louder . \u201c ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh~  mmmmmmmm~ Ohhhh KRISSSSSSSSSSS keep keep going\u201d she screamed and moaned. Kris  continued an  very soon she orgasmed and  was sweaty and tired but kris  wasn\u2019t done yet and  continue . She started to moan again and moaned his name. After a few minutes kris starts to cum inside elisha and she loved the feel and said \u201cohhhh yessss~ morrrrreeeee please. Kris continue to cum inside her unit finally he orgasmed inside of her and that caused her to orgasm again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them were tried and kris started to cuddle with Elisha and Elisha cuddled with him and he fell asleep on her breasts. Elisha looked at him and  realize she should\u2019ve been mad but she feels happy and  started to rub his head as he was on her breast. He then  begun to  drool on her breast but  instead of pushing him off, she let his drool get all over her breast and she even started to hold him as a  breast-feeding mother would her baby and  his mouth even latched onto her breast and started sucking. This cause Elisha to feel pleasure and wet again but he  manage to fight these \u201cgirl body instincts and feelings\u201d and  got him off his breast . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n That  woke him up and he looked at her and  realize what he did . \u201cOh oh Ethan I am  so sorry I had to  please forgive me\u201c  he begged . \u201c I mean I know I should feel mad but I don\u2019t but  i\u2019m still  a little upset  you had sex with me without my permission \u201c she said. \u201c is there anyway I can make it up to you?\u201d He asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm well you could buy me some boy clothes that fit me\u201d she said. \u201cWait  you don\u2019t want girl clothes ?\u201d He asked. \u201cNo .

Bras and panties are  for girls  on the inside and out .\u201d She said. \u201cOk so  you\u2019ll be OK with your nipple  showing through your shirt?\u201d He asked. \u201cWell  it doesn\u2019t bother me plus  I can  always  wear something over my shirt that can cover it .

She was wearing a baggy over sized T-shirt and sweat pants so a makeover and new clothes were definitely in order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first stop was a makeover. The two girls stopped into a spa and got facials followed by a mani-peti. Elisha also got her nails done with French tips and her straightened. Looking at herself in the mirror she felt shocked by just how pretty she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next stop was a clothing store. Jessica had to help Elisha because she had no idea what size she was for anything yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see, 5'6, 110lbs, 36 D-Cup breasts, and a size 6 shoe size and a size 2 dress size. Not bad at all.\" Jessica said after they finished her measurements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica had Elisha try on an outfit she thought would look great for this summer. It was an orange bikini and a pair of short denim shirts with a yellow tank top and white flip flops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she tried on the outfit Elisha looked to herself in the mirror as she saw this relflection staring back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AW9apIjj2ek/UdRW6-AhcmI/AAAAAAAAB-s/IHw0lN2kn_U/s900/busty-teen-blonde-model-orange-bikini.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AW9apIjj2ek/Ud...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn.....I'm hot!\" Elisha said as she walked outside showing off the outfit to Jessica who approved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls finished their shopping as they went out to meet up with Eddie. He hadn't seen her yet so Elisha was definitely nervous. As they approached the food court Eddie saw them as Jessica waved him over. Once he got closer he saw Elisha who immediately blushed as Eddie looked to her with wide open eyes....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow....Ethan is that really you?\" Eddie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes....call me Elisha when I'm like this please.\" She said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh okay I'm sorry Elisha. Wait what do you mean like this?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm not always going to be a girl. Basically for the next year or so I'm going to be changing back and forth between Ehan and Elisha. I don't really know when or how long either. I could be like this for several days or maybe just several hours.\" Elisha said nervously <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it doesn't matter who you are you are still my friend, and if I can say so you make an amazingly beautiful girl!\" He said as Jessica flashed him a dirty look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three friends spent the rest of the evening together shopping and having Elisha adjust to her new body. With her lighter frame and large breasts her center of gravity was way off. After awhile they decided to call it a night as Elisha went home with bags of clothes for her new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt home Elisha felt exhausted as she collapsed on her bed and looked down at her body.

Her new large breasts felt weird and constantly kept pressing up against her as she moved around. While the other distraction of the new absence between his legs kept him wide awake. He was so tempted to peak at himself and maybe even explore this new body but he was too scared of what he would see. Part of him refused to accept this change and brush this off as a bad dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen morning finally crept into Ethan's window he shot himself up quickly looking down. He let out a sigh of relief seeing his old chest instead of two large and perky breasts. He looked around the room trying to see if it had all just been one bad nightmare. Jumping out of bed he left his room only catch his parents waiting for him in the living room. Ethan's eyes widened as he knew what they were going to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey...we need to talk.\" His mom said as those four words validated what he already knew in his heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That....was all real?\" He muttered almost ready to well up in tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes honey...we need to discuss your future. Things are obviously going to be very different now.\" His mom replied as Ethan slumped down on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son...you were born different.\" His dad said walking up behind him. \"We never told you this but you were actually born a girl.\" His dad said as Ethan sat there stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"During my pregnancy we were unable to identity your sex. We went in multiple times for ultrasounds but each time they gave us a different answer. After you were born you appeared to be a healthy girl and we were happy. However before we could take you home you suddenly changed. No one knows how but when the doctors found you instead there was a boy. Afterwards many tests and studies were performed on you. They discovered you had a unique genetic abnormality. Your Y chromosome was unstable and changing back and forth. After some hormone therapy the doctirs finally said your chromosome was stable in Y form. From that point on we raised you as our son.\" His father explained the situation as Ethan could barely believe this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why am I changing now?\"  Ethan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well a few years ago after a routine visit we received notice that your chromeosome was acting up again. Gradually becoming more unstable. Doctors said by around your 18th birthday you could start changing again. However they noticed that the chromosome for some reason now is much more unstable at night. So for now we had to prepare for this fact that you might start switching again. Last proved what we feared. So for now you will have to accept that you will have to spend your nights as a girl.\" His mother told him as she places a hand in his knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you said there was a a way I could stop this right?\" Ethan said. Looking for some glimmer of hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the doctors said that this time your chromosome would list likely rest itself after a period of time. So we really just have to wait and see.\" His dad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long?\" Ethan asked as his parents grew still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A....a year....\" His mom said as Ethan stood up in rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A year! I'm supposed to live like this for a year?! Spend my nights cooped up away from everyone I know and shunned from society?\" Ethan said furious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey we never said anything like that. You will just have to adapt and start making some...changes...tonyiur routine.\" His mom said. \"We want you to have a happy life and we love you boy or girl.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just too much I need some time to think.\" Ethan said as he grabbed his wallet and keys and ran out the door.</span></div></div>",

Still hoping this was some kind of awful nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heavy sloshing of his bust, as he leapt up the stairs two at a time, felt too real. Maybe... Maybe that was part of this nightmare. He didn't see his mum behind him go after him, or his dad's hand rest on her arm. Leaving him to adjust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrified, by the shimmying weight, and that tugging at his shoulders, Ethan launched himself onto his bed, throwing himself onto it. The mattress gave, as Ethan curled up. It was hard to ignore his body. Pulling the quilt over himself, he hoped hiding his body from sight might shatter the illusion. But, even in the dark, beneath the quilt, it was impossible to pretend he was still male. The soft fleshy thighs scissoring over one another.... <i>with no obstructions between them</i>. His restless arms brushing over his bust, and even the briefest of contacts with those too large.... far too large nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan didn't recall getting comfortable, but the warm bedding, and the familiar scents lulled him back to sleep. It was a restless sleep, as he tossed and turned. Moaning in protest, Ethan was chased in his dreams. Mumbling denials in his sleep. His emotions turbulent, his hormones raging through his blood, once more Ethan's body changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaunted by vague nightmares, already fading. Ethan was drowning his bed. Tossing the quilt aside, he leapt free from the bed. As if erupting from it, as the cause of his nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven bleary eyed, and half-asleep. He felt the weight pulling at his shoulders. The heavy bust trying to throw him from his feet. The sheer undeniable reality of his body sending this morning's conversation back like an icy tsunami. Ethan glowered at his body. It was worse, more humiliating, more degrading... more feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/da/46/41/da46416ce64bfdd785690f74731f0cd7.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/da/46/41/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwaying unsteadily, his vision darkening at the edges. Ethan felt the risk of fainting threaten to steal him away once more. Resolutely, planting his feet wider apart, he fought the pull of unconsciousness. If this monstrosity of a body, happened after one snooze, he dreaded to think how much worse things might be when he woke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing gulps of air, he took the chill bedroom air deep into his lungs. A nervous tongue darting out to wet his lips. He never imagined missing, wanting his former body. Hell, even those simple D-cups would've been preferable to these....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan cradled his bust, trying to estimate their size now, their weight. The floorboards creaked beneath his feet. No! Her feet! she sternly told herself. When I'm like this. She shuddered, but continued. When I'm like this, I'm a woman.</span></div></div>",

And Mom told me it would happen again tonight, and every night.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got dressed and went downstairs, where Mom and Dad were having breakfast. \"Good morning, Ethan,\" Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mother tells me you met, uh, Emily last night,\" Dad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" Ethan helped himself to some cereal. \"Mom, you said there was a way to stop changing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, there is. But it might not - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it? If there's some way I can stop going from man to woman and back, I want to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad set aside his paper. \"There's really only one way to break the cycle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad sighed. \"You would have to get pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that it?\" Ethan chuckled. \"I thought it was something harder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ethan,\" Mom began, but Dad shushed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan slowly began to realize. \"To stop changing, I have to get pregnant. To get pregnant, I have to be Emily. But, if I stop changing when I'm Emily,... I... won't be Ethan anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's a matter of how long I can put up with the changes before I decide I'd rather be just Emily than both Ethan and Emily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made it to age 25,\" Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan almost choked on his cereal. \"Y-you, Mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"You've always known that your birthday is just seven months after our anniversary. Now, I can tell you that it was no accident. I really wanted a daytime wedding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan pondered the choice that lay before him. On the one hand, he could never do anything with his guy friends at night, since he wouldn't be a guy then. On the other hand, the only way to break the cycle of transformation was to give up manhood forever.</span></div></div>",

He needed to be one for now and gain some understanding and perspective about this new situation. He needed to understand more about his changes. When they would happen, how quickly they would happen, and how much control he had during them. He knew he wouldn't be able to stay inside at night forever, but he also refused to be a shut in. He wouldn't just succumb to these changes and hide away, he would find a way to live his life the best he could! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sun started going down Ethan stripped down naked and went into the bathroom locking himself in. His hands were tingling and almost shaking from the nervousness. He half hoped this was all a dream still as he looked at himself in the mirror. He took in a deep breath looking at the clock. It almost 6pm as the sun was setting in a nice shade of orange. Getting a little bored Ethan examining himself wondering just how sexy he would become? Would he start thinking more like a girl? Would he start finding men attractive? The revelation about his mom shocked him as he would have never guessed she used to be a guy. Ethan looked outside as the last bits of sunlight finally crept away a little after 6pm when a suddenly a massive tight feeling hit his stomach...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh....oh god here it comes...\" He said in discomfort as the changes started. Ethan looked at himself in the mirror trying his best to ignore the sensations and focus on where and how long the changes took to complete. The sensations started in his stomach as his gut sucked itself in leaving behind a flat and toned mid drift. Next his hands and arms thinned out and all his body hair withdrew back into his body leaving his skin smooth and soft. His nails grew longer and well Manicured as the sensations traveled south: his feet soon shrunk as his toenails changed. His legs thinned out and become lean and toned. Next episode felt the pressure building in his hips as he grunted a bit in pain as they popped out widening nicely. Next his but began filling out and swelling  larger into a sexy tear drop shape. Next Ethan felt the pressure build in his chest as he new what was next. To him it looked like all the excess fat stored in his body was traveling north building underneath his pecs as they began swelling to form his new breasts. They pushed out slowly until they reached their nice large D-Cup destination. Their added weight became quickly apparent to him as he felt the soft mounds hanging from his chest. Next his hair began to lighten turning a nice blonde color as it grew longer and cascaded down his shoulders. His face soon reformed into a soft feminine form as his voice soon changed. Lastly his once proud member began to shrink and withdraw up inside him as a nice new warm sit was left behind. His body finally finished as Emily stood where he was once standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting Emily looked at the clock seeing it had taken just under 10 minutes to fully change. Not much time at all but enough to run and hide somewhere. Looking at her new body  Emily realized something...She was HOT! Easily cheerleader or model material. She decided to strike a few poses in the mirror when a sudden knock came in the bathroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily honey I know you just changed I laid some clothes here for you!\" Mom said as Emily piked her head out the door. She looked down and saw a black t shirt and some short Jean shorts, along with a matching set of orange bra and panties. After a few minutes of fumbling with the bra Emily  slid up the shorts and looked over to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.rmbl.ws/z3/a/f/W/e/a.daa.1-hjgj-tyutu.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.rmbl.ws/z3/a/f/W/e/a.daa.1-hjg...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn I do look good...maybe this doesn't have to be so bad....but what I am I going to tell my friends?\" She thought to herself while deciding if she should go out or stay inside tonight.</span></div></div>",

The revelations and advice from mom about her new condition kept surprising Emily. She had no idea her own mother had all these secrets. She wondered how well she would be able to keep her own condition a secret. She thought about her, or well Ethan's two best friends, Eddie and Jessica. If either one of them discovered his condition they would think of him as a freak...Shaking those thoughts out of her head Emily and her mother drove down to the local Macy's to pick up a few things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the car ride Emily did her best to try and ignore the strange new sensations on her chest. Her new large breasts had a bad habit of bouncing around making their new added weight seem both uncomfortable and yet oddly familiar. She couldn't explain it, but it was like something in her mind while in this new body was telling her it was okay and to just embrace her new femininity. Reaching down she adjusted her boobs in her new top a bit, not even realizing it until her mom looked over and chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having fun sweetie?\" She said laughing a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily grew bright red for a second tucking her hands away. \"I'm sorry mom, it's  just they are so big and distracting, how am I supposed to manage with these from now on?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching over mom patted Emily's head slightly. \"I'm sorry honey, you did inherit your busty side from me.Trust me you will get used to them in time. Its all about finding the right bra and right top to accent them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily sighed trying to change the subject from this uncomfortable topic. However luckily the store was near as they pulled in and began their shopping trip. Once they were inside mom was looking around at all the different sections wondering where they should start first. That's when they heard a familiar voice calling out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jane, Jane, is that you?\" The voice said as Emily realized they were calling for his mother who's real name was Jane. Trying to figure out who it was though as Emily turned around only to pause in fear and shock as she realized who it was.....Ethan's friend Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jane how's it going?\" Jessica said walking over with her usual smile as Emily knew how comfortable those two were with each other. She tried to avoid eye contact for as long as she could until Jessica forced the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So....who's this? Friend of Ethan's...?\"Jessica prodded with her usual curiosity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane was obviously looking for a good answer quickly as her eyes seemed to light up quick. \"This is Emily, she is my niece, just moved here from California. She is staying with us for awhile.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that was her cue Emily held her hand shaking it with Jessica. \"Uh...umm, hi there. How's it going?\" she asked trying not to seem awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica smiled back looking her over for a second. \"Wow Ethan never mentioned his cousin was in town. You are super Petty too! We should hang out sometime!\" She said with an excited tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well actually maybe you can help Jessica. We are looking for some new outfits and I don't really know teen styles that well maybe you could help her?\" Jane said as Emily's eyes darted over to her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I'd love to what do you say?\" Jessica asked looking over to Emily</span></div></div>",

All the things your cousin didn't tell me.\" Emily was beginning to dread this shopping trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first place Jessica took Emily was to the undergarments section. Emily was professionally fitted for a bra, and her estimate that she was a D-cup proved to be right on the money. She picked up several bras, white and black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, they got some tops: T-shirts, polo tops, whatever caught their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Jessica helped Emily pick out some jeans, and picked out some for herself, and they went to the dressing rooms to try them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Emily slipped off the shorts she was wearing, Jessica called over the divider, \"I am so jealous of you, Emily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I wouldn't give to have tits like yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily was glad Jessica couldn't see her blush at this. \"If anything, I envy you, Jess. They don't make pretty bras in my size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, satisfied with their selections, Jessica brought Emily back to her mother. \"This has been fun, Em. Maybe tomorrow we can have lunch together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily gulped. She'd be Ethan during the day, but she couldn't tell Jessica that. \"We'll see.\"</span></div></div>",

We can get you a new phone and make a new profile for you!\" Jessica said as she finally took off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily wanted to collapse as she sighed heavily once she was alone.

Luckily their guest bedroom was empty so Ethan went and took all of Emily's clothes and tossed them in there. While there were no decorations or anything to show the room was lived in, Ethan was confident he could at least use the \"just moved\" to pass that off,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe remembered telling Jessica to come over around 8pm since his changes usually started around 7pm. He was playing this a little loose, but he figures this would at least give him time to change and make up a story to where Ethan had gone for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the new clothes Emily had bought last night Ethan was deciding what kind of outfit Emily should wear tonight. He could be conservative and just go for jeans and a t shirt. Or maybe a little<br>\r\nFlirty and try out one of the mini skirts Jessica insisted he buy. He figures Emily shouldn't be shy about her appearance, after all she was a beautiful girl. He picked out a tight jean mini skirt and black blouse with a white tank top. He also picked out the lady push up bra which Jessica showed up that he remembers made Emily's boobs look even bigger! He also decided to try out a lacy thong tonight as well. Satisfied with his outfit choice Ethan didn't even realize how girly he was thinking while choosing his clothes when he suddenly heard the door bell ring....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh....wonder who that is?\" He thought looking up to the clock seeing it was only about 6:30. He still had time as Ethan made his way to the front door and answered it as he saw Jessica standing there....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh....uh....hi....Jess....what's up?\" Ethan said stumbling at how early she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh....hi...Ethan....I'm....here...to hang out with your cousin.\" Jessica said in a super sarcastic tone making fun of him. \"Seriously you didn't know I was coming?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess Emily didn't say anything.\" Ethan said starting to sweat and tried to figure out what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we are gonna get her all re-Americanized today! Get her a new Facebook page and hopefully a new cellphone too!\" She said trying to sound southern and laughing as Ethan rolled his eyes at her horrible fake southern accent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she isn't home yet, do you just wanna come back in like an hour or so?\" Ethan asked as Jessica looked over at him with suspicious eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trying to get rid of me huh? I thought we could all hang out a bit...unless you have a girl coming over or something?\" She told him as Ethan struggled to find an excuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...no...it's just I have to study a bit tonight and.......UGH!\" Ethan suddenly felt his cramp up as he fell down grabbing his sides as he looked outside. It still wasn't quite 7pm yet and there was still a bit of sunset left over.....how could he be changing now? He thought as the family pain returned as he tried to fight it which only made the pain worse...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! Ethan are you okay?!\" Jessica ran over and grabbed him trying to hold him up as Ethan doubled over in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...please...I'm fine I just need...the restroom.\" He tried to say as there was a sudden loud Ripping noise coming from his behind....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" Jessica said looking at Ethan's pants seeing they had split down the middle as his behind was swelling and taking on a rounder more feminine shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on with you Ethan?!\" She said behind terrified and confused and Ethan tried to stand but couldn't. He wasn't listening to his Kim's advice and his resistance was making the changes more painful and intense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm.....just...sick...I need......I...need...oh god! No not yet!\" He call out as his pecs started swelling. He said grabbing them trying to push back his swelling mounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...my....God....\"Jessica said as she watched as two large breasts pushed their way out of her friends chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan knew he couldn't fight it anymore....his bountiful rack had given it away. Falling down he let go gulley as the changes accelerated. His hair grew longer turning blonde. His skin smoothed out and his features feminized themselves as his manhood slid up inside him. Soon Emily was laying in the ground looking up to Jessica with fear in her eyes.</span></div></div>",

Ethan wanted to tell you, in his own time, after you'd gotten used to Emily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He... he seemed surprised that he was changing tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that he was changing, but that it happened so early. The sun hasn't gone down yet, and that's when it's happened before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Edwards helped Jessica to her feet, and brought her to what was unofficially Emily's room. She knocked on the door. \"Emily? May we come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily opened the door for them, having changed into the outfit she'd picked out as Ethan. \"Are you okay, Jess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling a little better. Do... do I call you Emily or Ethan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me Ethan when I'm a boy, and Emily when I'm a girl. That's what I do.\"</span></div></div>",

Her lacy lingerie and tight Jean miniskirt, along with her tight black tank top which helped show off her impressive cleavage made her feel rather....sexy. She had to admit it even though things were off to a rocky start at least Emily could take comforting knowing she did make a damn fine looking woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping outside Jessicaooked over to Emily with a bit of surprise. Just a few minutes ago she had seen her long time friend Ethan and now he was standing in front of her as the beautiful girl Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn girl...I do have to admit you clean up well.\" Jessica said smiling as Emily blushed a bit still not feeling totally confident yet in these clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how long do you have to deal with this?\" Jessica asked as they moved towards the den to sit down and chat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom says it is permanent. Unless.....\" Emily paused for a second. \"Unless I chose to get pregnant then I will remain female forever. Mom used to be like me....I had no idea until I changed for the first time.\" She said <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica looked both stunned and shocked, but also intrigued. She had always enjoyed weird stories and in a way this was like one of her stories come to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater Emily's mom came back to join them. She handed them each a cup of tea as she sat down with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry honey I should have warned you about tonight. I know you had your plan all worked out for your transformation but it isn't a good idea to do stuff like that. The reason is because the change isn't an exact science. There will be days where it triggers early and some days when it triggers late. A lot of it has to do with you and your mood. If your feeling anxious and excited then you're more likely to change early. If your feeling angry or sad you are more likely to change late.\" Her mom explained as Jessica could still barely comprehend all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're saying cause k was feeling nervous and anxious about Jessica coming over I accidently triggered an early change?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it isn't 100% always going to happen but in this instance I would agree with that.\" Mom answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I will leave you girls to it. If you have any questions just ask.\" She said leaving the two alone for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a bit of an awkward pause before Jessica finally stood up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....we still need to get Emily a Facebook and new phone right?\" She said holding out her hands to Emily before giving her a small wink.</span></div></div>",

This made her uncomfortable, especially since the salesman was way older than she was. <i>I don't know yet what my type is,</i> she thought, <i>but I'm pretty sure this creepy guy isn't it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, they looked at shells for the phone. Emily reached for the black shell out of habit, as it was Ethan's preference as well, but Jessica said, \"Grab the powder blue one, Em. It matches your eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily had never considered this as a reason to choose something before, but Jessica sounded sure that this was right. If nothing else, it would make sure that Ethan would never grab Emily's phone by mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Jessica had bought Emily's new phone, she took her shopping for makeup, then perfume. Finally, they returned to Emily's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing Emily did was take a selfie with Jessica. Once Jessica helped Emily start a Facebook page, she talked Emily through the process of uploading her selfie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Emily was on social media, they sat together on the bed in Ethan's room. \"Em, can I ask a personal question?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" After all, Jessica was privy to Emily's biggest secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you go to bed, it's as Emily, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do you fantasize more about guys or girls when you masturbate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever question Emily thought Jess might ask her, this wasn't it. \"Huh? I don't... I mean, I haven't... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't masturbated as Emily?\" It sounded like Jessica found this harder to believe than Ethan turning into Emily in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Em, the clitoris is the only organ in the human body whose sole function is sexual pleasure. You have one, and Ethan doesn't.\" She gave Em a hug. \"C'mon, girlfriend, if you want a guy to do what you like in bed, you've got to figure out what it is first.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After setting up her new online profile and shopping together Emily had to admit she was starting to have fun as a girl. Jessica made this transistion easier for her and in a way she felt closer now to Jessica then she ever did as Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it grew late Jessica finally decided to take off as she gave Enily a huge hug before heading out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So let's keep this up okay Em?\" She asked smiling at her. \"I know we may only be able to see eachother as girls at night so next time we see eachother I'm taking you somewhere fun!\" Jessica said before she got in her car and drove off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily wasn't see what what kind of place she was talking about yet but she nodded and agreed before heading off to bed. Shutting everyone off and going into her room she slipped out of her clothes before pausing for a second. She looked at herself in the mirror as the discussion she had earlier crept back into her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Ethan was no stranger to masturbation as Emily he had been to scared to even try anything yet. In the back of her head Emily was still rejecting the idea she might one day love a man and have a child so the thought of any kind of sexual arousal as Emily  scared her cause it might start changing how she thinks and acts as Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever her curiosity and Jessica's advice earlier was proving too tenpting to resist. Standing in front of the body mirror Emily stood there in just her bra and panties. Closing her eyes for a second she was trying her hardest to remember she was actually Ethan and what aroused him. Opening her eyes Enily imagined she was looking at a stranger. Some sexy girl he had never seen before standing there in a lacy set of lingerie that accenting her large perky breasts and cute bubble butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding down her panties and unhooking her bra slowly Enily began to give herself her own little strip tease. She covered her breasts with one arm as she dangled the bra in the other hand. Dropping it slowly she backed up before letting her arm down and gazed in her large soft breasts as if for the first time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Ethan had barely any experience with women on his own he had to do what thought looked good for the woman in all the porn Internet videos and magazines he used to have. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily stared with cupping her breasts and squeezing them gently as she felt a sudden jolt run through her body. It felt good but different from anything she had felt as a man. She then teased her large nipples lightly running her fingers around them as she suddenly but her lip lightly at the tingling sensation as she noticed how hard they suddenly got. After several minutes of playing with her heavy but soft breasts Emily decides to move to the thing that truly defined her as a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit nervous laid down on her back and slowly spread her legs in front of the mirror slowly revealing the warm and wet slit that defined her new womanhood. As Ethan he had touched one before but only at a house party a couple Months ago with this girl who was clearly drunk from another school. He was still a virgin technically even though he told all he friends he hooked up with that girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath Enily ran her finger  along her slit surprised at how moist it was. Almost immediately she was hit with a quick feeling of pleasure she couldn't describe. It wasn't anything like she knew as a guy. This was far more intense, so much so it made her toes tingle. Prodding forth more Emily ran her fingers up and down her slit before finally finding the magic button at the top of her slit. Touching her clit for the first time made her almost cry out as the pleasure hit her body as she grabbed a pillow quickly to mask her moan. She couldn't believe how good that felt! Touching it more and more Emily writhed on her bed moaning in ecstasy before a sudden pressure starting building inside her....she continued as the pressure and heat built until.....\"OOOHH.....MY.......GOD!\" She suddenly cried out as she felt an intense wave of pleasure hit her body as she experienced her first female orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollapsing from the pleasure Emily felt both embarrassed at what she had done but also a bit....sexy....Jessica wasn't kidding as she closed her eyes wondering the future held for her as she fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

Then, he remembered that Emily had gone to bed in what was now her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis brought back memories of what had happened before she'd fallen asleep. The intensity of arousal and orgasm experienced as Emily was still amazing. He tried rubbing his chest as Emily had done, but it produced none of the reaction it had the night before. He picked up his clothes from yesterday, which had been ruined by his early transformation, and threw them away in the wastebasket in his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownstairs, things were awkward at the breakfast table. Ethan realized that Emily had been a bit too loud, even holding a pillow over her mouth. Apologizing, he left, heading for the bus stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got to the bus stop, Jessica was there, but Eddie and the other guys weren't there yet. \"Good morning, Ethan,\" she said. \"How was last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was intense,\" he replied. \"I think I disturbed my folks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than you're used to, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lot more. So, what have you got planned for tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-uh. It's a surprise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's a surprise?\" Eddie asked, as he and the rest of the guys came into earshot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a cousin named Emily,\" Ethan explained, \"and Jessica's been helping her. She helped her start a Facebook account, and tonight she's taking her out for something fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlton used his phone to look up Emily's page. \"Holy cow. I could help her have some fun. Just let me get my hands on those tits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan felt uncomfortable listening to Alton talk about the breasts he grew every night. Fortunately, Jessica stepped in. \"Watch how you talk, Alton. Emily's asked Ethan and me to tell her about the guys we know, so, if you act like a jerk, she's gonna find out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that, Jess,\" Eddie said. Eddie, Ethan remembered, had always been a good guy when it came to women. He hadn't been afraid to call Ethan out on groping that drunk girl, saying that she needed to give consent before Ethan even thought about doing something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought struck Ethan: He was evaluating his friends as possible dates for Emily. The first two nights of changing, he hadn't been able to imagine her sex life. After last night, however, he realized that she would want to start dating. And soon.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That night Ethan couldn't help but get excited at what plans Jessica had for them tonight. It was Friday night and all manner of things could happen. Ethan felt himself trembling at the idea of going out as Emily. While they had done some mild shopping so far, he hadn't really put Emily in any real social situations yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt about 6pm Ethan heard his door knock as he went and answers it seeing Jessica there holding a shopping back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're a bit early, what's in the bag?\" Ethan asked as Jessica grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry it's just a little gift for Emily. Something I know she will look sexy in.\" She said winking at him as she came inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan looked back at her a little confused. \"Umm...okay, well you know it's still a bit early Enily won't you know...\"be here\" for a little while.\" Ethan said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that and actually...well...I kind of had a request.....\" Jessica said looking to Ethan as she started to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan's Brow raised as he looked back to her curiously. \"Umm....what kind of request?\" He replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was obviously embarrassed as she bit her lip trying for figure out how to ask this. \"Can....can I watch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan was surprised at her question. \"You mean watch...me change?\" He said feeling a little awkward at the request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica nodded back to him. \"Yeah....I mean I only caught bits of it last time. It's so strange and different and well...cool. I want to see it fully in action.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Jess...I mean that means I would have to get naked in front of you...I just don't know if I'm comfortable with that.\" Ethan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on please! I already know your secret what else about you is private I don't already know?\" She said giving him a serious stare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine....but only because I trust you.\" Ethan replied as Jessica got excited as she grabbed his hand as they hurried up the spare bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was kind of funny Ethan thought to himself. A week ago being alone in a room with Jessica watching him strip would have been his fantasy. Now it was almost the opposite. In the bedroom Ethan slowly got out of clothes doing his best to cover himself with Jessica watching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is there like a pattern to it? Can you know what parts change first?\" Jessica asked anxiously waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm...not really. It's pretty random I just start feeling heat and pressure in the parts right before they shift.\" Ethan replied as he looked out the widow seeing the sun go down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of deep breaths Ethan suddenly felt a familiar crap in his stomach as he leaned over on the bed. \"Here is comes....\" He called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica watched excitedly as her friend started to change. It started in his hair this time as all his body hair started to suck itself back into his body. Next his normal hair started growing longer and changing color turning blonde as it grew past his shoulders and cascaded down his back. Next his fingernails grew longer and became well manicured nails. Next his body began to shrink and thin out as he lost several inches of height and began fat began sucking in and disappearing. His muscles thinned out as he took on more petite and feminine frame. Next his hips began popping and widening out as his but began to swell taking on a sexy tear drop shape. His stomach sucked in next showing off his new sexy toned and as the body fat began traveling north underneath his pecs. His chest soon began to swell next as his pecs began to soften and swell out into his new full breasts. They grew steadily pushing past cup sizes until hey rested at their comfortable 34-D Cup size. Next came the worst part as his manhood began to shrink and shrivel as it began pulling itself up inside his body reforming into the wet slit he was getting all to familiar with. Lastly his face shifted and reformed into his soft and feminine shape as Emily stood there were Ethan once was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica stood there amazed as Emily looked embarrassed and a bit awkward. \"Happy now?\" Emily asked trying to cover her large breasts and slit with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was so intense! It's like something out of a sci if movie!\" Jessica said excitedly as she reached into her bag and pulled out some clothes. \"Here these are for you I've got my out outfit as well we are going out tonight!\" She said grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going out where?\" Emily asked as she looked to the clothes. There was a lady black push up bra with a matching thong, and a sexy little black mini dress that barely went to mid thigh, and lastly a pair of 3 inch black high heeled sandals which were basically just a sole with two straps to hold her feet in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any Wu's house...\" Jessica said as Emily looked back stunned. Amy Wu was the rich half Asain girl from their school. Her dad was a doctor or something. She was known to have huge house parties when her parents were out of town. It was also the same place Ethan had messed around with one of friends one drunken night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be serious and you want me to wear this! I'll look like....\" She started as Jessica interrupted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will be the sexiest girl there! Imagine how jealous that will make Amy the guys will be there too and they will drool over you!!\" Jessica said as Emily rememberd she had always had a jealous rivalry with Amy since she stole her boyfriend last year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea did excite her a it as Emily agreed. After putting on the outfit Jessica helped Emily with her makeup as they also painted her nails a sexy shade of red. Standing up a bit wobbly on the heels Emily looked at herself in the mirror as she felt a sudden shock. She was DAMN HOT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh damn girl! You better be ready to get some stares tonight!\" Jessica said as she finished getting ready as they went off to the party.</span></div></div>",

I forgot you're still a virgin. Dental dams are for oral sex. Sounds like your mom doesn't want any guys to beg out of protection by claiming an allergy. Wouldn't want you to wake up tomorrow with an STI. Or a baby on the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to know. What's the plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The plan is simple: You walk around and introduce yourself to people. Just stay away from alcohol.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I wouldn't want to blab my secret because I got drunk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not just that, Em. If your first time isn't special, it should at least be memorable, as in able to remember in the morning. To that end, all drinks you order should go from the bartender's hand right to your own, and don't let your drink out of your sight for an instant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think that many guys will try to take advantage of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It only takes one. If Ethan passed out at a party, he'd wake up the next morning with a dick drawn on his face with a Sharpie. If you pass out tonight, even if you don't get sick or pregnant, any number of guys could have their way with you, and post it on YouTube for the world to see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point. I had an experience like that once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So don't let it happen to you. Now, time for them to meet the new girl in town.\"</span></div></div>",

She had never felt something so awkward and uncomfortable in her life as it felt like everyone was ether gazing at her with envious stares or lustful gazes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath she did the best she could to not think about it as Jessica grabbed her hand and let her through the crowd until they found their host, Amy in the kitchen talking with her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Amy! I want you to meet my friend Emily! She just moved here from Canada.\" Jessica said introducing her as Emily nervously shook her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily felt Amy's eyes scanning her body almost like a machine looking for any imperfections or things to tease her about behind her back. It was no secret that Amy was very sexually competitive with the girls. She liked to be the hottest girl, date the hottest guys, and have the most friends. As she looked over the new blonde girl she had never seen before Any almost looked stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow....you're so pretty! Welcome to the U.S. are things here like super weird for you?\" Amy asked Emily a small hint of snarkiness in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm from Vancouver, so aside from the different colored money, no everything is about the same.\" Emily fired back as Jessica looked proud for a second holding her own against the queen bee like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nodded and smiled as if giving her approval. \"Well excellent have a drink with us! I know it sucks cause here you have to be 21 but I won't tell if you won't.\" Amy said with a sarcastic wink as she held out a couple Jell-O shots for them to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily grew a bit nervous. She liked this feeling of being accepted but she remembered Jessica's advice. She figured these were fine since the girls were all taking them as she  nodded. All the girls in the group took a shot together as Emily winced a bit noticing it tasted way stronger then normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well get out there and have some fun girl, just stay away from Chase Morrison. He's the D-Bag in the Jordan jersey and backwards ball cap creeping on the girls in the dance floor. I would toss him out but he would totally rat us out if I did....\" Amy said as Jessica took Emily to the dance floor to have some fun.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Emily had never twerked before, but she knew how to do it. So, when Jessica started twerking, Emily decided that, if there were a booty made for shaking, it was the one that split a pair of jeans the night before, so she jumped right in. Judging by the response of the crowd, she was doing it right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily kept taking cues from Jessica. When Jessica grabbed the hem of Emily's top, Emily raised her arms so that Jessica could pull it off. Her bra left enough skin exposed that everybody could see it wasn't padded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily was really getting into the dancing, and spun several times, until she tripped over her own feet and fell backwards, into someone's arms. Emily briefly worried that it was Chase Morrison who caught her, until she spotted him in the crowd, looking like every one of his lottery numbers was one off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up, to see a familiar face. \"You okay?\" he asked, as he helped her to her feet again. \"Eddie McIntyre.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily Edwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Emily. Let's get a seat at the bar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat at the bar and ordered sodas. \"So,\" Eddie asked, \"what's Vancouver like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've seen it,\" she replied. \"It's a popular location with American movie and TV producers. They use it to stand in for New York or Chicago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout noticing it, Emily started going to town on the peanuts. \"You probably should have eaten before you got here. Amy Wu's Jell-O shots are made with strong booze. They really hit you on an empty stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's why I tripped,\" she said, though she had eaten dinner. Or, rather, Ethan had. Did changing burn through the meal so much faster? \"I was worried the wrong guy caught me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Chase Morrison,\" Eddie snorted. \"If you were to say no to him, he's got a pocketful of pills to take the argument out of you. Why does Amy invite him, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he isn't here, he rats on her, and no more booze.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" he snorted again, \"like that's the important thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it you don't like her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just that 'good enough' isn't good enough for her. She can't have just a few people at her parties, she's got to have everyone. She can't just date a guy, it has to be the best-looking guy around. And if he's already dating someone else, well, she just takes him away. One girl hating her is worth all the others being jealous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir sodas empty, Eddie brought Emily back onto the dance floor. It was a slow song, so he slow danced with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they danced, Emily took a good look at Eddie. As Ethan, she'd known that Eddie was good-looking. As Emily, though, she was struck by how handsome he was. She checked out his body. He worked out enough that he was obviously in good shape, but he wasn't musclebound, so he wouldn't blow off a date because he was busy lifting. She remembered the glimpses Ethan had caught of Eddie's dick... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily was startled by the realization. It was probably too soon for it to be love, but she was definitely in lust with Eddie.</span></div></div>",

She was lost in the  sensations and motions just letting her body move freely on her own. She didn't even seem to realize how sexy she looked as her large breasts pressed tightly against small dress, bouncing seductively with each move. Her round bubble butt grinding against Eddie's crotch as he held her hips was causing him to start sporting a massive tent already which Eddie was embarrassed and unable to hide. Almost everyone was looking over to them with envious and jealous eyes as Emily unwittingly stole the show for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the song Emily was panting and sweating as she needed a break. Grabbing Eddie they walked off together to a secluded part of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was so much fun! I've never danced like that before!\" Emily said smiling as she threw her hair back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I can see how much you enjoyed it. You should have seen Amy's face, I've never seen a jaw drop so fast in my life.\" Eddie replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily chuckled feeling a strange feeling of satisfaction at the prospect of making another girl jealous. It wasn't something she was used to but it felt nice.  Her head was feeling fuzzy from he drink earlier not knowing just how low her tolerance was in this body. She was starting to feel herself slip as her emotions and desires were getting the better of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know...I've never noticed before but you're really cute you know that?\" Emily said smiling up at Eddie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before...we just met tonight?\" Eddie said correcting her as he began to suspect that she was a bit more tipsy then she was letting on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh....yeah that's right I'm sorry.\" Emily said smiling it off as she suddenly leaned in without warning and kissed Eddie. It wasn't just a normal kiss, Emily felt herself wanting more as their tongues met quickly as Emily pushed him against the wall. Her large and soft breasts pushed against Eddie's chest as she lifted a leg letting him run a ran along her smooth thigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie was a bit taken back. This beautiful girl he had just met was talking with him and now making out with him as his initial instincts were to give in. However after just a minute or so of passionate kissing his conscious returned telling him that she he as drunk and that this was wrong.  Pulling away quickly he looked back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you know I think your beautiful and really cool but maybe we should get to know each other a little more first?\" Eddie said as Emily just realized what she had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god I'm so sorry this is so embarrassing!\" Emily said trying to salvage the situation. Her first night out as a girl and she was already throwing herself at a guy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen I like you too, but I need to go, I'll catch up with again!\" Emily said as she suddenly took off needing to get out of there. Her female hormones and emotions were too strong she was barely able to remember who she really was. Finding Jessica at the party she grabbed her hand and pulled her to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to leave now please!\" She whispered as Jessica nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping out of the party together Jessica drove Emily home who shared with her the story and how she let herself slip for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey at least it was just a kiss, you caught yourself before doing anything rash. Just go home and sleep this off and tomorrow Ethan will return and you will re adjust\" Jessica replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way home Emily was almost trembling as all she could think about was taking Eddie to a bedroom and stripping down his clothes and mounting him. Even as a guy his sexual drive never seemed this high before....perhaps the alcohol affected him differently as a girl? This was something Ethan should look into before his change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay over there?\" Jessica asked as Emily shook her head for a moment before nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they returned to the house Emily snuck back inside quietly as went to her room quickly stripping out of her tight and now sweaty clothes. She couldn't stop thinking about Eddie however. Every time she did her body felt like it was going to erupt. Laying down she imagined him crawling on top of her and.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh....uhh....ohhh!\" Emily called out from her room pleasuring herself until she finally was able to relax and fall asleep.</span></div></div>",

He remembered dancing with Jessica, then with Eddie, then masturbating at home. It struck him that, in 24 hours, Emily's sexual fantasies had gone from Ethan touching a strange girl to Eddie touching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis head didn't hurt as much as he would have thought. In fact, it barely hurt at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he went downstairs for breakfast, he said, \"Mom, I've got some more questions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd be surprised if you didn't, dear,\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seemed like I was really hungry last night, even though I'd eaten a full meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"The transformation burns calories quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that Amy Wu makes her drinks strong, but I only had one, and it did a number to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Women have a lower tolerance for alcohol, due to their lower body mass. As I'm sure you've noticed, Emily is shorter and weighs less than Ethan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Part of me really wanted to... go all the way last night. It scared me. Eddie stopped himself, but I was afraid I might not be able to stop me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always liked Eddie,\" Dad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not too far off base,\" Mom replied. \"Your body naturally seeks stability, and changing sex twice a day is hardly stable. I'm not saying you'll be a slave to your biological urges; but, now that you know what your body can do, you will want to try it out with someone else. Especially if you're intoxicated, ovulating, or both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm ovulating?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not right now, of course,\" Mom said with a chuckle. \"But Emily might be. And that brings me to something you really should know: If Emily is ovulating, she'll get her period in two more weeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We learned that in school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before that happens, you may experience premenstrual symptoms. Some women have mild symptoms, such as a craving for certain foods. Some have stronger symptoms: cramps, bloating, fatigue. And some women have no symptoms at all. If you fit into that last group, try not to brag about it to other girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's more, Ethan. If Emily has premenstrual symptoms, even though she's the one who will have periods, you will feel those symptoms, too.\"</span></div></div>",

That the girl he liked was also himself....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew just telling him wouldn't be enough. It would make him sound crazy. He thought maybe he could change then tell him as Emily, however that suddenly makes her look crazy too. He could just go all out and change right in front of him, however that risks shocking Eddie and freaking him out. Whichever way he chose he knew there wasn't a perfect way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the day wore on they wasted hours playing video games, watching internet videos, and eating food. As the sun started to set Ethan knew he was running out of time as Eddie looked a little impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So any word on Emily? It's getting dark soon.\" Eddie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh she will be along shortly....\" Ethan replied. He could feel his body tingling warning him that a change was near.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So uh....listen....Eddie. You trust me right?\" He asked Eddie who suddenly looked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm yeah...I mean I really hope so....what are you talking about?\" Eddie replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there is something I need to show you. It's about Emily but it's a really big secret. Whether or not you like what you see I can't help but I need to make sure you won't tell anybody.\" He said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie looked confused but intrigued. \"Sure....your not gonna tell me she is really a guy or a lesbian are you?\" He said trying to figure out what he meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's just....well let's just Emily and I are closer than cousins....more like twins....that share the same body....we just switch at night....\"  Ethan said as Eddie gave him a blank stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh....I'm not sure I get you dude....\" He said confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan soon felt his stomach tightening up as he knew as change was coming. Taking a step back he closed the door and took off his shirt and jeans standing there in just his boxers and tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just watch....and please don't freak out....\" Ethan said as he suddenly felt his body beginning to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a groan Ethan fell to all fours as his hair began to change first. It lightened turning bright blonde as it grew longer cascading down his shoulders touching his mid back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie jumped backwards as he first thought something was wrong with Ethan but he felt himself mesmerized by what he was watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan panted trying to get past the pain of the changes. His body mass was beginning to shrink as he grew shorter and thinner. His body hair was retreating into his skin which was becoming softer and smoother. His finger nails grew out into nice tips as his hands became smaller and dainty. His feet shrunk too as his body became a soft feminine frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie just stood there his mouth open and eyes wide thinking he was in some kind of dream....it was like watching a science fiction transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan grunted again as he felt his hips popping out as his butt swelled out filling outwards into a nice tear drop shape. Falling over and rolling to his back Ethan tried to quickly finish his change as the biggest parts were coming. His pecs began to soften up as his nipples grew and expanded. Soon his soft cones of flesh began to expand pushing out against the fabric of his shirt until they reached their late D-Cup size. He felt his manhood shrinking next, sliding away up into his body as a wet and warm skit took over its place. Last but not least his face softened and reformed into the familar face if Emily as his voice lightened and became feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole change room just under 10 minutes as Emily slowly stood up wiping off the sweat from her body as she stood there at what seemed like a paralyzed Eddie as she awaited his reaction.</span></div></div>",

Even small touches as she cupped her breasts and lightly touched her slit seemed to send shivers down her spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the shower Emily straightened her hair and did her makeup as she looked for a decent outfit. She finally found a sexy red mini dress and matching heels. She liked it because it was sexy and showed off enough cleavage of her perky D-cups but not too much to be considered slutty. She also decided to forgo a bra as it clung tightly to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she came downstairs after doing her hair and markup Eddie could only state with awe at how beautiful Emily looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You uhh....you look really nice....\" He said stammering <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you...\" Emily replied blushing a bit happy he liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the slight awkward exchange they headed out to a small but fancy Italian restaurant. They soon shared a lovely dinner together talking for hours. Not just about Ethan and Enily and their situation, but about life, their shared interests, and funny stories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring their date Emily noticed Eddies eyes constantly glancing down to her chest and trying not to make it obvious. She blushes slightly secretly liking it as she felt a warmth and slight dampness growing between her legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an amazing dinner Emily left the restaurant with Eddie as he gave her his coat for warmth. The smell of the coat seemed to turn her on even more as she hugged it close before getting in his car and heading back towards home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew she wanted Eddie more than anything at this point but her conscious was still strong telling her to wait for the real thing. However she grinned for a moment knowing there were other ways of them pleasuring eachother...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they drove back to her home Emilu slowly took Eddie's hand and placed it on her thigh. Looking over to her Eddie gave an approving look as he slid his hand along her skin slowly moving up her thigh. Glancing down at his jeans Emily spotted Eddie's huge throbbing erection against his jeans. She took his hand and guided it slowly up her thighs until it was touching her soaking wet mound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie was trying his bed to control himself. He wanted nothing more to pull over and mount Emily right now....however he knew the conciquinces could be severe if they didn't use proper protection. However he couldn't ignore her advances as he soon felt himself touching her panties and feeling her wet slit in his hand. Moving his hand up he slid it down into her panties as ur soon found her warm and wet slit as he slid a finger up inside her and began running and probing her insides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily responded in kind as she grasped onto the edges of his car moaning as she moved her hips with his hand motions. This continued for awhile until they finally pulled back to her house as Eddie parked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took about a second before Emily was out of her seat and straddling Eddie as they began making out furiously as Eddie's hand reached inside her dress to massage her large and lovely breasts. Emily's hand moved down and began rubbing and strucking Eddie's erection through his jeans as they both groaned in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter quite awhile of teasing and foreplay the two love birds finally decided to call it a night. They had successfully resisted the urge to have sex but also succeeded in pleasuring themselves quite well. Taking her shoes off Emily tip toes back into her room after kissing Eddie goodbye. Once in her room she grabbed the vibrator from nightstand and proceeded to finish herself off until she finally came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollapsing in a heap of pleasure Enily fell asleep in blissful ecstasy.... The next morning when light shined through the window Ethan awoke like normal as he yawned and looked around seeing his male reflection staring back at him as he noticed.....</span></div></div>",

During the day, they would be best friends, but the night would turn them into lovers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick shower and a return to his old room for clothes, and he went downstairs. \"Good morning,\" he said to his parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, dear,\" his mother replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad asked, \"How was last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.

Both were decent enough guys and fun to hang with, even if Jeff and Andy bragged about their playboy lifestyles a little too much sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys ready for some two on two?\" Ethan said trying to act perfectly normal his eyes only somewhat darting over to Eddie who he could tell was doing the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an intense couple games the guys were resting and talking as Jeff and Andy kept talking about this party coming up next weekend and all the hottest girls were going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really hope that new busty blonde girl shows up, holy crap she is sexy.\" Jeff said as Andy gave him a fist bump<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan rolled his eyes as he glanced at Eddie who was smirking behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear she is seeing somebody.\" Ethan suddenly said as Jeff and Andy looked back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\" They both asked together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno maybe they will show up together.\" Ethan said as he tossed Eddie a small wink when the other two weren't looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they were done Jeff and Andy left as Eddie stayed behind with Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So uhh I was thinking maybe Emily might like to go out for some dessert later tonight?\" Eddie asked Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah she might like that, she usually shows up sundown.\" Ethan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was home Ethan felt pleased. Things weren't too awkward between them. It seemed like their relationship was going to be normal with Emily being in the third person until they could be together after sundown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter settling in his parents asked how things went and he told them pretty well. After settling into his room he began looking for an outfit for Emily tonight. There was a small knock on his door as he opened it seeing his mother there and she seemed to be holding something. He couldn't tell what it was at first. It looked like a small circular container designed to hold something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there honey I want to talk to you.\" His mom said letting herself in an sitting down on the bed with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to be forward with you son. I know you want to explore your body and new growing sexuality with Emily. However I don't want you accidentally find yourself in a position where you have no more options. I want you to have this.\" She said opening the container revealing it was filled with small pink pills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are vey special birth control pills. They work the same as normal ones for regular girls but they are specially designed to work on some one with your unique chromosome. I took them for awhile when I was first going through things. With these you don't have to worry about condoms or pregnancy. You will still have a normal ovulation cycle too. You take one each day right before sundown and your change. Wth these you can feel free to be the girl you want but also live your life right now as Ethan. Then one day when your ready to have a baby you can stop taking them. I just want you to have optIons.\" His mom said as she handed him the pills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you mom.\" Ethan said as he took his first pill in front of his mom to show he agreed with her as she smiled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However just so you know you may notice some side effects with those pills, nothing too serious but it will be noticeable.\" She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of side effects?\" Ethan asked both curious and a little worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Physically as Enily you may notice some more developed breast growth and hair growth. Emotionally as Emily you may notice a slightly higher libido especially during your ovulation cycle. As Ethan you shouldn't notice much however in some cases you mighty rarely notice some of Emily's thoughts and emotions carry over. Those are what I know of honey but there might be others if you notice anything else please let me know.\" His mom said giving him privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan felt a small rush now knowing Emily could have Eddie fully now but he knew they still needed to wait until the moment felt right. He didn't want to rush things too quick. Looking outside he saw the sun going down as he knew a change was near and Eddie would be over soon.</span></div></div>",

Then his ass became rounder. He breathed through clenched teeth as his body dwindled to more feminine dimensions. His hair grew out, D-cup breasts grew, his hips spread. Finally, his penis and testicles withered, and Emily opened her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up and looked at herself in the mirror. There were no side effects yet. She washed off the sweat and put on a little black dress as she heard Mom and Dad letting Eddie in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went downstairs and into the living room. \"Hi, Eddie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie looked at her and smiled. \"You look good, Emily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. All set to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so. We won't be too late, Mr. Edwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a good time, you two,\" Dad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie took her to the local ice cream parlor. As they ate their sundaes, Emily said, \"There's something you need to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah? What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm on the Pill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie blinked. \"H-how did you - ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a special version of the Pill, for people like me. I take it right before the change. I'm telling you because there may be side effects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My boobs might get bigger,\" she said with a smile. \"My hair might get longer. My libido might get stronger, especially when I'm ovulating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. Anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a chance you might catch Ethan acting like me. But that's not as likely as the others. Other than that, it will keep me from getting pregnant. And, when I'm ready to start a family, I just quit taking it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good. So, when the time is right, we can make love like any other couple. I don't think tonight can get any better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned and whispered in his ear, \"I'm going commando.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily and Eddie got back into his car. \"It's early yet,\" he said. \"Want to go for a drive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe drove her to a well-known make-out spot. \"We don't have to go all-out, if you don't want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's start with kissing,\" she replied, \"and see how it goes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kissing didn't take long to go further. Emily undid the straps on her dress, revealing her breasts. Eddie caressed them, which made Emily's pulse sing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they shifted, Emily felt the pressure of Eddie's erection pressing against his jeans. Undoing his fly, she brought his penis out. Pulling a condom out of her purse, she wrapped his erection in latex and performed her first hand job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were finished, Eddie drove her home. \"I had a real good time, Eddie,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me, too. You know, next time will be our third date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily nodded. The third date was often when couples decided to start having sex. \"I'm looking forward to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily retied her dress, and Eddie walked her to the front door. \"Thanks again, Emily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" They kissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily went up to her bedroom. At bedtime, she brought out her vibrator again, and satisfied herself until she was ready to go to sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning Ethan woke up normally staring at himself in the mirror. He checked himself over seeing everything looked normal as he debated what to do today. Checking his phone he saw he had a text from Eddie as Ethan read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm out of town tonight how about dinner tomorrow? I know a romantic place by the lake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds amazing ;)\" Ethan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan felt his heart flutter a bit. That could finally be the big night for them, plus it gave him a day to prepare. Plus he decided it was time to finally tell Jessica that Emily was seeing Eddie. He grew a bit nervous at telling her cause growing up Jessica always had a crush on Eddie while Ethan had always had a crush on Jessica. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever other than that drunken night at a party a year ago Ethan and Jessica never really came together. He remembered the heart crushing moment last year when Ethan asked Jessica out and she friend zoned him only to go to Eddie and have him friend zone her. It took months of awkwardness for all three of them to finally all become friends again but they made it work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting ready in the morning Ethan made the call to Jessica and invited her over later right before his change. He wanted to tell her as Ethan then go out together as Emily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the afternoon Ethan fumbled through his phone at first visiting his typical internet videos and social media sites, however after about an hour or so he found himself visiting several female<br>\r\nClothing sites. His mind drifted off as he browsed shoe sites, dress shops, and even hair style places. He wanted Emily to look perfect for tomorrow night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After awhile of this Ethan finally caught himself as he shook his head trying to shake those thoughts out of his head as he noticed an odd new tingling sensation rush through his body. It was unlike anything he had felt before and could only described as a growing deep internal pleasure. Ethan let out a small groan as he gripped the couch not noticing his fingernails slowly getting longer.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever the sensations were abruptly ended as his doorbell rang.....Ethan felt himself snapping back to reality as he looked to his hands noticing everything seemed fine. The sun was still out and he had plenty of time before sunset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door he saw Jessica was there but not in the way he expected.....She was wearing three inch heels and  a short mini skirt with a tight tank top and push up bra to make her average C-cups stand out more. Her normal Aurburn hair had been lightened and she was even wearing false nails that had been painted a bright red along with her toenails. Considering the Jessica he knew always dressed much more conservatively this was a complete surprise. While he wasn't go to say anything it looked like to Ethan that in a way she was trying to look more like....Emily....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey come in you look really nice.\" Ethan said as Jessica came inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down together Ethan looked over at Jessixa both curious and worried at Jessica's new attaire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So....uh...new outfit? I like it a lot....it's very.....well....\" Ethan said trying to come up a nicer term for slutty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's sexy I know.....you seem surprised?\" Jessica said with an odd look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's just I never see you dress like this before.\" Ethan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you know I felt it was time for a change.....\" She said....as her voice turned lower and more sultry as her foot suddenly slipped out of her shoe and started creeping towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unmm...well listen there is something I wanted to tell you and about me...well more about Emily....her and Eddie have started......\" That's when Ethan paused as he realized Jessica's foot was in between his legs stroking his member through his jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm Jessica what are you doing?\" He asked never seeing her this forward before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica wasn't playing around anymore. She got out of her chair and slowly and straddled Ethan as she took his hands and started rubbing her breasts with them as she moved her hips along his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the Ethan from a year ago could only have dreamed of this happening to him. That Ethan would have probably blown his load already as he used to fantasize about this with Jessica. However this Ethan, the one he was currently felt strangely nothing.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.He had no erection and as she forced him to caress her breasts or and body the only thoughts going through his mind were how he was glad Emily's were bigger and could have pulled off this outfit better. After several minutes of teasing with no reaction Jessica jumped off of him and looked down at him with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it! I freaking knew it Ethan! You are losing yourself to Emily!\" She pointed out to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh....what?\" Ethan said confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on Ethan.....We both know how much you had crush on me before Emily started showing up every night. That night at the party a year ago you barely lasted three minutes you barely contain yourself when you finally got to have me.\" She said as Ethan's eyes went wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait what? I barely remember that night you said we just fooled around, remember I had never drank before that night.\" Ethan called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh we did more than that. My curiosity finally got he better of me so when we found that empty room I basically jumped your bones. Eddie was off hitting on some cheerleader but your eyes never left me that night. However the next morning I realized it was a mistake so I broke it off and let you keep your mental virginity.\" Jessica explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan felt a bit shocked and betrayed at Jessica. He always wanted her before but now he felt nothing for her at all....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what was this all about then?\" He said motioning to her outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A test.....I saw you last night living that ice cream den with Eddie....I was going to wave and call you over but not two seconds once you were in his car you were all over him. I wanted to see if any of the real Ethan I knew and grew up with was still there so I wanted to temp his manhood with what he desired most....me....\" Jessica said as tears filled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Jessica....I invited you over tonight to explain that Emily and Eddie had just started dating. I wanted you to know because your my friend, both of our friends. I value your friendship both as Ethan and Emily. I don't want to lose that. Plus I still think your beautiful, I just....don't feel that way anymore.\" Ethan told her <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what...are you just going to give in and become Emily full time?\" Jessica asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No....well...I don't know....I can't lie....Emily's thoughts and desires have gotten much stronger recently but I don't want to just give in either. I want to balance is until I can finally choose.\" Ethan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took another hour of talking things out but finally the two reconciled eachother to friends again as the two agreed to go out shopping tonight as Jessica's outfit kept making Etha want to find an awesome and sexy outfit for tomorrow night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after talking a familar pain hit Ethan as he ran upstairs with Jessica as Ethan took his pill quickly as jessica helped him undress. Ethan noticed that the change wasn't taking as long anymore getting it down to about 5 minutes now and some parts of it were not hurting as bad, especially the breasts, privates, and butt changes were starting to feel rather....good.</span></div></div>",

You can't put those in your bras.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no lie. Emily's breasts had gone up to a DD cup. She had to go bra-less, and her breasts strained at the top Jessica picked out for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they drove to the mall, Jessica asked, \"What kind of outfits do you want to look at?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe something like what you're wearing,\" Emily replied. \"Tomorrow night is my third date with Eddie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taking it to the next level, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're definitely thinking about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. So, this pill you're on. You said the way you look now is a side effect. Any others I should worry about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get really horny when I'm ovulating, so that should ease up soon. And there are some side effects for Ethan. Maybe that's started already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I went looking at outfits online, and I was really getting turned on, imagining myself wearing them. Plus, when you were testing your theory,... I felt nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Ethan is starting to act like you, and that's why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. And I'm not looking to be Emily permanently just yet, because the only way to do that is to get pregnant. I'm nowhere near ready to be a mom. I think I need to do more to establish myself before that happens, since, legally, I don't exist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was a big help in picking out new clothes, and Emily now had six outfits to choose from for tomorrow night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she settled in for the night, Emily took out her battery-operated friend, wondering if she would still need it to relax tomorrow night. Her pill-enhanced body got more out of the experience, and she had her first multiple orgasm.</span></div></div>",

His phone had a message in it from Eddie letting him know when he would arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I'm working till 5 so I will be there a little after 6 to pick up Emily. If she isn't there by then let me know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan liked how they had worked out a good line of communication discussing Emily during the day. It was a good cover incase anyone ever tried to pick up on they were the same person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the day time Etuan tried to distract himself with video games and movies and the internet, but nio matter what he did his interest only seemed to last a few minutes. He soon found himself looking up more outfits online and looking up various shoes wondering how Emily would look in them. Every time his mind wandered he tried to catch himself but he couldn't help but think about Emily's big date tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere they finally gonna do it? How would it feel? We're people starting to see them as a couple? What kind of future could they have? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll these thoughts kept him busy until the afternoon. As the sun started to set Ethan went upstairs and undressed as he took his pill and felt the changes it his body. He writhed on the ground as his body changed however unlike the discomfort and pain he was used to parts of the change felt actually quite good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up to check herself out the mirror Emily noticed that the pills were having a more visual impact on her body now. Her now DD cup breasts were now more prominent and perky as she noticed they lost some of their natural sag giving them a more rounded and enhanced shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hair was definitely longer now too before just going past her shoulders but now it seemed to reach all the way to the tip of her butt. She also noticed something else, the normal strawberry blonde blonde seemed a bit lighter and brighter shade than usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpinning around she didn't notice anything else of notice yet but she decided to moniter herself changes now to make sure:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter awhile she finally settled on the right outfit. A black leather mini skirt and white blouse that clung tightly to her chest and showed a good not slutty amount of cleavage. She also had on some sexy white lingerie underneath incase things the way she hoped tonight. Finally she put on some sexy three in heels that showed off her dainty feet as she did her makeup and combed her hair so it flowed behind her nicely. Shortly after there was a knock on her door as her mom entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow honey you look beautiful and so sexy! He won't be able to contain himself! It looks like the pills are working too I see your hair and your boobs! They are definitely bigger and perkier too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother! Please!\" Emily said blushing:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now  Don't be surprised if they continue to grow a little bit more and look  a bit rounder and perkier. It may be a bit inconvenient at first but once they settle in on a shape and size you will be fine. The hair is the same thing too. Don't be surprised if it continues to grow and lighten more as well but it will eventually settle in. Also some of your other assets might get a little enhanced too, so don't be alarmed if you start to notice your butt getting more rounded, your legs a little longer, and your overall figure taking on a more hourglass shape. The pills enhance all the sexual aspects of your female form.\" Mom explained <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh okay mom thanks. Is there anything else I need to know?\" She asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually yes honey. Thats partly why I came up here. I want you to make sure you guard those pills very carefully. They are very special and unique and only designed to only work on you. If anyone else takes them there could be harsh and very permanent side effects. Just make sure no other girl tries to use them or a guy mistakes them for a mint or whatever. I know the odds the slim but with your changing appearance it isn't uncommon for other girls to start getting jealous and they may think those pills could help them too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kinds of side effects would they have on normal girls?\" Emily asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to get to specific just think similar to the ones you're experiencing but multiplied many times over and most importantly they become permanent.\" Her mom replied <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand mom I won't let anyone else use them.\" Emily said as she suddenly heard a knock on the door. She smiled excited as she put her heels on and checked herself one last time before heading downstairs for her date with Eddie as she answered the door.</span></div></div>",

Oh.\" He finally closed his mouth, but he still couldn't take his eyes off of Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Emily asked, \"where are we going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I was thinking of that new place downtown.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good.\" Eddie lived closer to downtown. Did that mean he'd be bringing her to his home?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I wait up?\" Dad asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear, please!\" Mom interrupted. Turning to Emily, she said, \"Just call if you'll be late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do, Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dinner was good, with conversation centered on Emily's appearance. \"I guess you weren't kidding about those pills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I wasn't. And I'm not done changing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you aren't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm-mmm,\" she replied with a smile. My boobs might get bigger still. And my butt should start to fill out, and my legs will get longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, they got back in the car. Eddie said, \"My folks are out of town for a couple weeks. Would you like to come over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I would,\" Emily said, hoping to sound casual. Inside, she realized that he was, indeed, getting ready to take the next step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie pulled into his driveway. He got out of the car, then walked around to open her door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily took this opportunity to call home. \"Don't wait up, Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe showed her around the ground floor, even though she had been there before as Ethan. Finally, he asked, \"Do you want to come upstairs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe followed him upstairs into his bedroom. Then, as soon as he turned around, she kissed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was about to ask,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, and yes,\" she replied. \"I want to make love with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all the persuasion he needed, as they took off their clothes. Once they were naked, Eddie carried Emily to the bed. They kissed some more as Eddie fondled her breasts. Her breasts were so much more sensitive than they'd been two nights before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was fully erect, he put on a condom and straddled her. He began entering her slowly, but she wrapped her legs around his pelvis, driving him further into her. <i>This</i>, Emily thought, <i>is so much better than the vibrator.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily had never experienced anything like this. She'd felt vaginal spasms before, but it was so much better with Eddie than with plastic and batteries. When she came, her vagina milked his shaft in sync with his ejaculations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally finished coming, Emily said, \"Thank you, Eddie, for being my first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey fell asleep in each other's arms.</span></div></div>",

A big and strong and hair arm cuddling him....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a minute for Ethan to even realize what was going on. He was still sleep and groggy as he got up only to realize he was laying naked in bed with Eddie.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit!\" He called out jumping out of bed with a blanket around him as he ran for the bathroom. After a couple seconds he heard Eddie's voice echo a familiar tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit!\" He heard Eddie call out as they both didn't think this through very well wen it came to the morning after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...hey dude..can I borrow some clothes?\" Ethan asked knowing all he had were Emily's<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie let Ethan have some shorts and a shirt as they had a very awkward drive back to Ethan's place together. Most of them were silent but when Ethan got home he turned around for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sorry for the awkward morning but don't forget to text Emily tonight okay?\" He said with a small smile as Eddie nodded back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce home a nice hot shower helped Ethan shake off that awkward feeling and helped him remember how amazing the night was. Sex as a woman was so much more intense then he thought. It was much more pleasurable than as a guy. He couldn't help but think of all the new and awesome things awaiting Emily and Eddie in the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to call Jessica over and talk to her about it. Maybe even get some advice on how to be better in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later Jessica came over as they sat around joking about the really awkward morning but also going over the night in detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just can't believe how intense female sex is. I don't understand how normal girls don't think about it all the time like guys do.\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who says we don't? Most normal girls just have better self control than guys do.\" She laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I am gonna have to get better at it. It's just the pills are changing Emily more and more. She is becoming so sexy it's hard to imagine and her libido is getting stronger.\" Ethan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica's eyes darted around for a second which seemed odd before her eyes looked downward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm Ethan were your nails always like that?\" She said pointing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan looked at his hands as his eyes went wide. His normal short nails were gone. Instead he was staring at the long well manicured nails Emily sported every night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\" Ethan called out as he suddenly darted out the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding his mother Ethan showed his nails to her. \"What's going on?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at his hands his mother gave him a reassuring look. \"It's okay honey. I told you some parts of Emily would leak over during he side effects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what else? Do I need to worry?\" Ethan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm honestly not sure honey the side effects are different for everyone. Just keep an eye on things and especially those pills.\" His mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading back to his room Jessica was putting her shoes in and getting ready to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heading out? It's almost sundown Emily should be showing up soon.\" Ethan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I gotta run. Besides you said Eddie was coming over later to watch a movie on your couch I don't wanna be a third wheel.\" Jessica said and she took off in a rather quick and odd hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging it off Ethan saw sunset was coming as he went to take a pill and noticed the case was out.....he definitely put it away in its drawer every night.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe he just forget last night. Taking his pill he soon felt the changes hit his body as Emily soon emerged a few minutes later. Looking in the mirror she noticed nothing different from last night.  Tossing on some underwear she found a nice tank top and some tight yoga pants that frames her butt nicely. Since they were staying inside tonight she wanted to be comfortable but still sexy. She combed her hair and did her makeup and waited for Eddie to drop by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple minutes there was suddenly a pounding on the door as Emily grew worried. That wasn't like Eddie at all....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door Emily saw it was Jessica standing there. Her arms were wrapped around her chest and she seemed to be in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! Jessica what's wrong?\" She called out helping her inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica could barely stand as she collapsed on the ground in her hands and knees. It was strange her skin felt hit to the touch and she seemed to be making a mixture of moans both in and pain and in pleasure.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily....I'm sorry.....please.....forgive me.....I was jealous.....I snuck one of your pills.....I thought it might help me a bit too since they have changed you......\" She cried out in obvious discomfort and agony as she was grabbing her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRushing upstairs to grab his mom Emily brought her downstairs and showed her what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please mom what do we do?\" Emily called out as Jessica writhed on the ground as she began tearing at her clothes trying to rip them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing....I.....am. Sorry I warned you Emily. I....can't help her. At least not with the physical stages. I've only seen this happen once before. A very homely girl I thought was my friends snuck a pill. When we found her, her body had changed into something so overly sexual she looked like stripper or porn star. We weren't able to help her and when the mental stages happened she forgot who she was and ended up a sex obsessed  nymphomaniac.\" Mom explained as tears filled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was terrified as she looked up Emily's mom. \"Please! Help me I don't want this!\" She cried out as she held onto her breasts which were  slowly starting to pulse and grow....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't stop the physical changes but I might be able to prevent the mental. I will have to leave and see if my doctor is available. Emily, stay and help Jessica. The changes will take a couple hours. Hopefully I can make it back by then. Try to help her and ease her stress as best you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica you are gonna have to do your best to resist. If you give in and accept your fate than I won't be able help you. Try to resist as much you can. I know you are being overwhelmed with pain and pleasure but try to remember who you are.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lastly and most importantly Emily. In almost every case I've heard about this the victim becomes a permanent bi-sexual so if Jessica starts trying to hit on you or get you to pleasure her sexually in any way do not let her! Do not let her get off in any way. Tie her down if you have to. Her changes are going to be quite drastic so make sure you are prepared.\" Her mother explained as she got her coat and ran out the front door hoping to find the right medicine in time.</span></div></div>",

Each breast and buttock was the size and shape of a pregnant woman's belly. Her hair hung down to the floor. Jessica touched one of her breasts and moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily walked up to her. \"How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God,\" she replied, \"you're breathing on them, and it's driving me crazy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily knew how sensitive her own breasts were.

He saw Emily like normal but then he saw Jessica, or at least what he thought was Jessica. At this point her body had changed so much it was almost impossible to tell. Her breasts had grown so much they looked like beach balls with nipples. Her butt stuck incredibly far out and her light brunette hair has grown to where it was touching the floor. Her lips had also swollen and turned plump and pouty and her nails had grown to be several inches long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus what happened? Is that Jessica?\" Eddie asked terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah....it's my pills....they aren't meant for normal people. She snuck one when I wasn't looking and it caused this to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Jessica she seemed  to almost be forgetting who she was or where she was. She was leaning up against a wall her hand rubbing her clit furiously and fingering herself while other was groping her huge breast. It was then Jessica remembered what her mom had said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eddie help me! We need to tie her down we can't let her pleasure herself!\" Emily shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two walked over to Jessica she stared at Them with lustful eyes as she slowly licked the vaginal juices off her fingers before reached over and grabbing Emily and kissing her deeply....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily pulled away quickly tasting the vaginal juices Jessica had licked off herself. Grabbing her arms quickly Eddie helped by grabbing her legs as they pinned her down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! Fuck me! Do anything! Please I need it!\" Jessica cried out moaning in agony. Reaching up she tried to resist <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily and Eddie had to drown out her voice. They knew it wasn't the real Jessica talking her mind was slipping away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a belt and a bath towel the pair soon tied up Jessica's limbs as she struggled to release herself. They still had to hold her down but they soon heard Emily's mother pulling back into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRushing inside she was holding a  syringe filled with a bright purple liquid. Looking down to what Emily had become she looked shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! This is much worse than I thought.....she must have had an especially severe reaction. Here hold her down. This will prevent the mental changes hopefully and slightly reverse some of the physical ones.\" Her mom said as she quickly injected Jessica giving her the shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took a moment as Jessica soon stopped resisting them as she lay still for moment. After about a minute her body started convulsing as she started moaning as she was changing again. This time it was much quicker and in reverse. Her breasts shrunk down a bit as they reshaped into perfect round shapes. Her butt shrunk down too and her nails retracted a bit. Emily noticed something else as well. Her skin was tanning taking in a slightly darker tone and her hair was changing color turning jet black.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was done Jessica lay there panting as she slowly got up and stumbled a bit and looked at her new body in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.bugehoobs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Big-Round-Fake-Boobs-01.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.bugehoobs.com/wp-content/uplo...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still had the body of a porn star. Huge perfectly round boobs, full pouty lips, full and supple butt, and a perfect hourglass shape. However the ridiculous  over exaggerated sexual  features were lessened a bit down to a still over the top but at least now manageable figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this really me?\"  Jessica asked looking at herself in the mirror. She seemed to be herself again but still in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I'm afraid so my dear. That injection helped regulate the changes to a more manageable figure, but this is the best they could do. This body is now yours for good.\" Emily's mother explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look like a stripper or porn star....plus I feel different....I still feel...really....horny....\" Jessica admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Jessica, there will be some lingering side effects as well. Your body's libido is now much higher and I expect you are going to have bi-sexual desires now too. You are going to be prone to wearing as light and revealing clothes as possible. You will also soon notice that wearing high heels is actually more comfortable and natural than flat shoes.\" Mom explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears filled Jessica's eyes as she finally understood what her greed and jealousy had led too. She wanted to be sexier but not at this kind of price....Most people would barely be able to recognize her now let alone what her own family was going to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry Emily....can you forgive me?\" Jessica asked crying <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, you are still my friend, and Ethan's too. Tomorrow we will take you out and get you some new clothes.\" Emily said as they hugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter awhile things calmed down as they found a light and loose dress plus some heels for Jessica to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's probably best if I take her home....\" Emily's mother said knowing at this point Jessica would probably still be tempted to try and seduce Eddie ir Emily. Taking her home she left Eddie and Emily alone together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So uhh....that was an interesting evening....\" Eddie said as the two shared a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?\" Emily asked as she didn't realize how horny she was suddenly feeling....Her nipples were clearly visible through her tank top and her slit was already quite moist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could still cuddle and watch a movie?\" Eddie suggested <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting her lower lip Gently Emily took Eddie's hand and walked him upstairs to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a better idea.\" She said whispering into his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was in the room with him Emily pushed Eddie ok the bed as she quickly stripped herself and climbed on top of Eddie. She quickly helped him out of his clothes as Eddie seemed a bit surprised at how forward she suddenly seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason Emily felt like she really just needed Eddie as she quickly found herself straddling him as she lowered herself down onto  his erection. She guided Eddie's hands to her breasts which felt even more sensitive than usual. She then began riding him letting herself be totally filled up by Eddie until she felt herself cumming multiple times as her vagina milked Eddie for everything it could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the intense love making Eddie got up and dressed himself kissing Emily goodbye promising to see her again tomorrow. Emily was soon fast asleep as she passed out until morning when the sunlight came through the window as Ethan found himself waking up again. However unknown to him just yet, his nails had failed to change back and there were now several strands of blonde hair mixed in with his normal brown which was now a little bit longer than it should be....</span></div></div>",

Once he was dressed, there was a knock on the door. \"Ethan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm decent,\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom opened the door. \"I wanted to talk about Jessica, de - good heavens, Ethan! Look at your hair!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan saw. If he'd still been in high school, they'd have insisted he get a haircut before going back to class. \"Holy shit! And my nails are still long!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ethan,\" Mom said, using her tone of voice to try to keep him calm, \"tell me everything that happened while I was getting Jessica's medicine. Did you have any sort of sex with her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Mom. She wanted to, but Eddie and I tied her down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't have oral sex with her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Mom, I just said - oh, wait. She was masturbating, and she licked her juices off her fingers, then she kissed me. Is-is that why I look like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Possibly. It might be a temporary reaction to the extra dose from her fluids. If that's the case, it will wear off. Not necessarily today or tomorrow, but your hair should return to its usual length.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if it doesn't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll worry about that if and when the time comes. For now, we'll just wait and see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. How do you think Jessica's doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll have slept most of the night. Her transformation will have left her exhausted. She will have some questions when she calls. Her mother certainly did when I took her home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what should I say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The way she looks will be pretty much the way she will look for the rest of her life. Only the sort of changes that the passage of time brings will take place. Her libido will be heightened, and she will probably find herself bisexual, if she wasn't already. But her life will be her own, and she will not be a slave to her passions. That will be of some comfort.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone rang. \"I'll get that.\" With that, Mom left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returned a few moments later with the phone. \"It's Jessica.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan took the phone. \"Hi, Jess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Ethan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still can't believe what I see when I look in the mirror. Most of last night seems like some kind of fever dream. Did I really have tits the size of beach balls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And a butt to match.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And did I go down on Emily, or her on me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither. That was just a dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Okay. So, Eddie probably didn't pound me in the ass, either?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. You begged us to, but we knew it wasn't really you talking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still hornier than I've ever been, though. I can't tell if it's for Ethan or Emily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom says you're bi now, so it could be either one. But you're still in control, so that's good news. You can still find that special someone, you've just got more options.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I took your pill, Ethan. Can you forgive me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jess, it's okay. But you might want to wait until after dark before you drop by again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just say I'm dealing with a backwash situation, and leave it at that. It should be okay, though. See you later, Jess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later, Eddie called. \"How you doing, Ethan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty good. Want to try movie night tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I've got a... situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what? C'mon, Eddie, we're both guys. At least, I am for a few more hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,... I've got this erection that won't quit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that. When Jessica kissed Emily, it was after masturbating, and her joy juice got into my system. It should wear off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Well, I'll see how I feel tonight. Talk to you later.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After his phone conversations Ethan felt a bit strange. He thought about Jessica's new body and those huge perfect round tits and......Looking down Ethan realized what was weird, he was sporting a huge erection! He hadn't had these kinds of feelings since he first got on the pill but now he was feeling familar old sparks rising up in him once more. The thought of taking the new Jessica to bed and having her all sorts of things to him gave him strange new conflicting emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan also thought about his night with Eddie and how amazing it was. The incredible feeling of how he felt inside her and how Emily couldn't seem to get enough. Those thiughts seemed to cause the same stirs of emotion as Ethan began to realize he was attracted to both Jessica and Eddie now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was causing some strange conflicts in his head. If he slept with Jessica as Ethan does that count as cheating on Eddie? Shaking his head he tried to get these thoughts out of his head and just focus on he moment. Such as what will he do if these day time changes start getting worse...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan spent the rest of his afternoon trying to keep his thoughts together and distracting himself with the internet as much as possible. When the sun was starting to set Ethan thought about what kind of outfit to wear tonight as for soke reason he was drawn to a really short and revealing white mini dress. Looking at the dress he couldn't help but feel his familar stirs of emotion when there was suddenly a knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the time it was still pretty early before dark so Eddie was running quite early. Going downstairs he answered the door as his draw suddenly dropped. Jessica was standing there in the sexiest outfit he had ever seen her in....A tiny black mini skirt that barely covered her butt, tall four inch black heels, and a super tight black tank top with no bra underneath so her huge tits were quite visible under it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there handsome....\" Jessica said smiling at him with a devilish grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately Ethan felt his member getting hard as he tried to hide it as best he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...hey Jess what's up?\" He replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just came over to talk about some things and kind of wanted To clear the air.\" She said as she let herself in. Almost every step she walked her hips swayed seductivly side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing up to Emily's room to talk Jessica shut the door as they sat together on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how are you adjusting to the new body? I know it must be difficult.\" Ethan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...at first I couldn't believe it....I hated it and myself for being so dumb and taking that pill....almost none of my old clothes fit, these tits are so big and not to mention sensitive I could barely wear anything to cover them. On top of that any clothes I tried to wear that weren't sexy and revealing felt itchy and uncomfortable, it also just feels way better for me to walk in high heels now, almost like its my natural walking state. Not to mention I couldn't stop thinking about sex and touching myself only made it worse and increased my desires.\" She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry Jess....what can I do to help?\" Ethan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica looked at him for a moment before licking her lips lightly as grinned at him before suddenly jumping him and straddling his hips....leaning down she whispered into his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well actually there is something....I can't stop thinking about you Ethan....Even as Emily I want you badly but that side belongs to Eddie. So I want the side he can't have....Or perhaps he might even learn to share you....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan was taken back by how forward she was. He had dreamed about this as a guy before becoming Emily as his throbbing member gave away his hidden desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see someone has come around....I guess your male side isn't gone after all....\"Jessica said as she slowly started undoing his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...wait...Jess...I'm not sure if we should....things are just kind of weird right now.\" Ethan said as his pants and boxers were suddenly ripped from him exposing his large erect member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All you have to do is tell me to stop....but I don't think you want me to....\" Jessica said smiling as she stripped off his shirt before moving her body on his. Ethan realized she wasn't even wearing underwear as her juices were already sliding down her thighs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving herself on top of him Jessica slowly slid herself into Ethan as he felt himself entering her. He wanted to tell her to stop but he just couldn't. It felt too amazing as her wet walls took him in fully as she straddled him. Her movements and timing was perfect as Ethan moaned and held onto her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued for awhile as Jessica ride Ethan felt himself about to explode as he tried to warn Jessica. He knew she was on normal pills herself olus she showed no signs of stopping as she rode him quicker and harder until......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!!!!!\" Jessica cried out in orgasm as Ethan groaned exploding his full load into her. She milked his shaft for every drop as She slowly pulled off him. Ethan was panting from pleasure and exhaustion but for him his night was just beginning....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a familar tightness Ethan saw it was getting dark as the changes were going to start. Running to his drawer he found his pills and quickly took one as he turned around only to see Jessica standing there nude now with him.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...what's going on Jess I'm going to change soon....\" He said as Jessica took him and tossed him on the bed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not done yet and there is something I want to test.....\" She said as she crawled to the bed as she knelt down on her knees and slipped his member into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jess what are you doing I'm about to change and.....ahhh!\" Ethan cried out as he felt the changes start but this time they felt very different.....the pain was gone and fully replaced with an intense pleasure hat was starting between his legs....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changes were starting at his core this time as his member began to shrink and slither away turning into a smooth slit. This didn't stop Jessica however as she continued to lick and probe at his new feminine slit as Ethan cried out in pleasure unable to resist or stop anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the rest of the changes hit his body Ethan noticed how everything seemed to be turning more extreme than he remembered. His nails were longer than usual, his hair was longer than usual going well past his butt. It was also turning brighter and brighter until it finally became a bright platinum blonde. His entire figure became much more sexual, longer legs, wider hips, fuller butt, pouty lips, and finally....His growing breasts were getting even larger than before and also becoming much rounder and perkier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily cried out as her changes finished as Jessica finished licking her slit. Standing up slowly Emily felt her body was different as she got a good look at her new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/d8/d0/b5/d8d0b56aae7f40c84e67622321dfa3dc.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! I'm....im a total sex bomb now like....like...\" Emily said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like me....I know...I was hoping sexual stimulation along with your pills would finally trigger your true change....Face it Emily this is your true form....the way you have always wanted to look. I'm guessing you are feeling similar mental changes as well?\" Jessica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily couldn't deny it. She could feel sexual arousal for both Jessica and Eddie still. She also felt more compelled to dress sexier as her libido was definitely higher...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the tight white mini dress she slipped it on as her huge round tits were perfectly visible which have her a strange sensation of pride. She also slipped on some three inch heels and did her makeup as Jessica got dressed too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I do now?\" Eddie is coming over any minute.\" Emily said both excited and scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect....why don't we invite him up for a little threes company? We show him how well these new forms for us?\" Jessica said with a seductive grin.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We are in control. No matter how we look, we are in control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica sighed. \"Maybe you're right. I really wanted to try myself out on somebody.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you'll have plenty of chances. Trust me. Ethan likes having sex with you. And maybe if I weren't with Eddie, I'd go for you, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand.\" She smiled. \"I forgot to tell you, I'm interviewing for a new job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?

I don't think they'll turn me away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even though you're under 21?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With this body, I don't think I'll have too many guys looking at my ID.

Imagine the two of us on the same stage!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We might not get out alive!\" Emily said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Jessica headed for the door. \"I'm glad you and Eddie are working out so well, Em. I really wanted him, but I'm glad he came around for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck with the job interview, Jess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica's departure was shortly followed by Eddie's arrival. Taking one last look at her new body, Emily opened the door. \"Hi, Eddie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Em, I brought some - holy Jesus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily was amused by his reaction. And, judging by the bulge in his pants, he wasn't kidding about his erection.</span></div></div>",

What happened to you?\" Eddie asked as he walked inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's kind of a long story....Jessica came over and well....Ethan slept with her. Part of the side effects including this change to me were Ethan regaining his libido an desires, more specifically for Jessica's and her new body. Afterwards when he began to change I emerged I saw how my body had become much sexier and my libido had increased.\" Emily explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is this permanent? What other side effects are there?\" Eddie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so....I am pretty sure this was my eventual end result anyway but Jessica supercharged the changes to come out sooner. I'm not sure about all the side effects but I know for sure that I am feeling some bi-sexual desires. It was hard for me to resist Jessica even in this body. I've also noticed my need and desire to wear more revealing clothes as gone up. This skimpy little dress feels perfect on me. Also standing in tall heels like these feels so much better than it did. Lastly I can definitely feel my libido going up as well as my desires for you....\" Emily said with a grin as she leaned in and kissed Eddie as she grabbed his buldging package.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie was surprised at how strong and forceful she was now. Just a few weeks ago she barely felt comfortable going outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me show you everything...\" Emily said as she took Eddie upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing  the door Emily slowly slid off her dress revealing her new body to Eddie. His jaw dropped seeing just how sexy she had become. It looked like to him literally every inch of her body had been sexually maximized. From her huge perky tits that showed no sag, to her long legs and full butt and wide hips. Her platinum blonde hair was perfectly straight and cascaded down past her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily wastes no time jumping Eddie and stripping down his clothes. He wasn't kidding either, his package definitely looked bigger and fuller as the near thought of having him made her wet. Sliding on top of him she began riding him fast and hard wanting to have every inch of him fill her up. It didn't take long before the two of them were enjoying sweet blissful climaxes together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie left soon afterwards exhausted from their love making as Emily fell into a deep sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen morning came Ethan woke up and got out of bed as he saw his hair and nails had finally returned to normal. While he was happy about that a new troubling feeling was beginning to rise within him. As much as he loved his session with Eddie last night he also kept thinking about Jessica too. He was beginning to fully realize now that he was in love with Jessica again but Emily was in love with Eddie....</span></div></div>",

However when Ethan got there He noticed something odd. Instead of the Three guys there was already four and they were playing two on two. Eddie was playing with Steve, a really tall and smart guy who was on Varisty back in High school. They had hug out before a few times but Ethan always thought he was more of a pompous jock than Eddie did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was strange Ethan was feeling something he hadn't in awhile....anger....anger and jealousy towards Eddie. He knew Eddie wasn't out sleeping with other girls but this lack of consideration towards him made him feel slighted....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh hey guys...\" Ethan said interrupting their games<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey man, long time no see!\" Steve said offering him a high five which Ethan reluctantly accepted...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never knew you had such a hot cousin Ethan! I'm mean I've had some hotties before but man she is in a league of her own! Those tits are huge, and that ass to die for! I can believe you are okay with Eddie boy here hitting that!\" He said laughing as all the guys joined him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh..:he told you about Emily huh?\" Ethan said as his glare narrowed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah man... He showed me a pic he snapped of her last night, that tight little white dress, oh my god!\" Steve said laughing as he showed Ethan the pic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/d8/d0/b5/d8d0b56aae7f40c84e67622321dfa3dc.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan didn't realize Eddie he had shares photos of her since her change. He felt a little betrayed since Emily didn't agree to share them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....uh...I'm gonna head out you already seem to have a full team....\" Ethan said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh its okay man just hang out and you can sub for us....\" Eddie said trying to calm the situations<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks....\" Ethan said turning around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie caught up to Ethan and faced him so they could talk in private.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey man I'm sorry Steve just kinda showed up and we didn't want to tell him no We haven't seen each other since graduation.\" He said trying to justify himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen....obviously you didn't care enough to tell me, and considering whom I'm close too I would think leaving me out as a fifth wheel would be a bad idea....Not to mention sharing pics of someone without their permission! Listen don't come around tonight...:.Emily has  plans with Jessica....\" Ethan said storming off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing home Ethan couldn't tell if he felt more like shouting or crying....he knew Emily still loves Eddie but Ethan was so pissed off at him right now....maybe joining Jessica in that strip job wouldn't be such a bad idea....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalling up Jessica Ethan wanted to talk with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jess....\" He said talking with her on the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...I'm sorry there is no Jessica here anymore just Raven now....\" Jessica replied giggling <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What are you talking about?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got the job! They hired me on the spot! They even gave me a new stage name Raven, cause of my long dark hair. I made over $500.00 dollars in one night! The guys were throwing money at me it was soooo  amazing!\" She said excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow congrats Jess....or Raven...sooo I was think you should come over tonight. Maybe Emily can try out too.\" Ethan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Of course I will be over before sundown to help you change and pick the right outfit.\" She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan decided not to tell her about the fight just yet. Part of him was hoping it would resolve itself the other really wanted Emily to get this job and go out on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen sun started to set that afternoon Jessica or rather Raven now as she called herself showed up wearing a skimpy black mini dress and wearing no bra while sporting six inch heels. Upon opening the door she rushed in and pushed Ethan against a wall kissing him deeply as she rubbed her body against his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there  handsome....I've been thinking of you all day....\" She said with a devilish grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan smiled back wanting her badly but he knew he was going to change any minute now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing upstairs together without warning Raven suddenly pushed Ehan into his bed as she ripped off his clothes and climbed on top of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jess....I mean Raven...What are you doing I'm gonna change any minute.\" He said as Raven began lowering herself into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know....I want to do you as you change. This will get Emily hot and heavy and in the mood. Perfect for her audition.\" She whispered into his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan wasn't really in a position to resist as his throbbing member was pressed up against her wet slit. Raven quickly lowers herself down onto Ethan showing she wasn't even wearing panties under her dress.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven rode Ethan widely as he groaned in pleasure. He soon felt another familar sensation as his nails were slowly getting longer as long platinum blonde hair started to slowly grow and cascade down his back....</span></div></div>",

Ethan was sure he was about to come, but, before that could happen, his member shriveled and withdrew, leaving Emily to enjoy the orgasm. \"That was incredible,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured you'd like it,\" Raven replied. \"It's certainly one way to avoid getting pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily sat up. \"Shit!

Are you two sisters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just good friends, sir. I'm Emily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Mike. Nobody calls me \"sir\". And your name is... Tyffani.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyffani, huh? I'll have to remember that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Tyffani, the rules here are simple: The guys don't touch the dancers on stage. When you're not on stage, you're encouraged to make the guys feel comfortable. Get them to buy you a drink when you sit at their table.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't drink, Mike.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't matter. The bar gets the guy's money, that's what counts. If you want to give a guy a lap dance, only do it if no other girl is on stage. If he gives you any money for it, that's yours. As for sex, don't do it inside the club. And don't tell me about it if he pays you. Got all that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. You go on after Amber, she's the redhead. Raven, teach her some basic moves, let her improvise on that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should tell you, Mike, I can't come in until after dark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay, Tyffani, the big spenders don't come in until 10 o'clock, anyway. Knock 'em dead, kid.\" With a wink, Mike dismissed them from his office.</span></div></div>",

She scanned the stage first looking around for her potential targets. Men whom seemed the most interested. Next she slowly started moving her hips and body to the music letting herself get into the rhythm of things. After a minute or so she started twirling around the pole as she eyed her targets. Moving in closer she got on her hands and knees and crawled to them slowly showing them a full view of her large breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men were almost too eager as they stuffed more  money into her bra and panties and threw more on stage. Once the song was over Raven blew the crowd a kiss and collected her cash and came back stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter counting it a bit Raven smiled to Emily showing off her take. \"Over $200.00 in one dance think you can beat that?\" She said smiling in a teasing way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily felt something inside her growing....something new....it took her a moment but she realized it, she was jealous! She wanted to beat Raven! She knew she was hotter and that men would kill for a chance to be with her. She just had to show it.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short break another song started as the DJ announced Tyffani. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright we have a new dancer tonight folks give it up for the wonderful Tyffani!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the music Tyffani slowly walked on stage as she felt the piercing stare of dozens of strangers lookin at her body. She could almost feel their lustful desires as they gazed at her. At first Tyffani froze. She had no dancing experience and didn't know what to do. She tries to replicate Raven but only got bored looks from the crowd....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings weren't going so good for Tyffani on stage....She was this close to getting booed off stage when she looked back to Raven off stage. She saw her giving her a look of both desire but also  passion taking a deep breath Tyffani closed her eyes as she felt all the men staring at her as she felt something new rising up within her.....This new feeling was strange it was telling her to let go....that she wanted to be seen and to be desired. That she was the hottest woman there and everyone should pay just to see her..,,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then something clicked. Tyffani couldn't explain it, but something inside her changed and she felt her body moving sensually with the music at last. However it didn't stop there....she felt herself moving in ways she didn't even know she could as she grabbed the poll and wrapped her legs around it and started spinning. Her legs spread wide as she twirled and danced on stage in ways she couldn't even explain. It was like someone was driving her body and she was just the passenger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd cheered and  hollered as the DJ even called her out looking impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you look at that folks! A perfect body with perfect moves with shining blonde hair! I think an Angel has fallen from heaven tonight folks! Show her your gratitude!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyffani saw he crowd throwing money at her as she went and grabbed all the big bills by hand, in her huge tits, or with her mouth. After the song finally ended she collected her money and went back stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god how did you do that? I didn't know you could dance like that!\" Raven said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know either....it was like something inside me just came alive and I just could.\" Tyffani replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter counting her haul they saw she maid over $500.00 in one dance! Afterwards the owner Mike came down to see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never seen moves like that from a novice. I think the DJ was right you are an Angel.....in fact I think we just found your new Stage name if you want the job.\" He said offering her his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank...you.\" Emily replied taking the deal realizing she just got her first job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the night Raven showed Angel around the club showin her how to get guys to buy them drinks as they sat down with several groups laughing and cheering. She seemed to forget completely about her actual age as Angel and Raven had tons of shots and drinks with many different kinds of men. The two were the center of attention as they each gave  multiple lap dances that night and even had several offers for more..:.They decided to play by he rules tonight as they each made another $300.00 in tips that night before calling a cab and getting dropped off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two drunk girls spent their cab ride fooling around with eachother as Enily invited Jessica back upstairs. Inside the girls fooled around more helping each other reach powerful orgasms as they collapsed in each other's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were perfect tonight Angel....\" Jessica said embracing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were too Raven....\" Emily replied as they giggled at their stage names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want this to last forever....\" Raven said holding her tightly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.....I still have feelings for Edidie though I need to figure things out for my future first.\" Emily replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw Eddie....it would be so much easier if he was a girl like us....we could all be roomies and dance together at the club.....\" Raven replied in her drunken as Emily's eyes darted down to her pills concealed in their drawer.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen morning came Ethan saw the sunlight shinning through his windows as he looked up to his hands seeing heir normal shape returned. He also felt something new and pleasurable as he looked down to see Raven still here but with his member in her mouth.....He almost told her to stop but couldn't as she finished him off quickly with amazing morning sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry i just wanted wanted a quickie this morning. I'll see you tonight before sundown\"  She said kissing his cheek before taking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan collapsed back down on his bed resting from the exhausting night. He woke up a little later wondering if he should talk to Eddie today and try to patch things up. Getting dressed he noticed the drawer with his pills in it was still open as he closed it quickly. He was pretty sure it was closed last night but he wasn't sure.....</span></div></div>",

And she made $800 in tips alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's certainly got her started making a living. By the time you're ready to settle down, the transition should be seamless. Which reminds me.\" She put a metal box on the table. \"For holding your pills. You can lock and unlock it with your smartphone. We don't want any more Jessicas, do we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess not.\" Evan programmed the lock to open when he typed in ANGEL.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours, Ethan decided it was time to clear the air with Eddie. They had both had a whole day, and Ethan felt calmer about the issue. He called Eddie's phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" That wasn't Eddie's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica? Why are you on Eddie's phone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I decided to settle some things with Eddie. I don't like it when a guy trifles with a girl's feelings. And when that girl is my friend, I like it even less. And when I can do something about it, I don't have to sit around not liking it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jess, what did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I borrowed one more pill, and decided to see how Eddie likes them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You what? After you had such a bad reaction? How could you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan could hear Eddie moaning over the phone. \"Look at it this way: The next time Eddie wants to show a pair of tits to Steve, he won't need to ask permission.\" She hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan raced downstairs. \"Mom, do you have any more of that medication you gave Jessica?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose so. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She gave Eddie a pill! He's growing breasts right now!\"</span></div></div>",

The truth is honey I have honestly no idea if it will help Eddie. I have no idea what the pill will even do to him I've never seen or heard of a man using it before. This could hurt him as much as it could help him.\" She told him handing the needle to Ethan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand mom but I don't really have a choice. Emily loves Eddie and he has been my best friend since I was a kid. I have to do anything to help him.\" Ethan explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did Eddie even take a pill? He saw what happened to Jessica why would he do this to himself?\" His mother asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He didn't do it to himself.....Jessica tricked him somehow....She was angry at him over our fight and decided to get back at him.\" Ethan said angerly. He was so mad at Jessica right now he couldn't believe she would do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds so....evil....tell me have you noticed anything different about Jessica recently?\" His mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apart from how she looks now and how she goes by Raven all the time no...why?\" Ethan asked curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just worried....I hope she still isn't changing....\" Mom said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Changing into what?\" Ethan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something bad....lets just say Lust has a dark side and sometimes it turns people bad...with Jessica's transformation it may have awoken something dark inside her. Just keep an eye on her let me know if she starts acting out more. Hurry now you have to try and help Eddie! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding Ethan took off needle in hand as he drove like lightning to Eddie's house. Kicking open the door he saw Jessica standing there wearing a tight black mini dress with black lipstick and eyeliner on with her nails revelry painted black to match her long hair. She was standing there with a devlish grin on her face as she watched Eddie changing in the other room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRushing to help Ethan saw Eddie and had a small sigh of relief. The pill didn't seem to have the same effect on guys. While his hair was longer and his chest swollen his features were only mildly changed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ethan...is that you?\" Eddie said standing up slowly gripped his sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was Jessica....she did something to me....she came over and without saying anything she forced herself on me and used her tongue to slide something into my mouth.\" He said moaning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry I have this to help you.\" Ethan said holding up the needle as he quickly gave Eddie the shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately Eddie's changes began to recede. Within seconds he seemed to be his normal self again as Ethan let out a huge sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank goodness I was afraid I had lost you for good!\" Ethan said laughing a bit with relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I scared too for a moment I almost......\" Eddie said pausing abruptly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Ethan asked nervously <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uhh....feel kinda of......OOOHHH......AHHH!!!!!\" He said crying out in sounds there were strangely not in pain.....but almost sounded like a woman on the brink of orgasm.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This.....feels.....so......good.....Ohhhh!\" Eddie moaned again as he fell into his back and began ripping off his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven came in the see what the commotion was about as she gave a started look as Ethan rushed over to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie's body was changing again this time rapidly. His feature rapidly twisted and shifted around as thinned out and two huge breasts popped out of his chest. Long brunette hair grew down his shoulders as he started to become a woman as beautiful and sexy as either Emily or Jessica. Eddie couldn't stop touching herself as she changed and her manhood slithered away into a wet slit a brand new woman was suddenly born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://you69.com/images/normal_images/2014/08/08/sexy-busty-brunette-european-slut-flashing-her-big-boobs-and-smooth-pussy-4409.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://you69.com/images/normal_images/20...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he changes had subsided Eddie slowly stood up and walked over to a motto and examining her new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eddie are you okay?\" Ethan asked terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around she looked to Ethan and gave him lustful smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eddie is gone handsome....he is long gone.....you can call me Emma now.\" Emma said slowly walking over to Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is was Ethan feared most...the cure back fired and enhanced the change. Worst of all Eddie had taken in a whole new sexy and lust filled personality known as Emma....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over them Raven smiled examining her handy work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why aren't you the sexy little thing.....\" Raven said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan hadn't noticed it before but now he did. Raven nails while always long now seemed to be sharply pointed rather than square....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't she perfect Ethan? Just like I hoped. Sexy, lustful, with a strong sexual desire to be seen and also obedient. She can join us at the club. We will be a trio of sexy sisters!\" Raven said as she reached over and grabbed Emma's breast as she moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But who gets to have him? I want him so badly can I have him please?\" Emma said looking to Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh be patient I get to have him too! I guess we will just have to share him during the day until Angel comes to play at night....\" Raven said grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is not what Ethan wanted....his two best friends changed forever by him. One directly the other indirectly. Jessica was now a dark lustful creature with evil desires lurking behind her eyes. While Emma was a mindless horny slut desperate for approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan was at a crossroads. He was staring at two beautiful women who both wanted him. His throbbing member was so big and hard at this point it almost felt like it was going to rip out of his jeans any moment. He could also feel Emily or rather Angel now, desperate to come out and join them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever he also knew this wasn't right...he had to find a way to try and fix his friends before it was too late. However with Angel getting stronger every night he was afraid of losing himself too....</span></div></div>",

Try not to trip over those things.\" The DJ announced Amber, and she strode to the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think somebody's jealous,\" Raven said. \"Think we should tell her about the pills?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you crazy, Jess? Remember how bad your reaction was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay. I was only joking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, Mom's looking into getting me something more secure to keep the pills in. Just in case someone else finds them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All because of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was probably just a matter of time before somebody other than me took one. They look kinda like mints, and sometimes Ethan has guys over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven shivered. \"If a guy did take one of those pills, what do you think would happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows? For all I know, we'd be dealing with a shemale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber walked off the stage, her G-string full of bills. The DJ announced Raven. \"Watch me, Tyffani.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily studied Raven's moves. It didn't look too hard. And Raven came back with more money than Amber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now,\" the DJ said, \"a young lady making her debut tonight. Give it up for Tyffani!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Tyffani had a little difficulty. She seemed awkward, and she wasn't sure if she was doing it right. However, she decided to try just letting her body move, and that made a difference. She became more confident in her body, and the crowd appreciated it. When the song ended, she had almost as much money as Raven had picked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice job, Tyffani,\" Raven said. \"C'mon, let's get freshened up, then we get friendly with the customers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quite a night. She sat with a group of businessmen, and they didn't notice that she never touched the drink they bought her. Later, a bachelor party hired her for a lap dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt closing time, Raven and Tyffani totaled their money. \"Not bad, Emily. You made almost as much as I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing. I'm going to need plenty of outfits for this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two walked out into the parking lot, and found Eddie waiting for them. \"Hi. Your mom told me where you'd be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica cleared her throat. \"I'll be in the car.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jessica walked off, Emily asked, \"So, what's on your mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came to apologize. When Steve came by, he wouldn't shut up about all the girls he was dating in college. I wanted to shut him up, so I decided to use your picture to show him up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't seem like it worked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie shook his head. \"And I forgot that the operative word in my plan was <i>use</i>. I should have asked before I did anything. I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apology accepted.\" Emily grinned. \"How do you think Steve would react if you told him you were dating a stripper?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you'd be okay with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only real issue was you didn't ask permission. Now, you have it.\" Emily waved for Jessica to leave without her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily, I don't know how to thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was our first fight. Want to see if make-up sex is as good as they say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went back to Emily's home and humped like jackrabbits. When he was spent, Eddie said, \"I don't think I can make the walk back to my place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's another room on this floor. You can sleep in there, and not worry about who you wake up with. Besides, you can pick up the clothes Ethan borrowed.\"</span></div></div>",

He remembered everything about the club and dancing and the amazing sex with Eddie but for some reason the rest of his day was hard to remember. In fact a lot of days recently seemed a bit harder to remember....His nights as Emily were as clear as ever but his normal days seemed hazy.

Your condition is mutating....The pills you take had an unintended side effect I've not seen before. I believe all the sexual contact and situation with Jessica escalated things but seeing Emily now her body was never meant to become that over  sexualized. Because of how extreme her changes have been Im afraid things have escalated and now they are reaching into your life. Basically Emily is slowly taking over your body and mind son. It starts with your mind and memory. At first it gets harder and harder to remember your normal life, while at nights Emily's sexual desires and needs grow and grow. Then it affects your body. Soon every morning a piece of your body with remain changed until your remain Emily forever and don't even remember being a guy....\" His mom said in a very serious tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what can we do? Can't I just stop taking the pill?\" Ehan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid we are well beyond that point....Emily's body has adapted to the pill stoping it now would only make things worse by risking pregnancy. I'm afraid there is only one option and yiu are not going to like it....you can either give up and give in.....or you can give this to someone else....\" She said holding up a large purple pill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Ethan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something I hoped never to see again.....Its a very unique pill this is the last one in the world in fact. What it does is allow the someone with our unique chromosome to give away condition to someone else.....it was used in the past to \"cure\" people like us by giving away our condition to someone else through sexual intercourse. However when this was quickly abused the pills were destroyed and only a few survived. Normally this could be used to remove Emily completely but since she had gotten so strong it will only get rid half of her. If you take this and have sex with someone that person will given your condition and have to go through all the same trials as you forever. However it will also remove all the excess strength from Emily and restore the balance between you two once more and preventing her from taking you over. I'm giving this pill and choice to you under one rule....if you chose to take this pill and use it the man you chose but be fully aware of the choice he is making.....You cannot seduce some random guy and infect him with your condition. This pill only works if your partner is male so don't try anything with girls. If you chose to do this you just chose quickly, by my guess your probably only have about a week left before Emily takes full control.\" His mom said as she finished explaining everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan took the pill in hand and kept it safe. He knew he could let Emily turn into a full bimbo and take hold of him, yet he had no idea who he could ever pass his condition onto willingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to call up Jessixa they made plans for her to come over before dark than after dark take Emily out shopping for more outfits. He wanted to explain things as Ethan cause he knew once Emily showed up she would be more and more driven by sexual desire.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's why I asked you to come over early. Sit down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica sat on the bed, and Ethan took the chair. \"I'm having severe side effects with the pills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How bad is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily wasn't supposed to be so hyper-sexualized. And my memories as Ethan are getting foggy. Mom says I've got a week before I start becoming Emily full-time, and forget all about Ethan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Ethan, I'm so sorry.\" She hugged him. \"Is there anything I can do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to ask you some stuff, while I'm still me. See, there's only two ways to stop what's happening. One is for Emily to get pregnant now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the other?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan showed Jessica the large pill. \"Emily's got to give this pill to a guy, then have sex with him. When she does, her body will go back down to normal, and my memories will return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a no-brainer. Give the pill to Eddie, Emily fucks him, win-win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that simple. See, the way the pill works is, whichever guy Emily sleeps with gets my condition, and turns into a woman at night. So I can't just spring that on a guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, if you don't give Eddie the pill, then Ethan won't exist anymore. But, if you do give him the pill, bye-bye to Emily's first love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. I need you to know all this, because I don't know if Emily will be able to restrain herself long enough to explain all this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica nodded. \"You need me to tell Eddie all this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In case Emily can't or won't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see what I can do. Where's Eddie going to be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll be at the club. He wants to see Emily dance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see if I can get his table, then. The sun's pretty low. Better take your pill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan took the pill, then waited out the change. It took far less time than it had the first time, an indication of how strong Emily was becoming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily opened her eyes. \"What's next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We get new clothes,\" Jessica replied. \"Then we go to the club. Let's see how your second night goes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching Emily walk, Jessica had mixed feelings. She liked hanging out with Emily, but the prospect of losing Ethan forever terrified her. As was becoming her habit, she cursed the day she took that pill.</span></div></div>",

Jessica went with an all black one while Emily picked out an all white one. They decided to go with a Yin and Yang theme and dance together tonight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how are you going to tell Eddie about your situation? I mean you're not gonna ask him to take that pill are you?\" Jessica asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I'm not! I'm only gonna tell him that in a week he gets to have me full time! Ethan has done nothing but hold me back so it's time for him to go away....\" Emily said with a smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica couldn't believe her ears. Emily was sounding so different lately. Before she could always see Ethan behind her eyes but now it felt like she was a totally different person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to forget about Ethan completely? it will be like he was never born!\" Jessica said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly! Deep down I know Ethan wants to be me full time, if he vanishes as a side effect then it's just that much less guilt for him to have.\" Emily said as they walked into the club together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce at the club there was a lot of attention on both of them but Jessica knew she had to earn Eddie. Her new body made it very difficult to concentrate as her sexual instincts were kicking in. After a few minutes she finally found him as she pulled him towards one of the private rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen you need to be careful!\" Jessica told Eddie who looked very confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Eddie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something is wrong with Emily. Ethan told me earlier. I don't know how to describe it but she is taking over his body fully. Within a week Ethan will be gone and Emily will have no memory of him ever! The only way to reverse it is by having a guy take a very special pill right before having sex with her. That will transfer her condition into him and return her to normal, but at the cost of the man becoming like her.\" Jessica explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god is Emily going to plan to ask me to do that?\" Eddie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No she wants the opposite! Emily is still changing.....her mind and actions are becoming more like her body! I'm afraid she will soon be a total blonde bimbo in both mind and body! She wants to take over fully so she can have full control.\" Jessica said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't sound like the Emily I know....I should talk with her.\" Eddie said leaving the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eddie left the room he saw what he feared most. Emily was on stage her top off completely as she showed off her huge tits to the whole crowd as they tossed money at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then Eddie realized something.....this was not he Emily he fell in love with. He remembered what she looked like before. Beautiful, busty, shy, but also honest and kind. This Emily was some kind of sexual monster now....He needed to find a way to bring her back to normal....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left the club shortly afterwards not even saying hello to Emily. However at this point she was so far gone she didn't even seem to notice as she collected hundreds of dollars in tips that night....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen morning came for Ethan he awoke with a splitting headache....his head was pounding and his memories of last night and even the last few months seemed really hazy....It seemed like for now that Emily and Ethan he total seperate personalities and wouldn't share memories together. Waking up slowly Ethan looked into the mirror and saw his fears were confirmed. His hair was now platinum blonde! His body hair had also vanished as well. He knew at this rate he wasn't going to last long. Sitting around he decided he was going to need to come up with a plan if he was going to stick around.</span></div></div>",

However lastly his changes had been getting more and more violent and intense. Before they were nearly transitions from one fork to another. Now it felt like Emily was taking part of his soul away every time. After several agonizing minutes Ethan vanished both body and mind as the new Bimbofied Emily emerged and took over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night at the Club Emily was the star attraction. Jessica hadn't even bothered to show up but Emily didn't seem to even notice or care anymore. She was in love with the stage and all the attention from men she was getting. After taking in some huge tips Emily was brought over to the VIP tables where a very rich looking man in a suit gave her $ 1,000 for a private dance and for her company the rest of the night. Emily liked him at first sight, he was a bit older, maybe mid 30's obviously well off, and he treated her like a princess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't told me your name Cuite.\" Emily said tracing her nails along his cheek and jawline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Jack, Jack Morrison. Of Morrison Engineering, ever heard of us?\" He said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No but it sounds fancy!\" Emily said getting hot and heavy with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we do all sorts of things but mostly focus of pharmisuticals and chemical engineering.\" He said not expecting her to understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! So...you are like the boss?\" Emily said no really knowing or caring all she knew was that he was rich and handsome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes....very much so...why don't I show you more around here?\" He said pointing behind the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily figured out what he wanted as she grinned and took him around back. While Outside it took only a second before the two were wrapped around eachother as Jack quickly pushed her up against a wall. She was only wearing a tiny mini skirt and tank top so they were quickly discarded as she was quickly getting pounded by Jack as he thrusters himself deeply inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily loved every second of their screwing. He was big, fast, and very in control. After they finished Jack looked to her satisfied as he offered her a big tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Emily was back inside the club Jac pulled out his phone as he made a call....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes....I have very pleased with the final product. I think she will do nicely. Make the preparations to have her ready by tomorrow night.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the Night Emily made a lot of cash and hurried home before passing out happy with her night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen morning came Ethan woke up sore and groggy as he stumbled out of bed to use the restroom. He was about to do his business when he noticed something....his member had shrunk over half its size! It was tiny now and to make matters worse the small buds in his chest had grown to decent sized breasts! Probably about a b cup now they hung from him as his hair was also touching his shoulders. On top of all this to make matters worse he could feel something different about him. He could feel Emily's sexual desires, the thoughts and desires she had were starting to creep over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalling his parents in he needed to show them as they entered but with a very different look on their face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to be progressing nicely....\" His father said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I have her an extra dose last night so by tonight everything should be ready for her.\" His mother commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan looked stunned. His parents looked happy as his mom spoke up. \"Son it's time we talked....\"</span></div></div>",

Those pills aren't birth control at all. They are concentrated hormones that stimulate your extra chromosome making it stronger and stronger. That's why you have changed so much. You see the thing is we were forced to make a deal I order to secure our family's future. The truth is people with our condition are unfortunately unable to reproduce naturally....due to the nature of our changes people like you and me couldn't normally Cary a child to term ever due to changing back to a male every morning would kill any fetus in us, and since it takes weeks for an egg to even get fertilized, we could never even get pregnant to begin with.\" His mom explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That didn't stop your mother and I from falling In love  however. We tried everything and reached out to everyone for help. We wanted a normal family same as anyone. It wasn't until the Morrison Drug company took our case did we finally have progress. They were able to synthesize a drug that allowed her to change permanatly. Then along with  fertility boosters we managed to finally get pregnant. However there was a price to be paid. Part of the contract we signed said if we ever did successfully conceive a child and it happened to be a male with the same condition. Upon the time of their changing we would have to cooperate to test their new drugs on them or be exposed publicly and have her treatment reversed. So those pills we gave you were under their instructions.\" His dad said tears in his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see tho it's all for the best! They finally told us their plan! When Jack Morrison himself saw how well their treatment had worked he decided he wanted the perfect wife so he decided to take Emily as his new bride! Emily will become his and then she can have the fertility treatment to have kids! We want a grandchild one day and without Morrison's treatment you would be stuck in this gender limbo forever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I am just supposed to be some rich guys trophy wife! His vision of a perfect woman that he can have whenever he wants? You turned me into some kind of Bimbo Slave! I'll never forgive you! Besides you are too late Eddie agreed to take the pill he is going to save me!\" Ethan cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid we can't allow that Ethan....That's why lied and said you had a week left. In reality you have less than 24 hours....your body is already changing and by nightfall tonight you will be fully changed into Emily forever. You will not even remember this conversation. You will only know your burning desires as Emily along with a new desire to become the perfect arm candy for Mr. Morrison....this whole talk is just for us to clear our heads of doubt and guilt. In a few hours you won't even care. That's why we have to do this.....\" His parents suddenly said as they slammed the door shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan rushed over to try and open it but he heard them pushing a large dresser in front of the door to block it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think about making any calls either we took your phone last night....just sit there and enjoy your last day as a male.....I'm sorry son we love you but this is for the good of our family....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan struggled with all his might but he couldn't get the door open....Going to the Windows he saw they too had been sealed shut. Even if he could open them the two story drop along would most likely break his legs.....he was stuck in Enily's room like a prisoner....his phone and only means to communicate taken from him.....he had to get out! He had to reach Eddie and Jessica for help!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPacing around he tried to think of a plan as a tight pain hit his body...collapsing on his hands and knees he felt a pressure building up in his rear as his butt was swelling out slowly taking in a more feminine form.... He also felt a burning desire in him for a man,  specifically for Jack....he knew his parents were kidding now. By sundown he would be gone in both mind and body had had to do something quick, every second he wasted brought him that much closer to losing himself.</span></div></div>",

For what it's worth, I miss the old Emily, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sunset brought the transformation as usual. When it was finished, Jessica asked, \"How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stronger.

Remember that girl I felt up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was Ethan, and he caught hell for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" She lifted her hand. \"It was this hand that did it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so, Emily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me Tyffani from now on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Tyffani.\" <i>That way,</i> Jessica thought, <i>I won't need to think of you when I look at Emily.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night at the club went much as the night before. Tyffani was a wild child on the stage, and she was totally unrestrained with the customers. She got reprimanded by Mike for doing a lap dance while someone else was on stage. She didn't seem to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter closing, she asked Jessica, \"Have you seen Eddie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not since a couple nights ago.

Tyffani, because she wanted sex, and Jessica, because it meant Tyffani would go away forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Ethan awoke, and walked to the mirror to check himself out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hair was longer, coming down past his ears. His breasts were more defined, his ass was bigger, and he had the beginnings of an hourglass figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picked up the phone and called Eddie. \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eddie, it's me.\" Ethan winced at his voice, which was higher than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Ethan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ethan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or what's left of me.\" He swallowed. \"I think maybe we'd better do it tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I'll be at the club at closing, like the other night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" As Ethan hung up, he realized that he felt sexually aroused by the thought of sex with Eddie. He felt it, but there were no outward signs, as his member seemed no longer to respond.</span></div></div>",

It was his mom with a worried look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey there is something you need to know.....I know your plan tonight but I have to warn you of something. Even if you succeed and Tyffani is destroyed and you regain control over yourself as Emily you won't regain the body you once had....You will regain control over your mind and emotions but your body has changed far too much and adapted to the pills to well at this point to ever go back....Your condition will stabilize and you will be back to changing normally at night again, but the highly over sexualized body if Emily with remain.\" His mom told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan loomed a bit disappointed but not undeterred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine....I can live with the body of a busty bimbo as long as my emotions and feelings are my own. I just hope Eddie can live with having the same condition as me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is his choice to make.\" Mom said kissing his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes there was a knock on the door as came in. He was wearing the sexiest thing Emily ever liked. A tight black t shirt and jeans. Simple yet showed off his nice body. He needed to make sure Tyffani wanted him. Heading upstairs he saw what Ethan looked like now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god....\" Was all he could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I know....listen thanks for coming over a bit early. This could be our last time seeing eachother if things don't go well so I just wanted to say that you have always been a great friend and I Know Emily loves you.\" Ethan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie nodded with a tear in his eye. \"Then let's bring her back tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember Tyffani might suspect something. Don't rush things too quickly, take her out m, treat her like normal.....However if things go wrong.  Do whatever you have to.....Even if she can't stop it....or isn't fully conscious.....\" Ethan said with a serious look l.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie knew what he meant as he gulped not sure if he could ever do that to some one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen Eddie there is something else even if we succeed Emily's body will still.......Aaaaaahhhhh!\" Ethan cried out falling to his hands and knees. He grabbed his pill popping it quickly before rolling onto his back rolling around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis change was unlike any other he had ever felt. The pain was massive and intense but it was also combined with a pleasure so great he was moaning at the same time.....Tyffani was taking over and her body was changing to finally reach 100% sexualized potential.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts grew to an even larger size than before and reshaped again becoming perfectly round and perky mountains of flesh that would make a porn start jealous. Her butt grew a bit more taking on the perfect heart shape as her legs grew even more defined like were made for high heels and dancing. Her grew even brighter and more platinum as it looked almost pearl white and even seemed to shine like pure silver in the sunlight. It grew longer cascading down to her ankles the tips almost touching the ground yet remaining perfectly smooth. Her skin took on a nicer shade of tan like she hit a rankin bed every day as her nails grew a bit longer and glossy. Her lips grew a bit more plump as her features more refined. Her abs grew more toned as her body finally finished changing as Tyfanny let out a loud cry of pleasure as her eyes suddenly changes color to a dark Jade green color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm free! I'm finally free! That stupid boy is finally gone for good! No more Ethan, no more Emily, just Tyffani! \" she called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to see Eddie standing there as she licked her lips. \"So....what do think of the new me? Am I perfect or what?\" She said twirling around as her long hair twirled around her perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie took a deep breath and remembered his mission. If he forgot to take his pill or let on to something this could be Tyfanni forever.</span></div></div>",

He stopped only long enough to grab something to drink out of the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were both in Emily's room, Tyffani began to take Eddie's clothes off. Eddie retrieved the pill from his pocket beforehand. Once she had him naked, she began removing her own clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie took the pill and washed it down with the cola, trying to make it look casual. However, she must have seen something. \"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something a friend gave me,\" he replied. \"Supposed to prolong erections.\" He wasn't sure she would buy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as soon as the pill hit his stomach, however, he developed a massive hard-on. It felt as if it might erupt at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Tyffani saw his situation, she drooled with lust, and threw herself onto him, guiding his missile right to her vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was inside her, the feeling of impending climax diminished, and he carried her to the bed, thrusting his manhood into her all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they climaxed, he expected to need to pull his flaccid member out of her. However, it stayed hard, and he felt his arousal had not diminished even slightly. \"That friend wasn't kidding,\" Tyffani said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie figured he and Tyffani had experienced five orgasms. When she finally showed signs of exhaustion, his penis finally went limp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she closed her eyes, he tucked her in. It might have been his imagination, but he thought he saw a glimmer of Emily's smile on her lips. He walked to Ethan's room and fell asleep for what he knew would be the last time as a man.</span></div></div>",

The chest was flat and muscular, with some hair. Heaving a sigh of relief, Ethan opened his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was himself again. He was not yet a woman forever. That would wait until the right man had been found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat brought his mind to Eddie. He got out of bed, walked to his room, and knocked. \"It's open,\" called Eddie from inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan opened the door and went in. \"Looks like it worked,\" Eddie said. \"You look like your old self.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel like my old self.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be good to see Emily's face again tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About that.\" Ethan swallowed. \"Mom told me that, even if our plan worked, that hyper-sexualized body is here to stay. I'll still be the Emily we know and love, but I'll have that body for good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie was silent for a moment. \"At least it's Emily's personality. By the way, what all can I expect, from tonight until whenever?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The change starts with a pain in your lower abdomen. That's your uterus forming. It ends with your genitals changing from male to female. Between those times, the change varies at random. Also, if we get PMS, it'll affect us whether we're female or male.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will your mom hook me up with those pills?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so. You also picked up my sensitivity, so, if you took the pills, you'd go through the same things I just did, and you'd have even fewer options for someone to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so. Anything else I should know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure Mom's willing to talk to you over breakfast.\"</span></div></div>",

She told Eddie he would need to get on the ASAP to avoid pregnancy and that any normal pill would work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie looked a little stunned only now did he realize what he had signed up for. What upset him most was the idea that he wouldn't get to see Emily anymore and that he would probably start developing feelings for men just like Ethan did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan felt the same way. He knew Emily and Eddie were meant to be together but Tyffanni threw a wrench into that plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast before they got up Mom had something else to add. Pulling out a small vial she showed a small black pill inside:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is it.....the last pill I will ever show you, and the last one I will ever offer....However this one is for you Eddie. I will offer it only as a choice for you. If you take this it will reverse your change order. Instead of changing nightly you will change every morning at sunrise, then turn back at nightfall. If you choose this path you can still see eachother the way you have but you will never see eachother as the same sex again. Your friendship as boys will be over, you will only ever see eachother as man and woman depending on the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie took the pill and thanked her. \" I will think about it thank you.\" He said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie agreed to come over tonight so they could change together and talk. After he left Ethan wanted a few words alone with his mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is am there anything else I need to know about my changes it Eddie's?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well for you just expect your body to be more sensitive and to have a higher sex drive than before. You should be in control again but yor body and its urges will remain. Also your change isn't going to be an easy process again for awhile. You don't remember from last night but expect a slower more intense change that will be a mix of the most intense pain and incredible pleasure you have ever felt....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Eddie he will most likely have a change similar to yours since the transfer always gives some traits from host. Expect him to have large breasts and a very sexy frame, but just not as extreme as yours. Other than that just keep an eye out for any accidently day changes. If you start thinking and  fantasizing too much about girly things during the day you might accidently trigger a partial or even full change randomly. Just remember to keep your emotions in check.\" She explained to him <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day Ethan spent preparing for that night. Eddie texted him a picture of what Tyffani looked like last night so he could prepare for the change. Ethan was a bit taken back by just how sexy and over the top the changes had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hair looked like shining white silk that touches her ankles, her breasts were two huge perfectly round globes and her butt a perfect heart shape. Her figure was a pure hourglass and her skin perfectly smoothed and tanned a beautiful bronze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you win Tyffani....That is about as sexy as someone can become. However I will own that body be my own woman and live a good life not under your mindless sex driven control....\" He thought to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wrote down a list of things he and Eddie would need once they changed. On top the list was decent clothes and underwear. Tyffani had seen to making all the clothes in Emily's room replaced with nothing but sexy revealing outfiits. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then, once we change, we need to go clothes shopping. Tyffani went in for more extreme clothes than I care for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you mean 'than Emily cares for'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't. I feel like... I think maybe trying to separate myself from Emily helped to create Tyffani. I'm Emily, and she's me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose so. Besides, Tyffani's clothes were too big for you, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not anymore. Mom says that Tyffani's body will be the one I change into from now on. But Tyffani's personality should be gone for good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's some good news. Let me know if you decide you don't want to work at the club anymore, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica left as Eddie arrived. \"What were you two talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just updating her. How was your day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. What do you think of me calling myself Elise? You know, after I change?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how do you usually prepare for it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I go into the appropriate bedroom, take off my clothes, take the pill, and wait. Will you be okay with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie shrugged. \"I guess seeing you naked once won't kill me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sun set, the change gripped them both. As his mother had predicted, the transformation was far more intense than he'd remembered. He ran his hands over his growing breasts, enjoying the sensation. He marveled as his skin tanned. Finally, his member shriveled as a vagina grew inside, and Emily opened her eyes after a long absence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt a little disappointment at how her body had changed under Tyffani. She absolutely hated her floor-length hair, and it took her a while to balance due to her larger breasts and butt. One positive greeted her from the mirror: Her eyes were her own, rather than the jade green of Tyffani's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was intense,\" said a new voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily turned to see Elise getting her bearings. \"How do you feel, girlfriend?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's going to take some getting used to. I think I'll give this a week before I make up my mind about the black pill.\" She examined her new figure. \"Yowza. If I were still a guy, I'd never be able to take my eyes off of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK,\" Emily said, \"let's see if we can find anything for us to wear. Tyffani did a hell of a job filling the wardrobe to her tastes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey finally found some clothes that they didn't feel too uncomfortable going out in, then headed out for new stuff.</span></div></div>",

She obviously inherited some of Tyfaani's heightened sexual attributes. She had very large but thankfully natural looking breasts, long dark brunette hair, and a sexy hourglass shape. Any other day and she would have been the perfect woman for Eddie or Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter trying to find something reasonable to wear the only things they could find were two mini dresses that fit without  showing too much. Tyfanni only seemed to wear heels so they each picked the most reasonable pair they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile at the mall Elise had a very natural sexy walk with her hips swaying side to side. She didn't even trip in her heels even one time......in fact she seemed to walk like a natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to be adapting well. I'm surprised it was super awkward for me to learn to walk like this.\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it weird....I can't explain it but this body just seems to know how to walk in heels.\" Elise said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first stop was a makeover for both girls. Emily had her hair and nails trimmed down to a more manageable level while Eliae got her first mani-peti.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext they went bra shopping so Elise could get sized up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"36DD....not bad....\" Emily said teasing her once they had found out her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least these are still natural miss huge fake hooters.....\" Eliae said teasing her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily sighed a bit looking at her huge breasts in the mirror. They were perfectly round with no sag but also huge F-cups now that looked like porn start breasts. While Tyffani was gone her final curse was still very well felt by Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext they went clothes shopping getting much more normal outfits. Pants, skirts, tops, dresses, etc. Luckily one kf the perks of being Tuffani was she had tons of cash from her stripping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So have you thought about work? Are you still gonna work at the strip club? I was thinking cause I might be able to now too....\" Eliae said a bit shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno....I'm afraid if I do I might start to become more like Tyffani again....however I do need the money.....\" Emily said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring their shopping trip Emily noticed a few more odd things about Elise. Her hands were almost never still like she was trying to fight off something. A few times while trying on clothes Emily noticed she was groping her breasts and touching her slit hoping Emily wouldn't notice.....While they were eating in the food court she noticed she was squeezing her crossed legs together tightly and her eyes seemed to not only be focusing on her but also random guys walking by....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah:...well....I dunno....it's like....I can still think and remember my male mind and just looking at your amazing and sexy body or my own seems to turn me on.....but also there are these new feelings and urges I can't explain that make me think about guys too....\" Eliae said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand your body has natural urges and a heightened sexual sensitivity. It will take some time to adjust.\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter shopping Elise went home spend some time alone adjusting to her new form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily went home as well and saw Jessica's car parked out front.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking inside eEmily didn't see her but his mom was waiting in the living room....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom could only shake her head.....\"I told her not to do it.....I told her it was a bad idea....its heat for you to just see....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping Emily walked upstairs and saw Jessica sitting on his bed.....or at least he thought it was Jessica....her body looked nothing like it did....not even before her change. All sexiness was gone.....her hair was boy short and a pasty brown. Her skin was pasty white and freckled just like she was as a kid. She was paper thin and her boobs were flat as a board as was her butt.....she looked more like a 12 year old boy than a girl she sat on the bed tears rolling down her cheeks wearing a blouse and yoga pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica....what the hell happened? You....look.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UGLY! I know.....worse than ever....it's all my fault....I found a drug from a company that used to compete with the one who made your pills which turned me into that hyper sex doll. It was a reverse drug that was supposed to suppress sexuality. I was just so tired of being so horny and soo sexy all the time.....I asked your mom if I should take it and she strongly was against. There was no telling the side effects or how the drugs would mix..... She said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily felt terrible for her. Even before her change Jessica was always a pretty girl. However now she looked like the kind of flat skinny twig that boys would laugh at behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came over to see if your mom could help she told me no....and what's worse she gave me even more bad news....she said based on the change reverse severity the drug most likely didn't reverse some of my sexuality it mearly  split it.....\" Jessica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?\" Emily asked holding her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means I could change back into that hyper sex doll at any moment! However it would be even worse than before I would be sexier and more lustful than ever, totally out of control. Like Tyffani but worse. She said I could change back and forth randomly with no pattern at all.....I'm terrified....once again I made the wrong choice and it backfired. Jessica said crying into Emily's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily held her and patted her back.....Now both of her friends were going through a difficult struggle And she knew it was going to be a challenge to help them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding Jessica Emily decided to....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Emily decided to stay with Jessica at least until she fell asleep. Since they had no idea when she would even change they figured it was best to just relax and not think of anything sexual that might trigger something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica put a plain white t shirt with no bra since she barely needed one anymore with her flat chest. She also wore baggy sweats to relax in. Emily decided to change too putting on some borrowed yoga pants and t shirt with a hoody over it, to help hide her breasts. This way there were no sexual distractions anywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls spend the next two hours just talking and watching netflix, doing just about anything to distract themselves. Jessica kept looking at her hands and face in the mirror every few minutes both terrified and horrified at her own appearence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter awhile things seemed to be okay. The girls fell into their rythem and began joking and laughing and acting like three young women should be. Emily got up to get a drink as she turned back to Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jess you want anything?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica looked over and nodded. \"Yeah, can you get me a nice hard cock to fuck?\" She said....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a sudden pause and silence as Amber and Emily looked back to Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm....What?\" Emily said as Jessixa looked embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm....sorry.....I don't know why I Said that....Yes can you get me a bottle of water.......then let me suck on those huge tits?\" Jessica said covering her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two girls grew a bit worried as Jessica stood up covering her mouth. \"I'm....okay....I promise....I just need the restroom.\" She said storming out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily and Amber took a deep breath. Maybe it was just a fluke:...After a few minutes they heard noise coming from the bathroom, it sounded like Jessica cursing....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit.....shit......shit.....please stop growing please stop.......\" Is what they heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even asking for permission the two girls decided to intervene as they forced open the door and saw what they feared. Jessica was in tears with a pair of scissors in her hand and pool of hair around her face and the floor......her normal short boy length hair had started growing rapidly cascading down her shoulders and she was desperate to cut it off. However every time she cut it, it only grew back longer and faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please....help....it won't stop growing....\" Jessica said crying as Enily rushed over to help her as Amber took away the scissors to protect her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking her out of the bathroon they needed to come up with a plan and fast! Jessica's hair continued to grow until it almost touched the ground. Next the pasty brown color began to darken at the roots turning a dark jet black color that started spreading downward. It looked like ink was being poured over her as her now long silky smooth locked turned a dark sheen Raven black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica looked terrified as she pointed to her bedroom. \"Please take me there.....So I can fuck both of you sluts!\" She said covering her mouth with her hands again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should just lock her in her bedroom?\" Emily said as Amber nodded. Rushing over the two girls reached over to grab Jessica but she suddenly pushed them off as Emily and Amber were surprised by how strong she was....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please....just leave me....if this is contagious I can't let it spread to you.\" Jessica said still fighting for control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are your friends we wouldn't do that....\" Amber said as she took Jessica's hand. Walking slowly they tried to make it to her room but Jessica suddenly cried out gripping her sides in pain. Falling over onto her back she began ripping off her clothes, tearing at them.  Reaching over to try and stop her Emily and Amber each grabbed one of her hands to pin them down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily was barely able to hold onto Jessica's arm her skin was hot and fiery to the touch. Jessica's strength was also not normal....something was making her way stronger as she pushed Emily off her and suddenly swiped a hand at Amber who winced in pain as she saw she was now bleeding....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at her hands. Jessica's eyes went wider with fear. Her nails had turned jet black like her hair but also grown longer and sharper. They weren't the normal square tipped points but now sharp triangler tips....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRipping off her clothes Jessica's eyes were flashing colors....between her normal pale blue and a bright yellow....whenever they flashed yellow she said something sexual against her will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily and Amber were running out of options. With her increased strength they couldn't move her,  Plus Amber was bleeding from the scratch and she needed a bandage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily told Amber to take care of her arm while she dealt with Jessica. She might not be able to stop the change but she could help her through it. Kneeling down she held her tightly as her body was convulsing as it began to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer skin turned a nice deep tan, and became perfectly smooth. Her figure started filling out with soft womanly flesh as her legs grew longer and her hips widened out. Her butt became toned and firm, her stomach flat and toned. Next her flat breasts began to expand. They grew in quick rapid waves growing larger and larger as every wave hit Jessica like an orgasm as she cried out as her breasts began larger but also rounder, perkier, and much more sensitive. They were even bigger and nicer than Emily's when they finally finished. Lastly her face reshaped as her lips plumps and her features refined as Jessica let out one last cry of both pain as pleasure as her eyes changed yellow again but this time stayed that way.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few minutes for her to stand up but Emily knew the sex goddess of a woman that stood in front of her was no longer her old friend Jessica, but something else....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up the new Jessica walked over to a mirror as looked at her body. Everything about her screamed sexuality. From how her hips swayed with every step. To how she naturally walked on the balls of her feet like she was in high heels....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica....?\" Amber said coming out of the bathroom having just bandaged her Arm seeing her new form a bit stunned and taken back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at her she shook her head. \"I'm sorry girls Jessica is gone....only Raven here now and Im ready to play....so who wants to go first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber and Emily both gulped a bit not sure how to react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well actually....I.....should be leaving....Emily said slowly waking to the door. Emily had never felt fear like this before. However she could see the dark intentions behind those almost glowing yellow eyes.....Raven needed release and would get it any way she could.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking her lips gently she slowly walked over to both the girls as she suddenly made a lightning fast move and grabbed both of the girls and pushed them against a wall together holding each with one hand....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now.....here is what's going to happen. You two are going to change into the sluttiest outfits we can find, then we are all going out to the club together to find the best men we can for an amazing orgy with all of us together.....Or....you two can be my private harem girls for the night and spend the rest of the night pleasing me in whatever way I desire.....what's it going to be?\" She said whispering in a dark yet still sexy tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily and Amber looked back to eachother, they had to choose to either go out and expose Raven to more innocents who unknown conciquinces, or stay inside with her all night doing all manner of sexual things with her.</span></div></div>",

Raven was becoming Jessica again.

Just a twisted sexual monster....Wirst of all she spread her curse to their friend Amber, God knows what she looked like now....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRacing home Emily rushed inside, her clothing ripped and torn and her arms and neck covered in bruises....The increased strength from Jessica was no joke...When she got home in tears her mother was waiting for her holding what looked like a really old book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom! Jessica turned into some kind of sexual monster! She had claws and super strength! We have to help her!\" Emily cried out....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom looked to her examining her body for a moment. \"What about her hair? Did it touch the floor or move on its own?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh.....it didn't quite touch the floor or move different why does that matter?\" Emily asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother sighed a bit with relief and sat down. \"Thank god she is barely in stage two there is still time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily looked confused as her Kim took her hand and opened the really old book for her. She turned to a page with had a picture of very strange woman. She looked like a queen of some kind, but also like a demon. She had blood red skin, long curled horns, long claws on her hands and feet and fangs. She also had jet black hair that was so long it looked like a Rapunzel fairy tail gone bad. It had to be ten feet long as it wrapped around the floor at the queens feet, what was weird was that in the picture there were what looked like servants all being held and strangled by the hair. Like it was living and moving on its own.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom who is that?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is our ancestor....the first woman born with the Z chromosome. There is something I haven't told you about the Z chromosome.....Ita not a genetic mutation.....Its a virus....A rare ancient virus passed down between family members. However like all viruses it evolves over time and spreads though other means....The picture you are looking at is the natural state of the virus and the eventual form to which Jessica is doomed unless we can help her.....While the true history of the Z chromosome is unknown all we know for sure is that hundreds of years ago in some kingdom long forgotten there was a boy who dreamed of being Royal. However he was born a slave and knew only servitude. The story goes one day he saw a beautiful rich woman being adored coming through his village and he begged for even a taste of that life. Now the truth here is unclear but the story says the slave was visited by a stranger who offered him the chance he desired. However the stranger was a demon in disguise and tricked the slave into selling away his soul. The demon granted the slaves wish but not the way he wanted. He was turned into a beautiful woman. Everyone loved and adored her beauty and eventually a prince found her and offered to make her his bride. The former slave had everything he wanted but no matter how much beauty, sex, or money she got it was never enough. Eventually her body began to change to reflect her dark desires....she was twisted in form until she became the monster you saw in the picture. She killed her husband and becam queen and he a harem of men and women to fulfill her never ending lust. It wasn't until her own som disgusted at what his mother had become rose up against her and slew her in combat. With her last breath the demon mother cursed her son to have his own heirs fall victim to their list and greed the same way she did......Since that story people like us started to appear....\" His mother explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this condition is actually some ancient curse passed down through the ages?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know for sure....that's just an old story the details could never be verified. All we know for sure is that what we call the Z chromosome is a rare virus that changes its victims gender and enhances their sexuality until.....until they reach the final 3 stage process. You have already experienced stage one....Tyffani.... Your pill reaction was far too strong....this is my fault. Normally the pills give a minor sexual boost but prevent the stage process from taking place. Your reaction was much stronger and it actually pushed you into the first stage. In the first stage the victim's body becomes hyper sexualized and a new sexual driven personality starts to take hold. In stage two the victim takes on the first monster traits including claws, fangs, maybe even horns or a tail. Finally if he victim hits stage three they become....well....its bad....that picture only gives a piece of the puzzle. When j saw you were entering stage one I made sure to do the things necessary to prevent it from spreading. We came close had we not stopped Tyffani you would be just like Jessixa is now but all the time....Jessica's experiment somehow took all her sexuality and split it.....now one side of her is normal but with no sexuality, the other is nothing but sexuality....if we don't stop her before she hits stage three then she could start spreading the virus to anyone she has sex with. Right now she can only spread it to those she bites or scratches then offers themselves willingly, but those she spreads it too cannot spread it yet themselves, however if she hits stage three all bets are off....\" Mother explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily listened. \"How long does it take to reach stage three?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally only a few days.....However due to Jessica's situation it is spreading slower so maybe a week or so....which is good because I will have to leave he country to find the cure. There is only one place I know of to find it and it will take me a week to get there and come back. In the mean time you have to take care of Jessica......right now her other side is simply driven by desire, do whatever it takes to keep her from spreading the virus. You are immune because you are the source. However others and especially Elise could fall victim if not careful. When I return we will help her, but until then you must protect her both as Ethan and Emily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily agreed as she collapsed that night and fell asleep. In the morning Ethan awoke sore and still covered in bruises. He slowly got ready and went over to Jessica's he pounded on the door as he saw her answer the door in her normal non sexual form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...Ethan...how's it going? She said rubbing her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good...well....how are you?\" Ethan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine....just a headache. How was last night? Was it bad? All I remember is us talking then nothing....Amber was gone when I woke up this morning.\" Jessixa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan realized she didn't remember anything of her change. Should he lie to her and spare her the truth of the monster inside her, or come clean and tell her just how bad she was....</span></div></div>",

I'm on my way to the mall to get some more clothes for Elise you wanna join?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Jessica and Amber both of them with worried looks he decided it would be best to bring them along so he could keep an eye out. Plus they needed clothes to better accommodate their situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I'll bring Jessica around too and her friend.\" Ethan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen I will meet up with you guys I need to figure some thing out....\"Amber said grabbing a jacket to cover herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay but if you start to feel strange at all call us pleas.\" Ethan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica out on a plain white t shirt and jeans with sneakers as they went out to the mall to meet up with Eddie. The whole time Jessica would look at her hands or check herself nervous she might change at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen you need to relax, stress probably doesn't help.\" Ethan said trying to reassure her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived at the mall Eddie was a bit shocked to see Jessica's new ugly form. Her short hair and skinny frame with no boobs was a bit much for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow....Jessica what happened?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long story....\" Jessica said looking down ashamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next couple hours the three friends caught up on each other's current situations. It was a bit much for everyone to take in as each seemed to be facing their own challenges. However they agreed the curse on Jessica was top priority. Ethan also made sureEddie agreed not to tell her the full truth to help spare her feeling ms, because they feared what Jessica might do if she learned just how monstrous her change was....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey spent the rest of the day together without incident which made them feel great. They almost forgot the sun was starting to set so Ethan and Eddie would need to find a place to change. They agreed to head back to Jessica's for now since her place was empty. They hadn't heard anything from Amber all day which made Ethan bit worried. As they were heading out of the mall Jessica suddenly stumbled and tripped as Eddie barely caught her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa there..You okay?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm sorry don't know why.\" She said walking as she was only able to take a few steps before tripping again....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey say down on a bench as Jessica was rubbing her feet through her sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's weird my its like my feet keep trying to force me to stand upright like I would in high heels. I don't understand why......\" Her sentence was suddenly cut off by a loud ripping  noise coming from her shoes......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down Jessica saw long sharp black nails sticking out of the end of her shoes as her eyes went wide..:..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no....please don't make a seen we have to get to safety....the change takes longer so we have some time to find safety....\" Ethan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking outside Eddie saw the sun was already setting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ethan what about or own changes?\" He asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn we have to hurry lets all carpool together I'll drive I can probably hold mine off the longest.\" Ethan said as Eddie picked up Jessica who ripped off her shoes as she walked barefoot struggling as her feet snapped upright. She gripped her sides feeling hair starting to grow as the three raced as fast they could.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She now sported E-cup breasts and long legs, like Jessica had before she tried to reduce her breasts on her own. \"Not bad, huh?\" she asked as they got out of the car. \"I'm not sure this is really a curse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan didn't say anything. He just opened the car door, and Raven came running out. She had pulled off the rest of Jessica's clothes and ran naked toward Amber. Ethan saw with shock that Raven had grown a small tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan opened the next car door just in time for Eddie to finish changing into Elise. She picked up her new purchases and Eddie's clothes and held them over her body. \"What happens now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" he replied, \"let's get inside. I've held off the change about as long as I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven and Amber seemed to be satisfied with each other for now, so Elise helped Ethan get into the bathroom to change. The transformation seemed to take longer and felt more painful, as if his body was punishing him for his resistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Ethan was Emily once more, and she was glad to see that her hair and nails had only grown out to where they had been cut the night before. Once she got dressed, she came out into the living room. \"How are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Testing their stamina, from the sound of it,\" Elise replied. \"Anything I should know about dealing with them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amber got infected when Raven scratched her and made her perform oral sex on her. So, don't let either of them scratch you, and if they do, don't join their party. I'm immune, so, if you want to go home, I can keep an eye on them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not leaving my best friend alone with those two, at least not just yet.\" They sat down on the couch. \"Can I ask a personal question?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was your... first sexual fantasy as a woman like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica gave me a vibrator and some encouragement. My first time, I imagined that I, as Ethan, was touching a girl I'd never met before. The next night was the first time Eddie and Emily met, and I fantasized that you were having sex with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still wrapping my head around how my sexual attraction changes with the rest of me. I never would have seen myself attracted to guys before this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither had I. It's okay. You deal with it in your own way, at your own time.\"</span></div></div>",

I offer them greater pleasure than they have ever known yet they flee?\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well umm....perhaps you are just too much for them to handle.\" Emily said lying knowing they were terrified of her appearance and threatening tone.

She gripped her sides and moaned in agony as her nails and fangs began to retract.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Curses! That weak girl is regaining control!\" She said crying out as her body shrunk and she grew skinnier and her breasts started to shrink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress I feel it too it hurts!\" Amber it now shade  called out as her body began changing too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey writhed around for several minutes until their human forms returned. The stress of the reverse change not only wipes their memories but also makes them pass out as both Jessica and Amber slept naked in Emily's back seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily also noticed something different about Amber. Her normal sexy body had been drained of its sexuality. Much like Jessica her human body was skinny, pale, with no boobs and short hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping them off back at Jessica's house. Emily returned home and feel quickly asleep. She was exhausted from babysitting those two sex demons all night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever as she sleep Emily suddenly had a very strange dream.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her dream Emily was Ethan again. As he walked though a dark blanket of fog he saw a large cage in the distance. Walking to the cage he saw there was a red velvet couch and laying on it a woman.....She was pure demon....more than Raven or anything else she had seen. She looked more like the picture from the book. She had blood red skin and jet black hair. Her hair was easily 7 or 8 feet long and seemed to move on its own. She had a three or four foot long tail with a spades tip moving behind her as well as long curved horns on her skull and long sharp black nails and fangs. She was looking back to Ethan with hungry yellow glowing eyes as he suddenly realized who she was....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyffani? Is that you?\" Ethan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon woman smiled and nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hello there Ethan you naughty boy....Coming to visit me in this mental prison you locked me in? That was a very naughty trick you pulled. I didn't know those pills still existed. Well at least did....that was the last one wasn't it? Do you feel bad giving poor Eddie the curse? He was so amazing and now....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up! He's my friend! And if not for you he would still be normal. Why do look like that?\" Ethan called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please you already know that answer....this is my final and truest form. Also the eventual and inevitable form of your dear friend Jessica. Tell me does that bother you? Seeing your friend twisted and turned against her will?\" Tyffani said laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said shut up! Of course it does! You started all this? I was finally okay with my curse until you showed up and turned me into some kind of whore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyffani laughed again at the accusation. \"Please..:.You do realize that I am just the true form of your inner sexual desires....:The curse just makes those desires real and flesh. Had you never taken that strip job. Stopped taking those pills, never had sex with Eddie. You could have controlled this curse yourself. Your weakness gave birth to me....what bothers you more? Seeing your friends twisted or knowing it's all your fault?\" She said in an evil tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP! Get out of here! I want to leave!\" Ethan said shaking his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is your head you can leave whenever you want....by why leave when I can offer you something?\" Tyffani said smiled as her tail swished back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want nothing you can offer me!\" Ethan yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even a way to save your friends?\" Tyffani said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan paused and looked to her. \"I don't need a way....Mom is looking she should be back in a few days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please.....why do you think every time Mommy dearest has ever offered a solution it only made things worse? The pills, Eddie, Jessica? Your dear mother is hiding darker secrets than you know. Do you really think her solution won't come at a price?\" Tyffani said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe....so what's your solution?\" Ethan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy....you let me out again.....you are the source of this those pitiful fools are pale imitations to what our power could be. There are so many things I could give you if my true form and powers are unlocked. Once I am reborn I will take away the curses from your friends and give them back the bodies they were born with. I will even sweeten the deal by restoring dear Eddie back to normal....In exchange I get to come out and play again at nights. I promise I won't even spread the curse. I just want to be free again!\" Tyfanny said shaking her cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of turning into a demon like that every night terrified Ethan but he thought for a second perhaps it was better in his hands than anyone elses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I wanted to how?\" Ethan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The next time you start to change take all your remaining pills. At least ten should do it. That will break my bonds and reawaken me in my true form. We will still share this body over days and nights but your friends will be normal again I swear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll think about it....\" Ethan said walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry your friends don't have much time they are reaching the next stage that's where things get really interesting. The change is gets even slower and stronger and worse your mind doesn't change until the very last moment. This way you have to suffer and witness every part of yourself changing.\"  Tyffani said laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan woke up in bed the next morning in a cool sweat. He knew how real that dream was and felt as he knew Tyffani was still there inside his mind. He would consider her offer but not yet. He knew his friends needed him and he wondered what to do.</span></div></div>",

Gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyffani was a horrible person, Ethan,\" Amber said. \"She put on a lap dance during my stage time, even though she knew it was against the rules.

Perhaps it was his job and burden to make sure his friends were safe.....even if they didn't want him to....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was scratching her back both e itch was seeking to go away....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay Jess?\" Ethan asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I just have this itch that won't.......RIIIIPPP!!\" The sound was tearing denim from her jeans interrupted them as everyone stood stunned as a long, blood red, three foot long, spaded tail erupted from her spine and ripped through her jeans and started moving around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan remembered what Tyffani said last night. They were entering a new stage which meant this change would be the slowest and most painful yet. Unlike the others where their minds were quickly overrun with pleasure and desire, almost freeing them of the guilt. This time their minds would be the last thing to turn. Almost a torture they would have to see every inch of their body's change first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also remembered that her demon side was desperate for a man and would most likely come  after himself and Eddie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever time was on their side. This change was going to be very drawn out and slow. It could give them time to come up with a plan..... </span></div></div>",

This time the change was incredible slow and painful for them both which was causing a lot of suffering. Amber was leaning against a wall moaning in a strange combination of pain and pleasure. Meanwhile Jessica was in Ethan's arms struggling to control her slowly changing body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...hate you....Ethan....for doing this to us.....\" Amber said moaning against the wall as her body started filling out more sexually. They both were starting to slowly regain their ages and natural sexuality as Ethan saw budding breasts and gardening nipples poking against the fabric of their tight tank tops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica tried to stand up as she stumbled around on the balls of her feet. Her feet has just snapped upright as her toenails were already black and starting to get longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes Ethan got a text from Eddie saying he was almost back with the case of pills. Amber had moved off the wall and suddenly fallen to her hands and knees as it looked like she was grunting trying to push something out of her. There as a sudden ripping sound a a familar looking tail ripped out of her behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....can't do....I can't do this! I'm not a monster! I refuse to let this happen!\" Amber suddenly called out. Suddenly without waning she stood up and ran out the front door. She had adapted to her new feet and suddenly ran at a really fast pace out the door as Ethan tried calling out to her to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amber NO! please!\" Ethan called out looking back to Jessica who was curled up in a corner. The changes were almost at the half way mark. If they continued at this pace it would be about another two hours before they finished. Just enough time for it to turn dark....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie soon returned with the bag as he looked around. \"Where is Amber?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She just took off!\" Ethan called out. \"We have to go after her! She is entering the stage where she can start infecting others!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are we supposed to find her?\" Eddie called out knowing she could be anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan slowly turned to Jessica. \"Jessica....we need your help. I'm guessing by this point you can smell Amber?\" He asked:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica sniffed the air and nodded. \"Yeah my senses are going wild....Amber had a unique scent though...why?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need your help finding her....\" Ethan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up balancing on her feet Jessica looked back to the boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you crazy I'm not going out like this!\" I'm still changing I can barely focus let alone let others see me like this!\" Jessica yelled. At this point her hair had grown down past her shoulders and turned black. Her breasts were about a B-cup and her sexy figure had just started to develop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica we don't have a choice! If we don't find her in the next couple hours before dark I won't be able to help either of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew there wasn't anther option as she nodded. She had gained enough strength to hopefully walk around and resist long enough to help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe needed a way to disguise her though....the tail was going to stand out badly.....Looking around they decided to make her wear a pair of baggy sweat pants and stuff her tail into them along with a black hoodie. She would have to walk barefoot but hopefully people wouldn't notice or just assume she just had heels on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping outside Jessica sniffed the air as she caught the scent and pointed south towards the south part of town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan and Eddie both gulped as they knew what was in that direction.....the yearly dark  carnival. A festival held during the summer where all things weird came together. Imagine a  renaissance festival, a superhero convention, and Halloween all wrapped up in one big outdoor event that lasted a week. Everyone wore costumes all the time and it was frowned on if you didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is going there to try and blend in....if she fully changes no will suspect a thing and she can infect anyone she wants.\" Eddie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please.....we have to hurry....we don't have much time.\" Jessica said groaning as she looked down at her hands and saw her finger nails were starting to darken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe all nodded and agreed heading out together. Finding Amber in a crowd that big was going to be no easy job but they had too. Eddie handed Ethan his bag of pills as Ethan out it into his pocket as they headed out together.</span></div></div>",

Her claws had left stripes on the man's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a final groan, Jessica tore off her clothes, completely transformed into Raven, and climbed onto the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan sighed. \"We're too late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's for sure,\" Eddie said. \"I'm changing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eddie metamorphosed into Elise, Ethan took out the pills and swallowed them all.</span></div></div>",

It was a pain unlike anything he had ever felt before.....It was like his very soul was on fire.....he screamed in agony as the skies above suddenly started get darker as black clouds drifted above them. Ehan heard a laughing and echoing in his mind which he new was the voice of Tyffani.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stupid boy.....thank you so much for this....had you been smart enough to read the history of our kind from dear old mommy you would have learned you only needed to take half those pills....with that you would have temporary gained my but kept yourself in control.....I knew your impatience wouldn't bother checking my claims so now I am free to unleash my true self upon this world at last!\" The voice said laughing to him as Ethan tried to fight back in vain. He was taken for a fool once again.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan's body desperately tried to fight off the change but the power was far too strong.....as his male body began to change into female new demonic features began to rise. Large horns ripped out of her skull as two huge wings ripped from her back as a long tail erupted from her spine. Razor sharp claws and fangs emerged with her pointed ears as her skin turned a deep rose color. She was far more demon than either of the other two. Once the first changes finally ceased Tfyanni stood up. Her powers changed her clothing to a demonic two piece that covered very little. Her long jet black hair flew behind her shoulders as her eyes flowed a bright green color.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://d1nr5wevwcuzuv.cloudfront.net/product_photos/9527759/succubus_by_arsenal21-d5b0r51_original.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://d1nr5wevwcuzuv.cloudfront.net/pr...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up to the other two demon girls and Elise Tyfanny saw that Raven was holding down Elise pleasing her while Shade finished off the male from earlier. However upon seeing the new risen Tuffant they all froze.....her power and aura was so strong the other two demons were paralyzed with fear...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two are pathetic excuses for thralls.....you get a taste of real power and all you care about is fulfilling your lustful desires....you could have made these men your slaves....I guess you are fit for nothing less than to be my servants as I take my power back....\" Tyffani said to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding up her hands Tyffani's glowing green eyes grew even brighter as both demon girls and Elise fell to their hands and knees and began coughing and chocking. As they each coughed green gas came from their mouths and as they coughed out this strange gass their bodies began reverting to normal. After a minute all the gas had left their bodies as they each had their normal bodies back except for one thing.....each of them had the same shade of bright green eyes as Tyffani did.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyffani seems to absorb all the gas from the three as she felt even more powerful now.....Eddie, Jessica, and,  Amber were human and normal again but now paralyzed with fear as they each knelt in front of Tyffani.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyffani....you got what you wanted may we go now?\" Eddie asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyffani only laughed as she looked to the three of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not even close to being done with you three...from this point on you three will serve me.....The male will be my personal mate and protector, while you two thralls are going to be my new pleasure slaves....but first we must do some adjustments.....\" She said laughing <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyffani waved her hands as the eyes of Eddie Jess and Amber all lit up as they began moving against their will. They each stripped naked and laid on their backs with their limbs spread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on my body won't listen?\" Jessica cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't bother struggling...I left just enough power of mine in you to be influenced by me. You are my puppets now if I wish it...if you struggle you only make it worse....\" Tyffani said as she stood over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do to us? Make us demons like you?\" Eddie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No sweet male....I shall be the only true demon in this world.....I'm going to give you bodies worthy of serving me....powerful, strong, and sexually perfect.....plus it comes with an overwhelming sexual desire and willingness to serve me.....\" She said seeing the fear in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClasping her hands together Tyffani suddenly released a red cloud of mist at her former friends as they began coughing as the process began.....</span></div></div>",

It began with his hair growing out to shoulder length, which made him wonder for a moment if Tyffani had changed her mind about him. However, that was dispelled as his muscles swelled, making him look like a gym rat or professional wrestler. Finally, he felt a fire in his crotch as his member grew to new proportions. When it was finished, he had an eighteen-inch erection that was a good six inches in circumference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Jessica and Amber, the changes were more familiar, as Jessica regained the extreme figure she had as an exotic dancer, and Amber's body changed in the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let us go,\" Tyffani commanded. \"I do not require an audience, and there is a scent in the air, familiar yet strange. We shall meet back at the dwelling the two women share.\" With that, Tyffani took flight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie was elected to drive. His pounding erection hurt, but he still had full range of motion in his arms, while Jessica and Amber were hampered by their enormous breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they tore off in the car, the man Shade had seduced slowly rose to his feet and looked wistfully in their direction. \"Call me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the three arrived at the house, Tyffani was there to greet them. \"What do you want from us?\" Eddie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleasure, my pets, pleasure,\" Tyffani replied. Let us begin simply. I will suck on that magnificent cock, while Jessica eats my pussy, and Amber sucks at my breasts.\" The four got into position quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie found that, as soon as his monstrous dick was inside Tyffani's mouth, the pain went away, replaced with sensations of pleasure he had never imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica, too, gave in to the pleasure she felt as she gave her demon mistress oral sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Amber, the moment she began to suck, a fluid gushed out and coated the inside of her mouth. She tried not to think about what this fluid was, or how the feel and taste of it made her wide and wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three slaves rotated their positions through the night, until Tyffani grew drowsy. \"The three of you may amuse each other,\" she said. \"You will return to your normal forms during the day. I promised Ethan the day. If he should change his mind, however, and relinquish the day to me, that decision will be his.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tyffani fell asleep, the others sat for a time. Finally, Jessica spoke to Eddie. \"That thing is hard again already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It hasn't gone down since I was changed,\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't that hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whenever I'm not having sex. Once it's inside a vagina, mouth, or anus, all I feel is pleasure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica thought for a moment, then moved over and began to give him head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the sky began to change color as dawn broke, and they became their normal selves. \"Tyffani kept her word.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Amber said, \"wonder how disappointed Ethan will be when - \" The rest of the sentence died in her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie and Jessica turned to look at Amber, then followed her gaze to Ethan, and they understood what Tyffani meant before she fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan now looked like a small child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that child was sexless.</span></div></div>",

The child looked no older than 3 or 4 and was bald, hairless, had no nipples, and no genatia of any kind. It almost looked like a doll expect it was still a human. Leaning down Eddie tried to communicate with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan is that can you understand me?\" Eddie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe child looked up to him and only nodded slightly. It seemed that while Ethan's mind was present he had lost the ability to speak. He could still walk slowly but strangely he seemed to also have been stripped of all emotions.....there was no sadness or pain, or anger, or happiness. It was like this body was a doll trapping Ethan inside it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Ethan may have been trapped inside, the power of Tyfanni was still very much alive. The three friends noticed they were all wearing normal clothes they had never worn before. They could also feel something deep down. Something that told them that if they tried to betray Tyffani or flea something bad would happen....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do now? Tyffani will be back at sundown. When she returns our free will is gone.\" Eddie turned around to ask the other two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.....However I'm pretty sure I can guess Tyffani will not stop with us in her Harem. She will to start spreading out to others.\" Jessica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's exactly what she will do.....I saw it.....the fluid excreted by her breasts....it showed me her plans. She will build a harem of perfect pleasure slaves and use their essence to stay immortal.....however right now we have an advantage....Tyffani isn't strong enough to take over during the day....as long as she doesn't seduce and currupt anyone new she can't get more powerful. This gives us time to find an answer.\" Amber said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of answer is that?\" I barely know anything about demons. The only person we had helping us was Ethan's mom but she is gone in Europe!\" Eddie said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're might be someone else. I met an old gypsy woman at the dark carnival last night. Right before I fully lost control. She saw me with my tail and horns and said she knew I wasn't in costume.....I wanted to ask her for help but I lost control soon after.\" Amber said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well why don't we try to find her again?\" Jessica asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Ethan we can leave him here alone and we shouldn't take him anywhere.\" Eddie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right.....Eddie you stay here and watch Ethan. Amber and I will return to the carnival and will try to be back by sundown with the gypsy. \" Jessica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a fine plan but we have another problem......it seems Tyffani isn't going to just let us out during the day without conciquinces.\" Amber said as she looked down and pointed to Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica looked down to see what she meant. She suddenly felt a slight moist feeling in her currently modest sized breasts. Reaching down she rubbed her nipple and pulled her hand back only to find a strange nector like substance on her fingers. Her breasts had also swollen up a bit larger. Tasting the substance it was incredibly sweet and deliclous. Jessica's mind suddenly flashed to an image of her back in her demonic body with Eddie and Ethan suckling both her breasts as she moaned in pleasure....:the image suddenly faded as she brought herself back. Amber showed Jessica the same thing was also happening to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the same fluid I mentioned earlier. Tyfanni seems to have passed it to us. If we let anyone else taste it they will start changing and become another servant for Tyffani. Our bodies are already slowly changing back. It how Tyffani planned it. We get our bodies back in the day only to watch as they turn back slowly by nightfall.....\" Amber said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not all look.....\" Jessica said pulling off her shoe which was a small sandal. However as they watched a small heel was forming on it. \"Our clothes will start changing too. We need to hurry.\" Jessica said slipping it back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie agreed to stay behind and watch Ethan as the two girls got into Ethan's car and drove off towards the festival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did they know that it was Currently the biggest day of the carnival today and it was going to be packed with tons of people making it very hard for them to find the one person they needed.....</span></div></div>",

Not only were there tons of people at the carnival right now, there must have been at least a dozen or so different fortune tellers. It also didn't help that Amber could barely even remember what she looked like, and seeing how almost everyone was in costume it made things even tougher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour of no luck both girls were starting to get hot and tired. However suddenly Jessica paused as she suddenly grasped her chest and let out an awkward moan of pleasure......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber reached over and grabbed her trying to hide her from prying eyes. \"What's wrong?\" She whispered to Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tightness....growing.....please can we rest?\" Jessica pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber nodded as the two found an empty spot in the shade behind a restroom. Laying down they rested for a bit as Jessica looked down to her chest. Her breasts were throbbing, almost pulsing like a heart beat. Each time they pulsed they grew little more, and each pulse felt like a miniature orgasm for Jessica. She watched as her breasts grew about another cup size as they were about large C cups now. She knew this was no where near their final size but the sensations of the changes were too much to ignore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn that Tyffani....she made these changes even more pleasurable to distract us.....I'm starting to feel it toooo.....\" Amber said moaning as her breasts began to pulse and swell larger too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls changed their nipple pads which had more nector in them this time. They disposed of them carefully as they looked around again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least we know each change will follow one of the intense orgasms, it will give us a little warning.\"! Amber said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It won't matter soon, we are running out of time....look.\" Jessica pointing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls shoes had changed to stiletto heels and nether of them had noticed, infact it was already feeling more natural to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what I'm most worried about look....\" Amber sailing pointing to a banner hanging above them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica read it carefully. \"Costume dance this evening after sundown. Monster costumes preferred.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took her a minute but soon her eyes widened. \"You don't think Tyffani would turn us back into demons for this dance?\" She asked Amber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's exactly what I think....I think Tyffanni expects us to turn just demon enough at sundown to attract and seduce two willing males and with the nector pumping through us is they will become servants of hers and then she will devour their essence to return to full power. I don't think can escape that doll form yet....she used too much power in us....she needs to feed again to return to normal strength.\" Amber said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to leave then! While we still can!\" Jessica said worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't! If we leave without the fortune teller we have accomplished nothing....we have to at least try.\" Amber said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica nodded as the two girls went back out to graze the dangers of the crowd knowing their changes were getting stronger....</span></div></div>",

With only her hazy memories to guide them, it seemed a hopeless task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make matters worse, their changes were becoming more frequent, and the accompanying orgasms stronger. \"We're running low on nipple pads,\" Amber said. \"It seems like every time we change, our breasts leak even more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to tell - ohhh,\" Jessica said, cut off by the familiar sensation of an orgasm building within her. The two women could only thrash and groan as their bodies became more sexualized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the orgasms subsided, they saw that their bodies now matched how Jessica had looked when she started at the strip club. As for their clothes, only thin strips of fabric stood between them and being arrested for indecent exposure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" said a voice in a thick accent, \"you have returned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica and Amber turned and saw a frail old woman leaning on a stick, one eye clouded with cataracts. \"Holy shit,\" Amber said, \"we found you. I was ready - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is not much time,\" said the fortune teller. \"Come inside my tent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two followed the elder woman and sat at the table therein. When the old woman sat opposite them, Jessica asked, \"Do you know what's happening to us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have seen it,\" came the reply, \"many years ago,\" Neither Jessica nor amber dared to ask how long ago, as the woman could easily pass for 200.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do we stop it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It stops when the source of the evil returns. The younger will challenge the elder, and the elder will consume the younger, regaining her youth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica didn't like the sound of that. \"What about our friend? He's caught up in the evil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If what has happened before happens again, then your friend will die with the younger demon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we stop it? Is there any way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps. If the younger demon finds a source of power stronger than the lust which feeds her, she may triumph over her elder. What happens after that will depend on her recognizing the source for what it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was about to ask for more specific information, when she saw that the thin fabric that was all that was left of her clothes had vanished. This realization was followed by the strongest orgasm she had ever felt. Jessica and Amber fell to the floor, writhing in pain and pleasure, completely unaware of the world around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the orgasms subsided again, Jessica and Amber opened their eyes again, to see... </span></div></div>",

A long red spaded tail was swishing behind her as she slowly stood up to see her demonic body again. Her mind was gone replaced by the seductivly  dangerous Raven.Looking over she saw Amber standing in all her demonic glory as her eyes were glowing a bright green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes....I'm free Shade is back. I hear you my mistress. I hear your desires, we must find two males and seduce them using the nector in our breasts. Then we will mate with them and drain their essences to be given to you for your rebirth.\" Shade said looking over to Raven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven smiled as she stood an acknowledged Shade. \"Yes my sister....Let us go and fulfill the desires of our master.\" She said as Shade stepped out of the tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica and Amber were gone and any resistance they had to the desires of Tyffani were gone as well. As Raven left the tent she suddenly felt a hand reach out and grab hers. It was the old gypsy woman, and she was putting some kind of silver charm bracelet around her wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" Raven said looking at the charm as it suddenly began to glow. Suddenly an intense pain hit Raven as she fell on her hands and knees. Her glowing red eyes suddenly began to change as they reverted back to the same side of green of Jessica's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Opening her eyes slowly Jessica realized that she was back in control. Her mind was back. The last thing she remembered was....Her hands suddenly darted down seeing her demniic claws and huge breasts which were a deep red color like the rest of her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god I'm a monster! She said seeing herself.\" While she was always aware of the demon inside her she never had actually seen it fully for herself yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes my dear....that bracelet had bound the demon mind back inside you for now. However you must listen close to my words for time is of the essence. That bracelet nearly binds the demon's mind it doesn't stop the influence the demon master has over you. The elder demon is coming and the only way to fight her will be to convert the younger and for you all to band together. Right now the younger has given you and that other demon much if her power, which she plans to reclaim tonight. Once you two have drained the essences of two others she will feed off that and then take back her powers leaving you both human slaves once more. This must not be allowed to happen! The power of this bracelet will keep you in enough control to flea and hide from you master for the next 24 hours. You master will know do everything in her power to find you in that time and take back what is hers. You must not let you touch you, if she does not even the power of the bracelet will stop you from falling under her control. If you succeed in 24 hours the young demon will have a moment where her powers and mind are weakened allowing the true self a moment to escape. When this moment happends you will see it, you just act fast and put the bracelet on her. This will banish the evil demon's mind from her and all those under her influence, however it will leave the powers alone. With this you can all unite against the elder when she arises and unite to fight her off together.\" The gypsy explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what your saying is that I have to hide from Tyfanni for an entire day, but also be close enough to her so when she is weakened I can attach the bracelet to her?\" Jessica said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes exactly....Also do not tell or trust anyone with this information. All those under her control will not hesitate to stop you. Even during the day light their minds are not truly their own.\" The gypsy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica thought she finally understood when suddenly an intensely powerful orgasm hit her body as flashes of Tyffani filled her mind. Collapsing she moaned in pleasure trying to fight it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I resist her? This body.....I've never been this horny in my life. And during the daylight I slowly change back.\" Jessica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must find the power within you to resist it. You cannot stop the changes but you can refuse to give in to your desires.\" Reaching out the old gypsy woman held her hand for a second and smiled as she suddenly seemed to vanish without a trace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up slowly regaining her strength Jessica tried to think of what to do next.</span></div></div>",

She couldn't deny her feelings for Eddie but something was telling her this wasn't right. Ethan had already been accepted into college and Eddie was planning to go to a trade school in another city. Even if they both wanted this was it worth it for just a few months? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Eddie asked Emily as he could tell she was feeling off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....just don't know if this is right....our futures are taking us very different places Eddie. I really like you but I don't know if I can continue this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you trying to break up with me?\" Eddie said feeling heartbroken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I......I...think so....Not because I don't like you. This new body and new life. I've barely gotten used to it. I'm just not ready for a relationship yet. I need to understand myself and what the future holds for both sides of me before I commit to anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fate can be cruel....I finally find my dream girl and she turns out to be my best friend. Maybe you are right.\" He said with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think our paths will cross in the future. I still wanna remain friends though college.\" Emily said holding Eddie's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two soon finished their dinner as Eddie took Emily home after. Eddie wasn't expecting anything but Emily soon leaned in with a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come upstairs I have a surprise for you.\" She said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie agreed as Went upstairs as Emily disappeared for a moment. After a few minutes Emily appeared before Eddie wearing nothing but a set of sexy black lingerie. It hugged her body tightly pushing up her large D cups. Eddie's mouth widened for a moment seeing how sexy she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If this is to be our last night together for awhile I want it to be a memorable one. I want you to be my first Eddie.\" She said smiling.</span></div></div>",

As soon as the door was closed, he took off his shirt. \"Let me see that purse,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily handed him her purse, and Eddie pulled out a dental dam. \"Let's start with one of these.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily smiled, then lay back on her bed, taking off the negligee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie began by caressing her breasts. Emily sucked air through her teeth as his attentions aroused her. When she wasn't sure how much more she could take, Eddie put the dam over his teeth and began working on her sex with his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan had known that Eddie was popular with the girls, and, as Emily, she was glad for this experience. He knew exactly where her clitoris was, and he gave it his full attention. She rubbed her breasts as they throbbed with each beat of her heart. She could hardly believe the pleasure as she experienced her first orgasm that didn't come from her vibrator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie removed the dental dam and asked, \"How was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get those pants off,\" Emily replied, \"and I'll show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Eddie was naked, Emily saw that he was almost fully erect. Her hands gave him the last stimulation he needed, then she slipped on a flavored condom and began to suck, cradling his testicles in one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he shot his wad, Eddie said, \"That was great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily shrugged. \"I've picked up a few things about what guys like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing away the condom, Eddie asked, \"How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the best night of my life.

Then, once they were both sufficiently aroused, Eddie put on a fresh condom, and they began having vaginal sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was everything Emily could have hoped for. When their orgasms came, her vagina milked his throbbing penis. She had not expected this reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the afterglow was finished, Eddie kissed her, grabbed his clothes, and said, \"I'll go sleep in Ethan's room. Goodnight.\"</span></div></div>",

He was happy to be here but it was hard to forget the road that brought him here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter their night together Emily and Eddie said their goodbyes. They agreed to stay friends and stay in touch regardless of where life took them. Eddie had already agreed to take a full time job in another state while Ethan was moving in the opposite direction for college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few months were spent getting Ethan and Emily ready for College. Ethan was terrified about how to arrange a normal life with his condition. Where would he live? How would he be able to have a roommate? However his mom seemed confident every time the subject was brought up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a month his mom also took Ethan to a very special doctor. She said he specializes in helping people with his unique chromosome. He had helped her growing up for many years. He was very nice older man named Dr. Thompson. He offered Ethan a special shot which would act as a birth control for the entire year. After his mom found out Emily had had sex for the first time she insisted on it. She didn't want any unforeseen babies popping up anytime soon. Ethan agreed to the shot thinking it was for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only issue with the shot was it had a few side effects. The doctor told him that sexual growth and development would be natural and to not worry.  Within a month Emily had to upgrade all her bras to DD cups. Emily's blonde hair now touched the tip of her near perfectly shaped butt, while her fingernails had grown a bit longer too.The doctor said these were normal side effects and not to be alarmed. While inconvenient Ethan was able to deal with these changes. The only side effect Emily seemed to really dislike was the increased libido. Perhaps it was just the sexual longing for Eddie but Emily was getting hornier than usual and dressing up just for fun and pleasuring herself almost nightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a month of adjustment Ethan and Emily seemed to be relatively in sync with each other. Ethan focused on life and school while Emily focused on fun and pleasure. Luckily Jessica was around to take Emily out shopping and to several clubs where they danced many nights away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the three months school had finally arrived and Ethan was all packed up and ready. He was given a normal dorm in a co Ed building. This meant he would have a regular roommate and would have to balance both lives the best he could. He had no idea who his roommate would be and how he would explain his situation. After unpacking Ethan nervously awaited his new roommate. When he heard footsteps coming up the hall he saw his door open as Ethan stood there a bit shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding there was one of the most beautiful girls he had ever seen. She had dark tanned skin and long black hair that flew down her back. Ethan guessed she was of pacific island decent. Her boobs were even bigger than Emily's but also perfectly round and perky which made them look fake. She was a good foot taller than Emily standing almost six feet flat footed but she was also wearing at least three inch heels. Her legs seemed to go for days and her figure was a perfect hourglass. She was also built like a tank. Her arms and legs had clearly well defined muscle and she had a serious six pack. She was wearing a light blew sun dress as she came into into dorm room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Ethan her eyes lit up as she dropped her stuff and ran over to Ethan and picked him up like a teddy bear and gave him a huge hug. It seemed she was even stronger than she looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god I'm sooo happy to meet you! You must be Ethan right? My name is Lola! I can't wait to hang out with both you and Emily!\" She said as Ethan was shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...how do you know about?\" Ethan asked as Lola stepped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About your XYZ chromosome? Well because the school told me and also I used to have it too! I was a bit different I started changing at 16 and due to certain....well let's just say life choices I lost the ability to revert back about a year ago. Since then I've just been Lola. The school and your family must have wanted us together so you could have someone to help mentor you through this. I have been in email contact with your mom for about a month now she told me about your situation and how you only started changing a few months ago.\" Lola said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan was a bit taken back. It seemed it mom had gone out of her way to make sure he could have as normal if a college life as possible.</span></div></div>",

How's the baby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face became serious for the first time since she'd come in. \"I had a miscarriage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan felt like he'd said the exact wrong thing. \"I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. Your mom's told me all about you, so it's only fair that you know about me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm from Samoa, originally. Like I said, I had the XYZ chromosome, too. I gather that your folks didn't tell you about it until your first change? Well, my folks told me when I was 14. I used to wonder what it would be like when I started changing. Of course, I had no idea it would happen when I was 16. I had gone camping with my best friend - just two guys - when the sun went down and I suddenly found myself changing. You can imagine the look on Joe's face when <i>these</i>\" - she indicated her breasts - \"started growing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must have freaked you out,\" Ethan said, \"him suddenly being sexually attracted to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was no weirder than me being attracted to him. But he did become my first sex partner, but far from my last.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once I got back home, I found myself in the party scene. Drinking first, then drugs. I started getting used to waking up in some guy's bed, usually someone I hardly knew. Finding myself pregnant might have been a wake-up call, but I just hit the snooze button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the end, it was an overdose that finally got to me. I lost the baby, and I damn near lost my life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once I got out of rehab, I was a changed woman. I was alive, and determined to enjoy life to its fullest.\" She looked out the window. \"Looks like the sun will be down soon. Is it okay if I watch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose,\" Ethan said, already getting undressed. \"You'll be the third person to see it, and the first to ask. I'm glad you're here, Lola. When I'm Emily, I've been super-horny lately, and I could use someone to help me keep it under control, especially with all the guys on campus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the last rays of sunlight died, the change began with the now-familiar pain of a uterus forming in Ethan's belly. Since getting the shot, Ethan had noticed that the transformation seemed to hurt less, and the order of the changes seemed to have stabilized. Breast development was next, followed by his ass growing to similar proportions. His waist narrowed, and his hips widened. His arms and legs became more feminine, then his hands and feet. His hair and nails grew out. Finally, his genitals changed, and he was Emily again.</span></div></div>",

On the other hand Lola was the only person she knew here and she needed someone like a mentor to help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm okay just promise me no drinking. I don't wanna risk any trouble my first day here.\" Emily said as the two girls got dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cross my heart. This is about socializing and getting you more comfortable in your body.\" Lola said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just worried because lately I've been getting more and horny recently, and I've noticed a few changes to myself. Is that normal or just a side effect of the shot?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only a little bit. What you're actually experiencing is part of your natural development.. Your body is still changing and developing itself. Over the next few weeks you will notice it more. Bigger boobs, longer, brighter hair, longer nails, wider hips, bigger butt, etc. it's different for everyone and t can be a bit alarming with how drastically some parts of you change. Would you believe after my first change I was barely a B-cup?\" Lola said pointing to her massive perky boobs.\" Lola said with a laugh as they finished getting ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily looked to herself in the mirror realizing how hot and sexy she looked. Biting her lip she began to daydream of a hot college guy coming up from her behind and.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she knew it Emily was grabbing one of her breasts moaning as Lola came up behind her and ripped her hands away before giving her a sudden slap across the face. It wasn't too hard to leave a mark but it definitely hurt enough to snap Emily out of her lustful day dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl you have got a long way to go. If you cant control yourself in private how will you do it in public? I'm sorry to hit you like that but you need to always remember who you really are. These next few weeks are gonna be a test for you. Which is why I only want you dressing sexy like you are. Once you can gain control of yourself in public dressed sexy you can do anything.\" Lola said helping Emily calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry....it's never been this bad before. Please do that again if I start to drift.\" Emily said taking deep breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anytime.\" Lola said with a laugh as the two girls went outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of walking around campus it was obvious they were getting looks. All the stares especially from guys was making Emily uncomfortable as she could feel the heat building inside her. Lola seemed totally fine and just smiled and waves as they walked around no problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where are we going?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A sorority house. Alpha Kapa Omega. Where the hottest girls on campus go. We are going to show up all those stuck up birches tonight and make them all jealous.\" Lola said with a wicked smile as Emily suddenly got really nervous as they saw the huge house in front of them. It had a huge sign out front and tons of people were gathered as they hosted their first gathering party for potential new recruits.</span></div></div>",

While she may say she was a changed woman Emily could tell the wild party girl was still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing a bit Emily realized she was a bit hungry as she looked around for some snacks. The only thing she could find was a bowl of gummy bears in the kitchen. There was a sign above them that said. \"Only one per person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around nobody was watching as Emily decided to take a small handful for herself.

More than she should have....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next few minutes Aaron and Emily talked for a bit. Emily shared that she was new here and bit shy to the part scene. Aaron shared he was a year older and had been here for a year already. As they talked however Emily began to feel a bit weird...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tingling feeling had not gone away and had only gotten worse....Her whole body was feeling weird all of a sudden. Leaning against the wall she had to resist letting out a small moan...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" Aaron asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...I dunno I feel kinda weird...\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you have one of those gummy bears?

I had a small handful of those bears! I tonight they were just being stingy with the portions....! Please go grab Lola for me!\" Emily said trying to cover her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron nodded as he dropped his drink and ran over and grabbed Lola and quickly brought her over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl what is going on here?\" Lola said as Emily was leaning against the wall panting in the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She ate a few of the those spiked gummy bears earlier I think she is having an allergic reaction or something....\" Aaron said to Lola.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spiked! Where they yours!\" Lola said as she suddenly grabbed Aaron by the collar and lifted him up with one hand no problem. Her eyes were fillled with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NNNOO! There were brought here by Summer! Her friend made them. I was against the idea! Do we call an ambulance?\" Aaron asked scared as Lola dropped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, they can't help....Emily's body is very different from others girls...we need to get her somewhere private quick!\" Lola said trying not to draw attention to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The basement! There is an outside entrance over here.\" Aaron said leading her around the corner. Lola picked up Emily as she carried her to the basement entrance. The basement was a lounge of sorts with couches and chairs around as Lola sat Emily down as they locked the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily was laying on the couch moaning and trashing around as she began to try and rip her dress off as it felt like it was on fire. Her hair had already Grown past her ankles and was now even brighter than platinum blonde. It was turning a bright white color that seemed to shine when the light touched it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lola....what's happening?\" Emily asked moaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those bears were spiked....mostly likely pot or ecstasy....Your body is  still developing remember? Those stupid bears don't mix well with our biology during delicate stages...They are causing a super charge of your normal development. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily couldn't stand her clothes anymore. Peeling her dress off she pulled off her bra which was quickly getting to tight. Grabbing her already large natural breasts Emily moaned as they began grow again this time different than usual. They started to rise off her chest and take on a rounder shape as they reformed into perfect round globes. Their natural tear drop shapes changed as bey grew another size or too larger. Emily was unable to see her own toes now as her huge perfect breasts blocked her vision. They looked almost too perfect now...Not a person alive would ever believe they were natural anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily's body changed a bit more, her legs grew a bit longer and her hips widened as her butt exoanded a bit. Her skin took on a more natural tan. Her lips grew a bit more pouty as her facial features refined a bit. After about ten minutes the changes finally stopped. Emily had gone from really sexy blonde girl to snow haired sex goddess....The kind of girl others only dreamed exsisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron had witnesses this whole transformation as she stood in the corner trying to cover his obvious erection. He had no idea what just happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily slowly stood up, dizzy from the change. She didn't even realize she was only wearing high heels and a black thong as Aaron stared at her. After a minute she freaked out and grabbed her dress which was now too small for her to put back on. Emily was blushing so bright she couldn't even speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen...you can't speak of what you saw here. Emily is...special....understand?\" Lola said looking to Aaron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey that's fine as long as she is okay. Listen do you need a ride home? My car is parked out back we could try and sneak her out of here.\" Aaron offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not a bad idea...However we could easily be seen...\" Lola said as they debated their options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Only a few glances of Emily's new body and Snow White hair were caught by the crowd but no one caught of glimpse of who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron drove the two girls back to their dorm quickly as he looked back to Emily. She seemed almost fascinated by her hair and boobs playing with them constantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she gonna be okay?\" Aaron asked looking back to Lola.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, this is just a reaction to the drugs, her body on the other hand.....Anyways thanks for your help I got it from here.\" Lola said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure you don't want help?\" Aaron asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NNNOOO DONT GO! Pleaae stay!\" Emily cried out grabbing Aaron's arm. She was pretty high at this point and was prettt emotional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine you can come up just don't be stupid and try anything.\" Lola said in a very protective way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron nodded and helped Emily up to her dorm as she fell in the bed as she stripped out of her clothes. Her hands were roaming her body as any touch felt incredible to her at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what happened to her? I've never seen anything like this before?\" Aaron asked Lola.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not for me to tell you. All I can say is she is very special. Her body is not like other girls.\" Lola said trying to Cover Emily but she just pushed her away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron tried not to stare at her topless body but his eyes would occasionally glance over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about her body will she go back to normal?\" Aaron asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola sighed. \"Unfortunately no....The worst part is she won't remember any of this either tomorrow so I am gonna have to explain it to her. Her mind and feelings will all go back, that's just the drugs in her system. Listen...You seem like a nice guy but try not to get interested in Emily....She can't have the kind of relationship you are looking for.\" Lola said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I'm just trying to look after her. It's not everyday you see someone's hair turn whiter than a host and grow all the way down to their ankles and their boobs turn into perfect porn star tits. You can understand that right?\" Aaron said as his phone suddenly rang as he stepped out for a second to answer it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My boobies are so big and round! They feel sooooo goood!\" Emily cried out writing in pleasure on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Emily....\" Lola said petting her head a bit. \"I just hope you can deal with this body moving forward. It's Ethan I feel most sorry for. Your transformations are going to hit him like a truck now. It's gonna feel like ten orgasms at once all over your body. You really are something special though girl. I've never seen a reaction this strong before, I think this is gonna be a very interesting year for both of us.\" Lola said with a smile as she grabbed a hairbrush and started lightly brushing Emily's Shinning white hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily was almost passed out when Aaron came back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything okay?\" Lola asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...my cousin Susan just called me crying. She is a freshman like Emily I was hoping to introduce them and maybe make them into friends. She was at the party we just came from.\" Aaron said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Lola asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She wouldn't say she is on her way here though.\" Aaron said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola looked a bit angry she didn't need any more people here right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes there was a knock on the door as Aaron brought in Mary quickly. She was a very pretty girl. Nice body and pretty dark long hair like Aaron's, at least in half her head....The other half looked like it had just been shaved off. Mary ad obviously been crying earlier with mascara running down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god Susan what happened?\" Aaron asked shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those bitches happened! Those girls who work for Summer. They gave me a drink which made me sick and as I was throwing up they came up behind me and cut my hair! They said I wasn't welcome there anymore. I have no idea all I did was talk with this nice guy named Shane.\" Susan said tearing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait....Shane Bryson? Tall, mocha skin?\" He asked as Susan nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Summer's current boyfriend, well boy toy is more like it. She is just using him to try and make me jealous. It must have been retaliation....\" Aaron said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I Fucking hate those bitches! Wait....whose the snow haired porn star?\" Susan asked seeing Emily now passed out on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Emily, she had a bad reaction to those spiked gummy bears, this is her roommate Lola.\" Aaron said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit! Damn look at both of you! Sorry I don't mean to be rude but....Jesus. Look at those tits! I mean who gets surgery this young?\" Susan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola raised an eyebrow at her as Aaron stepped in. \"Listen you are still a bit drunk listen I will drive you home. We will talk again later okay.\" Aaron said escorting Susan outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long and very eventful night the sun finally came back as Ethan awoke to find himself laying in bed with a massive headache. He was clearly dehydrated as he got up to take some aspirin. The whole night was fuzzy he remembered changing and going to the party. He remembered meeting a nice guy named....Aaron? Possibly...then blank....the rest of the night was a total blur. As he got up and ready he saw a note written by Lola.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ethan, make sure you are here alone before sundown, something happened last night which affects your changes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan wasn't sure what she was talking about as Ethan felt anxious for his first official day as a student on campus.</span></div></div>",

Now on top of that he was going to have to deal with a whole new body and transformation. So far college was not off to the hottest start for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was almost setting as Ethan looked over to Lola. \"So....when you say orgasmic do you mean......OH.........MY.......GOD!\" Ethan suddenly shouted before falling to his hands and knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan had never felt anything like this before. His previous changes had taken getting used to but this was like getting struck by lightning in comparison. Rolling over onto his back he was paralyzed by the intense pleasure which felt like electricity running through every fiber of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started with his hair which lost all its color turning Snow White as it exploded in length from his scalp. It grew and grew and grew refusing to stop until it was at his ankles, almost to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally Ethan would try to get undressed before a change but this time he was blindsided as he unable to do anything but stare at himself and groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis skin began to tan more so than he remembered taking on  a beautiful bronze glow. His body was changing in almost an explosive manner now as the back of his jeans began to rip as his butt grew rapidly and expanded into a perfect round shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis shirt was rapidly getting too tight as his breasts began to form. Ethan was forced to tear off he shirt as his nails grew longer. Looking down his breasts grew and inflated taking on perfect round shapes. Even as they grew past DD range growing even larger they still remained perfectly round and perky. Soon his massive breasts blocked the view of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of his body changed in kind. Long legs, dainty feet, flat stomach. Lastly his face reformed becoming much more seductive with more pouty lips, long eyelashes and refined features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen everything was said and done the new Emily stood up and looked to herself. She could only stand there in shock. She looked like male fantasy come to life. Like a cartoon character had jumped off the pages. Everything about his new body screamed sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus I'm a total sex doll! I look like I was created in a lab or machine. Look at the size of my tits! Oh my god!\" Emily said a bit shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you. Please calm down. Listen I know it's extremely over the top. You can manage we just have to adapt. Tonight we are gonna go close shopping together get you some new outfits. Then we are gonna talk strategy at getting back at the bitch Summer. I have to leave now for about an hour when I get back we will head out. In the mean time just wear  some yoga pants and one of my sleeping shirts.\" Lola said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine I wanted to take a shower anyway.\" Emily said finding a towel. She was barely able to tie it around her chest now as her butt and cleavage was still very visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola couldn't help but laugh a bit as she took off as Enily went to the bathroom to shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside the bathroom Emily began to wash herself as she examined her new body. Not only was it way too sexual it was also very sensitive. Just touching her new breasts instantly made her nipples hard as she moaned loudly and had to pry her hands away. She also noticed a few other strange things. While she could stand just find normally whenever she would stand up in the balls of her feet like she was in high heels it suddenly felt better for some reason. Also whenever thinking of what new clothes to wear anything not sexy or revealing in some way would cause a weird itch on her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce out of the shower Emily rinsed her hair and wrapped the towel around her waste as best she could. Once her hair was dry she heard a knock on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot expecting anyone she figured Lola must have forgotten her key. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you forget your key or something?\" Emily said as she opened the door only to stop stunned....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron from last night was standing there as he suddenly got a full view of Emily wearing nothing but a towel....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily felt an immediate rush of heat in her body. She was embarrassed but also turned on....part of her wanted to just drop the towel and grab him. The other part of her wanted to scream and slam the door shut.</span></div></div>",

What happened to Susan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Summer had her stooges shave half her head, because she was talking to the guy Summer was trying to use to make me jealous. Poor Susan had to shave the rest off and go wig-shopping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sucks,\" Emily said, sneaking a glance at Aaron's crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Aaron asked, \"how are you feeling? Your roommate said that what happened to you was because you were unusually sensitive. Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't lie to you, Aaron,\" she said, placing her hand onto his, \"this is taking a lot to get used to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can imagine. Uh, did you want my hand for something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Emily was fully aware, she had taken Aaron's hand and brought it under her upper towel, placing his hand on one of her breasts.

Lola held Emily's ankle pinned between her arm and side, then dug through her purse with her other hand, finally bringing out a hypodermic syringe. \"You'll thank me for this, Em.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLola pulled the cap off the syringe with her teeth, then drove the needle into Emily's thigh muscle and pressed the plunger. Emily cried out in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was in that needle?\" Aaron asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer came as Emily's cries lessened. Her skin lightened to the tone it had before the Alpha Kappa party, her breasts became smaller, and her hair became shorter and blonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily's coming back to normal?\" Aaron asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost,\" Lola replied. Emily's hair was waist-length, longer than it had been, and her breasts were now big enough for an F-cup. Lola would need to loan Emily her bras until she could get her own. However, the fact that Emily was trying to cover her naked body indicated that her lust was back under control. Throwing a towel over her, Lola said, \"Thanks for your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Aaron left, Emily recovered her voice. \"I thought you said an antidote was years away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little white lie,\" Lola said, holding her fingers a short distance apart. \"I didn't want to get your hopes up, and then find out I couldn't get my hands on it.\" She went to the mini-fridge, and got a granola bar and a water bottle for Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily gulped down half the bottle before she asked, \"What did you have to do to get it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you later, kiddo. How you feeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not chasing that guy down. Believe me, if you hadn't come back when you did, I would've been on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Emily had finished the water and the granola bar, she went to sleep, followed soon by Lola.</span></div></div>",

Ethan realized how much he already owed her. Twice now he had gotten into some serious trouble and she bailed him out. Fortunately her drug seemed to keep that hyper sexual side of Emily at bay. He hated how little control he had while in that body. At least his day was still his own. Emily's body was still a bit more sensitive and sexual than normal but it was something he could at least deal with now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting some breakfast Ethan went to his first class. It was boring like usual as he went to his two classes. His third class was his last one of the day and it finished right around lunch time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ethan sat and looked to the clock he was barely listening to the professor thinking about what he wanted for lunch. Class was almost done as Ethan yawned as he scratched the back of his head for a second. He felt a strange itch as he noticed his hair seemed to be longer than it should be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe itch was only getting worse as Ethan noticed several odd looks coming his direction. Getting nervous Ethan felt hair touching the bottom of his neck. Much longer than it should be....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell suddenly rang as Ethan bolted out of the class like it was on fire...Almost sprinting he found a small private bathroom and locked himself inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on?!\" Ethan asked as he looked in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his shock and surprise his hair was still growing just like during a change...His medium brown hair was still growing already reaching his shoulders. The roots were also turning a bright blonde and spreading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't right! It's still just mid day!\" Ethan called out seeing his change. Something was causing a much earlier change in him. What was worse was this change was slower than his normal ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan hunched over as he grabbed his sides and let out a small grunt of pain. He could feel a pressure building up in his hips and butt. His nipples were also getting larger and more erect poking through the white tank top he was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf all the days to wear a white tank top and his baggy jeans this had to happen. Emily wouldn't be able to fit in these clothes at all. Her breasts were far to big now and these pants would just fall off her small frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting on his phone he called Lola for help. Maybe she could come meet him. However she didn't answer as he called. He sent a text shortly after as his finger nails started to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lola something is wrong I'm started to change!\" He types and sent to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were several knocks on the bathroom door as Ethan began to worry. He could see the tissue in his chest was just beginning to swell. At this rate he would finish changing in about ten minutes. He could try and make it back to his dorm but that was on the other side of campus. Or he could just wait out the change here but that would leave Emily exposed by herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should Ethan do?</span></div></div>",

You OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand,\" Ethan said, hearing the change in his voice. \"Why am I changing at noon? And why is it taking so long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From what I understand, the medication is still highly experimental. What's happening to you must be a side effect. Can you make it to the dorm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. But my shirt wasn't made for Emily's tits, and her hips won't hold up my jeans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go as fast as you can. Hold your pants up, if you have to. I'll meet you there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan hung up. The hem of his shirt was riding up as his breasts grew. <i>The door's out of the question,</i> he thought. <i>I'll have to go out the window.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened the window and climbed out, thankful it was the ground floor. His hair was now waist length and blond, and he could feel his shoes becoming roomier. Kicking them off, he began to run, one hand holding his shoes, the other holding his belt. <i>Now I know why Lola wears a sports bra.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no way to tell how many people were watching as this figure ran across the campus. The fabric of the shirt started to give way about three-quarters of the way to the dorm, showing breasts to anyone around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final change hit just before Edwards reached the dorm building, and it was Emily who reached the door just as Lola was opening it. \"What a day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's an understatement,\" Lola said. \"C'mon, let's get you inside and dressed, before campus police writes you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily tore off the ruined shirt with both hands, letting the jeans fall to the ground, leaving just Ethan's boxer briefs. \"I didn't expect anything like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither did I,\" Lola said, offering Emily some of her clothes. \"Maybe the chem professor didn't know, since it's so new.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Emily dressed, she asked, \"How did you get it, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Promise it never leaves this room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to let that chem professor fuck my tits.\"</span></div></div>",

Lola helped comb her hair as she gave her a bra to use. Emily wasn't sure how to handle her new larger breasts. Her old breasts may have been big but they were still natural meaning they easy to move around with and moved with her. These new porn star tits were huge perfectly round globes. Emily had to push them in and bend over to even see her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting on her bra and underwear Lola finished up with her hair and helped her do her makeup. Looking at herself in the mirror she looked sexier than even she was used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit I'm so hot! Is it wrong that I am starting to like it? I used to feel so self conscious but now I feel almost empowered.\" Emily asked Lola.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's natural to like how you look. However don't forget who you are. It's still up to you to remain in control.\" Lola said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily nodded and she put on a pair of jean short shorts and a tank top with a yellow blouse over it. She picked some pink flip flops as she was finally ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan still had two classes to finish after lunch. Emily was going to have to in his stead. Taking in a deep breath Emily went outside and headed off towards class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily attendance wasn't taken in his college classes so Emily was able to sneak in without anyone really noticing. Taking a seat in the back Emily tried to keep to herself as best she could. However nothing could prevent the lustful stares of all the boys in the classroom whenever they glanced her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter class was finally over Emily was starving so she went to the cafeteria to go get some dinner. It felt so strange being out in the day as Emily. Everywhere she went people would glance her way or just stare down her chest. The even stranger thing was it didn't really seem to bother her that much. In fact whenever a girl would give her a jealous look Emily almost felt stronger because of it.</span></div></div>",

She still didn't mind being looked at, but she could certainly do without the jerks telling her what she could do with various body parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo disturbed was she by those remarks, that she bumped into somebody getting into line. \"Excuse me,\" she said, \"my mind was a million miles away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay, no harm done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her head out of the clouds, Emily finally recognized him. \"You're Aaron, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right or wrong, I'm Aaron. Good to see you're feeling better.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two picked out their dinners and sat down together. \"I want to thank you,\" Emily said, \"for helping me last night. And I want to apologize for the way I acted. I don't know why I made you grab me like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron nodded. \"It's a good thing your roommate came in when she did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully, the next time I decide you should touch my breasts, it's something we both agree on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they finished eating, Aaron asked, \"Can I walk you home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two walked back to Emily's dorm, talking about this and that. Emily told Aaron a lot about herself, except for the part about her being Ethan. Aaron told Emily about his life before college, and how his cousin was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived at Emily's door, she kissed him, a long and passionate kiss, the kind she hadn't given anyone except Eddie before.</span></div></div>",

How will he react when he finds out what you really are?\" Lola asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll deal with that when the time comes. For now I'm just taking things one step at a time.\" Emily said feeling a bit defensive for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour Emily was getting undressed when a sudden pain hit her chest and stomach. Looking down her breasts were beginning to rapidly shrink as she saw hair sprouting on her arms and legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis sensation was new to Emily. She had never actually experienced a reverse change before. She always reverted back to Ethan while she slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe experience was definitely painfully as Emily fell over as her body grew and stretched back out to her normal male form. Within a few minutes Ethan was back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up Ethan looked over to Lola a bit upset and disturbed. \"What's going on here? My changes are way more in flux than they are supposed to be?\" He said a bit frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Ethan....I said the drug wasn't completely finished. However I could let Emily continue on like that she was on the verge of losing all control. For now all we do is monitor and react as best we can. For now I think the best plan of action will be to carry a backpack with you with a change of clothes in it just in case.\" Lola said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan didn't like this at all. He was now living in a stage of uncertainty and fear that he might change at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were some upsides to this. This was the first time since his changes began he was able to go to sleep male. No more huge breasts causing him discomfort while he slept. However he has also never had to do any morning routine as Emily before either. Either way he took the small bonuses he could get and went off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Her ears even came to small points as fangs could be seen in her mouth. .Her eyes suddenly started to turn a bright yellow color as she felt her climax coming. Letting out a loud moan that sounded like a howl Emily cried out in pleasure as her body shook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is it!\" Aaron said suddenly as he reached down to grab something from his jeans on the floor. Moving with lightning speed Aaron grabbed a small vial of purple liquid from his jeans and quickly poured it into Emily's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily....or rather the beast that Emily was now fell off Aaron and began writhing on the ground in agony. She moaned and growled in pain as if she was on fire making all sorts of inhuman noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron stood up quickly and dressed as he watched Emily begin to change again. This time her body was reverting, becoming more and more human as her beast like features vanished....Her over sexual body began to take on a much more natural shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes Emily was laying on the ground back to her self, well....almost.

If he changes into \"her\" instead of Emily tonight we don't know if he can handle it. It may cause him to make a bad choice and be stuck like that. We both agreed we like how Emily is progressing, we just to help her control her hormones. However I'm afraid....I'm afraid that because Emily has already showed restraint issues that \"she\" might be more than Ethan can handle. You remember your experience right? If I wasn't there to....\" His father explained <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ENOUGH! I understand...\" Mother interrupted. I will go talk with him. He should know the real truth of his condition. I thought changing into a sweet busty blonde girl every night was enough how am I supposed to tell him there is something far more dangerous? I still have nightmares about Susan...\" Mom said as tears welled up in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad walked over and held mother tightly to consol her. \"I know sweetie. Your sister made her choice.

They awaited the moon and darkness to see what kind of changes this new cycle would bring....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they saw the moon rise Ethan closed his eyes and waited for the familar sensations to take hold. He waited as he stood there until he felt...:nothing.....nothing at all....he wasn't changing into anything, not even Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm wasn't something supposed to happen?\" Jessica asked as Ethan looked back and shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm yeah....I don't feel anything not even the normal changes.\" Ethan replied as they went back and sat down together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning over Jessica placed her hand on his shoulder as Ethan felt a sudden strange jolt hit his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really thought something weird was going to happen.\" Jessica said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah me toooooo.......ahhhh....ohhh:...\" Ethan sudden cried out as the familar sensations hit his body again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time however the changes did not go as planned. Instead of blonde hair growing down his shoulders, long auburn hair was taking his place. Instead of large full D-cups erupting from his chest, perky natural C-cups took their place. His whole body starting to shift and take on a much more feminine frame and one that seemed very VERY similar to Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan felt his face forming as light freckles appeared on his body. His nails grew longer and his skin smoothed out as he finally felt his changes subside. Standing up slowly Ethan saw Jessica standing there looking at him with a wide open jaw. It was like she was  paralyzed with shock as Ethan rushed over to a mirror to see what he had become...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding there in the reflection was not Ethan or the Emily he had gotten used to. Rather standing there was a perfect duplicate of Jessica! Everything down to hair style, nail length, and even.....Ethan felt his clothing beginning to feel weird as it felt tighter. Looking down he saw it looked like it was moving on its own accord as it shifted into a pair of tight yoga pants and tank top....the exact same outfit Jessica was wearing....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How....how is this possible?\" Ethan said as his voice sounded just like Jessica's: walking closer to her even the way he walked and talked sounded like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea....this just redefined the term weird for me....\" Jessica said as she looked at what was now her clone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am going to have to see what my parents know about this....they know more than they are telling....\" Ethan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two spend the rest of their night trying to remain calm and have some fun together but having two people in the same room felt a little weird. Ethan decided to change into something else as he instinctively looked through her drawers and found a nice pretty pink top stashed in the backand slid it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey that's my favorite top how did you find it?!\" Jessica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan looked stunned for a second. \"I don't know I just knew....Its weird I feel like I know a bunch of stuff I shouldn't like.....You have a vibrator hidden in here....\" Ethan said as he opened another drawer and found the female aid hidden behind some clothes. \"I also know you lost your virginity at 16.....not 17.....to....Max Wallace? Really that creepy guy from junior high? You said you hated him!\" Ethan said as he realized the shocked and horrified look on Jessica's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason he had gained access to many if Jessica's memories while in her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding it was best to forget everything they just talked about the two girls hurried off to bed as Ethan couldn't help but run off to the bathroom and get nice sneak peak at Jessica's or rather his naked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards the two fell asleep and morning came shortly after. When the sun came through Ethan awoke to seeing his male form he returned along with his normal clothes. He had no idea how that happened last night but he knew he needed answers.</span></div></div>",

And he even knew things about me that I never told him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on, Mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's something we hoped wouldn't happen. But it is, and it's going to happen three nights a month. When you ovulate, your cell structure becomes unstable. The presence of another woman can throw you off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's why I didn't turn into Emily. But why did I turn into Jessica?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing she touched you before you changed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I did,\" Jessica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When she did that, she imprinted on you. Now, for the next two nights, you'll turn into Jessica.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ethan, I'm sorry,\" Jessica said. \"I wish I knew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It gets worse. When you become her, your mind will become hers even more, to the point where you forget which one of you is Ethan. And, if you become pregnant, you will remain Jessica for the rest of your life, while the original Jessica ceases to exist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are-are you sure about this, Mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"It happened to my sister, Susan. She was like us, a boy who became a girl. But she lost control of herself, became another woman, and became pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we stop this?\" Jessica asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not this month,\" Mom answered. \"After the ovulation part of the cycle, Emily will return. Next month, it will be a clean slate again, with Ethan working from square one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I be sure I'll become Emily when the moon is full?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lock yourself into Emily's room. Being surrounded by Emily's things should promote the change into her in the months to come. And it'll keep you from roaming about if you're not in control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there's no way to keep Ethan from becoming a duplicate of me again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is one way,\" Mom said, \"that would prevent this from happening again for a few months. But the consequences are a bit much, so I wouldn't recommend it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed. \"Ethan won't become Jessica if the real Jessica is pregnant.\"</span></div></div>",

To his dread, the young man instantly grabbed his throat, as he had heard a soft melodic female voice came out of his mouth instead of his deeper register. He sounded softer, smaller, higher pitched now, but the birthday boy's new voice was the least of his worries. Ethan noticed his skin was lighter than before as well, all blemishes seemingly vanished. As if to add more insult to injury his sandy blonde hair also had changed into a deep red color. Looking into the mirror he realized he had changed into a busty red head!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/7b/72/af/7b72af4e0927bdc07b730cf411e98a4e.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I turning into a busty red headed girl!?\" screamed Ethan in his new voice, sounding for all the world like a whiny teeny bopper. He began to shout to the heavens so someone- anyone- would hear the screams of a terrified young woman and come running like a knight in shining armor. \"Help! Help! Help! Hel-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a thunderous clatter of knocks on the other side of the bathroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey?\" asked Ethan's mother Jane rather loudly, a hint of concern and more than a dollop of dread in her quivering voice. \"Please open the door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Ethan considered not unlocking the door and hiding out in the bathroom, or even escaping through the window and run to Eddie's house. After all, those packages of girl clothes. Maybe Mom had something to do with this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Ethan shook his head. No, that way lay madness. He needed his parents to get him to a hospital. He had screamed for help, and he got it. He felt bad about waking up his folks, but this was an emergency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, I'm coming!\" he announced, still wincing at how much he sounded like Jessica, and he reached to unlock the door(To his disappointment, he was now several inches shorter than he had been ten minutes ago and had to stand on the tip of his toes to reach the door latch). He opened the door, quickly grabbing his shirt from the floor to hide his newfound breasts and private area, and stared at Mom and Dad, both of whom were looking down at poor Ethan with a look that was more curious than horrified. Ethan himself was obviously terrified<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something happened to me! I'm really Ethan!\" he announced. \"A few minutes ago, I felt a huge pain in my stomach, and I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan's father, James, made a signal with his hands to stop talking, and so he did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son, we know. Come with us in the kitchen, and we'll talk about it. You're not dying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later, after Ethan had calmed down from his initial shock(He had been hyperventilating without realizing it) and gotten fully dressed. Now swimming in his male clothes, looking impossibly adorable, he sat at the kitchen table with his parents. He glared at both of them with terror,. They seemed more serene than they should be in this insane situation. Then again, they claimed to have all the answers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that the answers made any sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have an atypical genetic structure\" explained his father in a calm, relaxing tone of voice. \"You...you were born with a rare ability where your body is in a constant state of flux, morphing from male to female and back around every 48 hours.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unbelievable\" said Ethan, shaking his head. \u201cI'm a freak. I can never get married, I can never have a driver's license. I probably can never use public bathrooms again. So wait, am I, what do call it, intersex?\" he asked, unsure of the definition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" cut in Jane. \"You're much more unique than that, Ethan. People who are intersex don't fit the typical definition of male of female, like a woman with gonads, or a man with a uterus. You're not that, honey. Physically, you're something unique. Like your dad said, you're one of a kind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I don't want to be one a kind!\u201d Ethan screeched, slamming his now dainty fist down on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The doctor who delivered you called you a genetic clusterfuck\" grinned James sardonically. \"You're both male and female, literally. You're the best of both worlds.You're the only person in the world with your condition. You'll go down in history.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, like the Elephant Man. Is this...is this why you had all of those female clothes that you were hiding from me? You both knew this was going to happen to me?\" asked Ethan with a quivering voice, eyes darting from one to the other in fear. He was holding back tears, not knowing how to deal with the fact that he was a freak. He hated the fact that his sobbing sounded just like a girl crying, as that was one of his secret turn-ons. He never told anyone about the time that he jerked off to a secret recording he made of Jessica in tears after her first break up in middle school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we knew this would happen. We hid it from you until you were ready. On the bright side, apparently you're going to live twice as long as a normal person would\" continued James. \"Every specialist that we took you to said that every time you officially swap sexes, you 'regenerate', for lack of a better word. You age half the amount of a normal person. I'd say that counts as a pretty decent side benefit. I'm jealous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, this is serious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So am I. I have less years in front of me than I do behind me. God, you're so cute when you pout now, Ethan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't want to be cute! Jessica is cute. I'm supposed to be strong and authoritative, because when a boy turns 18, he becomes a man, and now my birthright was stolen from me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ethan, this IS your birthright, and you are a man. But you're also a woman, and right now your male side is waning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This doesn't make any sense! If my dick really goes into hibernation for half the year while I sprout boobs, why didn't this happen earlier? At least during puberty? There were literally no signs at all until just a half hour ago!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane and James both looked at each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't like the answer\" said James. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At this point, nothing would shock me\" stated Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, this isn't going to be easy to explain\" replied Jane. We've kept secrets from you for so long, and now, in retrospect, I wonder why we did. I guess we thought if you grew up having a normal life, just being a kid, we wouldn't be burdening you with unpleasant thoughts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, that I'm a genetic freak of nature? What the hell are you talking about, Mom?\" screeched Ethan. Looking around at his parents, Ethan saw that he had overreacted. \"Sorry\" he said sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo biggie\u201d said Jane, comforting her son/daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ethan\" said James tenderly. \"You consider us your parents, don't you? We've always taken care of you, loved you, fed you, clothed you. We took you to Disneyland and the park and to baseball games. You have a big screen TV in your room. I bought you a car/ My dad never did any of that for me. We tucked you in and told you bed time stories where you were the hero who saved the galaxy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of...course, Dad. What are trying to say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ethan, you were adopted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan looked over to his mother. She also nodded through sad eyes, now reaching out to hold Ethan's hand. Ethan's new hands were so girlish and small that Jane's hands could envelope both of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan looked at both of his parents with exasperation. \"Look, if you're worried that I'm mad at either one of you for keeping me in the dark all of these years, well, I'm not going to lie and say that I'm not. I'm fucking pissed\" he said, trying to sound authoritative. \"That being said, I still love you both so much. You're my mom and dad . I'll never not think of you as my mom and dad. Now please tell me what this has to do with me growing boobs and turning into a girl all of a sudden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames rubbed his eyes and made a soothing sigh. \"You're taking this so much more maturely than we thought you would. I know that if I were going through the same thing, I'd be up the wall. I would have already packed up and left home if I had one day changed sexes and found out that I was adopted. Son, your real birth father was a man named Frank Clayton. Your biological mother's name was Nancy, and she looked just like you, with the red hair and a body to die for. They were both old friends of your mom.\"</span></div></div>",

Frank was in the same graduating class as me when I was your age, and let me tell you, he was a real genius. He won all the science fairs, and aced all of his classes. He was inventing things in his basement workshop that are still probably twenty years ahead of the rest of the world. If only he had been able to secure the patent rights to some of his inventions, he'd probably be one of the richest men in the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So he was a mad scientist?\" replied Ethan sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, he was. Frank had Narcissistic Personality Disorder, and a laundry list of other problems, not all of them his fault. We found that out later. He was so, so intelligent, but so deeply insane. And you don't need me to tell you that genius and madness do not mix well together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And he was a pig too\" shot back James. \"Don't forget that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, he hated women\" Jane nodded, a small smile forming on her lips, as if the offensiveness of Frank had long washed away from Jane's memory and fermented into rose colored nostalgia. \"Like so many men, he objectified us as being good for nothing but sex and something to look at.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, so he was a real life Lex Luthor\" Ethan joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane laughed. \"Only with a full head of hair. If it weren't for the fact that he happened to be handsome, he would not for one second have gotten away with the crap that he did. If Frank were some stereotypical nerd, he'd have been dumped in a garbage can and had lye poured over him by the football team so damn fast, but he was lucky enough to be blessed with good brains AND good looks. As we all know, pretty people can get away with things normal people can't. Thankfully today, creepers aren't tolerated no matter who you are, but the world wasn't so enlightened when we were kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what about my birth mother?\" asked Ethan quietly, enraptured by his mother's story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nancy was a sweet girl. She was in the same graduating class as me. We were friendly with one another, but I wouldn't say that we were friends, which to this day I feel guilty for. If I had been there for her instead of being jealous of her, maybe she wouldn't have been so emotionally vulnerable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, Nancy was very sweet. She was a rich daddy's girl. Captain of the cheerleaders. Not a genius, but not an airhead either, and she was a redhead, just like you. Actually, she looked a lot like a young Christina Hendricks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how did her and this Frank creep get together?\" Ethan asked, inquisitive as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, he sweet talked her, promised her the world. He took her out places, earned her trust. When they got close enough, he let Nancy see what he was building in his basement, and she told me she blanched. He made all of these unrealistic dream like pledges to her, like immortality and eternal youth. He was going to do this, he was going to do that, he was going to move them to Paris and get married at Jim Morrison's grave. He was good at faking romantic gestures, like all sociopaths.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWay to lay it on thick, Mom. I get it, the guy was a douche.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want to hear the story of them or don't you? As I was saying, they did get married when they were nineteen, and they did go to Paris for the wedding ceremony and the honeymoon, but it left your father completely bankrupt. So Frank got a job working in father in law's company, first working in construction, and then he moved up the ladder into a managerial position. Frank didn't go to college because thought he was smarter than the professors, and in many aspects, he probably was. He made you and your mother a lot of money.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did she do for a living?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing. She was a spoiled brat, just hanging around with all the other rich, beautiful people and doing whatever it is they do. She didn't have a job until she was almost thirty. A little bit of modeling, a little bit of media stuff. She appeared on MTV a couple of times, making her rounds on all of these silly dating and game shows. I remember her giggling a lot, because life was but a dream to her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo she was a bimbo? Great\u201d huffed Ethan, inadvertently twirling a lock of his now long hair around his finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u201d said Jane firmly. \u201cShe was not a bimbo, she just enjoyed a privileged life. If you're worried if you will become like your mother, no, you won't. I liked Nancy, but she had a very different personality than you do. I made sure of it. Anyway, moving on. Your father and your grandfather did not get along with one another. Employees and other people attested in court that the two were constantly feuding with each other, Frank because he's a a-hole, and your biological grandfather because, well, he was an a-hole too, but at least a rich and successful one who knew that this guy wasn't right for his daughter. Your grandfather...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait. So if my biological grandfather knew that this guy Frank was bad news, why did he allow them to get married? Couldn't he have threatened to cut off Nancy from receiving money or support if she went through with it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames made a small grin. Jane sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrank...was really, really good at talking his way out of things. He had the devil's tongue. That's how he was able to hide the abuse for so long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh oh\u201d said Ethan softly, not liking the dark turn this conversation took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. He was physically, mentally, emotionally, and sexually abusive towards your mom. You don't need to be told how abusers work. They are able to isolate their victims, make them dependent on their abusers, trick them into believing 'Oh, deep down he really loves me', blah blah blah. And it doesn't even matter how strong willed you are, you can still be suckered into it. Well...now we get to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour father, as I noted, was a scientific genius. He was also an enormous misogynist. Actually, scratch that, he had no respect for human life to being with, but his hatred of women applies to you. You see, when your biological mother became pregnant with you, she immediately began doting on you. She had always wanted a child, a daughter, to dote on. I know this because of the diaries she kept. It was her goal in life to have a baby and to care for them when she finally sewed her wild oats and grew up, and when she did, she...she became a whole other person. Frank couldn't handle this, apparently. When your birth sex was determined, he, in a childish temper tantrum, said that he wanted a boy instead. Nancy told him that they could try again next time, but Frank wouldn't have it. He then threw himself into a new project downstairs in his workshop. He never told Nancy what it was he was working on, but she could see that it wasn't anything that she could wrap her brain around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was it?\u201d asked Ethan, more enraptured by this story than he had been expecting to be. He was holding onto Jane's hands with a great firmness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe was creating a chemical compound that he would dose Nancy with by putting it in her food and drink. It would...it would reverse the birth sex of their child...you. You were originally a girl. He wanted a boy because he just wanted to control her, and when he dosed Nancy, he was mucking around with your genetic material, warping it. Turning X's into Y's, and all that jazz.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my God, I was born from a mad science experiment\u201d whispered Ethan in a voice so low, even he could barely hear it, though his parents could read lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is like some bad movie from the 60s\u201d said Ethan. \u201cThis is like something that dude who wrote The Stepford Wives would write.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's all real, Ethan\u201d said James with an air of seriousness, but not a lack of warmth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is something else...the process wasn't...well....it didn't go exactly as hit father planned. It's how you wound up in our care.\" Ethan's father said as he grew even more nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The process was meant to change your gender permanently  in the womb but instead you came out like normal. However shortly after your birth you began to switch genders rapidly every few hours intact. The doctors didn't think you were going to survive because of the  physical strain on your infant body. Your father, both ashamed and disappointed in you couldn't deal with the sight of his failure and wanted to give you up. We couldn't let that happen and convinced him to let us care for you as our own. He agreed and you came home with us. We struggled to handle you the first few months as your rapid gender changes caused you great pain and you cried almost all the time. However eventually the changes slowed and slowed until eventually you settled on your male gender seemingly permanently. After that you were a regular baby like any other. We told your father but still only saw a failed experiment and refused you. He also warned us the condition may return one day so we have been prepping for this moment since.\" Your father explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does this mean for me?\" Ethan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From our estimates we believe you will be changing genders roughly every 48 hours, give or take. We can't be 100% sure but that's the timeline we have now.\" He replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what I have to live two lives now? Boy Ethan and girl Ethan sharing the same body?\" Ethan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless\", Jane corrected, \"you want to change your name to something more feminine. I've always preferred Emily as a name for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear\" countered Dad, \"we can discuss the idea of deadnaming with Ethan another time. He's clearly still quite attached to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what happens next?\u201d asked Ethan to his mother, not even wanting to consider changing his name, nor using female pronouns despite his very female body. Jane continued.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well, lets just say that your condition did not go unnoticed by the hospital staff. You were born at exactly 3:30 P.M on May 22nd, 1999, at St. Agne's Catholic Hospital. I know this because your birth was printed in all of the local papers. I still have those issues if you want to look at them. They're in the attic. When you began rapidly switching between genders, you became something of a medical oddity. Doctors and other professionals came in from all over the country to investigate you, because what just happened to you in the bathroom? That's physically impossible. It breaks all known laws of science, and yet, here you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't rub it in, Mom\u201d whined Ethan, now staring with mild disdain at her slender, pale, freckled arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cEventually journalists of all stripes came in to take pictures of you, the miracle child. Before your grandparents nixed the idea, there was even going to be a NOVA documentary on PBS about you. But when Nancy had casually brought up Frank's secretive behaviors in his laboratory in front of a crowd of reporters, as well as his erratic behavior, well...that's when the heat became too hot for Frank. All that press attention gave your grandparents, all of the ammunition that they needed to try and break up your Mom and Dad. Your grandfather in particular was suspicious from the start that Frank had done something malicious to you, and now they had people to dig dirt on Frank for free, well, they jumped at the opportunity. Eventually, Frank's abusive behavior and what he had done to you came to light, and a warrant was issued for his arrest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan smiled, now shaking his head. \u201cThis just keeps getting weirder and weirder. First you tell me that I'm doomed to live with two genders for the rest of my life, and now you're telling me my real dad was Heisenberg from Breaking Bad.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm your real dad, sweetie\u201d said James, putting his hand on top of his wife's, sitting on top of Ethan's. \u201cHe may have been your father, but he's not your daddy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan giggled, then caught himself, as he was not a giggler. He wondered interally whether his biological mother giggled a lot too, but Ethan kept that thought to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour dad's life was nothing so dramatic as the ballad of Walter White, but sometimes it was close\u201d Jane joked. \u201cAs soon as you started to attracting big scale, nation-wide attention, his survival instincts kicked in. He knew that it wasn't long before something bad happened to him. So one evening, he managed to convince the staff of the nursery to let him hold you. After all, he WAS your father. So he held you, and he asked in the most sincere of ways if he could walk around the hospital with you. As you had not changed sexes within the last few hours, you were peacefully asleep in your little pink blanket, with not a care in the world. Frank walked down the hallway, and calmly left the hospital. He didn't take off in his own car, but had some guy pick him up.  That's when he came to our house and dropped you off. I hadn't kept in contact with Frank since high school, but somehow, he knew where we lived. Which, now that I think about it, is the creepiest part of this story.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that's when he told you all of this, and handed me over to you?\u201d asked Ethan, finally piecing everything together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly. You got it. Except for one minor detail. The reason that your constant gender swaps slowed down was because he gave us his instructions, instructions that he wrote down himself, to try and stabilize your condition. Remember that icky green medicine that we used to make you take when you were a kid?? Well, my old friend Holly, who was also a chemist, and was willing to do me a huge solid and never tell anyone about this, and is a chemist to boot, well, she followed Frank's instructions and created that medicine for you. But now that you're an adult, your body is, I dunno, I guess somehow you're now immune to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan blinked. \u201cThis is going to take a LONG time for me to process. All these years, I've been kept in the dark about my entire life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane continued. \u201cIt gets better. But that's when Frank left with that mysterious man, never to be seen again. He's been missing for eighteen years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan's eyes widened in a surprised gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u201d the boy turned girl said silently with her bee stung lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, your kidnapping was immediately blasted all over the news, and we turned ourselves in. We explained to the authorities what had happened, and thank goodness, we had an alibi from several of our neighbors that Frank had forced his way in and practically shoved you in our faces, otherwise we'd be in jail right now, and not taking care you. So after all what had happened to you, and to Nancy, and to us, and all of the media coverage, Nancy's parents just wanted all of this press attention to just go away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that\u201d James added \u201cis when we met your mother.\u201d </span></div></div>",

Even if you had never known her something was obvious that whatever fate had befallen her wasn't pleasant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We met your mother.... or at least we met the woman she had become.\" James said as Ethan looked a bit worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Ethan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're father was a smart, if not evil man. He couldn't let someone like your mother run around knowing his secrets. She was too much of a liability. However he still loved her so he couldn't just kill her. So he decided to...change her into someone else.\" James said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean change her? Change like I do?\" Ethan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No she is still very much a woman....however she has no memory of you, your father, or even HAVING a child. Your father used a series of powerful drugs similar to the ones on you to change her mind and body. He erased her memories and left a little more than a blank slate. We followed the trail left behind by your father which led us to a...dance....club. There we met her. Or at least what she became. I think she goes by Bunny now. We tried to talk with her but she had no memory of the last several years  at all. We decided it was best if she didn't find out about you or the truth. In a way she was the most free person involved here. No guilt, no sadnes, just.....nothing really.\" James said chocking up a bit the memory still a bit painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...my father is a mad scientist who has vanished, my mother is a brain washed rich girl turned stripper somewhere in another state with no memory of me. Did I miss anything? Any aliens? Any ancient spirits coming for me?\" Ethan said in an angry sarcastic voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen son....I know it's tough but it's the truth. We still love you. Your mother and I both still love you.\" James said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow we will go shopping and teach you a bit more about being a woman.\" Your mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen this whole story had wiped me out....I need some time alone to think.\" Ethan said going upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlone in his room Ethan stared at the busty redhead girl looking back to him. He kept waiting for this all the end like it was some kind of dream or nightmare. Laying down on the bed the weight of his new boobs caused a bit of discomfort as he pulled out his phone and distracted himself for awhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever the feeling of anxiety hadn't left him. Getting up Ethan walking over to the box of clothes given to him as a gift. He pulled out a few blouses, skirts and a rather sexy pair of panties and a bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath Ethan looked at himself in the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay....if we are gonna do this....we are going to have to be all in...remember it's your body now.\" He said as he slowly took off his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit! This body is....hot!\" Ethan thought to himself as he examined his full naked body for he first time. His large breasts and hourglass figure were his definite standout features. His firey red hair also was very unique. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the clothes he began to put them on. Luckily he didn't have much trouble as he looked at himself, or rather herself now. She looked like a very sexy young woman. Making one more mental note Ethan walked downstairs to show his parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he revealed himself fully to them downstairs his parents were a bit shocked at how feminine he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey you looked beautiful.\" His mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Ethan, you look amazing.\" His dad agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually....I've made a choice. While I am like this I want to be called Emily. I am willing to give this dual life thing a try for now, so I want to think of and consider myself a woman whenever I am like this.\" Emily said trying to take a confident stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that's very wise.\" His dad said as Emily's parents looked to her proud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n..........<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Somewhere in a hidden lab a scientist is monitoring what looks like vital signs. His computer prints out some information which he takes to another older scientist)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir the results are in. Stage one was a success. Subject XYZ has begun their first transformation.\" The younger man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. Monitor her and begin prepping the subject for stage two.\" The older man said with an evil grin.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Emily and her parents enjoyed one more familial embrace and hugged each other tightly, the emotional baggage subsiding from each of them in a barrage of love. James and Jane were so happy that their son/daughter was taking the news so well, although they were sure that it would take quite a while before he/she TRULY adjusted to their bizarre new life schedule. Quietly, tenderly, they eventually let go of one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter all of this crazy drama, I think I could do with one more slice of cake. You know, for the road\u201d said Emily glibly, obviously trying to hold back tears. Conversely, she was smiling for the first time since her transformation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got it. After what you just went through, I think some extra cake is in order\u201d said her father. \u201cLike getting your tonsils taken out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane cut her daughter a big slice and grabbed a fresh plate and fork for Emily. As Emily sat down to eat the moist goodness, she began unconsciously playing with her hair with her right hand while she forked down chocolate birthday cake with her left. James had also noticed this, and looked his wife knowingly straight in the eyes. She was already taking after Nancy's mannerisms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily looked up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, her mouth full of sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing\u201d said both parents in unison,both turning sheepishly around to avoid further inquiry, James whistling Starman by David Bowie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime after 2:30 A.M, Emily yawned quite loudly and patted her now svelte but nonetheless stuffed belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that's a birthday I'm definitely going to remember for the rest of my life. Thanks so much for a great day and for laying all the cards out on the table, guys. I don't know what I would have done if you all hadn't told me. Probably jump off a bridge somewhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames and Jane gave their the \u201cconcerned\u201d look parents give when their children joke about suicide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKidding\u201d grinned Emily slightly. \u201cBut seriously, I think I'm gonna hit the hay now. Night Mom and Dad!\u201d. Emily gave her parents one last hug a piece, and surprisingly, a peck on the cheek to both as well. James and Jane, who themselves were wiped out after the night's revelations and outpouring of emotions, were bushed as well, and all three members of the Edwards household went upstairs to get some much needed shut eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Emily locked her bedroom door behind her, she peeled off her new girlish clothes and stripped in front of the mirror to just her panties and bra, wondering whether women normally slept with underwear on or took them off like men did, as Ethan had liked to sleep in the nude himself. She pulled out a nighty that her parents had gotten her as part of the \u201ctransition\u201d package, as well as a cute mint green girl's pajama set, examining both choices in each hand. Emily eventually chose the PJ's to put on, just  out of the curiosity to see what they felt like. She stepped in one leg at a time, noticing for the first time her large heart shaped ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs my ass really that big? Meh, I like girls with a little junk in the trunk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily then buttoned up the top and pulled out her tangles of red locks through the collar. Overall, she looked super cute, and if Ethan had still been himself, the reflection he saw in the  mirror was of a girl he would normally lust furiously over. Although maybe there was a bit too much camel toe showing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow!\u201d moaned Emily, distracting herself, as the silky pajamas rubbed sensuously against her newly smooth, hairless skin. \u201cI could get used to this!\u201d she said, rubbing her hands up and down her new curvaceous body. She felt amazing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcited by the possibilities, Emily then jumped onto the bed, put her hand down her pajama bottoms and touched her new sex for the first time. As Ethan, Emily had heard that female orgasms are much more intense than male ones, and if Emily's squealing was any indication, the rumors were true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new girl masturbated herself into a deep sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA million little unconscious thoughts ran through Emily's head that night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ethan, he had never exactly been Mr. Universe. He wasn't bad looking as Ethan. He got by, but Ethan had never felt like he was impressive enough to attract girls. Easy Going Ethan was his nickname. Steady, friendly, dependable Ethan. Among his social circle, Ethan was perhaps the most academically studious one.  He wasn't a geek or a nerd, just serious minded, and among his \u201cinner circle\u201d of Eddie and Jessica, he was the only one bound for college in the fall. Ethan was the guy who helped you out with your math homework and was a shoulder to cry on when your studly boyfriend broke up with you to chase cheerleader tail. Forever friendzoned, forever a bridesmaid and never a bride, although Ethan correctly suspected that could just be his anxiety and low self esteem talking. The Ethan part of the brain shared by two identities was exciting for the possibilities of what Emily would become. Could she be a totally different person from him? The uninhibited, wild side that Ethan felt that he needed to repress as a boy? After all, the body of his Emily persona was on a whole other level. His birth mother must have been a real world class hottie to have given birth to someone like the curvaceous little minx inhabiting Ethan's bed right now. The only girl who could possibly compete with Emily physically was Amy Wu, a drop dead gorgeous half-Irish, half-Chinese girl who's father was a doctor and always threw the best house parties because her family was loaded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily also went back to what her mother had told her. That she was the only person in the world with this condition. Literally one in seven billion+. It was astonishing to think of, and Emily just imagined how she was going to explain all of this to her friends tomorrow.</span></div></div>",

Normally yes, you would have to learn shaving and waxing. However your condition prevents any body hair from growing on you. It's by design actually. Your body will always been smooth skinned, the exception to this is your normal hair. It will still continue to grow normally and will require normal daily Maintenance. The same applies for your nails.\" Her mom told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No shaving? Sweet! So what all do I have to learn?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's start with hair, then we will learn how to do makeup. Go ahead and jump in the shower once you are done we will begin.\" Her mom explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next hour or so Emily followed her mother's instructions. She showered trying to ignore how sensitive her skin seemed now. After the shower her mom showed her how to dry and style her hair. After they she showed her how to do makeup and then how to paint her nails. It was a rather long process, far more than Emily had guessed. When she was finally all done Emily was a bit stunned at just how pretty she looked. It was impressive just how much of a difference a little clean up and makeup could make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm her room Emily was deciding on an outfit to wear. This would be her first time in public as girl. Part of her was saying to go conservative. Wear some simple jeans and a t shirt and ease into this. No need to go crazy. However....another part,  A newer stronger was saying some else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are sexy now....show it off. Make those other girls jealous. Get those winks from the guys. Be the firey red bombshell you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting her lip gently Emily decided to risk it. After slipping on her underwear she grabbed a black skirt that came a little before her mid thigh. She also grabbed a red blouse that exposed part of her mid drift and showed a decent amount of cleavage. While not super slutty she definitely looked hot as Emily finished putting on a some red lipstick that matched her firey red hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly was the question of shoes. Simple flip flops were the easy choice. However there was a pair of black heels in the box. Not too extreme about three inches. Exposed toes with pretty flexible soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe figured she had come this far no room to back out now. Slipping on the heels Emily expected to fall over and have balance troubles but something else happened....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily couldn't explain it....the second she slipped the heels on her feet and balance seemed to automatically correct itself. She had no troubles at all standing and walking around. It was like muscle memory, like riding a bike. She just....knew....The heels didn't hurt at all and strangely they even seemed really comfortable to her. Her hips even had a natural seductive sway when she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe its part of my conditioning?\" She thought. I mean if her body could be programmed to not grow hair it might be programmed to have a natural affinity for heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing outside she felt confident and powerful for the first time in her. Something Ethan rarely ever felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom was a bit stunned at her clothing choice but didn't object. She respected Emily's choices to figure it what kind of girl she was going to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls soon headed off together towards the mall for a day Emily was sure to never forget. </span></div></div>",

Well we were waiting for this day but I think it best if Ethan explains it now. We made sure to tell him once it was over.\u201d His father said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments passed as Eddie and Jessica waited. To their shock a girl emerged from Ethan\u2019s room. She was strangely familiar looking. Very similar to what Ethan would have looked like if born a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey guys...\u201d She said in a familiar tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took them a moment to realize it as Jessica and Eddie looked at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god...Ethan is that you?\u201d Eddie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah...it\u2019s a long story.\u201d Ethan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen guys Ethan has a very unique body.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Ethan slept he was plagued by very weird dreams. In the Dream he was in some kind of battle between two giant shadowy monsters. It was like a tug of war as each of them was trying to fight over him. One of the shadows was very masculine in nature and the other very feminine. The battle finally ended as the feminine shadow bested the masculine one. The feminine shadow then picked up Ethan's body and swallowed it whole....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan soon woke up sweating and panting from the dream. He checked himself as he seemed okay. He had never had a dream like that before, it felt so real and lifelike. Laying back down Ethan tried to rest but felt his sheets were itchy. Getting up he turned on the lights as his eyes went wide. There was a small pool of body hair where he was just laying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan rushed to the bathroom to confirm what he had just witnessed. As he feared his body hair was rapidly falling off. All he had to do was brush it with his hands and it would wipe off in clumps. In a mear matter of minutes his entire body was completely hairless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I sick? Was I exposed to some radiation?\" These questions raced through Ethan's mind as he was desperate for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever things only got worse. His head was soon itching too. As he reached up to scratch it a large clump of hair fell off his head. His dark brunette hair, the only feature about himself he cared enough about to style and trim was falling off right before his eyes. Ethan cried out for it to stop but to no avail. Soon he was as bald and smooth as an Olympic diver...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't right what is going on?\" Ethan said out loud seeing his new perfectly smooth body. Little did he know this was just the beginning....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis head soon began to itch again. He could feel hairs beginning push out if his skull as new hair began to grow back on his scalp. He felt a small sigh of relief knowing he wasn't going bald. As Ethan watched new hairs began to sprout and grow on his head, however there was just one problem. They were blonde....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot just any blonde either but bright platinum blonde! As the hair continued to grow it was suddenly longer than his last hair style and still growing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is happening to me?\" Ethan asked as he grasped his new golden locks as they continued to grow. Within a minute they were touching his shoulders and still growing. Another minute and his hair was now past his mid back. The long perfectly straight platinum blonde locks flowing around him. The hair finally stopped growing when it was just a little past his hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This....isn't real....please wake up.\" Ethan said trying to wake up from a dream. To his horror this was just the beginning for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strange tingling sensation began to swarm all over Ethan's skin as it began to feel a bit warmer. Looking down Ethan could see his rather pale white skin tone was beginning to get tan. A perfect sun kissed tan began to take its place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changes began to speed up before Ethan could get a chance to react to them. The strange feeling spread to his hands next. Ethan began to hear a strange popping noise as he felt his fingernails begin to grow. They were stretching out as they not only grew they changed shape. They became well trimmed and manicured looking. Like a girls...:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan began to pick up on what was happening now as he tries to reject it. He tried to play it off like denial as he stared at his new nails.This denial was quickly shattered when a sharp popping sensation hit his hands next. They were beginning to shrink as his fingers got thinner and his hands turned into a very feminine shape. He now had a very female pair of hands attached to his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point Ethan was going to call out for help when another sudden popping hit his feet causing him to suddenly fall down on back. Looking down his feet seemed to be next as they were beginning to shrink. Reforming into a dainty feminine shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan tried to stand up but the sensations were too intense. The change was beginning to spread up his legs next as they began shift and reform. His fat tissue and muscles were moving around as his legs got thinner and more feminine. After just a few minutes he saw a pair of sexy female legs where his just were...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe excess fat tissue from his legs and thighs seemed to be moving up as a pressure began building up in his hips. There was a sudden loud cracking and popping noise as Ethan saw his hips pushing outward. They began expanding as Ethan rolled over to try and relieve the pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying his best to deal with excruciating transformation Ethan could feel a pressure building up in his rear as he realized where all the excess fat tissue from his lower half was about to be stored. Within seconds Ethan's butt began to swell and expand, taking on a larger and perfect tear drop shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrying out at his new lower half Ethan rolled back over as his new butt lifted him higher off the ground. The change was soon spreading to up more as he could feel his stomach beginning to contract. His stomach began to suck in leaving a flat and smooth tummy as the excess fat and muscle began draining from his arms as well as they got thinner and leaner. Ethan cried out as his rib cage popped and shrunk in giving him a leaner frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan watched as the excess fat tissue from his upper body began shifting and moving around his chest as it seemed it be all gathering together and heading for two spots underneath his nipples....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No please! Not this!\" Ethan cried out in vain as he watched the development of what were undeniably breasts forming on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started with his nipples as they Frey very erect and expanded two or three times in diameter. Next the flesh underneath began to swell as they slowly began rising off his chest. Within seconds they were past A-cups and than past B-cups. As they reached C-cups they began to take on a much rounder shape. Soon they were full sized D-cups. Perfectly prominent and rounded. They hung perfectly from his chest causing an obstruction of the view of the rest of his body. Their growth refused to stop however as they surged another cup size larger hitting full DD cup size when they finally stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe change was reaching its final stages as Ethan covered his face feeling his cheekbones and facial structure begin to change. His voice began to crack as his Adam's apple disappeared. His voice sounded much lighter and feminine. His nose and ears shrank as his cheekbones pulled in a bit. His nose grew smaller as his lips got poutier and more lucious. Within minutes a new female face has replaced his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was just one final thing that needed changed and Ethan knew it was the only thing that really mattered.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching down between his legs Ethan could feel a strange slit forming. His balls were also beginning to feel deflated like popped balloons. Desperate to hold on to his manhood Ethan tried to hold on to them only to feel them slither away between his new dainty fingers and up inside his new warm slit....The shaft soon followed as it shrunk and slithered away. It crawled up inside him as it left behind a nice clit which formed the top of his new womanhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe change was complete....His whole body felt like jelly as Ethan tried to stand and recover from the transformation. Very slowly he stood up regaining his balance as best he could. Finally he managed to get up as he stared at his new reflection in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B9HFQ2OCUAA0bTj.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B9HFQ2OCUAA0...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person staring back at him was not himself. It was a very sexy, busty blonde girl. She looked like a model or pin up girl. Her large fork breasts, perfect figure and sexy physique was something he had only seen online before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan was shocked and stunned barely able to even comprehend what just happened to him. It was then he heard something. A noise from behind as he turned around to see his parents staring right at him. </span></div></div>",

Her body and desires will be far too sexual for her to normally adjust!\u201d Her Mom said in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. She has us and good friends to help her. We will adjust with her. However it takes.\u201d Her Dad replied. </span></div></div>",

Those extra packages just wouldn't get off his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, he probably wouldn't be too disturbed, but his parents seemed pretty skittish about it. That was enough to trip some alarms in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What could they be hiding?\" he hummed to himself as he laid in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was already ready for bed and all, wearing his typical shirt and pants for the night. Still, the idea of just what was happening just had him laying down with his eyes still open. It was kind of frustrating to be fully honest. Part of him considered going downstairs to check them out right now, but he wasn't sure if they were worth the risk honestly. Then again, it wouldn't be the first time he crept downstairs to check something out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, at this rate, it'd probably be morning before he actually got any sleep. It wasn't even midnight yet and it felt like forever. At least all the cake from earlier had settled down so he didn't feel like he was going to explode. Although...his stomach did still feel a little odd for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, probably a little indigestion,\" he reasoned, slowly getting up. \"Maybe I should get something to drink. Just in case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he walked over to the bathroom just across from his room, shutting the door and turning the lights on. He casually got the cup and filled it with water, taking a small drink of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, much better,\" he sighed a bit. A little water always helped at this time of night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know...while he was up, perhaps he should go down and try to sneak a peak at at least one of the presents. Maybe just one would.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UGH!\" he suddenly lurched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoah...what was that feeling suddenly coming from his stomach. Surely it wasn't the water he just had right? No, this felt like something else, like....something was moving inside, but he couldn't tell what. He wasn't throwing up, so it couldn't be an illness or anything could it? Ugh, all these questions with no answers were pretty frustrating for one night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should just...\" he said, considering just going back to bed and waiting it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that train of thought soon subsided once something flew into his face. A lock of hair.....wait...he never had hair long enough to be in his face like that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's...going on?\" Ethan said, his hand coming up to the elongated pieces of hair.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWhat the....?\u201d Ethan said looking at the locks of hair falling in front of his face. Ethan\u2019s reddish brown hair had always been kept short. Rushing off to the bathroom Ethan felt anther felt another surge of pain in his gut. It felt like his organs were moving around inside as if trying to make room for something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his shock Ethan saw his hair had indeed grown longer. It was past his ears now and still growing! What was even more strange was that the roots of the new hair growing out were black, not his normal reddish  brown. Ethan could only watch as the hair grew longer and longer, past his shoulders and not stopping till it reached his mid back.  If he didn\u2019t know better he would say it looked like a girls hairstyle....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother surge of pain hit Ethan\u2019s body causing him to fall to his hands and knees. This time his whole body felt like it was churning all over. Soon Ethan\u2019s body began to pulse as bones began to crack and reshape all over his body.  The whole room was beginning to look bigger as Ethan\u2019s body began to shrink. He went from a nice 6\u20190 all the way down to 5\u20194. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis skin began to lose color becoming paler and whiter. His body hair also began to withdraw, sucking itself back into his body and leaving only smooth skin behind. His fingernails also began to grow longer and strangely well manicured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis clothes were getting too baggy and loose on his lighter form as Ethan struggled to pull off his clothes to get a better look at his changing body. Rolling into his back he stared down at himself in shock and horror at what he saw. His body was turning female!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach has already pulled in becoming flatter while his legs grew thinner. His hips had widened and pushed outwards giving him a more hourglass figure. Ethan felt himself being slowly pushed on the ground a bit on his backside as he realized t was his butt beginning to swell and take in a more heart like shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan tried calling for help but all that came out was a high pitched moan as his Adam\u2019s apple shrunk changing his voice to a very high pitched feminine tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan could feel the pressure building in his chest as he feared what was next. The flesh around his pecs was beginning to soften and swell, pushing out slowly. His new breasts began to rise as his nipples grew in proportion. They quickly surged past A-cup and B-cup ranges pulsing and growing with every breath. Soon they were C-cups and then D cups, as they began to block his vision. They had one last push in them rounding out at nice well rounded DD cups that looked perfectly round and perky despite their size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan\u2019s face soon reformed as well taking on a feminine look and appearance to match his voice. The final change was the worse thoughz Ethan could feel his manhood shrinking and sliding away from him as a new wet and warm slit began to form and take its place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes past before Ethan was able to finally stand and look at his new body. Upon seeing himself in a mirror Ethan almost fainted. Not only had he turned into a girl he had turned into a sexy and busty Asian girl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img004.lazygirls.info/people/bor_chi/bor_chi_bor_chi_02_2R4Z9mL.sized.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://img004.lazygirls.info/people/bor_...</a></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"W-What?!\" Ethan cried out, his, or rather her, voice distinctly feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis....this couldn't be real right? T-There's just no way that he just turned into a girl, an Asian one at that. That would border on some kind of magic, or extreme delusion, or perhaps both. Ethan put both of his hands on his head, feeling around every angle of his smooth face. Heck, he even tried the old cliche and pinched himself, to which he opened up his eyes to the same reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Asian girl in there was undeniably cute and sexy. Even Ethan couldn't get over that. His clothes were just barely hanging on, as his pajama pants would easily fall to the ground if he let go right now. Course, he still wanted to believe that he was just having the strangest dream imaginable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I should....just go to sleep....\" he said slowly, taking deep breaths. \"I'll wake up....and this won't...have happened...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, he wondered who he was trying to convince: him or someone else. Eh, it didn't matter. Anything to get this nightmare over with. However, right as he opened the bathroom door....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Ethan,\" spoke Jennifer, Ethan's mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan immediately squeaked at the sudden appearance of his parents, enough for him to accidentally drop his pajama pants and underwear, showing off the new womanhood underneath. Blushing madly, Ethan reached down and pulled them back up, inadvertently making his too big pajama top show off some of his large breasts in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This....this isn't what it seems like!\" Ethan squeaked out again. Boy was this new voice high, almost like something out of an anime. \"I just....!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know, Ethan,\" Thomas, the dad, sighed. He seemed to be looking Ethan over carefully. \"Let's go downstairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? W-Why?\" Ethan choked out, clearly confused. Why were they so calm? He'd figured that they'd be shocked and wondering who this Asian girl was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll explain,\" Jennifer said, though she had a small smile, like one of acceptance. \"Here. Put these on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, she had some clothes in her arms, which were a tight top, panties, and some small shorts. Ethan looked at his mom like she had grown a second head, but she just insisted that he put them on and come downstairs. Begrudgingly, he accepted them, if nothing else just to get to the bottom of what was happening. Once his parents gave him some privacy, he removed his big pajama shirt and put on the tight top. It was sleeveless and felt really tight. Heck, it showed off some midriff and made his breasts look bigger honestly. Plus, he noticed there was no bra or anything so his nipples showed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is ridiculous. It's got to be a dream...\" he sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing on, he put the panties and shorts on next. They weren't too hard, though navigating his large hips and butt made things a bit of an adventure. Still, he got them on, sighing at his appearance in the mirror before slowly walking downstairs to see his parents in the family room. Curiously, there was an open box nearby. Ethan noticed it as one of the presents he'd seen earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" Ethan asked, coming closer as he took a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...those clothes are part of your present,\" Jennifer explained. \"Truth is...we've been preparing for this day for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Wait, what?! They knew this was going to happen? What in the world did that mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Ethan reiterated those thoughts out loud.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sitting down at the table his parents got ready to explain to Ethan the truth about his condition. They obviously knew this would happen and they prepared for it for sometime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...\u201d Ethan said trying to break the uncomfortable silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I guess we should start at the beginning right dear?\u201d Jennifer asked Thomas who gave her a slight nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSweetie....you were born very different, very special from other kids. You were born with a very rare extra chromosome called the XYZ. It was the result of the genetic experiments done to your father and I so we could  conceive you.\u201d Jennifer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mother and I struggled for a long time to have a child. For awhile things seemed hopeless. Then a doctor came to us with a new experimental treatment. Parts of our reproductive DNA which were unhealthy and preventing us from having kids would be replaced with new healthy parts from healthy donors. The good news the procedure worked. We were able to get pregnant within weeks. However there was an unforeseen side effect.\u201d Thomas said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe process of altering our DNA mixed with others created an instability in the embryo. The chromosomes which determined your gender were in a constant state of flux. After you were born you changed genders rapidly. Multiple times a day. The doctors hoped eventually your condition would stabilize but it didn\u2019t. The stress of the transformations would have proven fatal on your infant body eventually. Luther doctors managed to come with a medical treatment that kept your chromosomes locked. You stayed male after that. However they warned us as you got older you would eventually develop immunity to the treatment and your condition would return. They predicted right around your 18th birthday so we have been preparing for this for years.\u201d Jennifer explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me sooner? Why surprise me like this!\u201d Ethan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe wanted you growing up normally like every other child. Learning something like this would have changed your life forever.\u201d Thomas explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy am I Asian now?\u201d Ethan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe donors that spliced our DNA were of Asian decent, I think Japan, if I remember right so part of their DNA got encoded onto you..\u201d Jennifer said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long do I have to stay like this? Is there a cure?\u201d Ethan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, there isn\u2019t a cure yet, however we have learned more. Your transformations are going to happen roughly every 24-48 hours. There isn\u2019t an exact timer on them but you will feel the changes coming like before, the transformation usually takes 5-10 minutes as you just experienced. If you are lucky you might just change in your sleep. They say that given time you might even learn some sort of control over them.\u201d Thomas said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about....you know....girly problems? Like can I get pregnant?\u201d Ethan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrom what we were told, no, at least not right now. Because your Uterus reverts back when you change it can\u2019t hold a child. However if the changes ever stopped and you became a woman permanently then yes you would develop a normal cycle.\u201d Jennifer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would my changes stop?\u201d Ethan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell the doctors said your condition will most likely stabilize eventually. There is just no telling when yet. It could be weeks, months, or even years from now.\u201d Thomas said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat else should I know?\u201d Ethan asked feeling overwhelmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell now that you are female your body is pumping estrogen into you. Don\u2019t be surprised if you start to develop certain:...new habits.\u201d Jennifer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike what?\u201d Ethan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you might develop an attraction towards boys, you might start to think girly thoughts or desire more girly things like clothes or makeup. This new female side of you might act very differently from your male side. You are still the same person inside but don\u2019t be surprised if you start to think differently over time.\u201d Jennifer said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo where do we go from here? How can I still live my life?\u201d Ethan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell son that\u2019s up to you. We respect your condition if you want to keep it a secret that\u2019s fine, if you want to tell the world that also fine. You have to come to terms with this on your own we are just here to support you.\u201d Thomas said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about tomorrow I take you shopping for some more outfits. I think the bras we got for you are going to be small. I can show you some basics for acting like a girl.\u201d Jennifer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Mom.\u201d Ethan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne last thing, since your a girl now we think it\u2019s best if you have a new name while female. Think of it as a new identity. We were thinking of calling you Emily?\u201d Thomas said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEmily? Yeah that could work.\u201d Emily replied. She felt overwhelmed yet strangely excited as well for the future to come. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At that, the explanations ended, at least for the time being. Emily wasn't too sure about actually feeling a little excited for this. She didn't really know why. Maybe it was the idea of something strange and interesting in an otherwise normal life. Who knew really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, obviously the rest of the presents contained clothes for being a girl, though Jennifer did laugh a bit at how much they underestimated Emily's bust size. They had thought C-cups at the max, as opposed to Emily's DD-cups. That got a bit of a embarrassed blush from her, with the thought of how long her parents had been preparing for this. In any case, at least the pajama top and pants they got were better suited for her, even if the top still showed her bellybutton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How am I supposed.....sigh....\" Emily sighed, trying to pull the top down as much as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as she settled as much as possible into bed, her thoughts continued to be plagued with that of what was going on. She really was a girl. A Japanese girl on top of that. Made her wonder just how they could explain it, though adoption seemed to be the best idea. Kind of made her wonder just who donors were. Probably just some anonymous people somewhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quite much for her, to the point where she didn't even notice when she finally fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****The next morning****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning came oh so quickly, as it typically did. Emily had never felt more groggy as she slowly woke up, stretching a bit. For the briefest of seconds, she wondered if everything could have just been a dream, but a small poke of her huge breasts stopped any chance of that. Yep. Still a girl. Still Japanese. Still Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven getting up felt different, what with the huge butt and hips she was sitting on. The loss of 8 inches of height was also pretty noticeable. She had never noticed just how helpful it was to be 6 feet tall as a boy. Welp, no time to waste anyway. She knew her mom would want to waste no time in getting shopping done, so it was time to jump into the shower. Luckily, all this seemed to have been prepared, as a neat pair of girls clothes were laid out for her, along with new soap and hair shampoo to use. That figured more or less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Emily picked everything up, her eyes traveled to the other gifts she got from her friends. She laughed at how she got sandals from Jessica. Heck, perhaps they actually fit now. She couldn't tell for sure, but her feet did seem to be similarly sized. In any case, she eventually walked out of her room, heading to the bathroom and beginning her typical routine of getting ready. Still, just seeing her nude form in the mirror as the water was warming up was surreal. Understandable though. Who would seriously believe such a tale?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, she went inside the shower, immediately aware of just how sensitive her skin was now, especially her breasts. Nothing painful obviously, but boy was that going to take time to get used to. For the most part, she started normally, trying to be careful with the soap on her skin. It wasn't rocket science, so she liked to think she could figure it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she did though, her thoughts went back to what her parents said about even being affected mentally. Could her interests end up completely changing? Could she really end up being very different compared to now? Heck, would she even begin to start speaking Japanese? None of it made sense, yet nothing about this made sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWelp, as she worked the shampoo into her long hair, she decided to let it slide for now. Worrying now was pointless. Guess she'd just have to deal with it when it came. Speaking of dealing with it....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheesh, how do they handle this hair?\" she groaned, amazed at just how much it took just to wash her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would never complain about girls having to take so long with it again.</span></div></div>",

It was a cute and rather sexy little pink dress with matching heels and underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh, Mom what\u2019s with the dress?\u201d Emily called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s for you sweetie. I want you to wear it today. You need to start learning how to wear and walk in girly clothes. We will be trying on more today as well.\u201d Jennifer replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily was terrified of going out wearing something like this,  the dress only came last her mid thighs and the heels were several inches high so balancing was going to be tough. Her mom did have a point though, she had to learn this at some point...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a heavy sigh Emily pulled on the clothes. The underwear was easy enough except the bra which was a bit too small so it pushed up her heavy breasts more than she wanted. The dress was easy to put on but it made Emily feel very uncomfortable. The empty feeling between her legs felt so strange compared to wearing pants or shorts. Not to mention the generous amount of cleave the dress showed. The heels however took some serious getting used to. Emily got them on easy enough but found herself tripping and stumbling with almost every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow the hell do girls even walk in these?\u201d Emily said stumbling around the house holding onto anything to keep up her balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom Jennifer couldn\u2019t help but laugh watching Emily stumble about. She was wearing a similar outfit as to make Emily feel more comfortable. She showed Emily a few basic walking and balancing tricks to help her walk straight in heels.This helped a bit, but due to her huge breasts weighing her down in the front the balancing took more getting used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019s first?\u201d Emily asked her mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell clothes are definitely on the list, mostly I want to focus on dresses, skirts and heels, the things you aren\u2019t used to. I also have a manicure and pedicure scheduled for us, we also need to go to the lingerie store and get you proper sized bras for those 36 DDs. You decide what\u2019s first.\u201d Jennifer said. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Emily still found it so strange that she was actually here thinking about which to go first. Lingerie or clothes. Granted, she didn't have to think hard on it. The dress was functional enough, but the bra she was wearing....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lingerie first,\" Emily sighed. \"I feel like this thing is going to cut my breathing off eventually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough,\" Jennifer smiled and nodded. \"Well, let's not waste any time then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Emily followed her mom out to her car. Her dad's car was already gone as he was already at work. Emily got into the passenger's side, while her mom got into the driver's seat and got the car moving as per usual. Thankfully, they wouldn't really have to go to a lot of different places as far as clothing was concerned, as the mall had just about all of it in one place. Still, on the way there, Emily kept on fidgeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright?\" Jennifer asked. \"I mean, as much as possible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm okay I guess,\" Emily sighed, adjusting the dress a bit. \"This thing is just so short though. I feel like my underwear would be seen easily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You kind of get used to it,\" Jennifer laughed just a little bit. \"That's pretty normal honestly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess....\" Emily said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thing bothering her was just how weird things felt sitting down. This new butt of hers even made sitting down feel differently, as did her hips. She didn't voice those concerns though. She imagined her mom would heckle her like crazy if she brought that up. After that, she just stayed quiet for the duration of the trip, letting her mom park the car in the parking lot as normally as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk afterwards was basically one big learning session on heels. The flat ground of the house was nothing compared to trying to walk on more uneven ground like a parking lot. More than once, Emily found herself stumbling, thankful her mom was holding her hand to keep her upright. By the time they actually made it to the entrance, she felt like her ankles were sore as heck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, I think we could have saved this for another day,\" Emily sighed, thankful for the more even ground inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But now you already have the practice,\" Jennifer smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, in that case, the two women made a little walk to the lingerie store a little ways inside. Emily had never been inside this before, and she blushed a bit at seeing all the stuff around. Still, she followed Jennifer to where some bras could be found. Finding a few 36DD-cups weren't too hard. Though, seeing how big they were only reminded Emily of just how big her own were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, that's insane,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should be thankful,\" Jennifer laughed a bit. \"Most girls would be crazy for the size you have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, though perhaps a little flattered, Emily walked over to the nearby changing rooms to try the new bras on. She already had an idea thanks to the one she put on earlier. Thankfully, once she did, she actually felt a little relief. The 36-DD-cup bra was a perfect fit, and she didn't feel like she was going to suffocate like before. Satisfied enough, she took it off and handed it to her mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're good,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful,\" Jennifer smiled. \"I'll pay for these now so you can wear one of them immediately. I'm sure that's what you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes it was honestly. Emily let Jennifer go ahead and purchase the bras as well as a pack of panties with them. Once that was done, Jennifer gave her one that matched her pink panties and had that put on before putting the dress back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling better now?\" Jennifer smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, a little bit,\" Emily actually smiled back a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was crazy as heck, but at least spending time with her mom wasn't all bad.</span></div></div>",

She still hates the way her new butt and hips made her walk with a natural sway that caused a few boys to stare at her with lustful eyes on their way back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily had never been stared at so obvious before. As Ethan she was guilty of staring at several hot  girls or sneaking a few peeks here or there. However now being on the receiving end of it felt so different. Part of him hated it, the idea of creepy guys staring lustfully at her creeped her out. However another part of her felt somewhat flattered...It was almost empowering to some degree knowing just how sexy and beautiful of a girl she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile in the car Emily stared down at herself only to be given a view of her large and very visible cleavage. Her new bras were push up ones that showed off her large breasts more giving her a bust a more prominent display. She wasn\u2019t used to not being to see her own feet when she looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later the two women found themselves at a nice clothing store downtown. Jennifer picked out several their dresses, skirts, heels, blouses, and shirt shorts to try on. Emily grudgingly tried them all on and she tried to ignore the fact that she was having a surprising amount of fun. She even found herself checking herself out in the mirror several times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter picking out several combinations that she liked Jennifer came to her with one last item. It was a blue striped bikini. What was worse was it looked like it was designed to show off the boobs and butt area specifically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmm, What is that?\u201d Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a swimsuit silly. You are going to need one and this is in your size.\u201d Jennifer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom...I can\u2019t wear that! It\u2019s shows more than my underwear!\u201d Emily protested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh hush silly all bikinis feel that way at first. Go and try it on and come out I wanna see, don\u2019t worry this is the ladies dressing room.\u201d Jennifer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily rolled her eyes and went back to the room to change. stripping down she changed into the bikini struggling a bit at first because of the individual cups that supported her large breasts. She finally managed to make it work at Emily saw herself in the mirror and was a bit stunned. She wasn\u2019t just cute anymore....she was hot! Really hot and sexy! Emily was really surprised at how sexy this new body was she heard her mom talking with someone outside the dressing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot paying much attention to who she was talking with Emily walked out of the room wearing the bikini and she twirled a bit showing it off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Mom what do you think?\u201d She asked spinning around a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I think it\u2019s really sexy I just have one question....Who are you and why did you just call her mom?\u201d A familiar voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily paused and suddenly froze. Her mom was there talking with none other than her long time friend Jessica. The same one from Ethan\u2019s birthday party.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Well, Emily had to admit that things were kind of fun. More than she thought they would be at any rate. However, all that seemed to go away right in the moment she noticed Jessica. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica looked...obviously confused. She had just seen some Japanese girl in a bikini come right out of a changing room and call Jennifer \"mom\". Like that made any sense at all. Granted, Emily couldn't help but shoot a \"Couldn't you give me a heads up?\" look at Jennifer, to which she seemed kind of sorry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's....um....\" Emily tried to say. Granted, there hadn't been much talk about what exactly her story was going to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, as far as the general public would be concerned, she'd either be a friend of family or adopted. However, she wasn't sure if Jessica was going to fall for that. Could she just say she was staying at their house and Jennifer asked her to call her \"mom\"? Nah, that didn't seem too plausible honestly. Maybe it was best to just tell her the truth. Emily honestly didn't like lying to Jessica. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just hoped she wouldn't regret this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I called her mom....because I'm Ethan,\" Emily sighed, looking at Jessica. \"Just....looking a lot different at the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was looking at Emily like she had a second head. Understandable really. She had just heard perhaps the most ridiculous thing she had ever heard of. This Japanese girl claiming to be Ethan. At least Emily had an idea of how to go about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if you need proof.....you gave me those sandals that you bought around a year ago,\" Emily started, figuring it'd be the best solution. \"Plus, you told me a week ago about that guy who wouldn't stop pestering you and I said you should sock him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted, revealing Emily said that in front of her mom might not have been the best idea, but she needed some kind of proof that Jessica would believe. Predictably, Jessica seemed even more floored than she already was. It wasn't like she stood anyone that she was going to give those sandals as a birthday present. Unless Jennifer actually told her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Ethan....?\" Jessica said slowly. \"That...really you? You're not...just messing with me are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm dead serious,\" Emily said, sighing a bit. \"I know it's....a lot to take in...but there is an explanation....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Emily took the time to change back into the dress she came here in, before she and Jennifer gave an abridged version of the story from last night. Jennifer was curious that Emily was okay with telling her, but Emily trusted Jessica. She wasn't one of those gossipy girls. She could keep secrets very well, and Emily couldn't think of anyone more trustworthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.....that's unreal,\" Jessica said, her hand on her forehead. \"But...you're still you, right? Like...not someone else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I still feel the same. Personality-wise anyway,\" Emily smiled a little bit. \"Just....trying to get accustomed to it at the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Jennifer looked at her watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, how about we get some lunch?\" she suggested. \"We can relax and get things sorted out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat actually sounded really good, and Jessica did look a little hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me,\" Emily said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Heading to a local restaurant together Emily decided it was best to be as open as possible with Jessica. They had been long time friends and yes she had been a long time crush of Ethan\u2019s, as Emily she felt like maybe they could connect more. Being open about this condition was the first step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how long are you like this?\u201d Jessica asked as they sat at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should change back into Ethan in another day or so. It might even be tonight when I sleep. Roughly 24-48 hours is the window but I don\u2019t know for sure.\u201d Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo....what did it feel like? The change I mean you grew boobs and lost your....you know....man parts.\u201d Jessica said with a small chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily rolled her eyes a bit. \u201cWell it definitely hurt, but it was more the shock than anything.  The hardest part is actually the bones reshaping and the organs shifting around. Growing the breasts felt weird but it didn\u2019t really hurt much.\u201d Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of congrats on the big boobies! What are those D? and for a Japanese girl that\u2019s really rare too.\u201d Jessica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily blushed a bit still not feeling very comfortable talking about her body like this. \u201cYeah, 36 DD. I\u2019m a bit surprised too honestly. They are really sensitive too.\u201d Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls talked a bit more making jokes here and there to lighten up the mood. Jessica used humor to deflate the really awkward situation they were now in. Luckily it seemed to help as t made Emily feel a little more comfortable. When the waiter came Emily at first thought about ordering a nice big juicy burger like Ethan would like but for some reason she really wasn\u2019t craving that. Sushi sounded really good to her for some reason so she ordered that instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve never like Sushi before.\u201d Jennifer said to Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee you really are Japanese now! You\u2019ve even got the big boobs all those Anime girls have!\u201d Jessica said with another chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls ate their lunch together talking more about all the girly things Emily was going to have to learn. Makeup, clothing styles, doing her nails. Most of it sounded really tedious to Emily. However being able to skip having a period was huge blessing and one of the few upsides to the condition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Emily I have an idea, instead of you going to the salon why not come over to my place? I can show you how to paint your finger and toe nails there. I think it would be a good bonding experience for us as girls now.\u201d Jessica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like that idea a lot Emily.\u201d Jennifer said in agreement. \u201cIt would be really good for you to start spending time with girls your own age.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily was a bit nervous at the idea but she nodded in agreement. \u201cOkay sounded fun.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they had finished up lunch together and headed outside there was suddenly a loud crack of thunder a torrent of rain started to suddenly pour down on them getting everyone soaking wet. Jessica and Emily hurried as quick as possible over to Jess\u2019 car as they drove together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily was freezing as she found her body shaking horribly. This new body was not designed for the cold and she was shivering uncontrollably as her body was soaking wet from the rain. They quickly arrived at Jessica\u2019s apartment as they hurried inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside Jessica brought Emily to her room. Emily thought she was going for some towels but she was suddenly shocked when Jessica began taking her clothes off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm....Jessica what are you doing?\u201d Emily asked still shivering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can\u2019t stay in these wet clothes silly we will catch cold. Come on and get undressed it\u2019s fine we are both girls.\u201d Jessica said as took off her shirt and pants then her bra. She was only still wearing her lacy black thong. She grabbed a towel from her clothes and began drying her hair and body as she tossed her wet clothes in a hamper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily was both terrified and excited. As Ethan seeing Jessica almost nude like this would have been a dream come true. However her seeing herself almot nude in this new body felt so strange. It was also weird how comfortable Jessica seemed with this. Did this mean she didn\u2019t even see Emily as Ethan anymore? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cold however made Emily\u2019s choice much easier as she had to skip out of her soaking wet clothes. Taking off her dress and bra Emily joined Jessica in her satin panties as the two girls sat by the heater together drying off in only their underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth you make one sexy girl. Don\u2019t get any ideas though I don\u2019t swing that way. \u201c Jessica said with a chuckle and a wink. However it was obvious she was deflating the sexual tension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica than reached behind her and pulled out a case full of finger and toe nail polishes as she looked over to Emily. \u201cLet\u2019s get started.\u201d She said with a smile. </span></div></div>",

I'll still be a guy half the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds so weird that something like that could be real,\" Jessica added. \"It's like sci-fi or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it does,\" Emily agreed. \"Still, it's alright all things considered. The shopping I did earlier was somewhat fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's good,\" Jessica smiled a bit. \"Was that dress your decision though? And the heels?\" she added with a little laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heck no!\" Emily cried out, laughing a bit as well. \"No, my mom wants to fastrack me on the way to learning how to be a girl, so she jumped me on all the super feminine stuff right out of the gate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yikes,\" Jessica laughed. \"Well, hopefully you won't have to wear that stuff all the time. I'd be dead if I had to wear skirts and heels on every single day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough,\" Emily agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth made a bit of relaxing small talk, just enjoying each others company for now. It made things better for Emily, now that she had a sympathetic ear to talk to. Aside from talking, they didn't really do much else, just having a bit of fun while they waited for their clothes to dry out. Once they did, Emily reluctantly changed back into them, making a good reminder to ask her mom for some more casual wear some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWearing a dress like this everyday was going to be embarrassing as heck.</span></div></div>",

They had talked for quite awhile mostly superficial stuff. Jessica did give Emily a few pointers on how to walk, sit, and move more naturally as a woman. Sitting now Emily found herself crossing her legs now while wearing a dress or skirt. However in the car ride home there was an awkward silence between the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...are you going to ask me about it or what?\u201d Jessica said breaking the ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAsk....ask what?\u201d Emily said nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on....I\u2019m not dumb, you have wanted to ask me since you saw me topless. I thought that little display would make things easier for you....Just ask me, you want to know come what sex is like as a woman right?\u201d Jessica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily immediately blushed at the thought. She hadn\u2019t even begun to think of that l, however she would be lying if she said it hadn\u2019t crossed her mind. Ethan himself wasn\u2019t a virgin anymore. He had been with a friend of Jessica\u2019s, a girl named Maya. They went together to prom and several dates their last year of high school. However she had moved shortly after graduation. Ethan always had a crush on Jessica but they had only ever shared a brief kiss one night a long time ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm....is that something you would be willing to describe to me?\u201d Emily asked still blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHELL NO! You have to find out yourself!\u201d Jessica said laughing as Emily blushed redder. \u201cI just wanted you to ask. It\u2019s obvious all the sexual tension and confusion coming from you. I just want you to know you can come to me with any questions or concerns you have.\u201d Jessica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily laughed a bit shaking her head at the conversation they were having. Her nervousness with this new body was still very obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there any tips or tricks I should know regarding....you know....that stuff.\u201d Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I will tell you a secret, girls get just has horney has guys. Society just shames is for it so we have to act more  discrete about it. So if you suddenly see yourself having dirty thoughts or craving sexy clothes don\u2019t worry about it, that\u2019s totally natural.\u201d Jessica said with another laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls laughed and chatted a bit more as they pulled into Emily\u2019s house. There was another car parked int the driveway however, one that didn\u2019t belong to Emily\u2019s parents....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out of the car Emily suddenly froze as she realized who\u2019s car it was just a bit too late...:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Jessica how\u2019s it going?\u201d A friendly and familiar voice said. It was, Eddie, Ethan\u2019s best friend since childhood. He got out of his car and walked over to the two girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Jess I have been trying to reach Ethan all day but no answer.\u201d Eddie said as he suddenly paused to look at Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime seemed to freeze for both of them. Emily was okay with a girl like Jessica knowing her secret but she had no idea how a guy like Eddie would react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi there I\u2019m Eddie, Ethan\u2019s friend.\u201d Eddie said offering his hand to Emily\u2019s<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh....ummm.....hey....I\u2019m Emily I\u2019m....\u201d Emily said <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She didn't want to say this to him just yet, though she hoped he would be understanding once she did tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's nice to meet you, Emily,\" Eddie smiled before looking back. \"Still, you two know anything about what's going on with Ethan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His.....\" Emily started to say but stalled a bit. What would work?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His parents sent him to go visit family,\" Jessica piped up. \"It was one of his presents from yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily was a bit surprised to hear Jessica say that, and so quickly too. It was like she already thought about it. Though, Emily wondered if it was really going to work. Eddie seemed a bit perplexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, that a fact. I kind of wish he could have said something,\" Eddie replied, apparently buying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was pretty last second honestly. He was surprised too,\" Jessica continued. \"I only knew because they happened to mention it beforehand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, Eddie seemed content enough with the answer, although he did find it a little strange all the same. Still, he believed what Jessica was saying, telling her thanks before saying good bye. He made sure to be polite to Emily as well before he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think that up on the fly or something?\" Emily asked afterwards. \"It was like you rehearsed it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I did perhaps give it some thought along the way in case you ever needed a quick story,\" Jessica laughed a bit before turning. \"Guess I better head home myself. It was nice getting to know \"Emily\" truly.\" she laughed a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure...\" Emily laughed a bit back before saying good bye and letting Jessica go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Emily went back inside, with dinner soon to come. She reiterated the days events to Jennifer, who seemed to really like the time Emily spent with Jessica. Seemed like a really productive day overall. Still, it felt like just the beginning of a wild roller coaster.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After an incredibly long and stressful day it was finally time for Emily to get some sleep. She almost collapsed on her bed from the stress of dealing with her first full day as a girl. Finally able to get out of her annoying girly clothes she stripped down to just her panties and tossed on one of her normal male shirts she wore as Ethan. Emily was amazed at how big it was on her new body as it went almost to her knees. She could see now why girls always wore their man\u2019s clothes as it was baggy and comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying there in bed getting comfortable with these huge boobs wasn\u2019t easy. The constant shifting was not something she was used to yet. However after awhile Emily drifted off and fell asleep.however,  As she slept a strange dream suddenly began to fill her mind.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily saw herself and Ethan. They were sitting together at a table with something that looked like a doll on it: The doll looked like a lifelike replica of them both with Ethan on one half and Emily on the other. It seemed the two were fighting over it, like rival siblings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s my turn! I\u2019ve been asleep for long enough give it here!\u201d Emily said tugging the doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! It was mine to start with her your own!\u201d Ethan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJessica likes me better! It\u2019s obvious! Did you see the way Eddie looked at me!\u201d Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have them! They are my friends!\u201d Ethan said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know I can give you the life you always wanted! Just let go!\u201d Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever! I worked hard for the life I have you can\u2019t just appear and take it!\u201d Ethan yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two fought and tugged over the doll before Ethan finally emerged victorious holding it up in pride. \u201cIt\u2019s mine again now get lost!\u201d Ethan said proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily looked frustrated and stubborn. \u201cFine....but just for that I\u2019m going to come back at the worst possible time...\u201d Emily said before fading away into shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen sunlight peaked into the room Ethan slowly awoke as he saw his familiar hair arms staring back at him. There was a tightness in his crotch from the panties he was still wearing which he quickly removed. Jumping out of bed Ethan saw his old self back in the mirror as he sighed with relief. It had been almost around 36 hours since his first change right in the middle of what his parents guessed. Ethan stared at himself and saw he was exactly like he was before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting dressed Ethan\u2019s parents saw he had turned back to normal as he got ready. After breakfast there was a sudden knock on the door. Wondering who it was Ethan answered it as Eddie was standing there with Jessica behind them. Eddie\u2019s SUV seemed packed with camping equipment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey man you ready to go?\u201d Eddie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady for what?\u201d Ethan replied confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor this weekend remember? We are driving up to camp Murwood for the weekend. We are gonna spend the next two days camping, swimming, hanging out. Remember we talked about this a month ago.\u201d Eddie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh....damn you\u2019re right. Uhhh....one sec.\u201d Ethan said as he turned around to his parents in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI totally forgot the three of us were going to this! The whole change thing totally made me forget!\u201d Ethan said to his parents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry son we picked your bag and we made sure to include \u201cextra\u201d clothes in there for you.\u201d His Dad replied handing him a backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan snuck a quick peak into the bag and saw all his usual items and also a few clothes for Emily and even a bikini...Ethan was terrified. If he went he risked turning into Emily at any time, if he refused Eddie would be pissed off and suspicious of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the plan again? Sorry I forgot.\u201d Ethan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s abiut a day drive up there. We will get there late tonight. Spend the next two days camping and then come back again the following day.\u201d Eddie replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath Ethan decided to.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Honestly, Ethan knew he couldn't back out of it. Eddie would surely notice that something was wrong if he did such a thing, In a way, it almost seemed like it was inevitable that Emily would be revealed to him. Granted, Ethan did want to divulge that at some point, but certainly not this soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuess he would just have to hope that fate was kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right then...let's go,\" he said, forcing a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie was obviously happy to hear that, though Jessica gave a sympathetic look. His parents hugged him and wished him luck on his camping trip, in more ways than one obviously. His mom was certainly eager to give him some other tips just in case though Ethan really didn't want to hear that right now. After putting Ethan's stuff inside the SUV, he got into the middle row with Jessica on the other side, leaving the shotgun seat open next to Eddie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye! Have fun!\" Jennifer waved as she and her husband said good bye for the next couple days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was very little talk in the car, though Eddie did ask how visiting family yesterday was for Ethan. Remembering that was Jessica's cover story for him yesterday, he hesitantly replied that it was fine, fun enough for family. Eddie then laughed and remarked that it was good that Ethan didn't stay there longer and miss out on the trip, to which Ethan sheepishly chuckled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So....you changed back overnight?\" Jessica whispered to Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason why she sat back there with him was to talk about Ethan's condition. Eddie had the music on so there was no way he could listen in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah....but who knows if I'll always be that lucky,\" Ethan whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts went back to that dream of himself and Emily. It was really strange to be honest, so he hoped it was just that: a dream. However, the way Emily looked and said that she'd come back at the worst possible time made him shiver. Though, there was another thing that made him feel off. Emily's comments that Jessica liked her better, and that she could give him the life he always wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What in the world did she mean by a life I've always wanted?\"</i> Ethan thought. It wasn't like he ever had a desire to become a girl or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, there wasn't much he could do about it. Surely it was just a dream and him over thinking things. He and Jessica made a bit of small talk for pretty much most of the way there. At the very least, Jessica was in his corner, and she wanted to help out in any way possible. Ethan was really grateful for that, even though he had zero idea how he'd handle being Emily in such a new setting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, they had lunch around midday and then continued their drive.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was late at night when the trio pulled into the campgrounds. They had to use lanterns and flashlights to get their tents and sleeping bags set up. Jessica decided to set up her tent next to Ethan\u2019s Incase he changed during the night. Meanwhile Eddie was busy cooking up some food over the campfire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them sat together by the campfire Joking and telling stories about life and highschool memories. It was exactly the kind of night Ethan wanted. However the thought of Emily kept crawling back into his mind. He found himself checking his hands every few minutes to see if he nails had grown longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the three of them were ready for bed they went to their tents as Ethan laid down in his sleeping bag nervous for the next day would bring. As he laid down however there was a light tapping on his tent as he saw Jessica standing outside. She was wearing short shorts PJ bottoms and a tank top with no bra. Ethan immediately felt a bit nervous as he looked up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, can I come in?\u201d Jessica asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhh....sure.\u201d Ethan said trying not to stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them used the lights of their smartphones to see as Jessica reached over and pulled out a bottle of liquor she had snuck away with  and took a sip and offered him one. Ethan didn\u2019t like the idea of underage drinking and tried to avoid it as much as possible but he knew Eddie and Jessica didn\u2019t care as much. Not wanting to ruin the mood Ethan shrugged and took a small sip trying to hide the bitter taste expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo....what\u2019s your plan if....Emily comes to visit?\u201d Jessica asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to think about it all day. I have all sorts of excuses I could use, each one as unbelievable as the next. I could also just tell Eddie the truth.\u201d Ethan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProblem is that sounds the MOST unbelievable.\u201d Jessica said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know...this whole thing is so unfair. Just a couple days ago I was a perfectly normal guy.\u201d Ethan said sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I be honest with you? I mean as a friend you would want me to be honest right?\u201d Jessica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh...sure....\u201d Ethan said not sure what she meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUntil a few days ago you kinda boring. Don\u2019t get me wrong, you\u2019ve always been a good friend Ethan but you never took any risks or did anything adventurous. You were always too safe. This condition for all its problems has added a real amount of drama and excitement to you.\u201d Jessica said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to argue with her about that. Ethan always did take the safer route. Risks were never really his thing. Eddie and Jessica were always the fun and adventurous ones. Maybe he could use Emily as a way of being more of an outgoing person?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them talked for awhile longer until a Jessica had had a bit too much to drink. She was slurring her words and suddenly grabbed Ethan and pulled him close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh....Sleep....now.\u201d She mumbled deciding to cuddle up next to Ethan for the night. Normally this is what\u2019s Ethan would have dreamed about but it was obvious she only saw him as a friend.The two of them shared a tent that night only staying close for warmth. Luckily no new dreams came to haunt Ethan. However it was morning that caused the real problems....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Eddies voice called out from Ethan\u2019s tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan awoke to find himself still himself but with Eddie standing right outside his tent. The door was open and A half naked Jessica was outside arguing with Eddie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou two could have told me you were hooking up!\u201d Eddie said angered. He saw them sleeping together in the same tent and when he saw the empty liquor bottle he just assumed they had been together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEddie it\u2019s not like that we just talked!\u201d Jessica said trying to convince him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan had to admit it looked back but he was confident he could show Eddie the truth. He just had to.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that exact moment Ethan suddenly doubled over in pain grabbing his sides. There was a shifting pain all over his body as he saw his finger nails beginning to grow....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>What?! Now?! It had barely been even one day since he changed back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan was absolutely stunned and confused to see this happening so very soon. Surely his parents didn't lie to him about the amount of time between changes? Well, one way or another, he was quickly getting into trouble. Already his hands had transformed into dainty girly ones with longer nails, and he could already begin to feel his shoulders crunching in and the twisting of his torso. Granted, the t-shirt he wore still hid those changes so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it would only be a matter of time before something more obvious like his hair transformed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...guys!\" Ethan suddenly cried out. \"Think...I could perhaps get a bit of privacy to change?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat broke the two out of their little bickering. Eddie just shrugged, not finding that unusual, before saying that there were some things he wanted to get out of the way early as well. However, Jessica caught the flash of his girly hands before he tried to hide them, catching the hint. Once Eddie was further out of earshot, she mouthed that she'd come back when he was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me about 10 minutes....\" Ethan said softly to Jessica, letting her know how long it would take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded and left him as he zipped the door to his tent, at least giving him some privacy as the changes continued. Boy, it really was going to be something if it was this painful all the time. Made him feel lucky for the one time he changed when he was asleep. In any case, there wasn't much to do but wait them out. He took off his sleep shirt, seeing how smooth and curved his torso looked as it continued to change. Even now, this still felt so unreal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the minutes passed, he felt his hair grow out and and turn black once again. He actually grabbed a mirror from his supplies to get a better look, still amazed by the sight of it. Of course, that was nothing compared to when he began to see his face transform. His normal features melting into the smooth face of a Japanese girl. Seriously, seeing the major change to his eyes was quite something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeyond that, the growth of his breasts were still the most alarming, if nothing else for how much he had to breathe deeply during them. The sheer size of them created quite a weight on his chest after all. The nipples even hardened a bit and were more sensitive in the cooler air of the tent. Beyond that, he felt his legs soften and lengthen a bit into their girly form while he had to endure a groan at the expansion of his hips and butt. Finally, another painful kick came as his manhood became that of a woman's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, Emily was back, probably at the worst time like she said she would. Just the thought of that made Emily shiver at just what else could happen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ethan.....\" She heard Jessica's voice right outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in....\" Emily squeaked out in her higher voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica then opened the tent door, somewhat surprised to see Emily's half-naked form inside. Even for her, the idea of such a transformation was surprising. She couldn't even imagine how Emily felt during it. Still....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta admit....most girls would be jealous of that chest,\" she smiled a bit, lightening the mood a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose so,\" Emily smiled a bit in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, you do look good....though what about Eddie now?\" she asked as she came inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...don't know.\" Emily said. \"I know I can trust him...but it just feels like too much.....That make any sense?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, it does,\" Jessica said in understanding. \"You have the right to take this at your own pace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Emily smiled, so thankful for Jessica's support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, this still left the day to tackle. Guess Emily had to get ready now. Surely she wasn't going to go out topless like she was now.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The transformation still took its toll on Emily. She needed a few minutes to recover before she was able to get dressed. Going into the bag Emily saw her parents had only picked out a few really girly outfits to wear. There was a bright blue bikini that seemed designed to show off ones boobs and butt. A pair of short shorts, a tank top that would show off quite a bit of cleavage, and a crop top that would show off her whole midriff. That and a pair of flip flops along with lacy set of underwear was all she had to chose from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily put on the bikini and put the shorts and tank top on over it. It was unavoidable they were going to the water today She she might as well prepare. After getting her shoes on she slowly stepped out of the tent as she went to find her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily found Eddie and Jessica arguing a few steps away. It seemed Jessica had been keeping a secret From Eddie who was angry over all the deception going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen you just have to trust me. This is a secret only Ethan can show you. It won\u2019t make sense at first but you have to believe me it\u2019s the truth.\u201d Jessica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what the secret is I just want to know why you couldn\u2019t trust me to begin with?\u201d Eddie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them argued for a bit longer until Emily stepped out in front of them. Eddie paused for a second confused at why Emily was here, while Jessica took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEdddie, you remember Emily right? Well actually she is more than my friend she is...:\u201d Jessica started <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s me..::Ethan.:..\u201d Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEddies has dropped as he was both confused, upset, and strangely aroused all at the same time....The trio of friends sat down for the next hour proving Emily was actually Ethan and going over the condition Emily and Ethan now shared. It took quite a bit of convincing but after awhile Eddie finally accepted the truth and swore to keep it a secret. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole time they talked it was obvious Eddie couldn\u2019t keep his eyes off Emily who\u2019s body was started to react strangely to his stares. At first they made her feel uncomfortable but once they had relaxed she started to feel a strange heat building up inside her, something she wasn\u2019t yet familiar with:...</span></div></div>",

There was a bit of silence in the air as no one knew how to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow......that's....something...\" Eddie said slowly, not sure what else to add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.....that's kind of what I thought,\" Emily sighed. \"It's still a shock for me too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean....forget science...this sounds like borderline magic...\" Eddie continued. \"It's that crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to rub it in,\" Jessica warned him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no it's okay,\" Emily smiled a bit. \"He's not wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExplaining every little thing her parents told her was quite strange indeed. Heck, just being in this form around a guy was strange. It felt like a mess of emotions that Emily couldn't figure out. Still, at least Eddie didn't freak out, only showing a lot of confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still....why didn't you tell me earlier instead of giving me that story?\" Eddie crossed his arms. \"You trust me, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do!\" Emily replied a little too quickly, blushing as a result. She didn't want him to get the wrong idea. \"I trust you with anything, Eddie. It's just that...I wasn't comfortable with too many people knowing so quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only got to know it by accident,\" Jessica piped up. \"I just happened to see her mom at the clothing store.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, they explained all they could from how Jessica found out. At the very least, Eddie was able to accept Emily's fear of too many people finding out. She still trusted him as much as Ethan did, which satisfied him enough. He didn't need to be convinced to keep this a secret. No need to make Emily out to be some kind of freak to those who wouldn't understand. The three were pretty much in agreement, which made Emily happy. It was truly great to have friends who perfectly understood what this situation meant and that they wanted to help in any way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, the trio decided to begin their day. No sense in wasting their time camping here. As Emily pretty much expected, both Jessica and Eddie wanted to go to the lake to swim. Good thing she already got the bikini on underneath, even if the clothing itself unnerved her greatly. After the three grabbed a little of breakfast, they were off and walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So.......interesting attire...\" Eddie said slowly, looking at Emily. \"Not sure if it's really the thing for camping though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I completely agree,\" Emily laughed a bit, feeling at least a little of the tension dissipate. \"My mom is obsessed with fast-tracking me on the girliest clothing imaginable. I think she forgot the memo that I'm in the wilderness, not the mall. I don't even have proper hiking shoes.\" she added with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and I need to go shopping sometime,\" Jessica smiled. \"I'll help you get some clothes that won't show every piece of skin on your body.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio enjoyed a little laugh at that, feeling a little more comfortable now.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once they were down at the lake Eddie and Jessica had no problems in shedding their clothes as they got ready to swim. Eddie was wearing of tight black trunks that showed off his well built body from years of basketball. While Jessica was wearing a tight white bikini that showed off her body nicely. Her long blonde hair tied up in a pony tail as Emily stoood there frozen....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were lots of people here not just the three of them camping and having fun. It was a hot summer day and lots of friends and families were out enjoying themselves. However Emily found herself unable to move. She was so self-conscious about going out in a bikini. It felt like being naked in public and in an alien body it felt even worse. Taking a deep breath she shed the clothes and looked at herself for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bright blue bikini Emily had on seemed almost custom fit to her body. The top pushed up and held her boobs in nicely while showing off a fair amount of cleavage. One of the down sizes of Emily\u2019s large breasts was that they were unnaturally round and perky. It wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable for someone to assume they were fake. This meant with a bikini like this Emily couldn\u2019t even see her toes when she looked down. This combined with her bubble butt and hourglass like curves meant Emily was going to get many stares. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey....You Okay?\u201d A familiar voice suddenly called behind Emily. Turning around she saw it was Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah....sorry just a bit nervous.\u201d Emily said with a light sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be, you look amazing. I\u2019m actually really jealous.\u201d Jessica said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah....I do look hot, more than you...\u201d This thought suddenly crept into Emily\u2019s mind as she paused for a moment before shaking the thought out of her head. Where had that thought come from? Was it just side effect of the change or just a random fluke? Either way Emily ignored it as the two girls walked together to the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily didn\u2019t even realize that as they walked Emily was checking out Jessica\u2019s body but not for the reasons Ethan would have. She was actually comparing the two of them as a strange part of her felt pride in having bigger boobs and a rounder butt than Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got to the water Eddie suddenly froze when he saw Emily. She was stunning to him. Sexy and gorgeous but also shy and cute. The perfect combination to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow...:you look great.\u201d Eddie said with a smile and a small blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks...:\u201d Emily said blushing back. Then without warning Emily found herself letting out a loud scream as she found herself being pushed into the water from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing up Jessica was laughing historically as Emily spat the water out of her mouth and the her now wet hair out of her eyes. She gave Jessica a cold look back as she sarcastically thanked her as Jessica jumped in to join them. </span></div></div>",

It wasn't bad, not too warm or cold. Probably why there were so many people to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat began a rather nice day of swimming overall for them. After they got used to the temperature of the water, it was mostly just swimming around and casually talking. Granted, at times they would separate to have some fun on their own or to chat it up with someone else happening to pass by. After a while, Jessica actually began chatting with another swimmer near by, leaving Eddie and Emily on their own for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how does it feel right now?\" Eddie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" Emily replied. \"I don't feel too different in here....except for the obvious weight on my chest, I swear, they're bouncing or something,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Eddie laughed a bit along with Emily. \"I can't help but feel like even some guys would be jealous of getting to know what being a girl is like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue. It wasn't like the thought hadn't crossed Emily's mind as Ethan before. It was a natural curiosity after all, to see what was on the other side. More than once had Ethan wanted to get inside a girl's head. Maybe he'd have better luck if he did. Not quite sure this was really he had in mind though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Emily couldn't help but remember earlier, how she was checking Jessica out but for different reasons. Heck, she had even seen other girls in bikinis around and similar thoughts all came, like she was hotter than all of them. Just the idea of it made her blush and shake her head though. That couldn't really be her thinking, just random thoughts messing around with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Eddie wasn't bad a looker either. He wasn't ripped by any means, not even close. However, he was very fit, something Ethan kind of envied since his sport skill wasn't quite as high, although the two loved to play a bit of ball together every now and then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right,\" Emily smiled. \"Still, this is a bit extreme. Heck, adding in changing ethnicities on top of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which, does this change actually make you know all sorts of Japanese stuff now?\" Eddie asked out of genuine curiosity. \"Like, you can speak it and even have habits and such?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....I don't know about that,\" Emily laughed sheepishly. \"Though....I did have sushi when I had lunch with Mom and Jessica.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's very interesting....\" Eddie said before stopping. \"Um...sorry if I'm sounding too in to this. It's just...well it's something so unreal....I can't help but be curious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're alright,\" Emily smiled back, swimming a bit closer to him. \"I'd probably do the same if our situations were reversed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Eddie smiled back. \"You're still up for playing ball sometimes right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing would stop me from doing that,\" Emily laughed. \"I still want to catch up to you somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can try,\" Eddie smirked, some old humor from their earlier days coming back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, it was a nice talk between the two, like their friendship was still firmly in tact despite the changes to Emily. It at least assured Emily of some normalcy in these times.</span></div></div>",

The two of them started off like normal joking and messing around like normal but it soon began to act..::different. They were acting more playful with teasing, splashing, playing fun games together. As they tossed a ball around Emily would jump on his shoulders as he tossed her around in the water. It was obvious her new smaller frame couldn\u2019t keep up with Eddie anymore. However it didn\u2019t really bother her she actually kinda liked it....It almost felt like....flirting<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then Emily began to feel something, a strange warm tingling between her legs, and an increased sensitivity in her breasts. She ignored it at first until she jumped at Eddie when he was holding the ball above her head as a joke. As she jumped into him her large breasts pushed against his firm chest as a sudden rush of pleasure hit her body causing her to pause for a moment and gasp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil now Emily had avoided touching her new body in any sexual ways. Either out of fear or stubborn denial she never really experienced anything with this new body yet. However something was awakening inside her. A new feeling and desire that was getting harder and harder to ignore...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Emily gasped as Eddie picked her up in his arms after he pushed into her. He was carrying her easily like she weighed nothing. The feeling of being in his arms felt...:amazing as Emily\u2019s heart began to pound rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know you are so much lighter as a girl. I don\u2019t think you stand a chance against me anymore.\u201d Eddie said with a playful smile. Eddie was planning on tossing her into the water again until he saw the look in Emily\u2019s eyes. It was powerful lustful stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Emily looked up into Eddies eyes as she held him something came over her. It was a sensation she couldn\u2019t ignore or explain. Something she had never felt as Ethan before. Without thinking she suddenly wrapped her around around Eddies neck and pulled him in for a deep and passionate kiss....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was on the other side of the beach talking to a young guy who was obviously checking her out. Jessica needed to feel sexy and desired as she was secretly jealous of Emily. Talking to this guy who was trying his hardest to seem cool was just the confidence boost she needed. However as she looked over to her friends she suddenly saw Emily in Eddie\u2019s arms, the two of the sharing a kiss....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie returned the kiss with passion and for several seconds the two of them embracing each other felt like blue bliss. That was until the sinking realization suddenly hit Emily as she opened her eyes wide and pulled away jumping out of his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m....so sorry! I don\u2019t...I don\u2019t know what came over me! That was wrong.....\u201d Emily was blushing so red as she got out of the water and grabbed a towel to dry off. Emily was almost panting from the embarrassment of what she did....she just kissed her best friend. The worst part of it all was how much she liked it, and how deep down she really wanted more...</span></div></div>",

She just kissed her best friend, one who believed in her and wanted to help. It was like she took advantage of him, and it disgusted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only served to compound every other thought she had had since coming here. All those thoughts about delighting in how much sexier she was compared to other girls, and how much she really wanted to be in the presence of a hot guy; it just served to make it all the more alarming to her. What was she becoming? Was this really natural for girls? Or something far worse?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was obviously concerned as she excused herself from the people she was talking to, immediately coming over to see what was wrong with her friend. Obviously, she saw what happened, and wasn't too sure what to say about it. She tried to be cautious about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So....that was....something...\" Jessica said, smiling just a bit. \"Looked like you were really getting into it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica....\" Emily said, fear obviously evident. \"I'm honestly scared about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what?\" Jessica asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what I just did!\" Emily said a bit louder. \"That....that couldn't have been normal. Suddenly I just had some.....some kind of primal feeling or something....just that I needed someone's...pleasure or something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.....\" Jessica took in everything Emily said, trying to rationalize it herself. \"Could be that you're just adjusting to female hormones....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could that really be all?\" Emily asked, not fully believing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't know...\" Jessica sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could she? Unlike Emily, Jessica had no experience in dealing with male hormones compared to female ones. She didn't know anything about having to adjust to a different kind of hormone. How would she know if this was natural or not? She couldn't, and she didn't like how it was keeping her from helping Emily to the best of her ability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....I guess we just don't know,\" Jessica added eventually before looking back at Emily. \"But....Eddie and I are still here for you, no matter what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was Eddie, as he was coming out of the water and drying himself as well. He had a look of guilt on his face, much like Emily did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eddie....I...\" Emily started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know....and that's my fault too,\" Eddie smiled sadly. \"I'm equally guilty of getting caught up in that moment. When you kissed me...it was like that was all I could think about. The idea of what must be going through your mind didn't come to me at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was good that the three friends were being so honest with each other. It was something Emily could rely on no matter what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...Eddie,\" Emily smiled a bit more. \"I think...it'd be best if you two watched me...to make sure I don't get all lusty like that again. No matter what hormones or whatever I have, I don't want to be some kind of slut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. We won't let that happen,\" Jessica said with a bigger smile. \"That's what friends do after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely,\" Eddie smiled. \"Next time, I'll be sure to help you out if you have another moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks guys,\" Emily said happily. That made her feel a bit better. She still had a lot of uncertainty, but it was nice to help clear the air with her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, with that settled, they all felt like they had swam enough. Emily was feeling kind of hungry after all that, so the three friends decided to head back for a well-deserved meal.</span></div></div>",

She hated herself because of how much she liked it. The feeling of her breasts pushed tight against Eddie\u2019s chest, his warm touch on her soft skin. She found herself imagining more. Like how his hands would feel roaming her breasts and skin and what he would even feel like inside her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily shook her head quickly tying to clear the dirty thoughts out of her mind. She wanted to think of something else, anything else but her body wouldn\u2019t let her forget. The heat pulsing between her legs and the aching feeling in her breasts was a constant reminder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at camp Emily changed back into a pair of Lacey Underwear and put on a tight tank top and shirt shorts.  While still very revealing she didn\u2019t feel as exposed as she did with the bikini on. Jessica and Eddie changed back into their camping clothes as well as they gathered again for lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they ate it was obvious to Jessica to Emily was still upset over what happened as she was really quite and found herself shifting and adjusting herself often. She hoped maybe another social outing would help them forget and move on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey the guy I was talking to, Scott, he invited us over tonight for drinks and hanging out. It would be a fun party and get together.\u201d Jessica said changing the topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, sounds fun.\u201d Eddie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah....I guess.\u201d Emily replied. She didn\u2019t like drinking but she wasn\u2019t going to be the stick in the mud that ruined the mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the awkward lunch the trio decided to break up for awhile until later tonight. Eddie went for a walk while Jessica and Emily went just decided to relax under the sun and enjoy the fresh air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you going to be okay Em?\u201d Jessica said as they sat down together enjoying the beautiful scenery around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know...I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to handle this body. I thought at first it was going to be easy. I would act as I normally do, but I would just have boobs. I didn\u2019t think....I didn\u2019t think I would start to think and feel like a girl too.\u201d Emily said holding back tears. She was having a hard time controlling her emotions right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica brought in Emily for a close hug. \u201cNo one ever said this was going to be easy. If I was being honest with myself I would honestly say I\u2019m jealous of you.\u201d Jessica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy? You secretly wanna be a guy?\u201d Emily said with a laugh trying to lighten the mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo silly..::It\u2019s just.....your so damn sexy and beautiful, but you didn\u2019t really have to work for it. You should see the way guys stare at you, the way Eddie looks at you. I\u2019ve worked my whole life to get people to look at me like that and it still barely works. You get to become this beautiful and sexy girl a few days a week and you also get to skip all the BS that goes with it. No shaving, no periods, no pregnancy scares, it\u2019s like you only got the best parts of being a girl. Well besides all the emotions and hormones.\u201d Jessica said ending with a light joke to make Emily smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to deal with these hormones and emotions I can still feel them. That kiss....that damn kiss...it\u2019s like the damn broke and now all these new feelings are pouring through me.\u201d Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want my advice? From someone who actually went through puberty as girl. These feelings aren\u2019t going anywhere. The more you try to bottle them up the more they will consume you.  You need to embrace them but on your own terms. If you learn to control them then they will never control you.\u201d Jessica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you suggesting I actually sleep with Eddie?\u201d Emily asked blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never said that, however I would stop acting like Ethan around him. Ethan is gone right now. Emily is charge right now. Ask yourself how would Emily act around Eddie, not Ethan?\u201d Jessica said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily sat there for awhile contemplating what Jessica had told her. There were a million things rushing through her head as she tried to figure out what to do. Looking at herself in the waters reflection she took a deep breath as she knew what to do. Standing up she turned around and called to Jessica asking her for help...:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Several hours later)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was getting dark when Eddie returned to camp. He didn\u2019t see Jessica or Emily anywhere. The party they were going to was in the camp clubhouse by the beach. Eddie decided to change into something a bit more formal as he out on a nice collared shirt and jeans and did his hair neat. He still had no idea where the girls were at as he looked at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing footsteps he saw Jessica coming towards him. She was dressed up too. She was wearing a nice dress and heels and her hair and makeup had been done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, where\u2019s Emily?\u201d Eddie asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s....coming don\u2019t worry.\u201d Jessica said with a nervous look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie heard more footsteps as he Emily stepped out of the shadows as Eddie\u2019s jaw almost dropped....Emily was wearing a sexy tight black dress that hugged her body like a second skin. It showed a generous but not insane amount of cleavage and pushed up her breasts nicely. It hugged her round butt and hips nicely. It came to her mid thighs showing off her smooth legs. She was also wearing matching black heels that she seemed much more comfortable in. Her hair and makeup had also been done. Her long black had been straightened and looked like black silk. She had on red lipstick and even her finger and toe nails had been painted the same shade of red. She looked like his dream girl come to life.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm....Eddie would you go to the dance with me....as my date?\u201d Emily asked nervously trying not to blush.</span></div></div>",

He thought if he saw Emily as his friend Eddie they could just be friends and nothing more it would be easier. However that kiss. That damned kiss was making it impossible for him to ignore how he felt. Emily was beautiful, sexy, and everything he could want physically by there was more to it than that. She was also smart, funny, a joy to be around. All the best parts of Ethan were still in her. That\u2019s what he liked the most. He just refused to make the first move on her. He didn\u2019t want to be seen as the creep or weirdo trying to bang his friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre....are you sure? I mean you look amazing Em it\u2019s just I don\u2019t wanna out pressure on you.\u201d Eddie replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay Eddie. Jessica showed me that if I\u2019m not willing to accept this side of myself and embrace it I will be running from my feelings my whole life. This is something that I want. Me as Emily not Ethan. Try to think of us as different people. Tonight I\u2019m just Emily.\u201d Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis idea helped Emily build the confidence she needed to feel comfortable in her own skin. This wasn\u2019t about looking sexy or getting laid. This was about embracing ones self. By dressing up and going on a real date Emily built the confidence she needed to accept her new life and condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then. I would love to take you out tonight.\u201d Eddie said offering his hand to Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing a bit Emily took Eddie\u2019s hand as they walked off together. Jessica had to hold back a tear of happiness for them both. As she saw them her mind drifted not to Emily but to Ethan. She normally only saw him as a friend but something was different now. If Emily was this kind and passionate was Ethan always that way too? She knew Ethan had a crush on her but she friend zoned him multiple times. Was that a mistake? Ignoring this thought for now the trio set off together heading to the clubhouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a really nice cabin lodge. Lots of people there dressed up, drinking and dancing to the music. Emily was still terrified about the date as she walked in there with Eddie around her arm. People were obviously staring at her as she felt like everyone in here was either staring at her with lustful eyes or jealous stares. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I get you a drink?\u201d Eddie said showing Emily to the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust fruit punch for me. Nothing with Alcohol, I promised myself I wouldn\u2019t take advantage of you or anything else like tonight.\u201d Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine I completely respect that.\u201d Eddie said pouring her a red cup full of punch while he grabbed a light beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica found Scott the guy from earlier who invited them. It was obvious she was still jealous as she made it a point to take him quickly to the dance floor and started doing slutty dances to show off. Eddie and Emily found a table nearby to sit and talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what made you go all out like this? The makeup and the nails?\u201d Eddie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really just wanted to push my girly self to the limit. I\u2019m really not a fan of these nails or anything so I probably won\u2019t do it too much.\u201d Emily said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJessica keeps staring at us, I think that guy she is with is just a way to make me jealous.\u201d Eddie with avoiding her gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah...she admitted that to me earlier. She super jealous!\u201d Emily said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them talked for a bit getting more comfortable as Emily looked to the dance floor seeing everyone getting so close and all the booty rubbing and sexy dancing made her body feel warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you like to dance?\u201d Eddie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI....would but I don\u2019t want to dance like that. I promised myself nothing slutty.\u201d Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on I\u2019ll show you how to dance without grinding or twerking.\u201d Eddie said taking her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily felt rushed off her feet as they went to the floor. Eddie soon began to show her a few really cheesy dance moves. Really bad ones just to make a joke. Emily couldn\u2019t help but laugh as Eddie was out there doing the funky chicken and other ridiculous moves just to make her feel more comfortable. Emily finally gave in as they stared dancing for fun as other people joined in for laughs and fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours of dancing and mingling Emily and Eddie had totally lost track of time together. It was like they were in their own little world tonight. When the music suddenly changed the lights went down as slow dancing music started to play. Eddie took Emily out there as she was nervous seeing how close everyone got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie placed his hands on Emily\u2019s hips as she wrapped her arms around his neck. The two began to rock back and forth slowly getting comfortable as Emily felt herself slipping. She wanted nothing more to kiss and be kissed. To touch and be touched. However she resisted every urge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d She said with a smile looking up into Eddie\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor what?\u201d Eddie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor an amazing night. For not just treating me like a freak, or just a friend. At first I thought I was going to hate my condition. I thought it was going to ruin my life. However I\u2019ve had more fun today than Ethan has had in months.\u201d Emily said blushing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know I would never treat you like a freak. I still think of Ethan as my best friend. My buddy who has my back. That\u2019s not how I think of you. I see you as Emily. An amazing and special girl who doesn\u2019t let her sexiness or beauty ruin her amazing personality.\u201d Eddie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then Emily couldn\u2019t hold back anymore. Standing up in her tip toes she pulled Eddie down for a deep and passionate kiss. Not like before where it was just impulse this was done purposely and with passion. Eddie returned the kiss with full force as their tongues touched and wrapped up together. Emily even let out a soft moan feeling her breasts pushing against his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was busy twerking on Scott when she saw Emily and Eddie wrapped up together. She thought she would feel happiness for them but she felt a sudden emptiness inside herself. She imagined herself where Emily was and Eddie was Ethan. She needed to get this thoughts of her head anyway she could even if it meant sleeping with this Scott guy tonight....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica and Scott soon left the dance floor disappearing somewhere as the party was winding down. Emily and Eddie were some of the last to leave as they left smiling and hand in hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how was your first date Emily?\u201d Eddie said walking Emily back to camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmazing...have you seen Jessica?\u201d Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah...she followed that Scott gut to his room. Prettt sure I know what their doing.\u201d Eddie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm...playing checkers!\u201d Emily said sarcastically with a laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly! Well maybe naked checkers.\u201d Eddie said laughing back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them came got back to camp together as they shared one last kiss before bed. Emily wanted nothing more than to rip their clothes off and jump in his tent but she resisted the urge before saying goodnight.</span></div></div>",

After everything that had happened, he was thrown for a loop at Emily's question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I....Well....\" the man said, barely able to get a word out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....And then the tense atmosphere was broken by the stifling of a laugh. Eddie looked to see Jessica just barely holding it in. Emily still had a big blush on her face, sighing just a bit at Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I actually said it didn't I?\" Emily asked, giving a small smile as a result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I really didn't think you'd pull it off,\" Jessica added. \"I thought for sure you'd stop mid-sentence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait.....so you two were messing around?\" smirked Eddie once he finally understood what was going on. \"That's going a little far wouldn't you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, she wanted to at least try out asking someone,\" Jessica shrugged, her smile not leaving her face. \"And you were the best candidate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm happy you think so highly of me,\" Eddie smirked, not offended in the slightest. It wouldn't be the first time a couple of girls had a little fun with him, and he was certainly happy with some friends messing with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily was certainly happy at how things weren't as tense now. Honestly, she wondered if she perhaps should have been more serious about it, but this wasn't the time for that. No matter what, she wasn't going to jump on Eddie and take advantage of him, because she knew he'd be unlikely to refuse her if she asked him seriously. With that said, the three friends then left, beginning to make their way down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a point, Jessica walked further ahead, leaving Eddie to talk more privately with Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess you must be feeling more comfortable in your own skin if you can joke about it,\" Eddie said as he helped Emily stay upright after a slight misstep. Emily was still learning how to use these heels, even if these were more comfortable than the other ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Jessica helped me out with a little talk,\" Emily smiled. \"I've felt a bit better since then, and I figured why not see if you approve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I would say definitely,\" Eddie laughed. \"Though...I can't help but feel very under-dressed by comparison. Seriously, not even Jessica looks as made up as you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah....I might have gone a bit overboard. I just wanted to see what would happen,\" Emily said as she looked at her nails. \"Personally, I'm not a fan of the painted nails, but figured it was worth a try for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough, though I agree with you. I think women look better without it anyway,\" Eddie smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll take that into consideration,\" Emily laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow this felt a lot better than before. None of that weird tension from earlier. Just friends actually laughing about silly stuff. It made Emily feel a lot more comfortable in her own skin, as Eddie kind of alluded to. It made her hopeful that everything would go well from here on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, once they rejoined Jessica, they made their way to the club. Wasn't too bad a place, though Eddie and Emily felt a little out of place. Even as popular as Eddie was, he was not a party animal, nor was Emily. Plus the fact that neither really liked drinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll probably be the ones standing out,\" Emily said as she got a non-alcoholic beverage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, not a problem,\" Eddie said as he grabbed a soda. \"Give me a Coke and I'm good any day of the week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got a laugh from the both of them as they got themselves situated at a table. Jessica was already talking with the same guy from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheesh, guess she really wants his attention,\" Eddie smirked as he looked. \"Think she's jealous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh she is. She said so herself,\" Emily smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thought so,\" Eddie laughed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Overall, it was a pretty nice party. They didn't really Jessica for large parts of it though, kind of leaving Eddie and Emily on their own for the most part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's..pretty loud in here...\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue, with all the chatting and music, it was pretty loud. Emily could barely hear herself think with all of it. Thankfully, Eddie seemed to share her opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, kind of is,\" Eddie smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it wasn't unpleasant. The two didn't really do anything big themselves, mostly just blending in with the crowd and enjoying time to themselves. Still, Emily did kind of like how lively it was. A stark contrast to many other things she did were things were quieter. She kind of wished Jessica would spend more time with them, but oh well. Guess she had her own thing to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just hope she doesn't drag that Scott fellow into a room with her,\" Emily laughed a bit. \"She did seem very jealous of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would hope not. Sounds kind of shallow to me,\" Eddie said. \"I mean, it's just my opinion, but I always thought Jessica had thicker skin than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was true. One thing Ethan always liked about Jessica was how she seemingly never took anything too personally. However, from Emily's experience, that seemed to be more than a little bit off. She kind of hoped Jessica wasn't going to take the difference in their bodies too harshly. Frankly, the fact that Jessica already revealed she was jealous made her feel a bit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie seemed to catch on to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't let it get to you,\" he smiled. \"She'll come around, just like I came around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Eddie,\" Emily smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's really what happened. The two of them saw a lot of people dancing, a lot of it pretty suggestive that made Emily blush heavily. Eddie though did get her to do something just a little more casual with him, just a little moving to the music and having a little fun. Nothing over the top or sexual about it, just two friends enjoying each other's company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew...I think I might need to get back in shape after that,\" Eddie wiped his forehead a bit. \"You can actually dance a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I just didn't feel like stopping after a while,\" Emily laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could tell,\" Eddie smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eddie.....thanks a bunch,\" Emily smiled. \"You really made this night a lot better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true. Emily was really grateful to Eddie for his company, as well as Jessica for the idea of coming here. It was a lot of fun. Eddie seemed equally happy, thanking her as well for the company. Jessica eventually rejoined them, looking more than a little exhausted. Eddie and Emily laughed together, not really bothering to ask why she was tired. Probably too much time dancing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as it got really late, the trio left the club, enjoying their casual walk back to the camp. Eddie mercilessly teased Jessica about where she was, getting a shove from her. Emily laughed at the antics of her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe surprisingly didn't feel too many strange feelings back at the club, though she worried they might come back with time. Still, she had come a long way to accepting being Emily as well as Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust had to take one step at a time.</span></div></div>",

He'd almost given up on the idea it was a dream, as it felt too real. The niggling details just disturbed him too much. Cradling his bust, it felt real, warm, soft in his hands. He couldn't bring himself to explore ...<b><i> it.</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, dropping his bust. The pain, at his shoulders, as the girls settled back into place made him wince. Scowling at the further proof, his hands ran over the wider hips, and the fuller, rounder rump, she'd imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSettling down on the chair. He tried to think of anything else that might have caused this. Had someone spiked his drink... or was this some badly cooked meat, a gravy delusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to the rumpled shirt on the floor. He picked it up, the worn shirt, and slipped it on. At least he could hide that bust, if the damned shirt could be buttoned closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reality was Ethan discovered that he was swimming in the shirt. The sleeves were too long, the collar would be two or three inches too wide, and the whole thing hung down to mid-thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reflection in the mirror made her look sexier, in the oversized male clothes. Shuddering Ethan had to admit that he was her... The sexy nymphette in the glass was her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHurling herself backwards back onto the bed. She felt the shimmying dance of her bust as she flew, and the sloshing of those fat nips against the fabric as she landed. It was futile, as she clutched the shirt to her body, Ethan had to admit, she truly was that woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/564x/22/b4/40/22b44058f3648acc3938b2a536e24e3c.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/564x/22/b4/40/22b44...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind gibbered at what this meant.

His skin began to tingle as the hair on his skin receded into him leaving his skin completely smooth and hairless as it became paler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis brown haired turned pitch black and grew out until it was mostly straight but slightly messy down to her lower back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis penis then began to shrink. \u201cWhat?

After a while of struggling to stand up because of the change in her center of gravity she finally grabbed onto the sink. She struggled to pull herself up, she had lost so much muscle mass. It felt like she had never worked out a day in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stumbled her way to the door and felt around for the door knob. She opened the door and her parents say their new daughter. Short, cut, pitch black hair, slender waist and arms, big hips and ass, thick thighs and large breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome with us honey,\u201d her mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMi.... mi no see, it burwy,\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom grabbed her hand and lend her to the living room.

You kept changing genders and ethnicity. Eventually the doctors were able to find a way anchoring you to one gender while slowly causing your z to deteriorate over time. They said that when you turn eighteen your z chromosome will completely fade away and there will be no reason to for you to be a boy anymore. They also said your true nature a something that effect your female self will arise. So you and I will be going to the doctors office tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMi no want to be girl!\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid you don\u2019t have a choice Ethan,\u201d her father said. \u201cAlso you should pick a new name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMi should,\u201d she said.

Her mother had helped her put them on and them Emiko wore a dark blue shirt and sweat pants that she had to role up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat there in the waiting room. Emiko could barely hold back the urge to rub her pussy. She was getting a dirty look from a mother\u2019s across the room. Eventually they were called back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo it happened,\u201d the docter asked. She was a woman who was about 5,6, in her mid thirties, brown hair, and c-cup breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes it has,\u201d Mrs. Edwards said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll come with me Ethan,\u201d the doctor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt Emiko,\u201d Emiko said shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHun?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, her new name is Emiko.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh well than Emiko follow me, we\u2019re going to run some test.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the test Emiko and the doctor came out. \u201cOk using new methods we were to find out that your daughter has a form of autism that causes her to speak the way she does. We also found out that her libido is three times that of the average girl her age. We also determined that her breasts are still growing. We don\u2019t know when they will stop but I recommend that you should check up with us mouthy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmiko and her mom walked to the car. \u201cAlright now we go shopping to get you some new clothes.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Seriously! How did this happen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell why don\u2019t you help us shop for new clothes for her and then we will tell you over lunch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk I really want know what happened to you Ethan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt Emiko,\u201d she said shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, sorry she\u2019s been very shy since she transformed, she said her names Emiko now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey finished shopping and purchased a lot of clothes. Now Emiko was wearing a black thong that her friend insisted on. A black sports bra that clinged to her round perky J-cup tits. The wore tight white yoga pants that showed of her sexy ass. She also wore a blue anime shirt that clinged to her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then went to an eye doctor to get fitted up with some new classes. Emiko did so bad on the test with the eye machine she only she biggest letter and barely see the other two rows of letters below it but everything else was a complete blur. Emilo was then fitted with with cutest nerdy glasses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went to a Japanese restaurant from Emiko\u2019s choosing for some reason she felt a strong urge to even though Ethan would\u2019ve wanted to go to a burger joint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess your new asian blood is really effecting you,\u201d Jessica joked causing Emiko blush in embarrassment. \u201cSo how did this happen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmiko\u2019s mom then explained the whole thing to Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat Himiko Tanaka do you know who that is?\u201d Jessica asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s a famous Japanese porn star who has like O-cup breasts that are still growing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmiko then tried to barry her head. If her breasts were still growing they\u2019d probably reach O-cup too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the car ride home something crossed Emiko\u2019s mind. \u201cWhat bout cowege?\u201d she suddenly asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily her mom was ready answer that. \u201cWell, we all ready called the college you got excepted into and tolled them about your condition. So you have a year get used to your female body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFree year off suit,\u201d Emiko thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She usually wore thongs, sports bras even though she doesn\u2019t exercise very much, tight shirts and tight sweat pants. She had developed the most nerdy of interesting. She loved to read comics and manga, watch anime and play video games. She had also developed an interest in drawing anime style which she was very good at. Her room was filled with anime, comic and video games posters as well as fake replicas of fictional weapons and cosplay outfits. One thing she definitely noticed was that she was unbelievably horny. She was usually masterbating when she was alone. For some reason she didn\u2019t seem to have an interest in her interest as a guy. She wasn\u2019t into politics or sports. Something that she appreciated about her new body is that she seemed to be able to eat whatever she wanted and her boobs and ass seemed to absorb most of the calories. She had gone up to a k-cup and she had needed to get new pants. However she did not appreciate the fact that she was shorter than most sixth graders or the fact that she couldn\u2019t see without glass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of her family and friends had been informed about her condition. Some took it well others needed some time to get used to the idea. All her friends teased her about the way she now talk but she had gotten over it. She had also realized her new attraction to men. She had already embraced her new female libido and fucked all her male friends before they had gone off to college, though some have stayed. She loved giving blow jobs, she was a master at it. She had even fucked her female friends. The one drawback to this is the fact that if she doesn\u2019t have sex for a while her libido will build up and she usually ends up running up to someone begging them to fuck her. If they say no she pounces on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now Emiko is sitting on the edge of her bed playing video games. She is riding a dildo. Emiko has only an anime shirt and headphones. She\u2019s eating lucky charms and drinking soda. Her parents always try to put that stuff on the highest shelf where she should be able to reach. However she always finds a way to get it. She doesn\u2019t care it all goes to her tits and ass. She used to be frightened of the idea of her breasts getting bigger but now she hopes they get to O-cup and beyond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
