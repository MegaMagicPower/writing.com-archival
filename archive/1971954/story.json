Between the fog and the coal smoke, not too much literally shines around here, except the gaslights fighting to illuminate the streets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe meet our hero(ine) in the early evening among the docks of the Port of London.

He did have a touch of success with the phonograph, but that's about it. The dynamo, the electric light, and the cinema are all as yet uninvented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond, Mr. Otto's internal combustion engine is distinctly missing. The world is proceeding on a steam-powered basis. But steam, it seems, is capable of all kinds of things you didn't know about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition, there are a few odd deviations in geopolitik to discuss:<br>\r\n(I specifically added some powerful non-white nations in the alternative history to improve the feasibility of non-white characters. They will still likely face disrespect in caucasian nations, but perhaps there will be more balancing factors for them.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe US and Canada are more or less the same as in the history you learned, except Texas never joined the Union. Brazil and Mexico both have emperors and aristocracy. Mexico is a long-time rival with the U.S. for influence in Texas, Central America and the Caribbean, while Brazil, Argentina and Chile have fought several wars, trading possession of Uruguay, Paraguay and Patagonia several times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Zulu Empire was able to deal the Brits a somewhat embarrassing defeat and have since grown to dominate the southern quarter of Africa, except about half of South Africa that the Brits have held onto. The Jolof Empire, which held onto its historic extent,is locked in an eternal power struggle with The Kingdom of Morocco for control of West Africa. The Ethiopian Empire is a power in East Africa counterbalancing British-controlled Egypt and Sudan. The remainder of the continent is under European or Ottoman domination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Asia, China is the same mess as in your history books, except with a little more success fighting back here and there. It has recently forced an end to the unequal treaties, but is still stuck with a number of European and Japanese colonies on its coastline. India is largely the same, except that a powerful khanate has appeared in Punjab and Afghanistan, threatening to challenge Britain for control of the subcontinent. Japan controls Manchuria and Korea as in mundane history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Europe, the biggest difference is the lack of a Prussian Empire. That means no Franco-Prussian war, no Kaiser, and a very different dynamic in Central Europe, which is a patchwork of Ruritanian duchies and kingdoms (as before the Prussians). Napoleon had his successes in Italy and Central Europe, but it was the Poles on the allied side instead of Russia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout the Prussians to participate in the Polish Partition, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth survived and got back on its feet. Other than its portion of Polish territory, the Russian Empire is roughly the same, and as in mundane history has fought wars with Japan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny more odd details I or anyone else come up with will be added as they are created (provided I like them!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegarding a few terms: \"Unwashed\" characters are not literally failing to bathe; this term simply means the Great Unwashed, the working class, the street class and such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPirates in steampunk NEVER use ordinary ships. They use airships. Or submarines (think Captain Nemo). Or ships that somehow convert to land-going vehicles. Anything, as long as it does something more than merely float on the surface of the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpportunists are treasure hunters, gold seekers, anyone looking to turn a (legal) buck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercenary characters do dirty work for hire; they can be military mercenaries, but can be more. Legality is not so much a concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTinker characters are not-yet-financially-successful inventors. They generally work as jacks of all trades, and mechanics extraordinaire.</span></div></div>",

Indeed, if for no other reason, one might deduce this from the Webley revolver held in a tastefully decorated holster hanging from a brass-buckled leather belt. After all, neither revolver, nor holster, nor leather belt would have been in an ordinary lady's wardrobe. In addition, one might observe that few ladies could hope to hang on to such a large caliber weapon were they to fire it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA trio of street toughs who eyed her from the opposite side of the street chose not to inquire more closely, as did a few gentlemen seeking opportunities of varying sorts.

Her bodice was of the finest brocade, and obviously lined with the finest leather and nearly unbreakable stays. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn point of fact, it was said (among those who had apparently known her for more years than she would admit to), that she was not only a crack shot with the revolver, but was also very skilled with the several blades she was known to carry. She hurried along her way, seemingly oblivious to all, but to the gentleman watching her from the darkness of the doorway, it was obvious she was totally aware of everything around her. She walked briskly along the road, closer and closer. He stood stock-still as she came on, hoping she would pass by, but his luck did not hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped a mere 12 feet away. She placed her hand on the butt of the revolver and quietly said, \"Jeremy, I know you were taught better than to skulk about, boy.\" He sighed as he stepped out into the halo of gaslight over the door. Perhaps the direct approach would be better after all, \"Aunt Millicent, please don't tell mother I'm out this late, but could I follow you to the airship?\" Millicent narrowed her eyes, \"Why would you think I'm going to an airship, boy?\" Jeremy looked down and shuffled his feet for a moment, then decided to just spill it. \"Aunt Millicent,\" he said as he looked up to meet her gaze, \"the whole family knows you come down here to the airship docks, and we just want to know what your are shipping or receiving that would come here this time of night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe considered it for a moment, then stepped forward to her nephew. She looked up and down the road for a moment, then leaned forward, a gentle smile on her lips. \"Jeremy,\" she said quietly, \"Nobody has a need to know what I am shipping or receiving, but I'm somewhat fond of you. I will let you and you alone in on a secret if you promise not to tell.\" Jeremy gazed into her bright blue eyes and fully committed to the conspiracy, \"Of course, Aunt Millicent,\" he crossed his heart with his right hand as he held his left up for her to see, \"A secret is a bond, and you're my favorite aunt.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned even closer, her bright eyes twinkling mischievously, \"I don't care what's shipped on airships, as long as they pay well when they ship on MINE.\" Jeremy's eyes widened as he saw her grin. \"Why, Aunt Millicent, you mean to say you're...</span></div></div>",

I have what you need.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly the door swung wide and as quickly closed once Millicent slipped in. \"Hurry,\" Gaylord urged, \"Death is near, it seeks to tromp upon the light of my life, as we speak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillicent swung the cloth bag from her back onto a scarred counter. \"Twas a bit dicey getting this here. What with the Queen's ban on progressive electrical innovation and the poorness of your district.\" She worked the parcel open to reveal a small steam pot and a block of gadgetry that was about one foot square. A tangle of metal tubing and copper wire fell out when she tipped the bag over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How will this save us?\" Gaylord looked over the pile suspiciously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This, my friend, is a miracle of our modern age; it steadies the patient's heart.

I will be editing it to fit better, once I figure out what to do with it,</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcGuilicutty, Gaylord's large poodle, freezing cold, covered in mud and smelly to boot, scurried behind the pot bellied stove.  The dog was an intelligent animal, but he lacked what human-kind calls common sense.  He hated himself about now.  He couldn't just lick his body clean.  He hovered in the corner, his entire body soaking wet.  He shook himself repeatedly, trying to remove what was now crusted mud that was stuck to his curly fur.  McGuilicutty had submerged himself in mud full of manure of some sort.  No wonder the poodle smelled.  Gaylord heard McGuilicutty whimpering.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMillicent was due any minute.  She was bringing the Pace Setter package to steady the heart of the patient.  Gaylord certainly did not expect to be encumbered with McGuilicutty's current dilemma.  Gaylord needed to tend to Dr. Iverson, the patient lying behind the pot-bellied stove right next to the poodle.  Dr. Iverson adored Gaylord's poodle under normal circumstances.  The patient was falling in and out of consciousness.  The more Gaylord smelled the manure and even felt chunks of it landing on his body, the more he suspected it must be covering the patient's body too.  Dr. Iverson had a heart condition.  Gaylord began to coolly react.   \"Millicent, call my assistant and have her remove this animal and get him cleaned up.  You and I will care for Dr. Iverson.  I will call Dr. Loveless and ask him to install the Pace Setter if he approves it for this case.  He is familiar with this invention and recommends it.  Keep the patient comfortable while I contact Dr. Loveless.\"      <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaylord reached Dr. Loveless momentarily.

Her upbringing had included a most thorough education. As a child she had learned Greek from a Spartan tutor. A quick study she had also absorbed the skills of African hunters and whilst on a short visit to Japan had gained some notoriety from being a mere female and yet being recognised for knowing the way of the warrior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer brief sojourn in Japan had been curtailed less she commit any serious offence to the Emperor who questioned the need for a young maiden to have such mastery of weapons. Her rapid departure, however, was due more to Scarlet Kate than to the vagaries of a senile Japanese Emperor. Kate had persuaded her that the best place to acquire a parasol to match her long blonde hair was on the island of Serendib. The island was far distant but the winds were favourable to a steamship that floated on the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her varied education and extensive travels, Penelope had never been aboard a flying steam driven airship. Her journeys had never required that she ascend to the heavens. Not that she had never ascend to the heavens. Her experiments with her fathers steam powered Jaguar had on more than one occasion caused the vehicle to take to the air before the safety valves were able to activate the hydraulic emergency brakes. She had been fortunate in never suffering anything more serious than a torn blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother had been aghast at seeing the torn blouse and it took Penelope some time to reassure her that it was the corner of the windshield that had caught the garment and caused such damage. The chauffeur managed to keep his job at least on that occasion. He would never forget the Duchesses punishment and thanked God it had been curtailed before he felt the full force of her wrath. He did however, keep in mind the vision of the Duchess with her storm rigging in full flight and thought he might yet arouse her anger sufficiently to ride that storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf the chauffeur we will hear no more. Scarlet Kate will become an important influence on Penelope's life in spit of only being a brief interlude. It was during this interlude that Lady Penelope achieved her sixteenth birthday. There was no such thing as a sweet 16 in those far off days certainly not if you were flying over the Indian Ocean trying to beat the monsoon to Serendib. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo while away the journey Kate would regale Penelope, who she now referred to as Penny, with tales of the brigands that plied their trade off the coast of Africa and who sometimes strayed North as far as the Malabar coast. Kate seemed very knowledgeable about the ways of these brigands and one in particular. A very merry fellow by the name of Harry Tempest. A man of hairy chest, a strong blackbeard and long pigtailed head. In fact a very hairy man all-round. You could see little of it but what skin showed was the colour of polished mahogany and matched the wooden leg he sometimes carried. No-one dare ask why he carried a wooden leg, let alone a mahogany one, as he had two perfectly good legs attached to his body down below. The eyepatch was another affectation and he never seemed to cover the same eye two days running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne evening as the two ladies, rather one lady and one whose gentility might be less elevated, were finishing supper, a massive joint of pork from a flying pig. Kate let out a mighty belch and exclaimed that she had been fortunate to come across a flying pig whose captain would sell them such a joint. She almost let slip that whilst she had received the joint for the captain of the pig he had not received anything in the way of payment. Unless, of course you considered being allowed to live a little longer as fair recompense. Her tongue had been loosened somewhat by the excellent wine she had served with the meal to celebrate Penny's coming of age as it were. Penny, being under 18 was unaccustomed to alcohol and sensibly drank the smallest glass. Even so Penny was a little light headed and Kate much more so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe table cleared and Kate's cigar smouldering in a solid gold ashtray she proceeded to launch into another entertaining tail of pirates, brigands and vagabonds. As she regaled her guest with outlandish tales she slowly sipped the wine and the cigar still smouldered. Kat never actually smoked but had learned from her father that there was nothing better after a good dinner than some good wine and a good Cuban cigar. By his definition of what made a good Cuban cigar Kate had decided that Burmese cigars were as good for the purpose and so the cigar smouldered on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe level of wine in the bottle dropped ever lower and Kate's eyelids began to droop. Soon she was snoring loudly and would do so for the remainder of the night if previous occasions were any guide. Kate's crew on board the Beaten Bewitched consisted of a cabin boy, a cook and a helmsman who had once been a butler in the London residence of a well known aristocratic family who were not only well born but owned huge estates in Yorkshire as well as large mills in Lancashire and Rutland. They were also by chance neighbours to Penny's grandparents and some sort of distant cousins or great uncles, penny could never be bothered with all these family trees much other mother's despair. One day my girl, she would say, your are going to have to choose a husband and it best be from among your cousins or else you'll end up a pauper not able to afford a new wardrobe every year.</span></div></div>",

Look at that long coat. Make a fine blanket.\" He gulped a third of his mug. \"Where ya 'spose 'e's from?? Punjab??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hardly. Prolly eastern India. Jharkhand or Odisha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurt nodded. \"Aye. Dark skin but Caucasian features.\" The object of their conversation smiled as the waitress set a fresh mug in front of him. \"Look at that! Bet 'e's got more teeth than everybody in this barroom put together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSid wondered which way the dandy would go when he left. If east, he'd go past the stables then a short stretch to the inn, where he was probably staying. They'd have to take him before he got there. And do it silently without rousing the horses or the sleepers. If he went west, though, it'd be a piece of cake. The apothecary and mercantile lay that way, but they were closed and shuttered this time of night. They'd drag his body into the alley and have plenty of time to find his money or whatever valuables he carried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raucous and festive tavern noise subsided as two men entered. They stood commandingly in the doorway, slowly looking over the crowd. Sid recognized the shorter of the two. He was Preacher Harris, owner of a sheep ranch a mile to the west. If he wasn't the richest man in town, he was darn close. He insisted his given name was \"Preacher,\" but Sid doubted it. What kind of parents would stick their kid with an appellation like that??<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other, larger, man was a complete stranger, and was also the reason the crowd stared. Six foot-four, sandy brown hair trimmed in front, but falling to his collar in back. He wore boots with pointed toes, tough-looking trousers, a red plaid shirt, a leather vest, and a large, strange hat. Sid thought it was called a Stetson. Most striking of all: The stranger wore a holster belted to his right hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurt's eyes grew wide as he took in the pistol resting in the holster. \"Looks like one o' them 'Merican gunslingers,\" he whispered to Sid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two newcomers approached the table where the young dandy waited. He stood and shook hands with both of them, and they all sat. The waitress approached their table. The stranger said, \"Whiskey.\" She looked hesitantly at Preacher Harris, who nodded. When she returned, Harris handed her a gold coin, and told her to keep the change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSid and Curt looked at each other. Preacher Harris was not exactly known as a big tipper. He was, in fact, the cheapest, most miserly miserable man the town had ever seen. He had just given the waitress enough to keep her child in milk for a month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd resumed it's merry carousing. Sid studied the three men at the nearby table. They spoke too softly to make out the words, but appeared to be in serious conversation. Whatever they discussed, it was soon settled. Harris and the gunslinger, if that's what he was, stood after just a couple of minutes and left without a backward glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dandy watched them go. He seemed to let out a sigh, then took a sip from his mug. He waved the waitress away when she offered a refill. Sid thought he looked ... Deflated. Yeah, like he'd gotten smaller since his conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're we gonna do??\" whispered Curt. \"We still gonna take him??\" He licked his lips. \"Like you said, he's bound to have a wad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSid looked at his Partner, then turned away. Could there be a more lucrative use of the dandy than simply killing him and taking his money??<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The smell of tobacco grew stronger, which he did not think was possible before it actually happened. And then there he was, the legendary Curtis Midgeley. The aluminum brace on his left leg crawled all the way to his hip, a chunk of his face where his left eye and cheekbone used to be was now a rusted iron patch and as he walked he put all three hundred pounds of his weight on his right leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat right across from <i>Dom</i> Gu\u00e1lter and smiled with what little teeth he had left. This was not the man Gu\u00e1lter was expecting. Curtis removed the cigar from his mouth and laid it in an ash tray on the table and yelled across the room, \"Sweetheart! I'll take a good black stout if you've got one!\" His voice was harsh and cut through all of the sounds of the crowded bar. \"So, should we get down to business kid?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGu\u00e1lter smiled. \"My father has sent me to get your 'assistance' for a problem we are having back home.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My help?

She looked quite dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it weren't for the officer's saber and the genuine insignia and devices on her uniform, one might be forgiven for seeing merely a buxom young redhead wearing a toothy smile and a stunningly tight sailor dress. Of course, the Republic of Texas Navy was the only fleet in the world whose uniform included a North American cattleman's hat and boots, so this officer and lady of its Air Corps would still stand out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lass needed none of it to attract attention though. The main thing that drew all eyes to her was her total lack of the composed character normally associated with female military officers. She was instead roaring in laughter at a lewd comment from a retired tar seated at the next table. Did she understand English properly? What that cad had just suggested she might do for him\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe empty pint on the table in front of Ensign Grace Travis probably had something to do with her behavior. Macleod hoped so, anyhow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gathered up his courage to approach her. No matter how perilous it felt to do so, a gentleman should be nearby to protect the inebriated lass's honor in case the old sailor tried to follow through on his proposition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cried out, \"Hey, girl! Drag another beer over here! I'm powerful thirsty, y'know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he arrived at her table, he noted the publican's head shaking in the background as he pulled a fresh pint for the bar maid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flame-haired Texan gave Angus a green-eyed head-to-toe appraisal. \"Wahl now, here's a purdy buckaroo! Howdy there, pardner! An' who might you be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least he was reasonably certain that's what she said. The last phrase sounded more like \"Ann hoomah choo bee?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madam, I am Second Lieutenant Angus Macleod of the Royal Marines. I'm inclined to believe you are the Ensign Travis I'm here to meet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LEFF-tenant, huh?\" she echoed his pronunciation with a huge grin. \"Well, Looey, yer inclined c'rrectly, ah reckon. Grace Travis, Ensign, Ree-public of Texas Naval Air Corps, atcher service. Why doncha pull up a log and squat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't sure if he had just been rudely insulted or invited to sit. He gambled on it being the latter, and took a chair across from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn closer inspection, he realized that if a proper British finishing school could have her for a year or two, she might become one of the loveliest creatures in this land. What misfortune, this loud voice and boisterous attitude!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pint landed rather loudly next to her, shaking him from the trance the beauty had momentarily put him into. The bar maid was giving him a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'll it be, sair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a pint for me, thank you,\" he answered, a bit flustered by her cross stare. Had he done something wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't him, he discovered. She turned her scowl on the redhead like a battleship rotating its main battery. \"Barman is cuttin' y' off, what wiff dis bein' yer fiff pint. 'E wants y't'settle up now, while yer still conscious.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was on her fifth pint? Macleod paled a bit at the thought, but cleared his throat. Totaling her five and his one, it would cost him a whole shilling, but the man she had been waiting for here ought to pay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let him know that I will pay her account,\" he told the dash. \"Please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe trained her frown on him once more, for a moment, then went to fetch his drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha that's rat gentlemanly of ya, sir,\" the ensign declared. \"Thank ya kindly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Rat gentlemanly?</i> He shook his head, watching her guzzle great draughts of porter with gusto. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis own pint arrived while the Texan was explaining that she had met the grizzled mariner at the next table, apparently named 'Berkley', on the ship she'd crossed on. He'd been in New York visiting his daughter, and taken to drinking with her on his voyage home. When she'd asked about the location of this establishment where she was to meet Macleod, he'd led her to the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How on Earth could you have finished four pints already?\" Macleod demanded. \"Didn't your ship only put in an hour ago?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wahl, I hit dirt with nuthin' much to do, so I jes' moseyed straight over here. Figgered you'd be along soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was too flabbergasted to respond to that, and hid his astonishment by taking another swig. It occurred to him, had she not even checked in to her lodgings yet? He saw the answer to that question; a medium-sized gladstone bag sat in the chair beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he frowned. \"You barely seem old enough to finish one pint. Aren't you a little young to be an officer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wahl that's rude! I'm nineteen, Looey!\" She paused and admitted, \"Next month.\"  Then shrugged and added, \"and a few weeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>An eighteen year old drinking a half-gallon of porter?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head. \"Well, we need to get a room arranged for you straight away. And we need to talk some business. You're attracting entirely too much attention here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tipped her head back and laughed, then looked him up and down, quirked her lips to one side and shook her head deliberately. \"An' here I thought hiz majesty had sent me a dandy present. Ya got a ramrod up yer caboose jes like every Marine officer back in Galveston, doncha?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe colored deep as the old sailor barked out a laugh, hiding his blush by taking yet another drink. If he stayed here in public with her too long, he'd end up needing to drink five pints himself.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAnd he needed to be sober to talk to her about the reason her admiralty had sent her here to England. Given her booming voice, they couldn't discuss it in a room full of other ears. After all, it was about\u2026</span></div></div>",

He attributed the success more to the fact that she couldn't get another pint than to anything he did though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't tell whether the look of reproach on the bar maid's face was her objection to the way that the ginger-haired wild woman was squeezing her plenitude into his arm as she clung to it, or if it were just her disapproval for his choice of female. Either way, she had entirely the wrong idea. His intentions weren't merely honorable, he was acting under direct orders of Admiralty!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could understand why the dash would think that way though, considering how the drunk Texan ensign was behaving. He became more exceedingly aware of her ample chest the farther down the street they walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging by the driver's loose grin when they grabbed a steam hackney to leave the Isle of Dogs to a less problematic area, that young woman had precisely the same misunderstanding about his intent. He was glad her thick Cockney was more foreign to his Scots ear than the redhead's Texan. It prevented him from understanding more than a few words of the comments she made. He did understand enough to know it was somewhat ribald.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lamplighter was still working his way down the street when they reached the nearest hotel that Lt. Macleod considered sufficiently reputable enough for a visiting officer of an allied navy. However, much to his frustration, the clerk would not consider letting a room to a clearly inebriated, unattached woman!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe encountered the same trouble at the next two hotels. The front desk clerk at the second of those positively glared down his large roman nose at Macleod in displeasure. He imagined the wink that Ensign Travis sent the man's way probably exacerbated that particular misunderstanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ironic result of all this moral caution was that the lieutenant was forced to sneak a comely, nubile young woman into his own lodgings so she could sleep the alcohol off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, the girl at least heeded his urgent request to keep her voice down. He couldn't imagine what sort of mayhem she might have caused had any of the gentlemen in the adjoining rooms overheard a female voice that was clearly not the landlady in their male-only boarding house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he spent an uncomfortable night on the floor, using his greatcoat for bedding, he awoke to find an only slightly less lively lass putting the finishing touches on her uniform. Somehow, it was perfectly pressed, despite her antics the previous night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTying the bandanna around her neck seemed to involve as much care as donning his necktie. He stretched out the aching muscles in his back while he waited for her to finish using his mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Top o' the mornin', Looey!\" she chirped to him in the mirror once she finished inspecting herself, which he immediately had to give a panicked shush. She just grinned at him, turned to set about tying his tie for him while asking in a slightly quieter voice, with a seductive tone and a pretty curl to her lips, \"Now who might have helped me out of my uniform last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cheeks blazing as he remembered hastening to face the wall when she suddenly began disrobing, then having to mostly not look after he discovered he had to do something about the fact she hadn't quite managed to completely cover herself with the sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared at the top of her head and stated in stiff tones, \"I assure you, Ensign, you did that for yourself. I had my back turned until you were under the covers, and you woke first, so you saw where I slept.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw no need to mention the thing about the sheets, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned, finished and perched on the edge of the bed to pull on her boots. After a momentary bite of her lower lip and another teasing, eye-twinkling grin, she admitted, \"Wahl, ah guess you bein' a proper gentleman an' all, I won't worry. And Mama teached me ah'd be bleedin' if you done anythin' ungentlemanly to me like that. Which I ain't, so seems like Daddy ain't got nothin' to worry about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cheeks were positively glowing red now. She finished by perching her hat on her head and tightening the chin strap. Leaning back on her hands, which uncomfortably emphasized that bosom and memories of the previous evening to him, she noted, \"Besides, ah reckon we gotta talk now, 'bout our missin' Air Cruisers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cleared his throat and began searching for his officer's hat in order to have a different direction to look, while he clarified, \"The ones that your government still are not willing to admit are missing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead grew a sour look on her face, complete with puckered lips, but she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which is why they sent an intelligence officer all the way from Texas rather than speak to us through regular channels via your embassy here,\" he added while taking a seat at the writing desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother nod, but she grew a slight sheepish smile and scratched the back of her head. \"Y'gonna jes' keep rubbin' my nose in our mess, or tell me whether yer government is willin' to help us look for them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brushed a bit of lint off his officer's hat and studied it for other detritus. \"Ensign Travis, they sent a lieutenant to meet with you. They did not send an adjutant to escort you to Admiralty. That should tell you that they are only willing to hear what you have to say. We still don't even understand what your cruiser squadron was intending to do. Surely your commanders don't think airships could reach the South Pole?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips pooched together as she considered her answer.

'Cause we build 'em more rugged than most 'cause o' hurricanes and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy?\" He had suddenly become concerned. If her father was an expert on airships... Surely Macleod had not just blithely allowed the daughter of the hero of the most recent Texan-Mexican war to spend the night in his bed?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked very unhappy at this point as she nodded. \"That'd be Admiral Travis.

Gillo Amarante was a modern day Leonardo Da Vinci, dabbling in art and inventing. Aldo had been his assistant earning room and board by doing odd jobs for Gillo. Aldo cooked and cleaned. Aldo kept the lamps supplied with oil and the fireplace supplied with coal. Aldo had also modeled for Gillo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAldo accompanied Gillo on the Alvington as it toured the Americas and Europe. Gillo had helped build the Alvington so everywhere Aldo looked, he saw cherubs with his face. Gillo had grown fond of the boy, even fatherly although Gillo would never admit it. Gillo never called Aldo son. Aldo was just an apprentice kept busy all day with various chores. However, Gillo would quietly look after the boy, teaching him and guiding him to a brighter future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGillo's fortunes fluctuated. He was never wealthy but he earned enough to give Aldo and himself a few nice things. It was while traveling in the Americas that Gillo rescued a raccoon from an angry farmer and gave the raccoon to Aldo. Aldo named the raccoon Rogue. Training a wild raccoon was difficult but Gillo helped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen one day while in London, a storm struck the Alvington a fatal blow. The Alvington sank in the Thames just near London Tower. Gillo and Aldo survived but Aldo got separated from Gillo. He searched for Gillo but no one in London had ever heard of the Italian man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAldo got a job as a hotel luggage carrier. He learned that the disaster of the Alvington may not have been completely an accident.  A man by the name of Keane Digby was sought by Scotland Yard for suspicion of sabotage. Aldo remembered many conversations between Keane and Gillo. Keane often asked for details about the construction of the Alvington. Gillo didn't like Keane and didn't like all the questions Keane asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe disaster of the Alvington caused Aldo to think like a romantic and a naturalist. Aldo firmly believed \"Technology will not improve life unless it is accompanied by improvements in the ethics of men.\" Aldo was torn up inside because he wanted to tinker with things like Gillo did but Aldo feared unethical men getting their hands on the machines Gillo made. Aldo longed for the simpler days of the Italian countryside where he and Gillo tinkered in innocence.</span></div></div>",

Edward VII has ascended to the British Imperial throne after the passing of Queen Victoria, Mr. Roosevelt has assumed the American Presidency due to the untimely and most lamentable death of Mr. McKinley, and the amazing creations of the brilliant minds of such scientific luminaries as Mr. Tesla and Dr. Loveless have transfigured our world in astonishing and wondrous ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur adventure sets forth from the Seat of Empire, the Shining Jewel on the Thames (Metaphorically. Between the fog and the coal smoke, not too much literally shining around here.) We meet our hero(ine) in the early evening among the docks of the Port of London.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">Note that I will send GP for especially good entries.

Both are very close to steampunk (in fact, some people credit \u201cWild Wild West\u201d as the first steampunk title.) Also, \u201cLeague of Extraordinary Gentlemen\u201d fits the bill. For the webcomic reader, see \u201cGirl Genius\u201d. For the Anime fan, \u201cSakura Wars\u201d and \u201cSteamboy\u201d are both excellent examples of the genre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere\u2019s a few links to help the steampunk newbie along:<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamPunk\" target=\"_blank\">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamPunk</a><br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SoYouWantTo/WriteASteampunkStory\" target=\"_blank\">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SoYouWantTo/WriteASteampunkStory</a><br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteampunkIndex\" target=\"_blank\">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteampunkIndex</a><br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://steampunk.wonderhowto.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://steampunk.wonderhowto.com/</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSCIENCE is a very important subject in Steam, but kindly toss those physics and chemistry textbooks.
