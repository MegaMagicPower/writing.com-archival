            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Houki gave off a rather large size.  Sitting by herself in the rather spacious dining hall of IS academy, she had been rather down in the dumps lately.   Slumping further down into the circular booth, the only thing on her mind was a certain boy. A boy that she had been enamored with since they were children, someone who she loved, but he only saw her as a close, yet somewhat violent friend. Since their almost 'kiss' around a week ago, the girl fell into her current depressive state, believing that Ichika truly did not see her as a woman.  Letting out another deep sigh, Houki picked at her half-eaten meal with her chop-sticks, not feeling all that hungry at the present moment. It was a rather simple and efficient Japanese meal as well, not too many calories, while giving her the correct amount of nutrition as well.  To anyone else however, it would look like something incredibly boring to consume.  Without her noticing, Ichika strolled into the dining room.  The room itself was rather empty, most of the other students had finished their lunch ages ago.  Since the Gospel incident, all use of IS units had been prohibited, until the exact causes of the catastrophe could be analyzed.  It also didn't help that IS usage became more unpopular with the general populace of the world as result of the experimental unit going rouge.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his new-found free time, Ichika found himself able to do all of his old hobbies again that he needed to cut down on since his arrival at the prestigious school.  One of his favorites past-times was cooking/baking as he did quite a lot of it during his childhood.  Though lately it seemed that he could only bake sweet confections rather than creating actual meals.  Maybe his other skills had deteriorated over time? Deciding it was best to not mull over such details, he tried to find Houki in the common space. Last time he heard, she was moping around in the room.  Noticing that she had been rather down in the dumps lately, Ichika wanted to bake her a small cake to cheer her up.  Holding a white container in his hands, he put quite a lot of effort into making such a treat, using the right amount of frosting, attaining a very moist spongy cake and even getting fresh fruit from the gardening club to use as toppings.  A few minutes went by of the special teen scanning up and down the rows of booths and tables until he actual found the girl.  He hadn't seen Houki in a few days and her appearance slightly shocked him.  Bags under her eyes, her hair not done up in her usual ponytail cascaded down her back, and a demure expression made her look quite cute to anyone really, but it made Ichika concerned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo.\" was all that he need to say. Surprised at the sudden noise, she looked up to see Ichika's warm and smiling face. Almost immediately she had an urge to give him a warm smile in return, but maintained her sullen disposition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Ichika it's you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you 'oh Ichika it's you' me.  Don't you say hi to your friends anymore?\" teased her crush.  Of course the word 'friend' hurt the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I've just been tired lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't take it personally, I was just teasing you a bit.  I brought you a present today. Here open it.\" Ichika slowly place the small container in front of her.  Surprised, she looked at Ichika and then back towards the container.  Opening it, she saw that it was a cake.  This cake had strawberry frosting adorned with actual strawberries and spelled out 'For Houki' in blue frosting.  The sight of such a treat made the girl frown somewhat.  She was never one for sweets and the calorie-filled pastry would ruin her perfect diet as well.  Closing the small box, she pushed it towards Ichika.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I don't do sweets.\"  By her words, his expression became a bit downfallen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? I made it especially for you! And you didn't even taste it yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure. I do appreciate the thought.\" And once again, she stared back into her half-eaten meal.  Most of it had surely gone cold by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah fine, if that's how it's going to be.  Anyways I'll be off, I'll give this to Cecelia if you don't want it.\"  Houki's ears peaked at that last part.  Cecelia? What does she have to do with any of this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why would you give it to someone else?\" Ichika found the question a tad bit weird.  What was the problem in giving away the cake?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you don't want it.  Cecelia likes my baking a lot and I thought she might like this one too.\" At the piece of info, something clicked inside Houki's semi-oblivious mind.  If another girl liked his baking at ate his creations regularly then that would mean that they would be spending more time with him! Also they would make Ichika very happy too! She knew from experience that nothing made the teen happier than seeing other people enjoying his food.  She had been such a fool! Why hadn't she had realized this earlier?!? Reaching out to the box in Ichika's hands, she forcible took it and placed it back in front of her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On second thought, you made this for me so it would be the courteous thing to eat it. No need to bring in anyone else.  Especially that girl...' said the girl as she mumbled the last part of her sentence.  Ichika's expression brightened and he took a seat right next to her.  Her face flushed from the proximity, but as usually, Ichika was too dense for such things.  Taking the small fork from inside the box, she began to dig in,  Bringing a forkful to her mouth, she slowly placed it into her mouth.  As soon as she did, a burst of flavor hit her very being.  It was delicious! Incredibly so! Strawberries, cream, sugar any kind of flavor hit her palate all at once. She turned to Ichika, a grand smile on her face and a small tear in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-This is incredible! How did you make it taste so unbelievable?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well practice I guess. Go on then, eat the rest of it!\" said Ichika, responding kindly to the flattery. With gusto the girl ate the sweet confection. Bite after bite, she wished the cake would never run out.  Around 10 minutes later, she disappointingly found the container empty.  Houki felt rather full at the moment too, who knew such a food could be that filling? Ichika sported a wide smile. He truly did love seeing people enjoy his food so much.  Staring at the girl, she seemed transfixed at the empty box, though he noticed she had traces of frosting still on her defined chin and around her mouth. Taking out a handkerchief from his breast pocket, he motioned the girl to come closer to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-Ichika?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mere, you have frosting all over your face.\" said the boy as he presented the small piece of cloth.  Blushing, she went in closer, her heartbeat increasing at his gesture.  Bringing the cloth to her face, he gently cleaned the residue from it.  Gentle motions up and down, left and right, he made sure to leave no trace.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There all finished. I'm glad to see you like it so much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah i-it was pretty g-good.\" stuttered the 'warrior' as her face still tingled from his touch.  Ichika made himself stand up from the seat. One of his shows was coming up and now he actually had the free time to watch it. However Houki quickly grabbed his lone hand with both of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Houki?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ichika, do you mind if we do that again sometime? I really liked doing this with you.\" She dared not look into his eyes, a look of vulnerability made itself obvious and she doubted that he would appreciate such a 'pathetic' expression.  Ichika warmly smiled at her.  He didn't know why, but he found it cute when she acted shy like this. Using his free hand, Ichika gently lifted her face to look at him. At this point her face as red as it could be but she enjoyed his touch oh so much.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Houki. Anytime you want.\" said the boy in a soft tone.  He felt it was important to spend time with her, just enough to return her to regular 'Houki' levels.  She acted quite weirdly during these past moments.  Releasing his hold right after, she did the same to his hand.  Waving goodbye, he left her in the room, he left her with a warm sensation flooding her body.  Her face still red, she slide back into her seat, her mind still quite fuzzy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Cakes don't have too many calories right?' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchika himself felt a tad bit weird hanging out with the girl. He couldn't place it, but it was nice simply being with her. Really nice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe I should ask her to watch my shows with me next time? Does enjoy soap operas?' wondered the boy as he made his way down the hall back to his dorm.  He had to think this one over.  </span></div></div>",

She didn't feel like closing the blinds, and when the suns rays got annoying...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah screw this,\" she sat up, yawning and stretching. She got up and went to the bathroom and groomed herself. Shower, tooth brushing, the works.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finished putting on her uniform she turned and saw her kendo stick. She should begin training before breakfast. As she reached for the kendo she heard her cellphone ring. Walking away from thw wooden practice sword, she answered her cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Morning Houki. How are you feeling?</i>\" It was Ichika. Houki blushed slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Ichika! Good morning. I'm feeling fine, how are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Doing good myself. Today is the season premiere of a new show that I'm gonna watch! It has an itneresting premise and I an hoping it does good, and I was wondering if you can watch it with me?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When does it start? What about breakfast?\" Houki could have sworn that she heard grilling in the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I got that taken care of. I'm making blueberry pancakes!</i>\" Houki flushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I am planning on doing some morning training. I got to keep my kendo skills sharp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh...I see...well maybe I can hit up Rin and-</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On second thought I'd be right over!\" Houki ended the call and darted out the door. No way is she going to let that Chinese pygmy get the day with Ichika! Not while she has something to say about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter running through some halls she reached Ichika's dorm and stormed inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Houki?\" Said Ichika from his small kitchen. As Houki was trying to see if any other of her rivals where present her nose was bombarded with a sense like no other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlueberries...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is the pancakes...ready?\" Asked Houki slowly, as if the aroma was causing her to be light headed. Ichika, wearing his white apron and turned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh almost. You can take a seat on the sofa. I'll be right over.\" He turned back to the flipping of the specially made flapjacks. He was rather astonished on how fast she was in getting to his dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it ready yet?\" Asked Houki impatiently with her arms crossed. For some reason the boy didn't seem scared like any other time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep it's finished!\" He carried a dark blue plate with the blue-spotted pancakes. Houki stared at them in amazement, almost as if they were glowing with a holy light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then? Shall we watch? The show is called <i>Fantastic Reality</i>!\" Ichika sat down next to her and set down some plates with forks and knives and turned on the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Houki began to dig in.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as the doughy substance hit the taste buds of her mouth, the girl gave off an audible gasp.  Just like the day before, this culinary confection of Ichika's was a delight to one's palate, the different flavors of the pancake acting in perfect harmony.  Houki could have sworn that she was tearing up a tad, the blueberry flavor slowly over taking her mind.  Her face shifting towards a shade of red, she turned to Ichika, an amazed look to her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-Ichika, this is, this is! I c-can't even describe it!\" exclaimed the 'warrior' girl who felt as if she was in a state of pure bliss.  Ichika stereotypically rubbed the back of his head in embarrassment, a small laugh accompanied the motion.  He did enjoy getting praise for his cooking as he never received any during his lonely childhood.  And getting such compliments by Houki, the often crass girl, made him feel all the better.  Though he did wonder why her comment also made it feel like his heart skipped a beat.  Maybe he over did it with the sugar in his pancakes? Shaking these thoughts out of his rather dense mind, Ichika paid his attention back to his stack of blueberry pancakes.  The teen gave himself about 3 of them, while he shoveled the rest of them to Houki, giving her a rather large stack on the white plate.  Placing a piece in his mouth, the flat-screen TV in front of the two began to blare the opening credits of 'Fantastic Reality' showing off all of the main characters while playing the cheesy theme song in the background. Ichika grew excited by the sight of his anticipated program starting, while Houki still remained unimpressed.  The characters themselves look rather cliche, the song was horrible and the main female love interest looked plain as a daisy in a flower field.  Finishing one pancake, she moved on to the second of several of them, savoring each and every gram of her meal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, I told you. It looks pretty great right?\" said Ichika in an excited tone, clearly enjoying himself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, I can see why you were looking forward to it.\" lied Houki, still not seeing the appeal of the program.  She simply continued to eat, happy that this was all it took to be able to spend time with her crush.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you like romance shows huh?\"<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour had passed and the show started to show the credits, accompanied with another theme song.  It only took a few commercial breaks for Houki to truly admire such a show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ichika! This show! I must watch more!\" proclaimed Houki as she turned to the boy, giving him a pleading face.  The girl was very close to his face, obviously making him nervous.  In the past, whenever she would be that close, she would often strike him with all of her strength.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I have some other dvds of shows that are similar to this if you'd wanna watch. Hell, I'd even let you borrow them too.\" said the black-haired student, still quite nervous from her proximity.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um! I'd like that very much Ichika!\"said Houki, giving Ichika a quick hug as a result of her excitement over these shows and the pancakes she had finished a few minutes ago.  Realizing what she was doing, she quickly released her hold, her face burning with her self-inflicted embarrassment.  Looking away from Ichika, she failed to see that he was also quite flushed, not that accustomed towards receiving such affection.  Once again, he felt his heart skip a beat, and finding himself to be questioning the emotion he was currently experiencing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, your plate is empty, want another helping Houki?\" He pointed to her desolate plate, all that remained was traces of sticky syrup plus small grams of blueberries.  At the moment, Houki did feel quite full, but she could never deny Ichika or he'd most likely share the food with one of the other girls.  If she wanted to win, she needed to make Ichika the happiest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'd love more.\" replied the girl in a quiet tone.  Giving off a beaming smile, he rose from his comfy seat on his sofa, gathered both of their plates and utensils and headed back to his favorite place, the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Houki! There's a show coming up next that you might like too! It has a female lead, thought there's more than one love interest. It's called 'Lover's Game' and it's pretty popular with girls apparently.\" While the last show did not interest her until she got to the 'meat' of the soap opera, this premise intrigued her greatly.  Leaning back into the couch in an attempt to get into a more comfortable position, she placed both of her small hands on her midsection.  As a result of her previous meal, she felt it to be a bit taut.  The thought that she had overeaten did not cross her mind, the only thoughts present were those of Ichika and the show starting in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good! Hurry up so you can watch it with me~.\" shouted out Houki, using a cutesy tone that even surprised her.  Though Ichika took no notice of the change in her voice, he was too occupied with his stove, preparing the pan for the batter.  Maybe he'd use strawberries this time?      </span></div></div>",

This seems more of a girl show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I gues you can say that I can relate to the main character, Ayase, somehow. But I can't place my finger on what it is...\" Houki tried hard to laugh. \"Though I do hope she ends up with Yukio or Junichi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The youngest of group and the childhood friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. I got more DVDs lying about. Interested?\" Houki began to think. If she accepted, she would miss out on kendo training she planned for today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I do have kendo to get today around noon. I can't slack off can I.\" The teen shrugged as Houki got up and walked for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah okay then. Guess I'll go bake my french vanilla brownies today. Do you think that because Charlotte is french she would love french vanilla products?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Houki about faced as fast a bullet. First Cecillia, now Charlotte he planned on sharing his food!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if the pancakes were as good as the brownies...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's okay if I skip a day, besides I'm already here and I'd be happy to try out your brownies!\" Ichika beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! We can watch 'Supernatural High' and 'The Satan Straights'! I'll start prepping the brownies, you can get the DVDs over on the shelf.\" Houki obliged and walked over to the shelf, getting the DVDs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ichika, can we have something else with the brownies?\" She said as Ichika inspected inside his pantry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" She heard him reply back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like lunch or something. You can do other stuff besides baking right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! Got anything in mind for lunch?\" Houki began to think...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprise me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay you start watching!\" She heard him scuffle around a bit more, exit the pantry and enter back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've already watched those two last night. You can catch up while I cook up lunch.\" Houki inserted the DVD of 'Supernatural High' and walked into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind if I borrow these chips?\" She asked, holding a potato chip bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be my guest.\" Houki nodded at Ichika's reply and sat back down and started the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I may get behind on kendo...but if it means spending more time with Ichika, then I'll gladly sacrifice a day or two,' thought the 'warrior' girl as she opened up the bag and started snacking as the opening credits rolled.</span></div></div>",

This time around the credits were much more upbeat, suggesting that the program would be more light-hearted compared to the previous soaps that the brown-haired girl had seen earlier this day.  The credits soon ending and the show finally started, opening up with the male main character waking up in his small dorm-room.  Soon after, a girl with small dog ears on the peak of her head, complete with an energetic wagging tail burst into the room and attacked the still drowsy hero, wrapping all her limbs on him, causing him to stumble to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That looks like a nice maneuver...' thought Houki, grabbing a handful of chips this time around, the crumbs spilling around on her uniform top.  Watching the rest of the intro, Houki understood the premise of this quirky show. Essentially the protagonist, an everyday teen who was thrust into a world of monsters upon his 18th birthday after he discovered his lineage of famous magi.  Bearing this impressive gift, he was sent to an eastern branch of an academy which enrolled various students with supernatural backgrounds. Now this included every type of 'supernatural being' from witches, to werewolves to even zombies! As per usual for this type of show, this main character finds himself attracting a variety of 'monster girls' who become smitten with him in various events.  The main heroine was a werewolf, who looked oddly familiar to Houki.  Long brown hair wrapped with a red ribbon, she was very affectionate in private, but tended to shy away from her feelings when the two were out an about in the school.  The girl continued to watch the episode, deeply enjoying the plot and character interactions. She couldn't help herself from routing for the werewolf girl for some reason though.  The episodes continued on as Houki munched and munched away.  By the mid-point of the third showing, the bag of chips was emptied, it's contents digesting inside Houki's stuffed tummy. At this point, it was slightly taut, filled with the pancakes she had eaten earlier as well as the bag of chips.  Giving it a slight rub, she knew that she would soon be at her limit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Houki, lunch is finally ready!\" shouted out Ichika as he emerged from the kitchen.  A tray was placed in his hands, a plateful of white brownies as well as an entree consisted of a two pieces of chicken Parmesan accompanied with a healthy serving of pasta dripping with a creamy sauce.  Houki involuntarily drooled at the sight, despite the protests in her stomach which screamed to not eat this meal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ichika! This is restaurant quality, where did you ever find materials like this to use?\" questioned the seated girl.  Ichika gave out an embarrassed laugh at the compliment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Cecelia shipped me some ingredients from over-seas and it's simple enough to prepare once you get the hang of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cecelia? What's the reason for her to do such a thing.\" asked the girl, quite suspicious of this arrangement that the two had.  Ichika, sensing the 'bad-mood' stemming from his friend, he attempted to ease the situation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I cook for her sometimes, and she saw the potential I had with cooking and wanted to give me the best materials to cook with.  That's all really.\" This still did not satisfy Houki.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that really the reason?\" quietly asked the girl. She was getting nervous at this point, Did those two have something else going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it I promise! I mean what else could there be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could be doing this because you like her...\" Just by those words, the girl felt her heart sinking at that possibility.  Could he really have feeling for the British girl? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...it's not like that Houki. I don't see her as anything other than a close friend.\" stated Ichika with a sigh.  He knew issues like this were particularly difficult, especially when discussing with other girls.  Though Houki certainly felt more at ease by what he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mean that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do. I'd never lie to you Houki-pokey. Now here, eat up or you food will get cold. I'll get my food and join you.\" said the dark-haired teen, giving the tray to his friend and walking off into the kitchen.  Hearing the nickname that he gave her, she puffed up her cheeks slightly in a mix of annoyance and embarrassment and with a hint of glee,  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mou, what's with that nickname...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it suits y'know.\" Ichika had her own tray and sat down next to Houki, not noticing that she had shifted slightly close to her crush.  A slight blush on her face, she dug into her food, savoring the rich taste of it all.  Saving the white brownies for last, she was in no hurry to finish the meal, despite the slight discomfort in her midsection.  She continued on though, a small thought in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Houki-pokey... is this  </span></div></div>",

She had her right hand on her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Full...stuffed...\" She groaned and gave a yawn. \"Sleepy too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna take a nap back at your room?\" The warrior girl nodded, and the teen helped her up and supported her with looping her left arm over his neck as they walked towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, napping can cause some irregularities in one's sleeping pattern. But I have a feeling you'll recover just fine.\" Smiled Ichika. Houki would only give several grunts as they walked down the<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she gave a unlady-like blech, and covered her mouth in embarassment, the gas exited by flushed at what she done it in front of the boy she secretly admires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're excused.\" Chuckled Ichika. Houki blushed and looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"s-s-sorry. I should have controlled myself better. I mean-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine. You should hear Chifuyu's belchs back when she ate my cooking back in the day. They made yours seem rather tame!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\" She looked puzzled at him. The most skilled IS user Chifuyu, Ichika's sister...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurping! It was an uncharacteristic thought of the warrior girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. Back when I started cooking she helped me test taste. She always gave off such belchs, but since she started using her IS she always eats out whenever I try to cook for her,\" Ichika looked a bit sullen as he looked down. \"Maybe she didn't like my cooking anymore...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!\" Yelled Houki, seemingly reviving with vigor as she jumped up. But wobbled and put on hand on her taut mid-section. \"That's insane! Your cooking is the best I've ever tasted!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it is! When I see Chifuyu again I'm gonna give her a piece of my mind!\" Some reason Houki felt insulted that the woman she looks up to as a role model refuses to eat Ichika's cooking that has the taste of gods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait hold on! Maybe you don't need to yell at her I mean-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious! I mean, who in their right mind would-\" She covered her mouth and muffled a small burp. \"Excuse me. Anyways, who in their right mind would not want to eat your cooking! To prove it, if you have any other recipes.\" She suddenly gave off a yawn, vigor leaving her. \"I'll be happy to taste them for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Houki nodded. Ichika beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great! How about tonight after your nap? I'll scrounge up something for dinner and maybe find some new DVDs as well! If I remember correctly there's one called 'Holiday Horror' and another named 'Samurai of the Stars'. Interested?\" Houki gave a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Just-\" She yawned again. \"I need to take a nap...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the two teens walked down the corridors and ended up at Houki's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... Tonight around 6 or 7?\" Houki nodded, too sleepy to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then.\" He helped her inside and he helped place her down on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See ya tonight!\" And Ichika bounced out of the room and Houki plopped onto the bed, dead asleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Houki found herself drifting off into a deep sleep relatively quickly, her body lethargic from the mass quantity of food she had consumed.  Hours and hours passed as the girl snoozed the rest of the day away.  Slowly stirring, Houki hazily got up into a sitting position on her comfy bed.  Giving off a rather loud yawn, complete with her stretching out her arms in the air, Houki then looked towards her window, noticing that it was pitch black outside.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What? Did I sleep for that long?' though the confused girl to herself, turning over to get a better look at her alarm clock.  The digital number blinked 8:30.  Letting out a disappointed sigh, and dropped back into her bed.  How could she have overslept like that? Granted she didn't set the alarm clock to awaken herself well before her dinner with Ichika as she simply fell into sleep readily after being helped into her room, but to miss such an important event like this, it simply made her angry at herself for such a stupid action.  Staring up at her blank ceiling, she thought of what Ichika did after she failed to show up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'He probably found Charlotte or Cecelia to have dinner with him. Gaaah! Why did I mess up this badly?' Wallowing in her self pity, she stayed like this for a few more minutes, thinking of Ichika feeding Cecelia a creamy eclair, or having 'fun' with Charlotte.  Steadily getting up, she decided to at least change out of her academy outfit if she was going to mope around.  Removing her top and skirt, revealing her white undergarments, Houki slipped on a black long sleeve shirt and a pair of white sweats.  Taking off her bright red ribbon, Houki let her long hair flow freely.  Going over to her small refrigerator, she pulled out a carton of her favorite flavor of ice cream, cookie dough, which she would treat herself too whenever she was feeling blue.  Sitting at her wooden desk, Houki then dug into her 'meal' of the night. The taste was good, but not as good as Ichika's cooking, which the 'warrior' girl greatly lamented.  It went on like this for some time, with the girl simply satisfying herself to something sweet.  Before she knew it, her clock read 9:00.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I might as well just go back to sleep...' thought Houki, resting her head on the wooden surface.  Despite her long rest, the weariness of it all slowly enveloped her.  Closing her eyes, she suddenly heard a knocking towards her door.  Groaning at the fact that she couldn't drift off, the student stumbled out of her chair, motioning towards the source of the current annoyance. Opening the door with a look of great annoyance, she soon changed that face as she saw just who was interrupting her peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-Ichika! W-What are you doing here?!\" In front of her was said teen, with his ever present goofy smile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, well I didn't want to be THAT kind of person, but when you were late to dinner, I kinda wanted to check up on you. Y'know to make sure you were okay and such.\" honestly answered Ichika.  While he was somewhat concerned that she failed to show up, he didn't want to be seen as 'clingy' or whatever that meant.  Houki however, greatly appreciated the thought.  Though at the time she was somewhat embarrassed by her current state of dress.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ichika..., well I ended up oversleeping that's all. I only woke up around an hour ago, but I figured you were already eating dinner with someone else, so I didn't bother showing up. I'm glad that you came to check up on me though...\" she trailed off, slightly reddened by giving her excuse.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, eating dinner with someone else? Who could I possibly eat dinner with?\" asked the male, clearly confused by her fears.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh? Didn't you say that you cook for Cecelia sometimes? And you mentioned Charlotte when you were cooking your pastries earlier today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I just make food for the others sometimes. I don't really eat with them that much I guess.  You're the only one I tend to have dinner with though.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Really?! I mean, really?\" Even at this point, she felt her heart beating faster and faster by his naive words. Was she the only part of their group that got the wonderful luxury of sharing meals with Ichika?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I mean you are my closest friend, so it's only natural.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'O-Oh well of course that makes sense then. It's only n-natural just like you said.\" While she found the concept of 'friend' to be a bit disheartening, still the fact that was able to be so close to him dispelled those feelings.  As expected of one who had not eaten in quite some time, her stomach gave off a growl which was loud enough to be heard by her crush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-A-Ah, well I haven't eaten yet...\" Ichika laughed at how his friend presented herself at that moment.  What was the word, cute? Yes she was acting very cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey is fine, you 'skipped' dinner after all.  Shall we go get some food Houki?\" She wanted to say yes, however she wasn't exactly dressed for the occasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, I'm all dressed down and it isn't very lady-like...\"  Placing his hand on her shoulder, Ichika simply smiled at her worries which seemed to be perpetual at this point.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey it's fine. I mean you look very cute right now haha. Now c'mon, let's get that stomach of yours settled.\" stated Ichika, grabbing onto her wrist and leading her into the hallways.  While this seemed completely innocent to the boy, Houki could feel herself heating up from said action.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Cute? He thinks I'm cute....\" thought the girl, her mind growing hazy due to his compliment.  Maybe he did see her as something else?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe?  </span></div></div>",

She always did wanted to continue on those two series.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah okay then...\" In no time they reached Ichika's room and Houki sat down at her prior spot. On the coach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make yourself at home,\" smiled the teen as he donned a new apron, one red and green with a watermelon theme and went to work in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do ya want?\" Asked the teen as he delved into the depths of his pantry. Houki walked up the DVD case and spotted the second volumes of FT and SH.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprise me!\" She said. For some reason she didn't mind what Ichika cooked. It turned out good so far. Maybe he had some sort of golden touch of his?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started up on the second DVD of Fantastic Reality. She heard the boring opening song come to her ears and waited as she heard the pots and pans in Ichika's kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Some time later-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This whole thing is a psychadelic trip. This has to be it...\" What has occured in FT was that the main characters now found themselves in some fantasy world that has decided to get high and screw physics. There was floating buildings, clouds that looked like yellow cotton candy, horses doing ballet, and a duo of bad guys who looked like a hermaphodite clown and an English victorian gentleman. What's was even more innteresting was that the characters literally had no powers, but had to survive on riddles and puzzles, and general survival. If they didn't there was several rather brutal traps, like a living breathing bear-trap that took one of the world's residents can ground him into a bloody paste and jack-in-the-boxes with chainsaws. If it wasn't for the bright and colorful world and more like real life, Houki would have suspected this world to be something akin to survival horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was still good, even if she knows who the main character will fall in love with the summer dress blonde girl and their friends trying to survive the evil duo's games. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner's ready!\" Houki's senses were assaulted by...cheese, a scent of meat but spicy, and something else. And Ichika came into view, his hands holding what seems to be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pizza?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! Home-made!\" Houki's eyes rose. Homemade pizza?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I never knew pizza an be homemade!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every single meal starts at home! Pizza was created in Italy and was a homemade dish before it become popular and made into food branches,\" He set the pizza down on the coffee table and sat next to Houki. \"finished volume two huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can such a bright world have such a...dark and brutal setting? I mean that doll figure that was trying to escort the people from our world away from those two...and into that bear trap...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but it gets better later on. It's more an intelligent show, despite the bland designs of the main characters, they need to use smarts to survive and return to their real world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if it's all...like a dream or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's still running. Who knows?\" Houki reached down to have a slice of the pepperoni pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she could have sworn that her taste buds exploded in glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing!\" Is all Houki could say. There were no words to describe the taste of this pizza!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you like it. I'll start up on Supernatural High. I think volume two introduces the vampire girl, the zombie girl and maybe the Alraune...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alraune?\" She talked with her mouth full, stuffing her first slice in her mouth. She could care less about her slowly distended stomach, she wants this pizza now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Search it up online. It's a bit creepy, that sort of monster...\" Ichika said as he took out the FR disk and inserted the SH disk. All the while Houki started on her second slice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-During the run time of Supernatural High-.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHouki was onto her 7th slice and Ichika was only on his 2nd, and over half the pizza is gone. Houki was rubbing her distaut belly as she kept watching the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently the main character now had not only the werewolf girl, the werewolf girl's loli little sister and the lamia(who Houki seemed to compare to Cecillia) seeking his affections, but also the short and loli-esque vampire girl(who reminded Houki of Rin), the zombie girl who looked human save for the grey skin and stitches everywhere on her person(Charlotte), and the Alraune who seemed to be original had bit of a BDSM complex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poke\", and she felt something touch her belly. There was Ichika grinning as a fool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Houki-pokey.\" Houki began to blush and</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking away from her crush, Houki could literally feel her face burning up with embarrassment.  His touch lingered on her distended middle, quite sore from the incredible amount of food that the girl had consumed during the course of the day.  All this attention was getting too much for the poor student could handle; her heart was beating quite faster as well. As usual, Ichika failed to realize that his actions were directly causing her to feel this strongly about him.  Really, at the moment, he thought of what next to make for his good 'friend.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mou, Ichika...don't tease me like that.  And don't call me that either...\"  said Houki, still looking away, not daring to make eye contact at the moment.  Why did he even start calling her that name? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, well why not? It's pretty cute I think.\" stated the boy, once again failing to see exactly how important his words were to Houki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I doesn't matter if it's c-cute or not!\" replied the flustered girl, struggling to even say the word 'cute.'  \"We're not in that kind of relationship, so stuff like that simply isn't okay to blurt out!\" continued ranting the girl.  Of course, if they were in an actually relationship, she would have loved any pet-name that he could call her, but in this situation, it simply felt cruel to her.    Seeing that she was actually upset, Ichika did his best to calm her down.  Placing a firm hand on her shoulder for the second this night, he carried a warm smile on her face.  This however caused Houki to feel even more down. Why would fate tease her in such a way.  Despite what her heart felt, her mind would always remind her that she didn't 'deserve' Ichika.  He deserved a kind girl who would never lose their temper, never start fights and never injure those that she cared for.  So far, Houki didn't even match one of these points.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey don't be like that Houki.  I call you that because you mean a lot to me and everything.  Tell you what, I'll bake you your very own cake to make it up for teasing you. How 'bout it?\"  said the teen with a grin, the exact one that would cause her to internally sworn.  Houki's conflicted feelings began to dissipate, somewhat satisfied by his reasoning of their relationship.  However, she couldn't shake the feeling of wanting more out of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A cake? Like the one you made me yesterday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, though I can make it bigger if that's what you want.\"  Almost on cue, the simple idea of a large cake for Houki to enjoy caused her mouth to water, despite protests from her taught belly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well perhaps one a bit bigger than yesterday. One with a lot more strawberry frosting if that's alright.\" Standing up and collecting all of the left-over dishes, Ichika gave a bow towards Houki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish m'lady.\" said Ichika, doing his best to not laugh at his joke. Houki however, gave off a cute giggle.  With that, Ichika went back to his own kitchen to whip up the treat for the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel free to watch some other series too!\" called out Ichika as he adorned his quirky apron.  Grunting as she lifted herself up from the comfortable couch, Houki went over to where Ichika's tv was and looked among the various DVD's he had laid out.  There was one series that caught the girl's eye.  The title read 'Momo Festival.' What set this cover different from the other series that Houki had enjoyed so much was that the main heroine depicted was actually a tad bit larger than the typical 'soap opera' female lead.  This brown-haired girl looked to be around a good 30-50 lbs overweight and for some reason, this greatly intrigued the 'warrior' girl.  Popping in the DVD into the player, she sat back down and eagerly awaited the start of the program.  Opening credits flashed and the setting was shown.  Watching for a good amount of time, Houki once again grasped the premise of the show.  The soap opera starred a high-school girl named Momo, who aspired to become a world class pastry chef and as a result, started up a cooking club at her high school. Due to her love of sweets as a child, Momo was quite heavy for her age.  The story begins with Momo busy with her club, which members consisted of her thin best friend, and an American transfer student who was also training to become a chef.  Like the previous story, this would be considered a 'reverse-harem,' with only three main rivals for her heart.  Shin, the ever-lasting warrior who wanted to slim her down as he believed she was the only 'pure' girl in the school, Gai, the tall and shy teen who only recently discovered his love of larger females and Takeshi, the sports star who finds himself quite flustered around Momo for some reason.  As she feels like no one would actually like her large, she is quite oblivious to their advances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ichika, this show 'Momo Festival,' it's very interesting.\" called out Houki, her interest at an all time high.  Seeing Momo getting stuffed by her own creations seemed very appealing to Houki, but she couldn't place why.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I love that show.  I mean it is pretty generic but a main character that isn't a stick is like a fresh breath of air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Not a stick?' thought Houki.  Where there people out there that preferred women that weren't thin?  Keeping that thought in mind, Houki kept watching, greatly enjoying each second.  <br>\r\n----<br>\r\nAround an hour later, Houki had finished up the third ep and things were certainly heating up.  Momo's weight had risen a good 10 pounds due to club activities, but there was no real romantic advances.   Her stomach having settled down her earlier meals, now seemed to crave even more food. Specifically Ichika's cooking.  As soon as that thought crossed the girl's mind, Ichika walked out of the kitchen, a bit messy from the flour and the frosting.  In his hands held a dish that supported the grand cake, pink in frosting and three layers in height.  Houki right away, sported a look of pure delight.  Setting it down onto the coffee table, he also gave Houki a smaller plate and cut out a generous portion for his friend.   Before giving her the fork, Ichika used it to make a small mouthful of cake.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Houki open up please!\" said the teen, holding the fork towards her mouth while his other hand was right underneath it in case the cake fell off the fork.  The beating of her heart increases spontaneously, but  she could never pass down such an chance to get closer to him.  Nearing her head towards his extended arm, she ate the piece, which was quite delicious and the blush on her face spread quite rapidly.  Ichika gave a grin at her enjoyment.  She really was 'cute' right now, was his thoughts right now.  Cutting a smaller slice for himself, the two continued to watch the show, Ichika unaware that Houki was unknowingly closing the distance between the two. </span></div></div>",

What are you to doing at this hour?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just watching shows and having dinner. I cooked.\" Smiled Ichika. And Houki saw something that made her eyes widen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChifuyu's mouth was open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You c-c-co-cooked?\" Chifuyu was shaking! Visibly shaking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. Might have some pizza and cake left.\" Ichika walked to the coffee table and grabbed a slice and placed it on his plate offered it towards the taller woman. \"Want some?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHouki could not imagine it. Chifuyu Orimura, one of the best IS pilots in the academy if not the world...was shaking as if she saw a black mamba on the plate instead of cake.But she was smacking her lips, but shaking her head, as if trying to resist it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OnsecondthoughtnevermindbiIchika!\" Chifuyu blurted out as she ran out the door and slammed it. They could hear the footfalls of her running away. Ichika and houki could only blink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...that was wierd...\" Said Ichika as he set down his cake and sat next to Houki and played the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totally...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe she didn't like the aroma of the cake? Maybe it was bad after all...She used to love my cooking immensely back then...\" Said the teen dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She ate your cooking when you were younger?\" Ichika nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. But she stopped one day after complaining about a skirt or something. I guess that's her way of saying I made crappy food and didn't want to eat mine since...\" Now the warrior girl felt sorry for her crush, and appalled at her idol. How can anyone not like this food! That's absurd!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your cooking is top notch Ichika! Forget what Chifuyu says or does! It's good! Really really good! In fact! To prove it to you I'll eat all this cake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gimme!\" Normally her stomach and female rationality would have objected to such an action, but her emotions have gotten the better of the warrior girl. She was going to chow down on this magnificent cake! She was going to get closer to Ichika!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No matter what!' Houki thought to herself as she started to chow down fast, cleaning her plate and starting on the cake itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...Okay then!\" Ichika played the soap opera again as Houki continued to scarf down the cake.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>About an hour or so passed since the long-haired girl opted to consume the remainder of the cake that Ichika had graciously baked for her, and Houki could not have felt more stuffed and satisfied.  While her belly was still quite full and hard to the touch, his food just made her feel so much better.  Though she felt as if she were to eat another bite, her stomach would literally pop. Her plate, filled with crumbs and the remnants of frosting, was placed on the nearby coffee table; this ceramic disc certainly served it's purpose.  The girl was under the large and soft mass of the blanket, her hands covertly soothing her aching tummy.  She couldn't let Ichika see such un-feminine actions, so the black blanket was perfect for her to use.  Gently rubbing the sphere that was formerly her 'flat as could be' stomach, the discomfort she was feeling was not alleviating itself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh well. A bit of an upset stomach is worth it if it means I can eat such a delicious meal.' thought the girl as she slumped back into the couch, snuggling further into the blanket.  She deeply inhaled the masculine scent that attached itself to the cotton material; a blush was slowly growing on her face as she did so.  Her face half snuggled into the fabric, Houki once again paid attention to the soap opera that was currently playing.  The two were still watching 'Momo Festival' and they were both highly enjoying it.  The current episode dealt with Momo's slight weight gain over the first few story arcs, and eventually, she began to crash diet.  The fictional heroine also went as far as giving up cooking all in the effort of losing a few pounds. Needless to say, this episode covered the dangers of undergoing a diet to starve oneself.  Stealing a quick glance towards Ichika, she noticed that he looked a bit angry.  This sight alone sent shivers up the poor girl's spine.  Normally Ichika was a care-free as a person could be, but when he puts on a more serious face, things were far from okay. A sudden thought flashed itself in the girl's mind, one that made her worrying increase ten-fold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What if he's angry at me?!? Did I overstay my welcome?' frantically pondered Houki, fearing the worst possible scenario.  Granted it was pretty late, but he hadn't mentioned anything like that.  Maybe he just expected her to leave?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-Ichika? Is something w-wrong? stuttered the warrior girl, her nervousness building up inside her.  Houki's voice broke Ichika's inner musings, causing him to look at the her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait what?\" said the boy, slightly confused.  He wasn't actually paying attention to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked if something was wrong. You looked a bit a-angry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Oh, no no no. I wasn't angry I was just thinking.\"  Tilting her head a bit to the side, she was unsure of his answer.  Ichika never really thought that much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what?\" said Houki, steadily inching closer to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well about this show's plot.  For a girl like Momo to suddenly drop her wishes to become a great cook all to lose a bit of weight, it's just so unreasonable.  I also think that's its pretty detestable how she ignored her body and literally starved herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never knew that you would feel that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do have some pride in my cooking skills and I hate to see good food go to waste.  It's only natural that I would dislike this kind of stuff.\"  Houki was generally surprised at his reaction. Generally, Ichika was never that passionate about anything really.  However, for people to not waste their food, did he mean...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ichika, do you like g-girls with good appetites?\" asked Houki.  Of course it would be easy to figure this one out judging by what he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, if you put it like that, then yeah, I can confirm it.  I mean, I really enjoy it when people like my food and they finish it as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" was all that Houki said, snuggling her face back into the comforting blanket.  She took in another great inhale, immensely enjoying the scent that belonged to Ichika.  Feeling as if she was being watched, Houki turned to Ichika, who was staring at her for some reason.  Feeling herself becoming flush, she had a hard time staring into his piercing eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-Ichika, you're staring.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, oh sorry, I was just thinking that you look very 'fluffy' right now.\" said Ichika, still staring at his friend while he felt his face growing warmer for some reason.  In light-speed time, Houki's own body shot up in temperature, the heavy blush on her face only exponentially increasing the 'fluffiness' that Ichika saw in her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-F-Fluffy? What do you mean by that?\" frantically asked the girl, who now lost the willpower to look at her crush in this somewhat awkward moment.  Ichika was also beginning to think that maybe he shouldn't have said such a thing without a hint of warning.  Though we was smart enough that he had to be careful with his choice of words, as Houki was known for her bad temperament.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean 'fluffy' as in you look really adorable right now.  Y'know, like you give off an air that would make anyone want to hug and coddle you. Something like that I guess.\" stated Ichika, conveniently looking at the other side of the room, suddenly finding it to be oh so interesting at the moment.  He thought to himself that is was fine to say stuff like that; they were childhood friends after all right?  Right next to him, Houki was undergoing the human equivalent of a nuclear meltdown.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'A-Adorable!!!!! He thinks that? He wants to hug me too?!'  These sorts of thoughts were all spiraling in her mind as fast as they could be processed.  But wait! This was a good chance for her! She knew when she was currently playing the 'sleep cute' card and she was in control of this 'event' between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Thank you Ichika. Do you want to share the blanket with me? You look a bit cold...\" said Houki as she moved a bit closer to him. She did her best to play out the image she was giving off, slowly nuzzling her face into the blanket.  Once again, Ichika was hit hard by that aura, and essentially had to control himself from doing anything questionable.  Giving a slight nod, he also moved closer to her, while she opened up the fabric, revealing her taut figure underneath.  Sliding right over, he covered them both under the light material.  While Ichika was making sure that he was keeping his hands to himself, Houki, the daring girl that she was, decided to do something a bit unexpected.  This time, she chose to play a different card.  Grabbing his free right hand, she took it and placed it on her tummy, allowing him to feel just how stuffed she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mou, Ichika...my belly is starting to hurt again from all of that food I ate.  Take responsibility for this...\" muttered the girl as she looked at him, her eyes secretly giving off a pleading look.  Slightly hesitant, he began to use his techniques that he would use to give back massages to his dear sister, and gently rubbed the girl's belly.  Houki truly felt like she was in bliss at the moment.  Not only was his food delicious, but his massages were of high quality as well.  It was quiet for quite a while, the pair enjoying both the sensations of the belly rub, and the soap opera that was still going on in front of them.  Despite missing a good chunk of the program, both of them did not mind one bit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ichika. You're not allowed to do this for anyone else...\" said Houki as she felt herself becoming drowsy all of a sudden.  Feeling herself falling asleep, in one last motion the girl leaned over towards Ichika, resting her head on his shoulder.  Ichika smiled warmly at his friend.  Guess it was getting pretty late.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Looks like she's going to spend the night huh?'</span></div></div>",

The Academy decided to have some remedial lessons after the one week break. No IS practice, mainly things like math, foreign languages, and IS Science/Engineering. And the warrior girl was in battle with her lower article of clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt has been an uphill battle ever since she has ate with Ichika last week and she's been eating and watching soaps with him...for the last week each day, spending the night for five of those days. Thankfully she hid whilst Rin and Cecillia came to visit if only to remind Ichika on some stuff. She forgot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut besides the girls, one thing she did come to love was Ichika's cooking, but it was taking a toll upon her figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bosom, once she compared to be the biggest of the 5 girls, was now a bit bigger, enhancing her breasts from a C to a D, making her bra slightly uncomfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the panties, which were a bit snugger than most, as she felt her normally toned legs soften up a bit. After donning her shirt(which covered a soft stomach, only bigger when she ate Ichika's food) and then...the real battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer damned skirt as she tried to clip the button around her hips, and she could have felt a slight softness in her posterior, no only firm as a week ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I um...may have accidentally put my laundry on warm. That may be the cause!\" Houki assured herself as she took a deep breath, and managed to get the button clipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew,\" she let out her air, and she still felt a bit of snugness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I'll go buy student services later and ask for a bigger skirt, now that it has shrunk.\" She did her ribbon and headed out of her apartment and down the hall, walking past other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she felt her cellphone ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Houki. I got the new DVDs for the soaps! They shipped them in this morning,\" said Ichika over the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome! FR, SH, and all the others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup! And an order that I placed from overseas will be arriving too! Some fancy ingredients for me to cook. Care to be the test-taster?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Well...\" Houki has been lacking in kendo...her last two appearances to those classes have been good, but she needs to continue her routine otherwise she will lose her skill. \"I have to make up for kendo Ichika. Sorry.\" She stopped by a vending machine, and inspected it's contents...soda...pop...water<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe inserted her coins and got soda, hearing the can fall and she reached into the slot and picked it up and took a sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" Ichika's said, his voice in a sullen mood. \"Well I'll call Rin up and see if she wants to. She is a good cook like myself after all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHouki spat out the drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what...I'll come by tonight...But just tonight okay!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! I can't wait! See you in class!\" He hung up and Houki took a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Why does Ichika have such good cooking skills...At this rate I'll be spoiled!</i>' She thought. But she shook her dead. '<i>But I refuse the other girls to get time with him when he presents me an opprotunity! I won't lose to them!</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued down the hall, and eventually reached her morning FL class, 4 hous each day of the week of a different language at different times. Monday German and Swiss in the morning. Tuesday French and Spanish(split into 2 hours) at noon. Wednesday English at night. Thursday Japanese morning. Friday Chinese/Korean at noon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was German and Swiss Monday.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>'Looks like I still have five minutes before the class starts. Five minutes to come up with a plan of attack!' thought Houki.  Clearly she had a number of choices in how to approach Ichika and her 'rival.' She could act all haughty and jealous and ignore him for the remainder of the class, making him seek her out later and 'apologize' with a favor. On the other end of that 'spectrum' she could act as a contrast to Cecelia. The shy and reclusive girl to her prideful and outgoing one.  The seconds winding down, Houki opted for the second option.  Taking in a deep breath, Houki entered the classroom, once again ignoring the stares from the other girls in the class.  To put it lightly, Houki's tempter made it so that others would be quite wary to approach her and all sorts of 'rumors' often boiled up from the grapevine about the 'warrior girl'. Hell the strangest rumor that Houki had heard was that she drank the blood of her fallen enemies, which gave her quite a laugh. Going according to her plan, she formed a small and shy smile, and mentally prepared herself to give out a stutter when she would great the boy.  Approaching his desk, Cecelia would be the first to see Houki walking towards the pair, the sly expression on her face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She's finally here. Now my plan can finally start.'  Of course the other long haired girl also had plans of her own.  As a result of the Gospel incident, much free time was given to her and she used them wisely.  Creating a new work-out regiment to lose those pesky five extra pounds and a strict diet was part of her daily life since that fateful event.  Also during the course of the week, this girl had noticed that Houki was spending quite a lot of time with her darling Ichika; what they were doing together was unknown to her.  Though she did know two things for a fact. First, Houki was acting a lot more mellow lately and second, there just seemed to be just a bit 'more' of her around.  Cecelia could not correlate these two issues though, but it seemed like it barely mattered.  What was clear was that she was thinner and that Houki got bigger.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good m-morining I-Ichika.\" Perfect, a stutter of his name. If that wasn't cute, she didn't know what was.  Turning around, Ichika smiled warmly at her, an expression that would always make the warrior girl want to swoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Morning Houki!\" replied the teen.  Cecelia's cat-like smile as she saw the small bulge that formed on Houki's midsection as she sat down next to her precious Ichika. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Houki!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, good morning Cecelia. I've not seen you in a while.  How have you been?\" said Houki. The bored tone in her voice made Cecelia's blood boil a bit higher, but she needed to keep her facade up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh I've been busy with some new training in order to practice some new techniques I've come up with.\" Of course this was a lie, however she hoped it would impress the boy next to her.  Houki found this to be a bit surprising as the pompous girl never seemed to actually do any sort of hard work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that all you did? I mean, did you have anytime to simply relax?\" asked the teen, a bit confused that she would do so much work without proper rest.  It reminded him greatly of his own sister, a woman who would often forget to eat and push herself way beyond her natural limits.  Those types of people were those whom he disliked the most.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course that's all I did this past week.  Relaxation is for the weak of mind! Only the strong and proud are able to keep up with these kinds of regimes.\" ranted on the girl, clearly failing to understand Ichika's words.  Understandably his smile turned into a bit of a frown.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Cecelia, it's good to take a break every now and then...\" said Houki, resting her head on top of the fancy desk.  Her arms were crossed across the surface which created a nice pillow of sorts for her to place her head on.  Of course this was also part of her plan, the sweet to Cecelia's sour attitude. Cecelia gave out a rather audible growl at this. Who was she to be under-minded by such an uncouth girl! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll stick to my plan thank you very much!\" shouted Cecelia bringing about unwanted attention to herself.  She greatly wanted to embarrass the other girl by shouting out how much weight she had put on recently, but she needed to act with tact when Ichika was around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you agree with me on that matter Houki-pouki!\" At the utterance of her affectionate nickname, the girl shot up from her seat, with a rather crimson shade plastered on her cute face.  Cecelia on the other-hand, gasped in shock.  To say such a 'lovey-dovey' name in public no less! How could have she had let one of her rivals progress that much!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-Ichika! I told you not to call me that...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, are you sure its not fine? I mean its such a good nickname and all.\"   He looked towards Houki, noticing that she looked quite frazzled at the moment.  He then turned and saw Cecelia, flinching slightly at her apparent anger.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well, if you like it, then its fine I guess.\" she replied.  Though she did opt to turn her face away from him, still a bit disoriented from the exchange.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ichika! Are you sure saying such names in the area of the classroom to be appropriate! Such behavior might not be acceptable either.\" whined the other girl.  Ichika stared at her with a bit of confusion.  Why was calling Houki by her nickname such a big deal? Before he answered, Houki spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, if he likes it then its fine.\" she said once more, this time with more confidence in her voice.  Cecelia 'humphed' for what seemed like the hundredth this conversation.  Ichika was going to thank Houki once again for agreeing with him, when suddenly the teen was interrupted by a  small but noticeable noise.  Cecelia and Ichika both turned towards Houki, her face as ripe as a tomato. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I guess I was still a bit hungry after breakfast...\"  Two different thoughts went through the other two's minds at that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Haha, Houki-pouki's really cute when she's hungry.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What a fatass.' <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two made their way down one of the school halls, passing by the other girls and teachers walking down the same way.  The way that the school worked was that everyone had their own schedule with different 'free' periods included.  Coincidentally, Houki's schedule showed that she was free every time Ichika was.  What a coincidence indeed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Ichika, want to go eat at the dinning hall today for lunch?\" she asked.  Houki felt it would be faster than going back to his place and making him cook a meal for them, despite his enjoyment of it.  Plus she was pretty hungry now and waiting at his dorm would only cause her to snack more.  Cecelia's comments made her realize that she needed to cut back a  bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh the dining hall? Sure why not? I heard that they have a pretty good menu today.\" he said with his usual smile.  His new-found interest in cooking made him want to learn how others cook as well, learning their methods and such.  The teen hopes that one day he would be able to come up with his own style of cooking.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, a good menu?  But I should try to cut back a bit...\" With that, it was understandable that Ichika would stop right in his tracks, partly of disgust of the words he just heard, and the other part from concern from his childhood friend.  Trying not to become that angry, he gave a small sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did what Cecelia said get to you?\"  She flinched when he she saw his normally happy demeanor turn less than happy.  A stern look was looking back at her at she couldn't find the courage to look him in the eyes.  Of course her rival's words hurt to hear.  What girl doesn't find her weight to be a touchy subject?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...well yes it did.\" Was all that this girl said.  Ichika found this explanation to be extremely lacking.  Grabbing her shoulders with a firm grasp, the sudden movement cause her to look up at him.  He gave another sigh as he began to explain something to his close companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen Houki. If you're hungry, you are hungry. There's no getting passed that fact. And if you are hungry, then you are allowed to eat whatever you want.  Something like weight and figure aren't that important if you're suffering from malnutrition.\"  These words were starting to convince her, however a single thought on the extreme side of the spectrum called to her attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about if I get fat? That's certainly the other health concern to go with the want to eat whenever you're hungry.\" This of course caused him to think more about his own reasoning.  A sudden click in his mind and the answer came to him.  Looking down at Houki, his smile returned as bright as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as you're healthy, than something as trivial as weight has no importance when you think about it.\"  This obvious statement hit her hard, but one other thing still needed to be answered.  This exchange of their was coming to a close, and the outcome could easily change the way that they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you? As a guy wouldn't you automatically prefer a thinner girl compared to a heavier girl, personalities aside?\"  While designed to have a deep impact on the teen's philosophy, her reasoning had little impact on him; rather it confused him a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would a person's weight matter at all? If they're nice then I know that we'll connect no matter what.\"  What? What was he saying? It was common knowledge that all men go for the smaller women. Hell, an entire bulk of their society was built on that simple notion.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So would you say that you would date a heavier person? And were not talking simply chubby either! No, someone that's around 200 lbs! Would you honestly claim to date them? And what about the physical aspect of it? Would you really be fine that when you would hug her, all of her fat would surround you?\" said Houki, her rapid fire questioning slightly confusing her friend.   Ichika of course thought the answer was obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as I like them, I'll like them, regardless of that.  I will say that I don't really know much about the physical aspect of being with a larger person, but I do think that I wouldn't mind.  I find the basis of attraction to be in the person's personality, rather than their physical body.\" he answered honestly.  Houki was stunned by the way he answered each on of her queries.  To actually say the opposite of what she expected, was something that she'd never believe to occur.  One last question hovered in her mind; one that was perhaps the most important one to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about me? What if tomorrow I was suddenly much fatter than I am right now? How could you expect me to believe that nothing will be different between us?\" She dared not look at his face for fear of his answer.  Of course things would be different, there's no getting around that, but she wanted to hear what he thought. After a few short moments of consideration, he had his answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing. Nothing would be different. Houki is Houki and nothing is going to change that ever.\"  Another form of reasoning that cause Houki to become speechless.  She wanted to talk, to say anything right now, but for some reason, she could not.  Before her mind processed it, she pulled him in closer, wrapping her arms around his midsection.  Being the kind of person he is, Ichika wrapped his own arms around her.  Houki found her mind becoming clouded, the world slowly becoming smaller and smaller until it only included her and Ichika.  She enjoyed this warmth that spread through out her entire body; the feeling being quite intoxicating as she held him tighter.  It was a given that Ichika was a bit confused, but holding the girl in his arms was something that he enjoyed greatly, though he could not place his mind on why.  As he felt her grab him tighter, he gave off a small chuckle which grabbed her attention.  Looking up at him, she gave him a shy smile, a bit of a red shade adorned her cute face.  This simple look of hers, caused his mind to freeze for a second.  A sudden urge to built up inside him, but he knew he had to control himself.  They did not share that kind of relationship.  Slowly relasing his grip on the girl, she did the same as well.  A small smile was made between them as the two followed the hallway towards the spacious dining hall.  Opening the door to the room he gestured that Houki entered first.  Stepping inside, they both noticed that there was a sparse amount of students present; it was slightly early after all, and what was the point of having a break so early into the day?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Houki-pouki, what do you feel like eating?\" he asked, playfully using that nickname of hers.  In return, she playfully shoved him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well anything sounds good when you're hungry, but have a craving for some Chinese food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, Chinese eh? Don't tell me you're turning into Rin now are you?\"  This earned him another playful shove, albeit a bit of a more forceful one.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mou, now you're comparing me to your <i>second</i> childhood friend?  Isn't the first good enough for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha you know I was just kidding.  Of course I prefer you to Rin!\" said Ichika with a sincere tone.  The pair soon went to gather their meals and found a nice booth to sit in; both of them sitting a bit close to each other.  The lunch itself was somewhat uneventful.  No other rivals showing up, no interference from other students and his sister didn't even scold them for having such an early lunch.  Houki had an order of General Tso's Chicken, a traditional dish, while Ichika ate Sweet and Sour Chicken, to the slight annoyance of Houki.  That dish reminded her too much of the promise between Ichika and the other girl.  Comparatively quickly, Houki finished her meal while Ichika was only halfway done.  Though Houki still felt a bit more hungry.  A side effect of being Ichika's taste tester perhaps?  Seeing that she had finished her meal relatively quickly, Ichika asked her if she wanted to go for seconds.  Blushing a bit, she said yes and made her way back to cooking station to procure another dish of General Tso's chicken.  And so it went on like this for a good chunk of their free time, consisting of Houki going up for more food and for their small talk as well.  After her fourth helping, the girl could say that she was quite full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah that hit the spot~.\" she said as she gave her midsection a light pat for emphasis.  Ichika gave a slight chuckle in amusement.  While he didn't say it out loud, he found it funny when his dear friend acted out of character.  Looking towards his watch, he noticed that he only had a few minutes before the start of his next class.  Rising up from the seat, he gather his tray and headed over to the garbage can to dispose of his garbage.  He then headed back over to Houki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm heading to class now.  So you're gonna stop by my place later tonight for some taste testing right?\" the teen asked, feeling a bit worried if the girl would reject his offer.  A bright smile and a small nod was her response.  Also getting up, the girl went closer to him and gave him a small embrace.  Letting go, the two went their separate ways to their respective classes.  Both were looking forward to their time together later, though Houki realized that she will be competing with Cecelia in tonight's dinner. However the girl did have some tricks up her sleeves...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Houki walked towards her next class, math, she straightened up as she saw her idol and one of the most IS users in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChifuyu Orimura, her arms crossed as she leaned against the wall. The other students stayed clear of her, knowing of her status as the alpha of the school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh crap, is she still sore about me spending the night at Ichika's?' pondered Houki? She remembered the woman stopping by and the moment she laid eyes on her and Ichika she bolted out of there. Or maybe it was something else? Nah, it was her and Ichika. What else was she afraid of to make her act like that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe she won't notice me as long as I blend in amongst the crowd...yeah. Hopefully, then I can get my math done for the day and-'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shinonome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Damn.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHouki stopped, and she felt Chifuyu's eyes on her, akin to an inspecting hawk's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like to speak with you in private,\" said the older dark haired woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...What about?\" Houki asked innocently and nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and Ichika.\" Houki gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um okay...but I have class in ten minutes and-\" Chifuyu brought out a note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My signature. Tell the teacher I held you up and that I was responsible. Now come.\" Chifuyu marched down towards a classroom, Houki following, her shoulders slumped as if she got caught with her hand in the cookie jar...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe I'll ask Ichika to bake cookies for desert tonight...' Mused Houki to herself. She went inside, noticing it was empty. Chifuyu was standing, her back against the wall and arms still crossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shinonome. I've noticed you have been socializing with my brother a lot as of late.\" It wasn't a question. And her tone of voice only wanted replies and no beating around the bush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you like it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm...a lot?\" She asked shrugging her shoulders. Chifuyu nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know of Ichika's habits of watching soaps, anime, and cooking right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Infact I do like watching it with him. Supernatural High is one of my favorites.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what of that new one Momo Festival?\" Houki paled and gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well-uh, um you see-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't try to lie. I went into his dorm the day after you left recently. It was in the DVD player.\" Her narrow eyes barrowing down on the warrior girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like that one too...\" She whispered, but loud enough for Chifuyu to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get right to the point. What do you care for most, your status or Ichika?\" Asked the sister of Houki's crush. The brunette girl flinched in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My status or Ichika?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Shinonome when I was younger Ichika used to cook for me before I signed up for the IS,\" She rummaged in her pocket and pulled out a photo and gave it to Houki, who took it. The warrior girl gasped. It was a younger Ichika and Chifuyu(a smiling one at that) at the ages that she guessed of Ichika being 10 and Chifuyu being 19 but Chifuyu was heavier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot heavier. She had to guess that Chifuyu was at least packing 200 pounds. She had a soft tummy that bulged from her shirt, her breasts were still perky but bigger(although currently they are roughy the same size as before). Her thighs were soft and almost rubbed against one another in her skirt. Her face was also a tad softer as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was happy as she and Ichika ate some pasta, Ichika's face sort of a mess with marinara sauce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ichika was a cooking prodigy ever since he was 8, and were it not for him being capable of piloting an IS, would have gone to the best culinary schools in Japan if not abroad. I'll admit I loved his food like how I loved my brother. But the weight I was packing on had me worried, beause my IS performance was dropping was I gained more weight. My highest weight was 236 pounds, and I knew I needed to lose weight and focus on my IS capabilities as well as be able to enroll Ichika at the Academy in order to make sure that no other countries get ideas about him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHouki took all of this in. \"Wha-what are you getting at?\" in a way, Houki was a bit shocked! The idol and hands down one of the best IS pilots on the planet, used to be overweight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ichika loves to cook, and trust me,\" There was a look of hurt and longing in his eyes. \"I would love nothing more than to have a taste of his food again...But I need to protect him, I need to support him. I can't indulge on his food, no matter how addicting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are heading down a path I once treaded Shinonome. If you continue to socialize with Ichika...you will end up overweight, maybe even surpassing my old weight of 236. I've come to warn of this,\" Chifuyu started into the silent Houki's eyes. Houki remained silent but there was one thing Houki showed to her that made the older woman impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDetermination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're saying that...if I care for my figure and IS performance, I should break his heart? Like how you did,\" Houki said, with a little rise. She remembered Ichika's sulleness when he recalled Chifuyu avoiding him whenever he cooked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe maybe the best IS pilot in the world, the scariest teacher at the IC Academy, but she won't allow anyone to hurt Ichika. Not even his own sister, who looked a bit shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ichika has been hurting due to you neglecting his cooking! He loves to cook! He loves to share his food with those he loves! And he loves you a lot I know that for sure! And what do you do? Ignore him!\" Houki took a gulp, Chifuyu flinched and looked actually vunerable with Houki's outburst, but the warrior girl isn't done. She chose her next words carefully..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kendo? IS? Status? Who gives a damn! If it means me that I must neglect Ichika in order to preserve that,\" She took a step forward, and in tandem, Chifuyu took a step back. \"Then I'll glady put on some weight! I don't mind if I one day reach 250 pounds! Or even 300! If it means...\" She quited down, wrapping her arms around herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it means me staying with Ichika and making him happy, then I'll be happy too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an uneasy silence in the empty classroom, both girls silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Great, I'm gonna get ripped into...' Gripped Houki mentally. She really spoke without thinking. And Chifuyu...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The wise and older women in front of her held a rather proud smirk.  Admittedly, she would have never expected this girl to stand up to her sheer presence, but Houki didn't even flinch.  Taking a look at the picture in her hand, it reminded her greatly of a simpler time; one where her and Ichika were just happy with being with each other, despite the deaths of their parents.  However, she gave all of that up, her familiarity exchanged for great power.  Chifuyu looked back at Houki, her eyes still shining with a brilliant determination despite her slightly trembling body.  Houki knew all the risks that came with being with her younger brother and yet her ambition was quite clear.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see that nothing I say is going to deter you from this correct?\"  The woman stared at her with her intense brown eyes, which was her usual form of intimidation.  Of course only a select few could stand up to such a fierce gaze; Ichika himself could easily withstand her, though it might be either his happy go lucky nature or his dense personalty.  Some would say that the boy was denser than a black hole!  Houki was using all of her energy to withstand her body's natural reaction to hide in the face of such danger, and managed to squeak out a few words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No. No No No!  I want to be with Ichika no matter what. I want to make him as happy as he makes me...\" she trailed off, her gaze falling towards the floor.  Maybe she was being somewhat unreasonable.  She didn't even know for sure that Ichika felt that way about her.  But no matter how much her mind reasoned, her heart would not falter.  Perhaps this was love?  Chifuyu sported another smirk.  For this girl to stand up to her twice was nothing to scoff at.  However this girl needed to understand a few more things.  Reaching out for Houki's midsection, Chifuyu squeezed a small amount of belly fat.  Houki understandably began to blush at such an indecent action, was her mentor into such things?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe she wants me to herself?' thought the girl, her mind clearly becoming fuzzy.  Chifuyu began to play around with her plush belly, showing how soft it had become.  Shaking it side to side, Houki herself witness how jiggly her midsection was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see this? This is only going to get bigger and become even more of an inconvenience.  When gaining the gut will usually grow the fastest when you stuff it to no end.  Sure you can hide it now, but what happens when it gets so big that you can't even see your overgrown lower half?  And forget going to the beach or wearing a snug shirt, all of that attention will be brought upon you! Could you say with a straight face that you would be able to handle all of that!?\"  This assault was difficult for the poor girl to process.  She did know the risks that being that large brought, and she also knew the social stigma it was as well.  Though since the advent of the IS systems, women weren't as criticized for their weight that much really.  Taking in a deep breath, her eyes re-lit to show her burning will.  Moving her hand towards the one that was grasping onto her tummy, she grabbed onto it and removed its from its hold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter...If I'm with him I would never regret anything.\"  Well this was it, Chifuyu had no more ammo left to convince this girl to separate from her darling brother.  Taking her hand again, the older woman placed it on top of Houki's head and gently rubbed it.  While she would never admit it, her hair was quite soft.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright I have nothing left.  I'll say one last thing though. I accept you.  Now you better make Ichika the happiest man in Japan or you'll be hearing from me.\" said the instructor as she left the empty classroom, leaving Houki by her lonesome.  A lot of things had just happened in their exchange but the girl's resolve was sound.  And she even received blessings from his sister! This meant that she needed to speed things up a bit between herself and Ichika.  Exiting the room as well, she went towards her room as she needed to prepare for tonight's dinner. Opening the wooden door, she stepped inside to find everything in proper order.  Heading over to her dresser, Houki picked out some suitable clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Remember, cute and sleepy is the way to go.  But I can't just go in my pj's either.'  thought the girl to herself.  Eventually she settled for a red long sleeved shirt and some black sweatpants.  The shirt was roomy enough that her belly wasn't as noticeable, however, her sweats seemed to be a bit tight around her hips.  She ignored that and went up to her desk and sat down in the comfy chair. This girl wanted to get some reading in before she went over to Ichika's,  Opening up one of her many textbooks, she began to read.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'A little snack wouldn't spoil my appetite would it?' </span></div></div>",

She passed somne girls, a scant few giving her looks over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Let them look</i>,' Thought the warrior girl to herself. '<i>There'll be more of me than they would have expected.</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally arrived at the vending machine, popping her coins in for a rice crispy and punching in the select buttons. The treat fell down the tray and she bent over to retrieve her treat. The warrior girl did so and began to snack by the machine, realizing she had more coins than expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe another wouldn't hurt...' Thought Houki. She placed more coins into the machine and she already finishes scarfing down the treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter five minutes of snacking and penniless on coins, Houki ate a total of 5 rice crispies and 3 medium sized cookies as she went back into her room, feeling content for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>That may have been a tiny bit overboard but those were small in portion anyway. I better ask the student council to see if they can get more bigger machines, and maybe decrease the prices too,</i>' thought the girl to herself as she smacked her lips and plopped down onto her bed on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stared at the ceiling, thinking of how to outwit Cecilia, her hand went to her slightly soft tummy, and began to knead it. Houki felt a small grin to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Maybe this won't be so bad...I mean, what's wroung with being soft...</i>' She placed another hand on her breast, noticing that it has gotten bigger. \"And cushy too.\" She giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her head to the clock and saw that she had plenty of time before the get together at Ichika's room.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The girl awoke with a small yawn, her eyes slowly fluttering open and adjusting to the natural brightness of the room.  Raising her arms skyward, Houki gave out a mighty stretch.  However, a wave of panic hit the girl, she forgot to set an alarm to wake her up from her nap!  Quickly jumping up from her chair, she ran towards the bathroom to make sure that she was presentable.  Looking at the wide mirror, Houki noticed that she had some drool marks near the corner of her mouth.  Embarrassed, she immediately wiped her face with a cloth that was on the counter.  Also seeing that her hair was slightly messy, she began to slowly comb it; after all, a girl mustn't look slobby in front of the one she was enamored with.  Truth be told, it was her long hair that she took great pride it.  After she was done with care-taking her long locks, Houki ran back into the other room and looked at the clock that sat on her desk.  It read 7:30 PM. Giving off a sigh of relief, Houki sat back down into her chair.  The girl still had about half an hour until the dinner with Ichika and her rival Cecelia.  Left alone with the thoughts of all the soap operas that she had seen together, the warrior girl hatched an idea.  What if she decided to head over to Ichika's early and help him prepare dinner? Yes this plan would work out incredibly well!  Rising to her feet, Houki ran out the door, making sure to lock her door of course and went in the direction of Ichika's room.  A few minutes of walking/slow jogging, the girl had finally reached his door.  In the heat of the moment, Houki failed to realize that Ichika could be busy at the moment and that it would be quite rude of her to disrupt him.  Feeling all of her nerve disappear into nothingness, this girl began make her way back to her room when she saw a group of girls around the corner, watching her.  Finding this a bit weird, she realized that maybe these other girls wanted to impede on Ichika's alone time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The nerve of those gaggle of fools!' angrily thought Houki as she sent a deathly like glare towards the group of female pilots. In a flash the girls grew scared and promptly ran away.  Sighing, she decided that it would be better for herself to knock instead of those other girls.  Raising her hand to the door, her arm trembling during the entire motion, she banged on it, three knocks to be precise.  Hearing some sounds emanating from inside, she figured that he was indeed busy with something and her heart sank a bit; partly for disappointment in herself.  A second after her self loathing, Ichika opened the door and was quite shocked to see his close friend outside the doorway.  Feeling himself flustered at how cute she looked, it left himself speechless for a few seconds.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Houki?\" By his apparent surprise, Houki assumed that he was expecting someone else.  With a 'humph' she turned from Ichika, feeling her anger building up once again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, who were you expecting? Cecelia?  Too bad, it's me Houki!\" she shouted, her back still facing her crush.  Suddenly Ichika wrapped his arms around the girl, resting them on her doughy midsection.  It did not take long for the girl to register his affection; she felt herself begin to overheat and her mind went fuzzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I-Ichika!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry.  I was just a bit flustered since you looked adorable.\" he said.  While he felt as if he should release the hold he had on her, Ichika continued their embrace.  As Houki was gathering the courage to place her hands on his arms, a lone girl appeared from the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get a room!\" she screamed in an obvious joking manner.  However Houki did not find this amusing at all.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will kill you in your sleep!!!\" she yelled out, scaring another student in the hall.  Ichika had to restrain her further from doing something she would have regretted. He then decided to pull her into his room and lock his door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Houki, calm down.  It was just a joke, so please don't let it get to you.\" he said as he released the embrace.  At this time, Houki's face was a deep shade of red, quite flustered after letting Ichika see her like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I'm sorry. I mean I just wanted to see you and then I lost my temper like that...\" stated the girl as she hanged her head in shame.  Ichika, feeling like this was perhaps a bit too much, placed his hand on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Houki, c'mon. It's fine, trust me its okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ichika...\" Looking up with a shy smile, she was glad that he was wasn't upset at her actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, anyways, feel free to plop in a dvd and some snacks if you'd like. Dinner should be ready in around half an hour. I bet you'll love it.\" claimed Ichika, moving over to the kitchen area where he had his pots and pans cooking the food for tonight's meal.  Following his courtesy, Houki headed over to his pantry and pulled out a pack of cookies.  Placing a bulk of them onto her plate, she went back to his living room and put in Momo Festival into the DVD player and relaxed back into her seat.  Enjoying the sweet taste of the treats, she was quite content.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ichika treats me so well~'</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>And so Houki continued to snack on these chocolate chip cookies while she watched on of her favorite series Momo Festival.  In the current episode, Momo was suffering from a bit of insomnia due to some weird dreams she had been afflicted with as of late.  This lead to some built up stress for the chubby girl and in turn led to Momo overeating in her club and at home.  Another effect of her insomnia was that she would overcook and the remaining food would either be brought home, in which case her mother would eat them heartily or for her two best friends to enjoy.  Without a surprise, this fact allowed for many of the proximate females that she knew to put on a decent amount of weight.  Houki found this process absolutely fascinating, how a person could cause such fluctuations in others weights in a simple manner.  Before the warrior girl knew it, the cookies that sat on the plate were all consumed, sitting nicely in her round belly.  However, this was but a mere snack for the girl as she still felt quite peckish.  Rising up and brushing the crumbs off of her soft clothing, Houki went over to Ichika's sink and placed the dirty dish in it.  Being the curious girl that she was, this IS pilot went over to Ichika to peak at what he was preparing for dinner.  Houki could see that he was preparing meat and had some broth in a pot over the electric stove that the school had so generously donated to him.  From the corner of his eye, noticing that his friend was close, Ichika turned around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Curious eh Houki?\" he joked with his ever present smile.  Houki nodded yes as she smelled the delicious aroma that the ingredients were creating.  A small thought clicked in Ichika's mind, he reached for the ladle in the pot and carefully measure a spoonful.  Blowing air on it in order to cool down the viscous liquid he brought the ladle near Houki's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here have a little taste.\" With a shy smile Houki opened her mouth and Ichika carefully dropped the broth in it.  The flavor was very rich and savory; one that Houki had the pleasure to taste.  She gave off a giggle which signaled to her friend that his soup was at least tasteful.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, it's very good Ichika. If I enjoyed the preview, then I can't wait for the main attraction!\" said Houki, trying to hold back some laughter from the corny line that she had used. Before Ichika could reply, a sharp knocking was heard at the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Houki-pouki, do you mind getting that?\" asked Ichika.  Of course he didn't want to leave the area in case an accident occurred and the girl obliged; she puffed out her cheeks in a pseudo-pout at the nickname but she complied with his request.  Walking towards the door, she unlocked the locked and slowly opened it.  Not to her surprise it was the British representative that was on the other side of the doorway.  The one thing that did surprise Houki was the way that the blonde headed girl was dressed.  Instead of her proper uniform or something a bit more formal, Cecelia wore a simple blue flannel shirt and sweat-pants quite similar to Houki's.  The other girl gave Houki a small smile, nothing was suspicious about it at all, which of course made Houki all the more suspicious.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Houki, how are you on this fine night?\" One other thing that the Japanese female noticed was that the blonde's golden hair was freely flowing down her back, the classic curls missing from each tip of the strands.  Even her trademark blue headband was nowhere to be seen.  Though even Houki had to admit that Cecelia looked quite beautiful even when dressed down to such an extent.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh I'm fine. I'm a bit drowsy from the nap I took earlier.\" answered Houki.  Cecelia stepped inside the room, also enjoying the rich scent in the air.  As Ichika was cooking up British recipes, she was reminded of the cooking back in her home country.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I see that you've gotten a bit of a head start.  That's very smart of you.\" To say that the other girl was somewhat shocked at the comment would be an understatement of sorts.  Why was Cecelia acting so complacent in comparison to her usual haughty behavior?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing like that.  I just wanted to see Ichika that's all. That is enough for me...\" trailed the girl, losing confidence in her voice.  Like countless girls her age, romance was something that was difficult for her and she was confused about the current state of her and Ichika's relation at the moment.  It was Cecelia's turn to act surprised as she had never seen the normally rigid girl act so demure.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, that seems to be the correct answer here.\" was all that the other girl said.  She began to walk over to Ichika to see him prepare the meal.  Houki motioned over to the couch in order to resume her soap opera.  Not long after Cecelia sat down next to the girl, and began to watch the show as well.  It was quiet between the two girls; the reason being is that they've never actually spent more than a few minutes talking to each other.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a cute show.  I just love how the main character loves food and is actually chubby for a change.\" said Cecelia, eying Houki's pudgy middle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? I thought you disliked those with extra flab.\" responded Houki in a tone that was less than benevolent.  Cecelia flashed a coy smile at this.  Maybe things were beginning to pick up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've learned something very interesting today my dear Houki.  During a walk towards the dining hall, I saw two people in a very close embrace.  Before that I managed to overhear a few key details.\"  Houki's eyes widened at this revelation, she had failed to notice anyone of importance during the earlier exchange.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you've figured out my resolve then correct? I will not lose to you in this field of conflict.\" Of course despite her less than refined figure, Houki certainly still had her warrior's pride.  That is a concept that never fades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like you've failed to notice a key component to all of this. In fact it is a pity that your so close to Ichika and yet still remain in the shadow of his basking light.  One who cannot even understand his ideals cannot stand on equal footing.\" The other girl was easily befuddled by Cecelia's cryptic words.  What in the world did she mean by ideals?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To put it simply, in a battle of weight I will always be the victor considering the vast amount of resources that I posses.  I am quite wealthy after all and if I ever needed to increase my girth, it could be done quite easily.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't only about weight though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.  That was my previous point.  Now you need to figure out the rest.\"  Before Houki could question on exactly what Cecelia meant, Ichika walked over, the apron still tied around himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey girls, dinner's ready!  Since there's three of us this time, I figured it would be easier to eat on the dinning table.\" said Ichika, walking back over to his table, setting up the silverware, plates and glasses.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like this will have to continue at a later date.\" Cecelia stood up and Houki followed her.  Both of them where quite impressed at the spread that awaited them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As per British tradition, I've made beef wellington and asparagus soup with egg in it.  Hope you guys safe room for desert as well since i cooked up something special.\"  The time for conjecture was over as the two females had drooling mouths and stomachs to be filled.    </span></div></div>",

Apparently she wanted to show to Ichika she can eat as much as Houki, but able to express a polite manner and table-side etiquette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHouki was a bit of the opposite at first, scarfing down as much as she could, but she could see how Ichika was being lean slightly towards Cecilia due to her manners, and Houki slowed down. The soup was all drained, it being the appetizer. Ichika was content with one bowl, while Cecilia ate down four. Houki slurped down 6 and a half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beef wellington was on a huge pan and was brought to the table, the steak-pastries numbering up to 15 and each the size of two fists in circumference and three inches in height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchika had resorted to one of of the meat-pastries and there the real battle began between the Warrior girl and noble girl. And the race between rabbits became like one between tortoises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecilia with her small stomach was only able to consume five Wellingtons, and while relishing the flavor, had her left hand on her protruding stomach, trying to soothe the pain of her extended gut. She did set her fork down and wiped her mouth with her napkin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHouki was feeling confident, finishing her sixth and moving onto her her seventh. But she had to admit, the combination of meat and bread was filling her up fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd during the dinner, there was another knock at the door, causing both of the girls, who were feeling a bit lethargic, to whip their heads around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Who could that be!</i>' both of them thought at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey it's here!\" Beamed Ichika as he stood up and went towards the door. Cecilia craned her head back to see what the teen was getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Whispered Houki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's opening it now...\" The girls could hear him talking, saying a thank you, and the door closing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got cobbler!\" Beamed Ichika as he held out the ingredients for what seems to be cobbler crust. \"You girls can watch one of my shows while I batch this up. You might get hungry again!\" Ichika then took the remaining three Wellingtons and put on his apron and began to search for his ingredients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ichika, do you mind if\" Cecilia tried to rise from her seat but plopped down onto her chair, her food not finishing digesting. Houki stood up with little trouble, as she was used to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll pop in some Super-High.\" She took a Wellington by hand a began munching on it, Cecilia's eyes raising as she watched her friend, already with an easily noticable and taught belly, continuing to pack in carbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then. Be sure to put the volume up for me to hear though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Houki then walked over near the DVD case and began searching, and Cecilia finally got the strength to stand up and slowly walk over to the couch and fell down with a plop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I can eat any more,\" muttered Cecilia. She clearly underestimated Ichika's cooking, both in quality and in quantity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHouki turned around, looked back at her and said</span></div></div>",

I however have the room for anything else that Ichika wishes to feed me.\" A quick glance was all that the girl needed to verify that her rival was stuffed to the brim. While Cecelia had indeed indulged to Ichika's wares, it had never been that frequent or in large quantities.  He hand moving towards her middle, it was taut and the pressure gave her a noticeable amount of discomfort.  Watching the other girl, she placed the appropriate DVD in the player and quickly sat back down on the soft couch. Both of them began to watch, a rather charming program, though Cecelia felt that plot was rather weak.  Time to time she would glance over to the other girl sitting next to her; noticing two rather interesting things. Firstly, Houki's eyes had a fierce shine to them. showing that she was quite ready for desert.  Second, the brunette had he belly exposed, her shirt was placed a few inches above her midsection and a her hand was on the fleshy mass, rubbing it tenderly. Perhaps this would be a good time to try to convince Houki that her mindset wasn't particularly healthy for her.  Cecelia reached out, grabbing the exposed flesh of Houki's tummy and giving it a squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-what are you doing?\" said Houki in a hushed tone as to not alert Ichika of any problems.  Cecelia held her grip on the belly, staring right into Houki's eyes, her own deep blue irises 'pleading' with the girl to hear her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still don't fully understand what I was trying to tell you earlier. You see this fat belly right? Do you know what caused you to gain weight like this.\" From her words, Houki gave a small smear, blowing some random strands of hair away from her face.  So what if she gained weight? If it was for Ichika, she'd eat anything and would not care about any of the possible consequences, something that she had decided long ago.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously the food Ichika made allowed for this to happen. I mean its only natural of you think of it like that.\" This earned her a sharp squeeze from the British pilot sitting aside from her. Having enough of the other girl's action, Houki forcibly removed the other girl's hand and in turn, reached out and grabbed Cecelia's full belly.  Wincing from the pain, Cecelia needed to endure this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That isn't what I meant. Obviously eating too much food will have an adverse effect on the body, I was looking for a more spiritual answer. If you continue on like this, not only will you end up losing Ichika, but you will be a whale too.\" The simple words that told her that she would inadvertently lose her precious crush cause her to feel something within her. A horrible empty feeling sprung forth and soon overwhelmed the poor girl. Her hold on the girl falling quite limp, it returned to her side, Cecelia watched as her eyes grew a dull haze to them.  The blonde felt terrible telling her the worst case scenario, but it was for the best. However, she did not expect a reaction like this from a simple idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lose Ichika? No, I that can't...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else would you expect if you cannot understand him? While we are rivals I cannot let this happen so easily. Someone as prominent as myself deserves the proper competition in order feel the full effects of 'winning.'\" A silence fell between them, the TV show left unwatched.  Neither could hear anything at the moment, they were too focused on separate issues.  As if on purpose, Ichika walked on to the scene; he failed to sense the tense air generated by the pair of girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys, the cobbler's in the oven so I hope you two don't mind waiting a bit.\" The girls suddenly noticed his presence, the mentioning of food caused Houki's belly to grumble with hunger.  Her face however, failed to match the enthusiasm her stomach possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Houki?\" It was quite easy to realize that something was bothering his friend and like any normal human, he grew worried in the span of a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Ichika. She's just a bit tired from dinner.  I don't blame her though, you did feed us a lot. My I'm beginning to think that you want to see us fatter.\" Cecelia said with a stereotypical 'oujou' laugh.  Giving out his own laugh, he sat in between them as Cecelia had given him some room.  Though he didn't noticed, he was sitting quite close to the British girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hm, perhaps I could break through to her with this...'</span></div></div>",

Anger at herself for letting Ichika do such an intimate thing to the blonde, anger at Ichika for obeying the blonde, and anger at Cecelia for such asking such a request.

It also promotes terrible sportsmanship, how do you expect me to compete if you perform actions that so vile?\" as she continued her rant, Houki continued to back up until she was sitting at the opposite end of the couch and Ceclia was right up in her face, her face slightly reddened due to the anger she felt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Look, calm down, or do you want Ichika to see us fighting?\" Realizing what she was doing, the blonde gave a small growl and moved away from Houki to give her some space. As she hated to admit it, the girl was right. If Ichika saw them fighting, then it would only make him upset. Taking a deep breath, she collected her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let me explain so someone like you can understand. A girl giving a boy a back-massage means one thing. It means that the girl is acting in such a way that she is 'giving herself' in order to support the male. Not to mention that massages usually lead to...\" whispering the last part of her explanation, Houki's face exploded into a blush and countless thoughts entered her mind.  She had never intended it to mean that! She just wanted to get Ichika to pay more attention to her. Walking back over to the two girls, Ichika had managed to balance three plates of peach cobbler, something he hoped that the girl's would enjoy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you guys are still hungry.\" said Ichika with a laugh in his voice. Carefully setting down the three small plates on the coffee table, he sat between the two girls, oblivious to the awkward silence that was surrounding the pair. Houki and Cecelia both grabbed their plates and nibbled on the dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's good...' both of them thought. </span></div></div>",

He had a terrible sense of fashion, his outside of school attire usually consisting of a shirt with a hoodie and some comfy jeans. He'd be a terrible consultant for what clothes would look good on the girl! Though he would admit that Houki would look nice in nearly any attire, she was simply 'that' kind of girl, thought Ichika, oblivious to his own attraction to the girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Houki, wouldn't it be a better idea for getting one of your friends to go along with you? I don't think I'd be able to help that much.\" said Ichika as he let Houki into his apartment, the girl walking right over to the couch and wrapping herself with the blanket on the couch. It smelled so much like Ichika that the girl couldn't help herself. Sitting down next to her, he was thinking of what he could make for the girl later on. Perhaps some sirloin steak would be up to her tastes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You need to come with me Ichika, I'd feel better if I had a close friend with me when were outside the school.\" said the girl, afraid of revealing that outside of her rivals and Ichika, she had no friends whatsoever. Sinking her head into the covers, she looked quite cute, which caused Ichika to blush slightly, confusing himself. Seeing that the girl was resolved in having the boy accompany her, he finally agreed to go with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but let's go tomorrow morning. You want to have enough time to do your shopping right?\" he said. Ferries back to mainland Japan occurred a few times per day and all students who did not live near the port had a curfew. And he certainly did not want to see the 'bad' side of his dear sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, b-but I'm also staying over. I want to make sure you won't ditch me for another girl or something!\" shouted Houki, still wrapped under the covers. Letting out a sigh, he gently patted the girl on her fluffy head, easing the girl and causing her to blush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Houki-Pouki, I'd never ditch you for someone else.

As Houki's shirt was rather tight, it failed to cover the curvature of her belly and her panties were left in plain sight, a nice black color. Ichika did his best not to look and stared at his plate, Houki now engrossed in the delicious food in front of her. Per usual, it was quite amazing and the chubby girl could not help herself. Finishing a third of her meal, Houki began to stuff herself with breadsticks, crumbs adorning her rounded face and her shirt.  Watching the girl consume the food was a sight to behold and Ichika found himself staring, unable to look away. Lately, he had been paying attention to the girl, her new found curves, her smile after finishing a nice meal and how soft she was whenever she hugged him. Feeling these thoughts flooding his mind, Ichika abruptly stood up, causing his friend to fall out of her food induced trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ichika?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah sorry, I'm just going to go to the bathroom. Be right back.\" In a flash, the teen left Houki alone, slighty confused, but she simply went back to her savory meal. In the bathroom, Ichika splashed water on his face, trying to cool himself down. Seeing Houki like that, he was quite afraid that he might do something he would regret later on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, she's just a childhood friend. She wouldn't have any interest in someone like me.\" said Ichika to himself. The reason that Ichika had seemingly ignored all of Houki's advances in the past was that he had convinced himself that she would never like someone as plain as he was. Ichika admired Houki greatly and simply could not see her feelings towards him. With Houki, she was nearly finished with her first plate. Instead of cleaning her plate, she wanted Ichika to return so they could eat together. Leaning back, she placed both hands on her soft middle, feeling a softness that she had become accustomed to. Looking down at her fattened form, she wondered if it would be alright to stay dressed like this. Of course at first it was highly embarrassing, but she enjoyed finally being noticed by Ichika. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe I should present myself like this more often.' </span></div></div>",

Heading over to the couch, her chubby stomach full and her panties in clear sight. Ichika did his best to not look at her bubble butt, however, he was not a man without worldly desires. The only thing that kept him sane was the mantra 'She is my childhood friend and nothing more.' Clearing the table, he brought all of the dishes to the kitchen and began to wash them. Ichika always enjoyed tasks like this, it helped him reflect on certain things and right now, it could help him from thinking about the cute girl. Houki took her place by wrapping herself up in the blankets, making sure to not put her pj pants back on, she did have a plan after all.  Finally finishing up with the dishes, Ichika went to his fridge and got out a heaping helping of some cookies and cream ice cream for Houki to enjoy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, figured you might want something sweet.\" said Ichika, bringing the bowl to her, spoon, whipped cream and all. With a bright smile, Houki gladly accepted the treat and aimed a spoonful right towards her hungry mouth. Ichika sat himself down, on the far side of the couch just to be safe. He saw that Houki was watching one of the climax episodes of Momo Festival. Watching, the teen tried is best to drown out his thoughts of being more 'touchy feely' with the girl, the thoughts thrashing around in his head. Houki would look at him from time to time, her face flushed, as she tried to gather the courage to go through with her plan. Finished with her ice cream, she placed the bowl on the floor and made sure to wipe away any residue on her face from the napkins that Ichika had sent her.  Getting her nerve together, Houki began to scoot over inch by inch, careful to not notify her crush. Eventually, they were only a few inches away from each other, and Houki cast of the blankets she was wrapped up in, revealing her tight shirt, her colored and strained panties, and her thick pale legs. The act of casting off the blankets, caused Ichika to notice her right next to him, a red hue appearing on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Houki, you're a bit close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a problem?\" said the girl, moving in even closer.  At this distance, their arms were touching and Ichika could not escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't want to cause you any trouble or anything,\" Trying to get up, Houki grabbed his arm and pulled him back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If its you, then its fine...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But something like this, we're childhood friends after all, it's just not proper.\" Feeling the anger getting the better of her, she pushed the young man backwards and got on top of him. By instinct, he ended up wrapping his arms around her fleshy middle, feeling just how soft the girl had gotten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, something like this is just fine.\" whispered Houki as she closed the gap between their faces. Just a few centimeters away, and Ichika was the one to close the gap, capturing the girls lips in a kiss. </span></div></div>",

She rose from her bed without any kind of ungainly complaint or clumsiness, preparing her flawless appearance with the utmost care and grace. Her drill-like hair perfectly curled, her makeup applied neatly, and dressed in her modest uniform. Prepared for another day at IS Academy, where she would be once again learning to fly the mechanised combat units known as Infinite Stratos, she sat at her table to enjoy a relaxed breakfast. This classy, beautiful, and strong lady was known to all her colleagues as a reliable class representative, as well as the representative candidate of the United Kingdom, Miss Cecilia Alcott. Having her very own personal IS, Blue Tears, as well as being descended from a noble family, made her something of a celebrity. There was just one, tiny, little thing that took away from this image. Or rather, something big. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was awfully fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hardly a recent occurrence, or indeed a secret. Raised as a pampered Lady, she was not exactly forced to do physical work, nor denied yummy, sweet treats. Her breakfast consisted of many jam slathered, buttery scones. As much as they respected her, classmates couldn\u2019t help but comment on her girth. It wasn\u2019t to the extent that it impeded her ability to pilot IS units, but it certainly impeded her ability to wear anything below a size large skirt. Even today, as she strolled towards her class with a smile on her lips, she noticed girls pointing and whispering at her swaying hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, hasn\u2019t Alcott gotten /even/ wider?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-It\u2019s not polite to say it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you were thinking it, riiiiight? Like, I don\u2019t know how she has the courage to hang around /him/ looking like that\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the protests of these commoners, Cecilia calmly sat down in her designated seat. Certainly, the way her plump posterior pressed against her chair lent evidence to those girls\u2019 claims. She couldn\u2019t remember the chairs in class being this comfy before! As she wiggled her feminine hips and settled down, she was suddenly disturbed by her tummy pressing against the desk. It was gurgling contentedly after its lovely morning meal, as usual, but being squished against her metal desk for hours on end wasn\u2019t something this well indulged girl appreciated. Cecilia folded her arms over her sizable, fat chest, and twirled her spiraling hair, before letting out a discontented sigh. No, this would not do. As she shuffled her hefty mass around, trying to fit her girth into some kind of comfortable position where it would fit, /he/ walked in. The most beautiful, and only, male student of IS academy. The man who Cecilia hoped to ensnare as she put so much effort into her appearance every morning. The stunning, raven black-haired Orimura Ichika, and he was looking right at the struggling Cecilia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYo, Cecilia.

She continued to struggle for a bit to find a 'sweet spot' where her body won't be so constricted. The young man gave her another smile as he took a seat right next to her. Ichika would often have these small chats with her, cementing her fledgling feelings for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, that homework last night was pretty rough.

As IS Academy was one of the most prestigious schools in the world, it was no surprise that they would offer world class food in a buffet style. So as Cecilia tried to literally eat her feelings, she did so by loading up plate after plate of any type of cuisine she could get her hands on. After finishing up a marbled steak drowned in mashed potatoes and gravy, she went onto her desert consisting of a good number of cheesecake slices drowned in whipped cream and strawberries. Busy with stuffing her face with the sweet dish, she failed to hear the whispers and murmurs of the other girls in the room. Most were unkind words, though there were a few caring thoughts thrown in there as Cecilia looked to be in a position to hurt herself with her eating. By now, she had long been able to ignore such words from the other girls. The only words that she cared for came straight from Ichika's and he never judged her for her habits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Quite a delicious lunch as usual. I only hope dinner will be as good!' she thought to herself, having finished the creamy sweet desert. Leaning back into her chair, she began to rub her stuffed gut, feeling rigid instead of its normal soft state. The rich girl felt quite drowsy after such a meal, feeling the crave to take a nice nap overtaking her. Before she could decide to go into a slumber, someone had approached her. </span></div></div>",

For he was chatting amiably to none other than the similarly dressed Shinonono Houki, his busty childhood friend with a long dark ponytail and a near constant frown on her cute face. She was aware that they often exercised together, but that didn\u2019t make their close contact today any less vexing. Ichika was around other girls far too often.

How was that training session for you?\u201d Houki was the first to speak up, glancing at Cecilia with pride in her eyes, trying to push the exercise-shy girl out of the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMm? Err, pretty good I guess\u2026 I\u2019m certainly hungry after all that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, me too\u2026 \u201c She glanced at Cecilia\u2019s many empty plates.\" We both appreciate our personal fitness don\u2019t we, Ichika? Keeping our bodies well maintained?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. I mean, I want to become a strong IS pilot. Fitness is important, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHouki took this chance to turn to Cecilia and puff out her already large chest with pride, her angular mouth forming a rare and smug smile. Cecilia was appalled! Did this mean Ichika only liked women who were exercise maniacs\u2026? Stick thin, eating leaves and running laps every morning before class?! She couldn\u2019t let Houki continue to have so much time alone with him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-Aha, yes\u2026  I Say, I-Ichika-san\u2026\u201d she swallowed nervously, a little red. \u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to increase my fitness too\u2026 I don\u2019t suppose you could help me, could you? Like you do with Shinonono-san?\u201d<br>\r\nHe looked a little surprised, always poor at hiding his emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay! Houki won\u2019t mind. But are you su-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIchika! You idiot! Go train with your precious Cecilia for all I care!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ponytailed girl stood up and slapped Ichika on the back of the head, before taking her tray to the other side of the cafeteria in a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOwch\u2026 Why\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIchika-san, thank you so much! Wh-When can we begin!?\u201d Cecilia\u2019s eyes sparkled with joy as she leaned over the table, her tummy hanging down, gurgling in protest to the idea of exercise.<br>\r\nIchika looked at her for a moment, whilst he rubbed his throbbing head. He never thought he\u2019d see Cecilia of all people so eager to work out\u2026<br>\r\nHe answered;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

WIth a nod, Cecilia agreed, incredibly happy that she could finally rid herself of this flab and become the girl that Ichika deserved. Later that night, the blonde haired girl laid in bed, a hand softly massaging her belly. Things were looking up but she had to wonder about something. Would Houki pose to be a problem? The way that she hurt Ichika and simply went away worried the plump Cecilia a bit. As these thoughts swirled around in her head, a low guttural sound could be heard from her midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well I suppose a midnight snack couldn't hurt.' she thought, clearly hungering for some nice sweets.<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day went by swiftly as class and lunch went by as easily as a breeze. Now it was a few hours before she was to meet Ichika and she was starting to become a bit nervous. She was in her room, dressed in a blue t shirt and grey sweats, both articles of clothing that happened to show off her flabby figure very well. She had chosen this instead of her traditional IS battle wear due to the fact that when she wore it, her gut hanged free for all of the world to see and her plush rear was made to look that much bigger as each cheek jiggled with each of her steps. Tugging the blue shirt down, it was starting to ride up, causing her cute pale belly to show itself. Even with these less than revealing clothes, she was starting to become more and more nervous of her current figure. Before she could start eating out of nervousness. a knock was heard at her door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Cecilia, it's me Ichika. Are you there?\" asked a voice from behind the door. Swallowing down her fears, she made her way to the door and slowly unlocked and opened it, revealing Ichika to herself. It seemed that Ichika had decided to wear his IS ware as he was dressed in a skin tight shirt that revealed his toned midsection and matching shorts that accented his strong legs. Cecilia fidgeted where she stood, become more and more self conscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hi there Ichika.\" she said, her voice barely being able to squeak out a response. He gave her his usual grin, a smile that always caused her heart to flutter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was able to finish all of my errands a bit early. Would you like to head to the gym now?\" With a shy nod, she began to gather important things such as a towel and some water bottles and followed Ichika towards the exercise center.  Eventually they reached a part of the school that was highly unfamiliar to the girl, a sign that perhaps she really should start to work out more. Arriving at the gym, she took a quick look around, seeing a multitude of work out machines, girls doing some workouts and the staff that was required to watch over them. She felt a strange feeling in the back of her throat, perhaps she was more nervous than she thought?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so are you ready to start\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ichika steered Cecilia in the direction of a more secluded corner of the gym, away from prying eyes, of which the tubby teen could not have been more grateful. They put down their towels and bottles, and stood to face each other. Cecila\u2019s heart was already beating fast behind her chest, rising and falling as she took deep breaths; how would the poor girl cope when the actual exercise began?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Cecilia. First, we need to stretch, so you don\u2019t hurt yourself!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Ichika-san! I\u2019ll follow your lead!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, it felt like Ichika was always thinking about her wellbeing. As Cecilia followed Ichika\u2019s lead and stretched out her pudgy arms, she couldn\u2019t help but feel grateful for this newfound opportunity to spend time with her love. How hard could this exercise business really be? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd Lunge\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair both lunged forward, getting rather close to each other. Ichika could see Cecilia\u2019s well maintained drills, smooth golden locks, flowing ever so close to his own head. As he breathed a little more heavily than usual, he could even smell the sweet scent of her shampoo. It was enough make his thoughts turn fuzzy and pink.  He hurriedly returned to a standing position, shaking that intoxicating fragrance out of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-Okay, now, stretch out your quads, like this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscular boy effortlessly kicked up his toned leg behind him and held it in place, balancing on one foot. Cecilia gulped audibly, before attempting the same, rather more clumsily. Her foot pressed into her pudgy posterior, and in her attempt to support her rotund frame on just one leg, she lost her balance. No matter how much fat she had out back, the scale of her belly brought her tumbling hopelessly forward. Quick as a flash, Ichika jumped forward to catch her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah there! Are you okay, Cecilia?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yes, I\u2019m\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecilia\u2019s face was pressed up against his well-trained pecs, hot breath flowing onto him. And it just so happened that Ichika\u2019s hands had caught Cecilia on her biggest \u201ctarget\u201d; her gut, overflowing from beneath her top. As Ichika looked down into Cecilia\u2019s sparkling blue eyes, and she into his, he couldn\u2019t help but notice just how /soft/ it was, like a big, pink pillow, enveloping his strong hands. Their two flushed faces were almost touching\u2026 all she had to do was stand up a little taller, onto her tip toes, and she could\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIchika. Perhaps you\u2019d like to explain this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u201dAaaaahh!!\u201d\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn intruding voice caused the two to jump apart, and stand up straight. It belonged to none other than the other blonde beauty in Ichika\u2019s life, Charlotte Dunois, the French representative candidate. Dressed in her trademark white, purple and orange tracksuit, she stared at the pair with a rare frown on her usually angelic face. Cecilia noted with sorrow that her flushed and slightly sweaty body still seemed to look as svelte as it ever did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just working out with Cecilia, a-and she fell, so, it\u2019s not what you thin-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWorking out with Cecilia? What?! You? Together with\u2026 /that/ Cecilia?!\u201d Char looked quite understandably shocked. It was difficult to tell whether Char was sweating so much because of this revelation or because of all the training she had just finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhoho, Dunois-san. That\u2019s right, Ichika-san and I were just-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIchika!\u201d shouted Char, rather rudely interrupting Cecilia. \u201cYou should have told me! I\u2019ve been planning my own routine too! We should work together!\u201d Once again her face was all smiles, as she took Ichika\u2019s hand in hers, causing him to get quite flustered yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Get your hands off of Ichika-san!!!) Thought Cecilia furiously to herself, but a dignified Lady of the Alcott familly was too reserved to make a scene in the gym. She simply huffed in disapproval. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cU-Um, sure, Char, sure, the three of us can work together!\u201d<br>\r\nThe two blonde rivals from across the Dover strait gave each other a killing stare. Cecilia was the first to break away, causing Char to grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then Ichika, shall we meet at this time tomorrow? I can\u2019t wait! Thanks!\u201d Having successfully forced herself in-between the young would-be lovers, she happily jogged away back to her dorm, athletic little ponytail swaying behind her. This left Ichika and Cecilia to stand around awkwardly on the soft exercise mats, a little unsure of how to react to everything that had just occured. <br>\r\nIn all the commotion, of course, they had quite forgotten about the exercise that had been planned.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning Ceclia awoke with a small rush of her heart, the previous day's 'workout' session still incredibly fresh in her mind. After the pair had separated, she mentally scolded herself for not inching the distance between the two so she could capture his lips in an incredibly romantic moment. Well, it did sound romantic enough in her head. Getting up, she got a good glance of her pale white belly that surged from her middle. Placing a hand on it, she frowned at the overall softness of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I swear to become the kind of girl Ichika can be proud of!' she thought to herself as her revolve began to climb higher and higher. She was going to diet! She was going to tone up! She was going to wear a size small in everything! A sudden roar of her stomach stopped this momentum as she nearly doubled over in hunger.  'I'll get to all of that right after breakfast...' she thought as she began her meticulous morning routines.<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking down to the dining hall, Cecilia ignored all of the whispers and hushed gossips as she was focused on two things. The first obviously being Ichika and the second being food itself. Getting in line, she grabbed a tray was clearly excited at the prospect of stuffing her mouth full of waffles, syrup and other sugary breakfast foods. A few minutes later and she left the line, her tray filled with a hearty stack of pancakes, eggs, a plateful of bacon and a few slices of toast. Also picking up a few glasses of orange juice and some milk, she found a both and proceeded to squeeze herself into a booth and began to chow down. Ignoring how her stomach was riding over the table slightly, she ate forkful to forkful as she felt herself becoming very satisfied. As the British young woman was engrossed in stuffing herself, she didn't notice a svelte figure sliding into the booth and sitting right across from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Cecilia, how are you?\" asked the ever 'naive' Charlotte as she placed down her own breakfast. Shocked at the fact that someone was right there, she quickly swallowed the food in her mouth and looked up to see the second infamous blonde of the school. Unlike her, Charlotte was quite popular and was praised for her good looks, nice figure and pleasant attitude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh, good morning Charlotte.\" said Cecilia, still shocked that someone aside from Ichika would be willing to sit with her. Looking at her tray, the amount of food that Charlotte betrayed her seemingly thin figure. She had a stack of pancakes that rivaled hers, plenty of bacon and a large bowl of oatmeal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems that we both enjoy a hearty breakfast huh?\" said the other blonde as she began to pick at her food. Cecilia decided to continue her meal as she chatted up with the French student. It seemed nice to talk to another girl like this and before she knew it, the overfed blonde was done with her meal, a hand placed on her stuffed middle. Looking over at the other girl's meal, she barely touched it, leaving most of it uneaten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks that my eyes were bigger than my stomach. Mind helping me finish this off?\" asked Charlotte as she pushed the tray close to her. Thinking it over, wasn't she trying to start a diet? Then again, she could always work off these calories with Ichika's training sessions.  Fork in hand, she reached over to the plate full of bacon and began to dig in, failing to see a smirk growing on the 'kind' Charlotte's face.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was time, yet again, for Cecilia\u2019s exercise with Ichika! She released a little ladylike giggle as she stuffed her burgeoning balloon of a belly into her tight little tracksuit bottoms. Patting her belly, so wonderfully filled from her lovely breakfast, Cecilia headed towards the gym. Her fat was so tightly constricted, she looked like a sausage! Mm, sausage\u2026<br>\r\nThe poor lady was ripped from her dreamlike reverie as she saw that slender Char already flirting with Ichika! How had she gotten here so fast? She\u2019d almost forgotten that French girl was going to be interrupting. Cecilia stormed over to Ichika at once, grabbing his arm!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIchika-san~ Could you please help me warm up again?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, sure. Can you touch your toes to start with, both of you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u201dYes!!\u201d\u201d<br>\r\nThe two girls instantly bent over, Char\u2019s flexibility allowing her to be gripping her dainty little toes in an instant, whilst Cecilia was having a little more trouble surpassing her gargantuan gut. She huffed and puffed, but just couldn't do it! Standing behind her, Ichika was having trouble denying that it was a very pleasant view, the sweatpants doing nothing to hide the incredible curves of her rear end\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Here Cecilia, you can do it!\u201d The young man took a step forward, gently placing his hands on her back to see if he could help at all, eliciting a nervous squeak from our heavy heroine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-Ichika-san?!\u201d In her panic at such close contact, Cecilia attempted to stand up, but clumsily ended up knocking right into Ichika. There was a loud thump, as Char straightened up and looked at the carnage before her. Ichika was lying sprawled out on his back, and sitting right in the middle of his toned chest, was a very fat, very red, Cecilia Alcott. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u201dIchika, are you okay!?\u201d\u201d both girls cried out at once. The poor boy soon coughed out an answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yup, I\u2019m good\u2026 sorry Cecilia, I didn\u2019t mean to frighten you.\u201d His cheeks flushed a gentle shade of pink. Cecilia\u2019s huge butt was right in front of his eyes\u2026 his hands were gripping onto her wide hips, but it would just take a second to slide his fingers down\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly, what were you two doing over here?\u201d Interrupted a rather irritated Charlotte. She had been waiting for a compliment on her flexibility, not for Ichika to end up close and personal with the whale! She took a firm hold of Cecilia\u2019s wrists, and leaned back, pulling with all her might! But Cecilia wasn\u2019t being very co-operative it seemed. Char was quite amazed at just how heavy Cecilia was. After all, she was a trained IS Pilot, yet she couldn\u2019t, just couldn\u2019t, no matter how hard she tried, lift this one girl off of Ichika!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnng... Cecilia... Ichika looks uncomfortable... Maybe you should get up! Get, oof, off of him!\"<br>\r\nYet Cecilia was hardly budging. She was just too fat to lift! And, deep down, rather enjoying having such a great deal of contact with her crush. Not thinking quite straight in the heat of the moment, she kept her rump firmly parked, resisting like a stubborn, spoilt child.\t<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-Ichika-san, doesn\u2019t seem to be\u2026 complaining!\u201d Certainly, this was true. His eyes were glued to Cecilia\u2019s enormous ass, his fingers sinking into the marshmallow flesh of her hips. Realising this, Char understood she had to shift Cecilia as soon as possible, before Miss Heavy Load and Ichika ended up inseparable! She dug her heels into the ground, leaned backwards, and used every last bit of her strength! Sure enough, after a massive struggle, Cecilia was brought back onto her feet, wobbling like jelly. As relieved as Ichika\u2019s chest felt, he couldn\u2019t help but release a disappointed little sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry girls\u2026 I don\u2019t really feel like any more exercise\u2026\u201d He wheezed, dragging himself onto a bench. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-Do you need to go to the nurse!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you like a snack?!\u201d<br>\r\nAnd so, the two girls sat on either side, and ended up fawning over Ichika for the rest of the session, desperate to ensure he was comfortable. Yet again, Cecilia had ended up utterly unscathed. No more exercise was done that day.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

To someone like Cecilia, the simple action of arriving at the gym meant that she could be rewarded despite not actually burning off the calories. Charlotte would be in a similar position, however she did manage to work out her body doing other things at school so the snacking could be done without fear of extra pudge on her frame. As of now, it was the weekend, which meant that the plump blonde haired lady was free to spend some more time with Ichika outside of their special workouts. The other day they had agreed to work on some homework together, something that the blonde was highly looking forward to. Walking down the halls, she ignored the usual comments and snickers aimed at her corpulent form, the thoughts of her spending time with her darling Ichika blocking out such negativity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ooh, I'm so excited. Maybe I can get Ichika to notice me as more than a friend?\" she thought, recalling all of the romantic manga she had been indulging in as of late. Generally in these situations, the guy and girl would study together and end up falling into incredibly romantic situations. Letting out a high pitched squeal, her face lit up in a red blush, earning her even more attention from the surrounding students. Eventually she would make it to the library where the two could study to their heart's content. Luckily, she had the foresight to sign up for a private studying room so the two could be alone without any interruption from a certain French girl.  Heading inside, she saw Ichika sitting down at a nearby table, reading a random book. Making sure she was presentable, she slowly walked up to him with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon Ichika.\" she said in a sweet tone. Looking up, he also gave her a big grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there Cecilia, ready to get started?\" asked Ichika as he stood up and grabbed his bag. She nodded and the pair moved to the room that she had signed up for. Heading towards the back of the library, they got into the assigned room and began. Time went on as the pair worked on both the handouts that were assigned and some studying for the next class. Deciding to sit next to Ichika, she would inch closer and closer to him as time would pass, causing her wide waist and fluffy thighs to press against his more firm figure. While Ichika could be dense from time to time, feeling her body pressed against him felt quite nice, the softness feeling like a pillow was rubbing up against him. With the sweet smell drifting off of her hair and body, it only served to make the experience much more enjoyable, causing his face to grow a bit more flush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ichika, can you help me figure out this problem?\" asked Cecilia as she pointed to a problem on her sheet of paper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this problem?\" he asked as he used his pen to point out the question in question. Because of this she looked up at him, to tell her yes, causing him to look down towards her. Staring in each other eyes, Ichika got a good look at the girl's cute rounded face and those plump rosy lips that seemed only a few inches away. However, it seemed that Cecila would be the more dense party in this situation and she simply nodded with a cute smile. Feeling his own face growing flushed, he quickly turned his head away to avoid something he might regret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ichika, is something wrong?\" she asked, growing concerned due to the erratic action. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah sorry about that, I felt a sneeze coming on.\" lied Ichika as he turned his head back to face her.  \"Ah so this problem has an easy solution to it.\" said Ichika as he went on to explain the problem. </span></div></div>",

Perhaps that joyous occasion was what filled her movements with such energy. She continued to wiggle happily as they queued up for their food, Cecilia making sure to get as much as possible, only stopping once her soft rump was firmly placed on the ominously creaking chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, not everyone in the room was as happy as our food-filled heroine. Alone, in the corner of the room, there sat a certain busty childhood friend. Nibbling at her salad like an angry bunny, she watched, with steadily increasing irritation, as /her/ Ichika chuckled and smiled at that hungry hippo. When she saw their fingers linger dangerously close to each other on the table top, she could take no more! Houki hoisted her wooden sword over her aching shoulders, and stomped over to the flirting students, the clicking of her heavy boots filling the dining hall<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Ichika, here you are, having fun I hope?\u201d Even for Houki, this frown was extreme. \u201cI mean, you\u2019ve certainly been neglecting your IS training lately, haven\u2019t you? I\u2019ve been training by myself all of last week.\u201d Houki shot a deadly glare at Cecilia, which caused her to swallow her enormous mouthful of food with a nervous gulp. \u201cIs it her fault? Is she spreading her lazy ways to you?  Don\u2019t you care about your student responsibilities anymore? Are you going to let her drag you down? I thought you were better than this, Ichika. I thought you were passionate about becoming a good pilot! What was all our training together for? Ichika you\u2026 you idiot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting her passions control her body, Houki let her sword fly out, with her training lending it incredible speed. Just as Ichika shut his eyes and flinched in a trained response, he heard a loud crash, yet felt no pain. Standing before him was Cecilia, her tubby arms outstretched as she blocked the wood with her empty plate. A crack crept down it, splitting it perfectly in two, a testament to Houki\u2019s sword skill. Not to be deterred, Cecilia opened her mouth and spoke in a dignified voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIchika-san doesn\u2019t deserve to be shouted at like that! Just because he isn\u2019t spending as much time with you doesn\u2019t make him a bad person! Shinonono-san, you ought to apologise right away! Ichika-san is a great man, and I won\u2019t stand to hear you slander him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy you\u2026 damn cow\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC-Cow?! How dare you, you\u2019re the one with the udders!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cENOUGH!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchika silenced the entire dining hall as he stood to his full height. Every other girl in the room stopped their chattering to watch the drama unfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHouki\u2026 I\u2019m sorry I forgot to train with you. But I want you to apologise to Cecilia right now. It\u2019s wrong to lash out at innocent people like that. Come on, shake her hand Cecilia. Make up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecilia slowly offered out a trembling hand as instructed, her chubby digits reaching for Houki. She studied the plump peace offering, as her brow trembled. Finally, Houki simply span around on her heel with a dismissive \u201cHmmph!\u201d She rushed to retreat to her room, but not before a parting shot;<br>\r\n\u201c<br>\r\nFine! Go flirt with Cecilia all day! Who wants to be a pilot anyway?!\u201d<br>\r\nAs the aggressive girl ran from the room, hiding her face, Cecilia was left with a blush on her plush cheeks, a whisper on her full lips. \u201cF-Flirting? Did it really look like we were\u2026?\u201d But that thought was interrupted by Ichika swiftly taking a gentle hold of her wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you all right?! What were you thinking, taking one of Houki\u2019s strikes\u2026 you could have been hurt! You didn\u2019t even use your IS to protect yourself\u2026\u201d The flustered boy took a moment to breathe, in and out, and calm his thoughts. His fingers danced over Cecilia\u2019s rather healthy wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCecilia. Thank you for protecting me.\u201d<br>\r\nThat caused her blush to bloom like never before. His eyes, full of gratitude, stared straight into hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there anything I can do to repay you? Do you need to go to the nurse?\u201d<br>\r\nA million answers flew around in her mind, but the grumbling of her tummy, and the nervousness in her heart, chose one of the most modest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Well, I could do with some ice\u2026. Ice cream, if you don\u2019t mind\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With her request, he simply smiled at her, happy that he could repay her for her incredibly sweet gesture. He would have to have a personal talk with Houki later, to both apologize for not spending time with her as a friend and talk to her about how she could have severely hurt Cecila. Ichika was a man, so that meant that he could tank her hits with no issue. Hell he received greater beatings in the past but he was always stronger for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, is that all you want?\" teased Ichika, gently petting her hair. With a small blush forming on her face, she nodded and smile at her crush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest, I really didn't do much.\" said Cecilia as she and Ichika headed outside the dining room. Since ice cream wasn't anything fancy, Cecilia saw no need for her to freshen up and she followed Ichika as they began to leave school grounds into town. This particular ice cream parlor was pretty popular with the girls at the academy, so they tended to give them discounts as well, something that Cecilia had taken advantage of frequently.  Since it was nearing sundown, the sky had an orange tint to hit, highlighting just how beautiful it was. Cecilia had an extreme desire to latch onto Ichika's arm and pretend it was a 'real' date, but she had to control herself, she need to better her body before she could tell him her true feelings. After about 10 minutes of walking, they arrived at the small shop, which was slightly full due to the amount of students in it. Holding the door open for her, the snickers and harsh words came about, but soon stopped after Ichika entered. This time there were whispers abound as Cecilia and Ichika headed to the counter to order their treat. Looking at the menu, she was always hard pressed to make a decision on what she wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So feel free to order whatever.\" said Ichika, also browsing the menu. Cecilia was at a standstill. One one hand, she can order something small and make sure Ichika doesn't spend that much on her, or she could get one of her usuals, which would be a bit more pricy. Seeing her face scrunch up in worry, Ichika gave a small laugh and placed a hand on her soft shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, feel free to order as much as you want. I at least owe you that much.\" With a small nod, she went up to the counter, the worker recognizing her as a really good customer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, can I get the double strawberry cheesecake sundae with extra sprinkles?\" asked Cecilia, feeling herself incredibly happy to be able to order such a sweet treat. The worker nodded and began to make her sundae. Stepping aside, Ichika placed his order which was just a medium cup of cookie dough ice cream with rainbow sprinkles. About a few minutes of waiting and their order was ready, Ichika paying the worker and the two heading to a booth to enjoy their spoils. Sucking in her stomach, she slid herself in and simply stared at her treat, seeing just how wonderful it was. Much to her surprise, Ichika slid in right next to her, sitting rather close to her as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, these look good right?\" said Ichika as he took in a spoonful of his ice cream. She nodded eagerly as she took the first bite, her face lighting up in pure happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, it's so good Ichika!\" she exclaimed as she began to shovel spoonful after spoonful of ice cream into her greedy mouth, enjoying how the flavors blended perfectly in her mouth. After about ten minutes of eating and smalltalk, Ichika noticed that there was a bit of ice cream and sprinkles on her cheek, As he was pounded into him the idea of being a gentleman, he took a napkin and gently wiped her face clean of any ice cream.  Noticing this, Cecilia froze and her face exploded into a red tinge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-Ichika?\" she said, her voice sounding almost like a whimper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, sorry if I bothered you, i couldn't help but help you out there.\" explained Ichika, giving her a sincere smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you...\" she said, her mind still feeling quite fried from the friendly gesture. Eventually the two would finish their ice cream, Cecilia rubbing her belly in delight, both in the fact that Ichika treated her and that she was able to eat something really good.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we good to go?\" asked Ichika, also feeling satisfied from his ice cream. With a nod from her, he slid out of the booth, offering a hand to help her slid out as well. Since she had just ate something that was rather large, she was feeling a bit sluggish, so she was glad that she had Ichika to help her. Taking his hand, she underestimated the amount of force he would produce and she ended up leaving the booth at a rapid way, her body going towards Ichika. Reacting, he caught her before she could trip, her hands around her wide waist and her body pressing up against him. Looking up after the shock of the movement, she saw his eyes as they were staring right at her.  It took a second to process what had happened and as she did, she averted her eyes as her blush grew even bigger. For Ichika, his hands were still on her waist, feeling her flab in between his fingertips. For reasons unknown to him, he had a strong desire to squeeze his hands in order to fully feel just how soft her waist was. Getting a hold of himself, he gently let her go, a voice in the back of his head telling him that it was a rather bad idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, want to walk back to the academy?\" he asked, his own face feeling a bit flushed. With a silent nod, she followed him, a small smile on her face at the fact that Ichika held her so gently. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day was far less pleasant for the young lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoofff\u2026. Come, on, aah, and, fiiiit!\u201d Whined Cecilia, as she struggled and squirmed. Standing alone in the changing rooms, Cecilia was tugging on her IS suit, as it utterly refused to encompass her swollen form. Resembling a one piece swimsuit, the stretchy material was supposed to be tight, but this was ridiculous! She could barely tug it up to her chest! Any onlooker would see her beach ball of a belly being cradled in the material, lifted by Cecilia\u2019s effort in a way that showed it\u2019s true, impressive, roundness. It gurgled unhappily, this makeshift hammock less than comfortable. It pleaded for a return to the ice cream parlour, to being fed sweet treats by Ichika\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNn, No, no! Need to, oof, train!\u201d And with a momentous effort, Cecilia hoisted the suit over her shoulders, threading her arms through the tight holes. She exhaled in relief, causing worrying sounds of stretching to echo through the locker room. Why had that been such an effort? Cecilia was well aware that she was the only student to wear a suit in this size. Sniping was a lot less physical than other combat roles. Few other students could hope to achieve her luxurious lifestyle and corpulent figure. She was \u201cexercising\u201d with Ichika many times a week! There was /no way/ she could have possibly grown even larger. Was it possible that the suits became more rigid with age? Had it lost its stretchiness? Either way, it seemed she would need a new suit, if she wanted to ever start training without already being exhausted. But for now, she had no choice but to deal with this ridiculous outfit.  With each step she took towards the training grounds, her belly, wrapped oh so tight, bounced and wobbled. This was an utterly unflattering view, the material hugging so tightly to her curves; it was as though she were naked! Rotund thighs rubbed against each other as she blushed deeply. And as her tummy did jostle and jiggle in its tight prison, she could hear the remains of her hearty breakfast sloshing within; eating with Char had made breakfast so much more fun, even if she was a rival! The food had never tasted better, and Cecilia always felt so full of energy each morning, excellent for her current schedule of exhausting exercise\u2026. Or so she told herself.<br>\r\nBefore she headed out into the open, Cecilia reached back to tug the bottom of the suit out of her enormous rear. The speed with which it snapped back into its position might have alerted Cecilia that this suit was just as stretchy as before. However, her mind was already fixated on what she would have for her next feast. The bloated balloon of a beauty bounced outside, into the harsh light of the sun, which spared no expense in illuminating the magnificent mass of Cecilia Alcott. Her blonde hair glittered like gold under the bright beams, as the shiny material of her suit emphasised her sheer girth.<br>\r\nCecilia was very grateful that Ichika was doing his training in a different location, as she equipped her armour and aimed towards the training targets with her rifle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to her room, and leaning against the door in exhaustion, as a sudden shower of rain pattered against the window of her room. As she took the considerable weight off her legs, Cecilia let out a sigh of relief. The door let out a creak of pain.<br>\r\nHer marksmanship was spot on as always. Sure she hadn\u2019t been running about or swinging a big stick, but she\u2019d still been doing exercise! And that meant she needed a rest! Confining her body to an old frilly blouse and London jeans, she sat down at her desk and grabbed a tin of gourmet cakes. Even her chair creaked at the burden, as her amazing arse flowed over the sides. Cecilia had received these cakes as a gift from home, and had been waiting for a good occasion to indulge herself. Sure, her evening meal was a mere hour away, but she /was/ tired! Popping off the first lid, she drooled at the wide selection of exquisitely baked goods. Her delicately maintained nails gripped their first prey, carefully placing the spongy treat into her moist lips. Mere seconds later, they were reaching for another. They tasted so, so good! Oh, so moist, sweet, and fluffy! And yet, somehow, they didn\u2019t taste as good as the ice cream Ichika had gotten her\u2026<br>\r\nHer mind suddenly conjured up an image; Ichika, in a fine suit, popping tray after tray of these cakes into her waiting mouth. As if trying to let her body keep up with her mind, she stuffed her chubby cheeks with the baked goods. She had been spending so much good time with Ichika of late. And he was so kind to her! These cakes tasted heavenly too! Cecilia was rising up to her own personal heaven, not noticing as her ladylike composure broke down. Crumbs dropped into her considerable cleavage, as an immeasurable amount of cake flooded into Cecilia\u2019s awaiting belly. Icing speckled her face as she gorged herself, wishing oh so much that her fantasy would come true.<br>\r\nA squeaking noise went quite unnoticed by Cecilia\u2019s ears.<br>\r\nAll she wanted was Ichika to be with her forever\u2026 to get her all the food she could eat, feed her, and love her no matter how much she grew! Sure, she was working out now, but who knew how long she could keep up that exhausting schedule?<br>\r\nOnce again, the frilly, stained, blouse squeaked for help, its pleas falling on deaf ears. It hadn\u2019t been made to contain such a behemoth of a belly, swelling constantly with the influx of cake. Fat steadily rose through the gaps between the straining buttons, like dough in an oven.<br>\r\nThe tins, which she had intended to last a few days at least, were almost empty, as the greedy little lady groaned in voracious pleasure. Cecilia leaned over her bulging belly to reach yet another fresh tin. She moaned with a mouth full of joy, dainty little toes curling up in happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmfff~\u2026 Ichi\u2026ka\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she snapped out of her reverie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, Cecilia witnessed in horror as each and every button burst before the unstoppable mass of her belly! Each deafening POP exposed more and more creamy white flesh, until the blouse hung uselessly at her sides. Her lace bra was fully visible, and visibly straining too. Cecilia suddenly realised just how painful her stuffed tummy felt, tight jeans biting into her waist. She wasted no time in undoing the button, causing her enormous tummy to roll out onto her rotund thighs. Taut and hard from its recent filling, it rose and fell with each heavy breath. It was full to bursting! Even Cecilia thought she had gone too far that time, but, she\u2019d simply gotten so caught up in her thoughts. She couldn\u2019t stop herself! Inhaling deeply, Cecilia ran her hands over her fitful belly in an attempt to calm it. A casual onlooker could easily have mistaken her for a heavily pregnant woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-Oohh\u2026\u2026 flimsy old clothes\u2026\u201d Whimpered Cecilia, still greedily licking icing from her face. She felt, and rather looked, like a beached whale, immobilised by her gluttony. The greedy Lady set to thinking what she would wear to the cafeteria later. After all, this was all the fault of the clothing, yes, just like her IS suit. Today was just an unlucky day! Besides, there was no way she could skip the meal, wasting food was a terrible thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 Her eyes fell onto the last remaining cake, and she smacked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm\u2026 maybe there\u2019s\u2026. Oh, just enough room for one more~?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Taking a small nap to offset the amount that she had just eaten, Cecilia slowly awoke to the soft sounds of the rain. Looking around in a daze, she looked towards her clock and saw that it read 7:00 P.M. Letting out a rather long yawn, hands outstretched behind her back, her arm flab gently brushing up against her rounded face, she threw her hefty legs over the side of the bed and sat there. Looking down at her current attire, she had changed into a deep blue sweatshirt with grey sweats after her earlier wardrobe malfunction. Letting out a sigh, she had yet to do her laundry for the week so these clothes would have to suffice until the morning. Though none of this was her fault, after all how could she know that the washing machines at the academy had a habit of shrinking clothes several sizes!?  Lifting her heft body up, she placed a hand to her flabby belly. It seems that her earlier meal had settled and her midsection no longer looked incredibly swollen. However, it still looked quite fat, a fact that the blonde tended to ignore often. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, I think I should still attend dinner. Perhaps I can meet Ichika there...\" said the girl to herself, recalling the thoughts she had over the boy earlier, sending her face into a heavy blush.  She wanted Ichika to tend to her every need, to spoil her like a princess. Shaking such thoughts out of her mind, she made sure to take her wallet and keys along with her as she exited her room, the destination quite clear. Since it was somewhat late, the halls were rather empty, something that the blonde enjoyed since she didn't have to deal with snickers or sneers from her classmates. Going through some hallways, she reached the dining hall which had a few students eating her and there. Quickly getting herself a meal consisting of chicken parmesan, a flat iron steak, pork cutlets, and various other dishes that she could fit onto her tray. Heading to find a seat, she saw Ichika picking away at his food, a somewhat neutral expression on his face as he browsed his phone in silence. A smile forming on her face, she slowly walked over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening Ichika. Do you mind if I sit with you?\" she asked, her voice as sweet as ever. He looked up and took in her appearance and felt his own face become a bit warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Ah, good evening. Yeah, feel free to sit.\" said Ichika as he patted the seat next to him. Cecilia nodded and slid right in, sitting rather closely to Ichika as they were sitting shoulder to shoulder. Taking a good look at her outfit, taking in her demeanor and he figured it out. Right now Cecilia looked incredibly adorable and every fiber of his being was screaming at him to simply hug the cute girl. Clearing his head of such nonsense, he continued to eat his meal as Cecilia dug into hers. They shared smalltalk, something that had become quite common for them as of late. They spoke of school work, of good foods to eat, of family, pretty much whatever came to mind. Soon enough, Cecilia would finish her grandiose meal, having become incredibly lethargic due to the sheer amount that she had consumed. Ichika himself had finished long ago, simply waiting for his friend to finish her meal. It was usually like this, but he never minded at all. Checking his phone for a brief moment to see if he had received any mails or messages, suddenly he felt a soft weight on his left shoulder and a soft snoring sound. Looking over, it seemed that Cecilia had succumbed to her fatigue and fell asleep on his shoulder. Ichika froze up, having no idea what to do in this situation. Looking closer at her, she even seemed to be drooling on him slightly, a clear sign of a peaceful slumber. Right now, those thoughts were coming back, yelling at him to take advantage of the situation and do something 'romantic.' However, Ichika was a gentleman in nature and always thought things through just in case. Smiling, he decided the best course of action was to simply let her rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Man Cecilia, you really are cute.' warmly thought Ichika as he watched her lightly snore.    </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As nice as it was to have Cecilia slumped over his shoulder, Ichika knew he couldn\u2019t stay like this forever. People were starting to stare for one thing, and Cecilia would wake up with a nasty cramp if she slept in these tough chairs. He had to take her back to her room. Gently pushing her back into her own chair, Ichika stood up and looked down at the slumbering sweetheart. No choice but to carry her back to her bed. So, Ichika took hold of her wrists, and pulled\u2026 and pulled\u2026 and pulled! It seemed he had underestimated the challenge Cecilia\u2019s dead weight presented. She was hardly budging at all, still sleeping as soundly as before, her rounded rump still firmly pressing down on the chair. Just as Ichika was ready to summon his IS to cope with this unimaginable burden, the bloated beauty suddenly gave in to his efforts, allowing him to hoist her upon his broad back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhew\u2026 glad to see all that work in the gym wasn\u2019t for nothing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte Dunois stretched her arms as she let loose an exaggerated sigh of exhaustion. Somehow, Ichika thought, it didn\u2019t look like Char had been doing that much working as of late, but it was certainly a stroke of luck that she had been around to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut still\u2026 she really is heavy, huh? I can\u2019t believe it took both of us to lift her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soft French girl suppressed a snicker. Oh yes, she certainly was heavy. Passing off a veritable feast to her every breakfast had sent Cecilia\u2019s growth skyrocketing. Char had been amazed at just how little self-control her rival held; simply place food in front of Cecilia, and she will gobble it down in seconds. An endless eating machine. Such a pig would disgust any man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, thanks for the help. Could you give me another hand quickly? I\u2019ll need you to get her keys out when we reach her room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, Ichika brushed aside her criticism like it was nothing. There was no way he couldn\u2019t have noticed; it looked like his muscular legs were about to buckle under the weight! Surely, thought Char, the contrast between the whale beached upon his back, and the slender poster girl for fitness and exercise before him, must be even more enormous than Cecilia\u2019s bum! Just to make sure, she placed her hands on her toned butt, and leaned forward to showcase her perky breasts, her jersey teasingly unzipped to expose just the right amount of cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well, sure, I don\u2019t mind helping you out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks a lot, Char!\u201d replied Ichika, heading straight out of the crowded cafeteria.<br>\r\nAnd so, the three of them traversed the corridors, Ichika gritting his teeth as he kept his hands firmly placed on Cecilia\u2019s hips. The gluttonous girl was blissfully unaware of her situation; eyes shut tight as she greedily smacked her lips and drooled in a most unladylike way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNnmnm\u2026 Izzit bweakfass yet~?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she mumbled cutely, her belly could also be heard gurgling in a very rare manner; for once, it was not begging for more food, but complaining about just how severely stuffed it was. The evening\u2019s gluttony churned away inside the fleshy orb, pressed against Ichika\u2019s manly back. It refused to be squished flat as might have been expected however, more resembling a well inflated beach ball. Char couldn\u2019t help but be a little jealous at the lengths Ichika was going for the fatty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIchika, are you sure you\u2019re okay carrying her by yourself? Isn\u2019t she a little, too /heavy/?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy didn\u2019t he notice? Why wasn\u2019t he agreeing? It wasn\u2019t like Cecilia could hear what they said. She knew he was kind, and a little dense, but nobody could ignore such a heavy burden on their own back! Nobody could overlook how fast she was growing, day by day, blowing up like a balloon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa, she looks happy doesn\u2019t she? Look at her, smiling away. She must have really enjoyed her meal.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing that little mistake in Ichika\u2019s hearing, Char understood. She saw Ichika stare at Cecilia\u2019s chubby cheeks, pulled into a broad smile, resting on his shoulder. She saw the way that smile was reflected on his own grinning face, even as his body struggled to haul Cecilia forward. And in addition, she realised how Ichika had not allowed his gaze to linger on her own scantily clad form for barely more than a second. In that brief moment, Char understood that she had lost. As they finally reached the room, Char fished around in Cecilia\u2019s pockets for her keys, unlocked the door for Ichika, and immediately turned away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodbye, Ichika.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, she was far down the corridor before Ichika could question it. Shouting out a quick \u201cThank you!\u201d , Ichika guessed Char must have been very busy. It was very kind of her to help him haul Cecilia home in the first place, he couldn\u2019t have asked for more. He gulped as he took his first step into Cecilia\u2019s room, his eyes taken by all the lavish decorations, girly frills and antique adornments abound. Very clean indeed, except for a multitude of cake tins that had been torn open, surrounded by crumbs. Still, he thought as he shook his head, he wasn\u2019t here to stay, but to drop Cecilia off. Carefully lowering her onto the softness of her bed, Ichika couldn\u2019t help but take a moment to admire her form. The smooth curve of her neck, her lazily swaying legs, the way her golden locks splayed out over the bed like the sun illuminating the sky. Just as he pulled away before temptation took hold, Cecilia\u2019s pudgy hand reached out and grabbed onto his toned arm. Still sleeping like a baby, her eyebrows had formed a little frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNnno\u2026 Ichika\u2026 stay\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis heart nearly leapt out of his chest before he realised that she was simply sleep talking, like before. But, that meant that Cecilia was dreaming about him right now. And that set Ichika\u2019s heart beating fast again.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was proud, she was kind, she was considerate, every quality that you would assign to a girl known as a 'lady.' To him, Cecilia was a good friend, but even then, one person could only take so much. Her chubby hand was still clutched to his arm, refusing to let go at such a time. Feeling his heartbeat steadily increase, he was at a crossroads of sorts. Still, since Cecilia was known as a 'lady' he had to be known as a 'gentleman' for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cecilia, it's time for you to go back to sleep,\" whispered the young man gently as he slowly released her grip on him and lowered her arm back on the bed. Before turning away, he heard her mutter once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ichika, don't go...\" Looking back, he noticed that she was half asleep, her eyes barely open. Felling his heart clench in his chest once more, he came up a bit closer to her and stared right in her clear blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cecilia, it's late. I promise we can spend all day tomorrow together.\" he said in a soft tone, placing a relaxing hand on her soft shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Promise?\" she wearily asked, the girl being pulled back into a state of slumber. This time, Ichika tool Cecilia's hand into his own. He felt just how soft and warm her hand was, something that made him feel at ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I promise. I promise on my honor as a gentleman.\" said Ichika with a smile, enjoying his little tittle. To ease her even more, he gently squeezed her chubby hand, feeling her let out a soft reliving sigh.  With that, Ceclila drifted off to sleep once more and Ichika let go of her hand. Before heading out, there was still something he felt that needed to be done. Going closer, he dipped his head down and gave her a soft kiss on the forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night Cecilia.\" he whispered. With that, he left the room carefully, not wanting to wake her up a second time. Closing the door, Ichika let out a big relieving sigh. The weight had been lifted from his shoulders and he could breath easy now though. Still, he face felt quite warm and his chest still felt tight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, don't over think things you idiot.\" he said to himself as he began to walk back to his room for some nice needed relaxation and sleep. </span></div></div>",

Wearing a white polo shirt and blue jeans, the young man nervously waited for the arrival of a certain lady. Mere moments after he had awakened this morning, he had received a text from Cecilia. Contained within was infallible spelling and grammar, a message reminding him of the promise he had made last night, and telling him to get ready for their appointment. Though neither of them had used the word \u201cdate\u201d, Ichika couldn\u2019t help but think it described this situation rather perfectly. The bright and burning rays of the sun hardly helped to slow the beads of sweat trickling down his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when Ichika was starting to fear that Cecilia might have gotten herself into some kind of troublesome predicament, he saw her.  Her feet moved slowly, clad in stylish blue sandals, her chubby feet testing the many straps. The rest of her soft body was well covered by a long, pure white sundress, flowing down from her shoulders, over her great curves, and ending around her knees. Even more so than usual, her golden hair looked superbly cared for, perfectly formed drills framing her heaving chest. Nestled between her full breasts, deep within her slightly exposed cleavage, nestled a lovely sapphire necklace, complimenting the earrings which contained her Blue Tears.  Seeing her slowly stepping towards the meeting point, Ichika couldn\u2019t help but think of how pretty she looked, as his own chest tightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, Ichika-san! I hope I didn\u2019t keep you waiting too long, my apologies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, I only just got here myself, no worries.\u201d<br>\r\nIchika anxiously spouted a small lie, more to protect himself from the embarrassment of being so hopelessly eager to meet Cecilia than to calm her worries. Flicking his gaze up and down her rotund form, Ichika was eager to change the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really like your outfit, Cecilia. White and blue\u2026 we go together well!\u201d<br>\r\nBoth of the awkward teens suddenly showed a red blush in response to Ichika\u2019s innocent statement.  He felt like such a fool, bringing down the atmosphere like this from the very start. Just as he tried to think of a way to recover the situation, the uneasy silence was broken with a thunderous rumble from Cecilia\u2019s spherical midriff, followed quickly by a deeper blush and a hastily stammered response;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-Ichika-san, we really should hurry to the train, or we\u2019re going to waste the day!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, err, yes, of course, this way, Cecilia!\u201d<br>\r\nThe pair soon focused on finding their way to the monorail station in order to reach the neighbouring city, the clear objective replacing their indecisive awkwardness. By the time they were finally sat down, it became much easier for them to chat casually, as usual. Sandwiched between Cecilia\u2019s wide, soft hips, and the warm glass of the window, Ichika stole glances at the sun-dappled ocean when not drinking in the far more beautiful sight of the happy Cecilia, impatient to reach the city and begin their day together.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Biting her plump lip as her sandal clad-feet stepped off of the monorail and into the crowded city station, Cecilia knew she had a problem. Oh, why had she been so silly? It had seemed like such a good idea at the time, back when her mind was giddy with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis very morning, as her head swam with ideas and worries about today\u2019s date with Ichika, she had surveyed her naked form in the mirror. She was undeniably fat. Fatter than before, but somehow Cecilia managed to miss that particular fact. Cradling her empty belly in her palms, she lifted up the mass of blubbery flesh and frowned. Last night\u2019s indulgences were a thing of the past, long since digested, ripples spreading through her jiggling belly as she gently shook her arms. It was no longer a taught, unyielding globe, but a great mound of soft, smooth fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need something\u2026 anything to make myself look thinner for Ichika!\u201d Shifting her hands to rest on her soft hips in frustration, her belly fell back down onto her upper thighs with a loud slap. The clock kept on ticking, and she hadn\u2019t even had breakfast yet\u2026. And that was when the idea came to her. Wouldn\u2019t skipping breakfast, keeping her tummy empty, make it look smaller? Genius, thought her starved and tired mind, as she struggled to squeeze her astonishingly wide hips into the unforgiving fabric of the dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the present, Cecilia cursed herself for lack of foresight. Her poor, starved stomach was rumbling nigh-constantly, screaming for nourishment. This had to have been the longest amount of time she hadn\u2019t eaten since\u2026 well\u2026 since forever! It was a small miracle that the raucous crowd screened her ravenous tummy\u2019s roars from reaching Ichika\u2019s ears. Suddenly, the toned teen reached back for Cecilia\u2019s soft hand, snapping her out of her hungry delusions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStay close Cecilia, I don\u2019t want to lose you! I think the restaurant you wanted is this way.\u201d It was a simple act, but it still brought a blush to the English glutton\u2019s swollen cheeks, and a gasp from her dry, hungering mouth.  Ichika was so thoughtful, so gentle, leading her by the hand to paradise. Even amongst such a large crowd, people couldn\u2019t help but notice the angelic smile of one particular blonde beauty, as she moved swiftly with a spring in her step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, it was not long before the exhausted, utterly empty girl was led to the expensive restaurant of her dreams, panting heavily with glazed eyes. Unfortunately, the thinning of the crowd meant that Cecilia no longer had any barrier preventing her tummy from embarrassing her in front of Ichika; she focused all willpower she had on keeping it silent. Meanwhile, the rest of her mind was filed with endless fantasies of food\u2026 oh, how she wished she was eating at this very moment, utterly gorging herself with plate after plate of rare delicacy\u2026 the poor girl smacked her lips at the idea with a sweet moan, hardly able to think of anything but filling her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like this is the place\u2026. Cecilia, are you okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cE-eh? Oh yes, fine! Just\u2026. Eager\u2026 to eat~\u201d Satisfied with that understatement of an answer, Ichika kept a grip on her hand as he led her into the establishment. He took charge of talking to the pleasant waitress and following her to a secluded booth by an enormous window, providing a scenic view of the ocean. Leather squeaked and wood creaked as Cecilia\u2019s shockingly heavy and delightfully soft ass descended onto the unprepared bench. Hurriedly grabbing the menu and drooling over the delicious sounding dishes on offer, she was far too busy deciding which of them not to order to notice Ichika daringly sliding across the bench to sit beside her. Snuggling up and leaning over her shoulder to read the menu, he couldn\u2019t help but sneak a glance at the bright necklace lost deep in her cavernous cleavage, before shaking his head, silently rebuking himself. Wasting no time, Cecilia called the nice waitress over in a panic, wiping a sliver of drool from her lips before speaking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I would like the Infinite Smoothie, and a caesar salad-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course Miss, and for the Gentlema-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c-and fussili carbonara, and the cod fillet, and the strawberry sundae\u2026 and\u2026 ooh yes, the chocolate brownie, if you please~\u201d As Cecilia flashed a brilliant grin, the waitress could only stand there, mouth agape and eyes wide in shock. That was undoubtedly the most food a single person had ordered from her\u2026 she put it from her mind and turned to the nice good-looking young man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd\u2026 for the gentleman?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll just have a coke and the lasagna. Thank you.\u201d Ichika looked into the waitress eyes with a grateful smile as he said this, all too aware of the burden Cecilia\u2019s gluttony was about to place on her.  Luckily, it seemed like enough to keep her mood up, as she skipped away to the kitchens with a rushed and nervous bow. Left alone once more, Ichika turned back to his fidgeting friend, rubbing her thighs together restlessly and looking out of the window, whining quietly as she waited impatiently for the food her body so dearly needed. Such a sight caused the corners of Ichika\u2019s mouth to lift into a gentle, genuine smile, as he simply placed his hand on her shoulder, speaking in a low voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCecilia\u2026 you must have been reeaally looking forward to this food.\u201d<br>\r\nGreat gut grumbling beneath the table, Cecilia could only blush and whimper in response.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After what felt like an eternity of Cecilia\u2019s pained moans and roaring, ravenous tummy, the first dishes of her decadent feast clattered down upon the table, the sound snapping her out of her tired trance. Licking her lips with a greedy grin, Cecilia dug her fork into her creamy pasta in a flash. Ichika could only watch in awe as she shoveled the carb-filled food into herself. By the time her green salad was brought to the table by another waitress, the pasta was already half devoured, and when her fish arrived she had already begun rapidly chewing through the healthy option. A stream of waitresses hurried to keep pace with the beautiful blonde\u2019s voracious appetite, a sight that gave an almost surreal feel to the meal. Quite forgetting the entirety of her lifetime of well-trained etiquette, Cecilia leaned back into the bench, inhaling deeply with a hand on her belly. It may have just been fed a normal sized meal for a normal teenage girl, but Cecilia was definitely extraordinary; her tummy still yearned for more, more delicious sensations to intensify that fantastic feeling of fullness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, Ichika-san, this food is simply too good~!\u201d Before he could offer a response, she leaned forward into the table and resumed her delighted display of unbridled gluttony. Cut, bite, chew, gulp, scoop, nibble, swallow, repeat and repeat again and again. Muffled panting punctuated each hurried bite, barely any time taken to savour the taste before it was hurriedly sent into her bottomless pit of a stomach. For some strange reason he couldn\u2019t explain, the shameless gorging was an almost hypnotic sight. Ichika barely even noticed when Cecilia began absent-mindedly digging into his own food in the middle of her voracious trance. There was just something about the boy that really kicked Cecilia\u2019s appetite into overdrive, something about the way he never once complained, always being so accepting and helpful, no matter how much she lacked restraint and delicacy. It was so comforting having him at her side, Cecilia felt like all her worries were flowing away. She could just eat, and eat, and eat, without a care in the world. Even once the main course was nothing more than crumbs on her cheeks, even as her tummy began to tell her it was feeling full and sated, Cecilia dug into her sweet desserts as though she was still utterly empty. Waitresses began to stare in disbelief at this unbelievable girl, an eating machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCecilia, maybe you should slow down\u2026\u201d Ichika\u2019s awkwardly mumbled suggestion fell on deaf ears. Her belly was an over-inflated beach ball, rounded and taut, bulging out into the table as she pushed herself forward to reach for her sweet deserts upon the other end of the table. It was almost large enough to present her from reaching her food, smooth fat flowing around the wooden rim as if threatening to engulf it.  Alternating between heavy scoops of sundae and thick slices of brownie, her pace barely slowed at all, cheeks bulging out with sweetness as she grinned cutely. Mere moments later, the unbelievable feast was completely contained within her belly. Spherical and perky, it filled her lap, almost visibly vibrating as it gurgled and churned away. That was when the aftereffects hit Cecilia like a brick. Her eyes opened wide as she suddenly realised just how painfully full she was. With a cute moan, she leaned into Ichika and gripped his sleeve for support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, Ichika-san, it hurts, it hurts!\u201d With a small blush, he instantly reached out to gently touch her tummy. Gasping at the softness of her womanly skin beneath the white dress, Ichika slowly moved his palm around in rhythmic circles upon the stuffed sphere. It seemed Cecilia appreciated the gesture, as her grip grew softer, her eyes shutting to enjoy the sensation as her cheeks grew even redder than Ichika\u2019s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeez, this is why I told you to calm down\u2026.\u201d Oh, why had she eaten so much, stuffed herself silly like that? First foolishly skipping breakfast, now she had eaten more than a days\u2019 worth of food in one sitting. Cecilia was evidently a lady who didn\u2019t know the meaning of moderation. She counted herself lucky that Ichika had been with her to help her deal with the challenges of having such a troublesome tummy, both times, as he gently rubbed the gurgling globe that was her gargantuan gut.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They took in the local sights, the delightful air and of course the local sweets. It seemed that the overfed blonde couldn't go a few steps without having something sweet in her mouth. From gelato to eclairs, she was happily munching away, not that he minded. Her smile was worth anything to him. Eventually the sun began to set and the pair were ready to call it a day. They had found themselves on the vivid beach, walking hand in hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today was nice Ichika...\" said the girl, her face feeling flush as they continued to walk barefoot on the sand. He held onto her dainty plump hand tightly, enjoying the warm that she gave off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we should come here more often.\" After a few more minutes of walking Cecilia stopped to stare at the sunset, finding the few quite breathtaking. Seeing that she had found a good spot,he reached for his bag to pull out a moderately large towel. Placing it down, he gently pulled Cecilia to join him, the rather hefty girl taking up much of the covered space.  Since there wasn't much room on the towel, Ichika was forced to sit rather close to the plump blonde, not that he minded of course. The girl gave him a cute smile as she latched onto his arm, resting her head on his shoulder. Her belly was simply too much to contain and was pressing up against his side as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know to be honest, I never really thought something like this could happen.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, what do you mean?\" asked the pudgy girl as she looked up at him, her blue eyes shining even brighter due to the orange lights of the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, well I guess just being this close to someone...\" he muttered as he looked away from Cecilia, feeling just a tad bit bashful. She gave him a shy smile as she held his arm tighter, feeling her chest beat fast and faster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I felt the same way really, when we first started to become closer and such. I mean, with me being this weight and...\" Before she could even finish, Ichika grabbed her by the shoulders and gave her an intense look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't put yourself down like that! If someone can't accept you for who you really are, then they don't even deserve to be in the same room as you!\" he exclaimed, feeling his temper getting the better of him.

Something like that was always terribly difficult to deal with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That still doesn't mean it was right to yell at you like that.\" With that she gave him a soft smile and wrapped her doughy arms around him, bringing him close.

Her emotions getting the better of her, she hugged Ichika even tighter, causing the young man to lose his balance and fall backwards with the overly plump girl lying right on top of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cecilia!\" he said with a shocked face, her hefty breasts crushing his chest and her face a scant distance away from his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you Ichika!\" she exclaimed, tears starting to well up in the corner of her eyes. He let out a soft chuckle, he was seriously making things way too complicated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too Cecilia.\" It was so easy, to say that weighted word to her. It felt as natural as breathing! Unable to hold back any more, the girl stole his lips for a sweet and innocent kiss. He pushed back with a bit of force, enjoying her 'taste.'  After a few moments of expressing their new found feelings, she slowly got off of him, her face still beaming with happiness. He was able to sit back up, stretching a bit to get rid of the physical stress he underwent. The blonde continued to smile at him, grabbing both of his hands and intertwining them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it's official now huh?\" he said with a grin. Cecilia couldn't help but reply with another chaste kiss, the first of many that the new couple would undergo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"EEEEEEEEHHH?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the resounding cry across IS academy. An incredibly potent rumour had found its way into the classroom, and united the students in discussion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ICHIKA AND CECILIA ARE DATING?!\" Disbelief, shock, jealousy, emotions were highly strung.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That overblown balloon... Ichika, you idiot...\" mumbled Houki as she gripped her practice sword tightly, staring out of the window with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To think that tea gulping glutton would be so bold as to steal MY wife! Unacceptable!\" The silver haired commando, Laura Bodewig, thrust a machete into her desk with a fierce scowl. Char seemed somewhat calmer than everyone else, sighing in acceptance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, I kind of saw it coming, but still...\" Her blonde hair swayed from side to side as she shook her head, before focusing on getting ready for class. That was when Rin piped up from the classroom doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, for one, thi-\" However, she was swiftly interrupted by the class register slamming onto her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get back to your own classroom. Bodewig, take that knife out of the desk. Class is in session.\"<br>\r\nChifuyu pushed the Chinese student out into the corridor and strode confidently to the podium, silencing the gossip about her brother in an instant. Suddenly, said brother appeared panting and breathless at the door, holding the hand of a sweaty, red-faced, butterball of a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haa, sorry, Chifuyu-nee, we were-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Orimura-sensei to you! Get to your seats!\" Her raised voice was to be expected, but far more terrifying was the burning, evil gaze of the classroom on the two lovers. Ichika wasn't quite sure why everyone was being so unusually hostile today. Everyone was normally so kind, he thought he'd finally settled in to this all girl's school. He couldn\u2019t think of anything bad he\u2019d done lately to earn such glares.<br>\r\nCecilia was wondering if the academy did bigger desks. Everything was too small for her after their weekend date. Clothes, her shower cubicle, chairs, meals, even some doorways. She felt almost like a giant in a dolls house, except the main problem was her width, not her height. She scratched at her gurgling tummy with a frown. She'd barely had breakfast! If this kept up, she'd have to be eating 24/7 to keep her body content! Still, she knew Ichika would stay by her even then. This massive maiden was definitely in love. Every thought lead back to Ichika.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening, Cecilia reclined on her bed. Though she was wearing an \"oversized\" t-shirt that clung to her belly like a second skin, and spats that hugged her butt ever so tightly, no exercise was taking place. Oh yes, she had planned it, squeezing into her clothes and awaiting Ichika's arrival at her room, but when he got there they somehow ended up completely forgetting why he was there. They were honeyed lovers, so drunk on their new love that they could barely think of anything else. And so, Ichika fetched expensive sweets from her various cupboards as the weighty woman rested upon her bed. He wasn't entirely at ease in a girl's room, but it wasn't like it was his very first time here. He placed a large box of cookies on her lap as she sat up against the plush headboard of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Ichika, so kind as always~\" With her elegant hands, Cecilia wasted little time in opening the cookies. Quickly ferried to her lips, she took little nibbles as she spoke to Ichika, chubby, pinchable cheeks wobbling slightly as she chewed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmf, Ichika, don't you think everybody in class was acting, mm, a little odd today?\" Leaning forward in his chair next to the frilly bed, Ichika clasped one of Cecilia\u2019s pudgy hands in his, looking into her eyes with a serious expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, they were acting a little upset... Cecilia, if anybody tries to bully you, please tell me straight away!\" The slightest blush coloured her chewing cheeks before she swallowed her little mouthful of crumbly goodness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmph~ I can look after myself... But thank you for the concern, my shining prince~\" Taut spats groaned as the large, lounging lady leaned over to kiss Ichika on the cheek. Her tummy, once a perfect orb of fat, was now bunching up into soft, blubbery rolls. Neither of them were quite used to such affection yet, blushing and fidgeting awkwardly, but Cecilia was nothing if not passionate. Reclining back on her bed, an empty box of cookies fell to the floor as she smacked her red lips, moving her palm around and investigating the new landscape of her engorged belly. Recently, she hardly ever seemed to recognise that this belly was supposed to be a burdensome thing that would make her unattractive to men. It was a soft, enormous pillow, a part of her beautiful body that felt good when she ate, felt good when she tenderly touched the endless expanse of flesh. The exercise regime that brought them together was becoming a thing of the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ichika~? I do believe there were some delicious cupcakes under my desk... Would you be a dear and fetch them for us to share?\" Ichika was only too glad to oblige, but he had no plans of depriving Cecilia of even a single bite.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chifuyu gave an exasperated sigh. She knew something was going on between her brother and Cecilia; how could she not? You\u2019d have to be both blind and deaf in order to not see just how hopelessly in love they were with each other. And this was precisely the reason why the IS instructor desired to speak with her only sibling. Of course, being one of his teachers, it was easy to find a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIchika, don\u2019t leave yet. I need to speak with you,\u201d the raven-haired beauty said, folding her arms under her well-endowed chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchika looked up, surprised. It was the end of class, and he had been planning on leaving to go meet with Cecilia in a bit. But now his sister wanted to talk to him for some reason, and in the young man\u2019s experiences, anytime spent with Chifuyu talking privately with him usually led to disaster. It also usually tended to last a while, and Ichika only had a half hour before he was supposed to meet with his new girlfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving his own sigh, Ichika got up from his desk and walked over to his waiting sister. At least everyone else had left class by now. As usual, Chifuyu was giving him one of her customary glares, which Ichika thought was mostly out of habit nowadays. Still didn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t intimidated by them, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Orimura-sensei, what did you want to talk to me about?\u201d the young man asked, dreading the impending conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearing her throat, Chifuyu decided to dive right in. \u201cI see Cecilia is now your girlfriend, hm, Ichika?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yeah. And\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou do realize you\u2019ve been attracting a certain type of\u2026 <i>attention</i> dating her, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchika had a feeling he knew where this conversation was headed, but he hoped against hope he was wrong. Gaining a steely resolve, he tried to put on his own intimidating expression as he answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve noticed we\u2019ve gotten some attention. What of it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIchika, I\u2019m gonna say this once, so you\u2019d better pay attention. I\u2019m going to suggest you break off this relationship you\u2019re starting with Cecilia, before it\u2019s too late.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToo late for what?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToo late for your reputation to be rebuilt! Seriously, Ichika, do I need to spell this out for you? Cecilia\u2019s a massive glutton, and she\u2019s only getting bigger and bigger as time goes on. She\u2019ll be practically immobilized by the end of this year! Do you honestly think she\u2019s the one for you, when there are so many other, much worthier, girls around?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchika seriously couldn\u2019t believe what he was hearing. How could his sister have seriously just said that? Even for Chifuyu, that was needlessly cruel! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChifuyu-nee, how can you say that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can say it because I know that if I don\u2019t, you\u2019ll stay right on this self-destructive path. Really, tell me, Ichika, what do you even see in that girl that a fitter girl can\u2019t give you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchika, despite his incredible shock, was able to answer <i>this</i> question immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou need to ask that? Well, I love lots of things about Cecilia! For one thing, she\u2019s the kindest girl I know: her shy, cute demeanor, and her sensitivity make her perfect for listening to my problems! I feel comfortable around her, like I can just open up and she\u2019ll be able to understand me! She\u2019s determined and has a thick skin, not letting the words of others bring her down.\u201d Here, Ichika gave Chifuyu a pointed look. \u201cAnd really, you mention her being fat as a <i>negative</i> trait? Well, I for one, love it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChifuyu raised a disbelieving eyebrow at this, prompting Ichika to go on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, what\u2019s there not to love? She\u2019s soft, large, likes to sleep on me\u2026 really, her being big is an amazing trait of hers! There\u2019s just something about her body, and how plush, yet so huge it is, that just makes me extremely attracted to her, on top of her amazing personality. Really, if you can\u2019t understand why I love a girl like that, then this conversation is over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Ichika immediately stormed out of the room, leaving a dumbfounded Chifuyu in his wake. Watching her brother go, the raven-haired instructor realized her mouth was open, and promptly shut it. Maybe she hadn\u2019t handled that all too well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat both failed to realize (Ichika because of his anger, and Chifuyu because she was out of sight), was that someone had been eavesdropping on their conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis someone was\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One of the most important things to do in the morning, and Charlotte let it completely fly past her radar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, this was hardly the time to take notice, class was just about to start. So unless the French beauty spontaneously gained time manipulation powers, she couldn't go and get anything. Which meant a couple of hours of having to sit through class with a stomach that'd probably give her no end of begging for some sustenance. Joy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Charlotte\u2019s fears were eased somewhat when she saw Ichika Orimura, the only male IS Pilot in the entire academy, walk into class. He truly was a knockout, the type of guy pretty much any girl could drool over. The brunette had a thin, firm build that showed he was most definitely in-shape, the perfect person to be piloting an IS. His face was the definition of handsome, very angular with almond eyes that exuded an unparalled warmth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe excitement quickly turned to embarrassment, though, as a rather loud gurgle escaped Charlotte\u2019s stomach, causing her face to immediately become as red as a tomato. She clutched it immediately, and felt she could die on the spot when Ichika looked over at the blonde with a puzzled expression on his face. When he began walking over, Charlotte just wanted to disappear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Char, how\u2019re you doing?\u201d he asked amicably, a smile appearing on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, me? I-I am doing\u2026fine,\u201d Charlotte said, bringing her eyes up to meet her crush\u2019s. Damn, they really did help to put her at ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright. It\u2019s just, sorry if it sounds rude, but I heard your stomach growl just now.\u201d Ichika  scratched the back of his head. \u201cDid you miss breakfast?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMm-hm.\u201d Charlotte fidgeted a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you wanna stop by the cafeteria after class and grab a quick bite to eat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Charlotte looked up at the brunette, honestly not expecting this news. \u201cYou\u2019d really go owith me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course! Why wouldn\u2019t I? You\u2019re my friend, after all, I don\u2019t like hearing that you have an empty stomach.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte let out an involuntary sigh. Friend. As much as she loved Ichika, it was hard to deny that sometimes he could be a little thick. The fact he hadn\u2019t been able to ever pick up on her romantic emotions, not to mention those of Houki, Rin, Cecilia, and Laura did make things a bit annoying at times. But the French girl supposed that was part of the reason she liked him so much: his na\u00efve innocence that most other men his age lacked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Ichika,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019d love to go with you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat! I\u2019ve heard they\u2019ve got a great menu going today, apparently it\u2019s\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuiet down and get to your seats, everyone!\u201d Chifuyu Orimura\u2019s boomed through the room as she made her entrance, glaring at the entirety of the students. \u201cWhoever doesn\u2019t get to their seat within the next 5 seconds will have to run 5 laps around the school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d Ichika yelped as he immediately made a bee-line for his desk. Once he got there, he looked back at Charlotte, a warm smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte clasped her hands on her lap and looked down at them with a fierce intensity, her heart threatening to burst out of her chest with all its pounding. Why did he have to be so blind to how she felt? Then another gurgle sounded from her belly, and she almost planted her face right on her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass had gone simply enough. There were several more gurgles, and while a few other students looked at the blonde with annoyed expressions, most were polite enough not to make a big scene. She did get a terse talking-to at the end by Ms. Orimura, and that was annoying. Charlotte was tempted to tell the raven-haired instructor that it was just a simple mistake, but she knew she couldn't start up some sort of argument with her. So, all she did was nod and confirm it'd never happen again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut really, who cared about all that? As Charlotte made her way through the halls of the academy, only two thoughts were on her mind: how to spend the best time with Ichika she could in a cafeteria environment, and what type of food she should order now that it was lunch. While Ichika did have priority, as the smells of the cafeteria drew closer, the French IS Pilot couldn't help but place a hand on her rumbling tummy as she licked her lips. It seemed like there was going to be a ton of stuff to choose from!</span></div></div>",

As one of the most gifted of IS pilots, no one would be wise to cross the likes of Orimura Chifuyu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Afraid of the health problems that go with being waaaay too skinny?</i>\" The camera panned to something like the 90s where a women was in the bathroom, head in the toilet and more or likely heaving. Then another one with a dark haired woman, also too skinny, over exaggerating on a heart attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They need to pay for real actors nowadays,\" said Chifuyu as she rolled her eyes. This commercial was just silly, but silly enough to make her continue watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe commerical's camera now changed to a real one, and an orange haired woman with a plump but rather attractive physique appeared. Her breasts seemed to be as big as Maya's, if not bigger, with a nice set of birthing hips and a slight and soft tummy. She was donning nothering but a sports bra and spats, causing Chifuyu to raise her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hi, my name is Angelina Frost, and I am supporting the new diet to healthy beauty. I am aiming to change the old conventions of tomorrow where beauty is skinny. Now, beauty is healthiness!</i>\" As if to emphasive her claim she gave a movemtn, causing her breasts to bounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"In addition, I am hosting a plus size modeling contest in which any girl over the age of 16 and over one hundred and thirty pounds may enter! The winner walks away with a grand prize of 100,000 US dollars!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's quite a bit of money nowadays, especially when that is converted to yen...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"We are hosting auditions, but only 8 will make it!

She couldn't even go to the event due to teaching duties and she may have agreed with Frost's idea, she may not-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a growl from her stomach.

It was just food; she could never remember getting so out of control over such a mundane thing. It\u2019s not like there was some prize to be won, some completion to prove her pride. She had eaten a meal that could\u2019ve fed an entire family out of her own volition<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n\u201cGah\u2026 well, I guess this could be considered a first world problem, huh?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bloated beauty smirked to herself, making her way carefully over to her room. She was going to definitely stay in her bed for at least the next several hours, potential emergencies be damned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she made it, she immediately collapsed onto the mattress with a heavy sigh. She belched loudly, and sighed in contentment. Her stomach hurt like hell, who cares if it might be considered gross? It helped to ease the pain, and that was all that mattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, if I keep on indulging in this type of diet, my figure\u2019ll be ruined completely,\u201d Chifuyu mused to herself. \u201cThen again, that food was delicious. Heh, I guess I can see why *urp* obesity is such a problem now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that her thoughts flashed back to that ad she saw earlier. The one with those women saying how they were proud to be fat and loved their bodies, and didn\u2019t care about diets and conventional images of beauty. Now, Chifuyu definitely hadn\u2019t been any sort of fat acceptance advocate in the past: she used to think that if you were fat, it meant you were lazy, and any other reasons were just excuses not to get in shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the present, however, she couldn\u2019t help but have a weird idea pop into her head that had never been there before. What if she got fat? What if she weighed over 200 pounds and never had to worry about dieting ever again? What if she even participated in that stupid plus-size modelling contest?  It was an idea that flashed through her mind in an instant, completely unbeckoned, and one that she immediately shook her head at in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is wrong with me tonight? Am I insane?\u201d she asked herself in an exasperated fashion. \u201cI\u2019m so fit and beautiful! Fat is gross, I don\u2019t care what some women say! Like I\u2019ve *urp* said before, it\u2019s just an excuse to be pigs, nothing more. Nnngh\u2026 maybe my mind\u2019ll be clearer if I get a bit of *yawn* shuteye\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she began to uneasily drift off into sleep, that stupid thought lingering around the whole time, until she finally went into blissful slumber.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One could definitely say that the beautiful IS pilot was certainly not a morning person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t help that her stomach felt a little weird from the previous night\u2019s binge. When Chifuyu looked down, she was glad to see that there weren\u2019t any visible after-effects from her huge dinner, but decided that maybe it\u2019d be a good idea to hit the track to burn off those extra calories, just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Or should I\u2026?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChifuyu shook her head once again in shock. That was the second time that stupid thought had entered her mind, and she couldn\u2019t just go back to sleep again to get rid of it, having just woken up and all. She sighed in dejection, trying with all her might to forget about it.

If anything, she seemed to be in a much better mood than she was usually. But an even bigger area of focus than that was her figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had an overall apple shape to her, her stomach round and soft, jiggling with any extended movement of her body. It was big and pillowy, with large, perky breasts the size of melons resting on top Chifuyu\u2019s stomach was perfectly round, not split into a double-tiered form, and it peaked out of the openings between the buttons of her straining shirt, white to offset the black. Her legs were thick, her thighs were huge, as well as her arms and face being softer. She was still dressed in her usual attire, just much larger. Same good ol\u2019 business suit and tie. If she had to guess, Chifuyu would probably say that she was about 280 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was surreal, to say the least. She never could\u2019ve even fathomed herself looking like that before, yet this was going on in her own imagination. How was this possible? She used to always think fat would make her disgusting, yet this version of her, despite certainly being less intimidating, made her actually become tempted by the idea of giving up dieting forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more she thought about it, the less crazy it seemed to her. Would it be strange? Hell yes. Would it be enjoyable? Very likely. Those models in the TV ad certainly seemed to enjoy their sizes, so why shouldn\u2019t she feel secure? Who was she trying to impress, anyways? It\u2019s not like she had a boyfriend or any close friends that would hate the idea of having someone obese near them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChifuyu made her decision. She was going to gain weight on purpose. Popular opinion could go to hell, she was going to do what made her happy.<br>\r\nIt was then she heard the doorbell ring, rudely interrupting her triumphant reflections.

She hated casual visits at such an inconvenient time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I just decided to pop you a visit!

You would not believe the awesome breakfast they\u2019re serving now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis peaked Chifuyu\u2019s interest.

That really did sound like the perfect breakfast, one she could certainly get behind!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, thank you, Ichika!\u201d Chifuyu exclaimed, taking her brother\u2019s hands in her own and shaking them excitedly. \u201cThat sounds wonderful! Let\u2019s go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she practically dragged her brother down the hall towards the cafeteria, eagerly awaiting her meal.<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUuuuurrrp!

He had never seen her eat with such a gluttonous craze, shoveling entire handfuls of food into her mouth, making it splatter all over the place, and not even bothering with her utensils at times. She just ate so fast,there were moments where he wondered if she could even breathe!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIchika, have I told you yet how grateful I *urp* am that you brought me to breakfast today?\u201d the IS instructor asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t really think words are needed here\u2026\u201d Ichika responded, eyeing his sister\u2019s tight as a drum belly.

What really sucked about that was it counted for 20% of his grade! Granted, he knew quite a lot of IS knowledge by this point, but there were still a few areas where he was sketchy, to say the least. It would\u2019ve been nice if he could\u2019ve  made some time in his schedule, but his friends always had somewhere to go or see, leaving him too tired to crack open the books. The male IS pilot loved his friends, of course, but sometimes they could be a little overbearing. It was almost as if they were in a competition or something\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, class, settle down!\u201d Chifuyu Orimura\u2019s voice could be heard as she entered the room, silencing the typical chatter and gossip that always sprung up in homeroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that\u2019s when the woman herself walked in. Even though Ichika had already seen her several times, it was still hard to believe that she was the real deal. He felt like someone else had somehow taken his sister\u2019s place or something, because he hadn\u2019t known that she had the potential to get so\u2026so\u2026 big!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChifuyu Orimura had gained so much weight, the last time Ichika had heard, she was 280 pounds. One may wonder how exactly Ichika came upon this information. Well, it wasn\u2019t exactly hard when your older sister was constantly proclaiming it as if it were some great feat (which Ichika admitted it probably was, but not in the way she was probably thinking\u2026).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChifuyu, for her part, was happy as could be. The image she had of herself at this weight had actually come true; she basically looked exactly as she pictured herself looking. Honestly, it was quite refreshing; she no longer felt any need to diet and remain \u201cbeautiful\u201d. She found confidence in her bigger body easily, no trouble at all. Honestly, she was surprised more women didn\u2019t take the path she had relatively recently chosen for herself. To think, there were people that worried about the troubles of dieting until the day they died!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then she scanned the room and took in the physiques of all the girls before her. Stick-thin, with hardly any meat on their bones. This also went for Houki, Charlotte, Cecilia, Rin, and Laura. And those five each wanted to be Ichika\u2019s girlfriend. Yet they were so thin\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told, Chifuyu had a well-hidden soft spot for her brother, and she certainly wanted what was best for him. And due to her recent appreciation of the fat female form, she realized that she maybe didn\u2019t want him to hook up with someone made of skin and bones. She wanted him to hook up with someone fat and happy, not having to worry about a woman complaining all the time about diets or how her clothes didn\u2019t fit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what was a big sister to do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was a rotund women weighing 297 lbs. sported a large gut with an equally large cleavage to match. Both her limbs and face were plump which complimented her red eyes and long brown hair all wrapped up in a waitresses outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to Debushi's, my name is Lana and I will be your waitress for tonight.\" She stated looking at her customer and instantly recognizing her face. \"My, my aren't you Chifuyu Orimura one of the greatest IS fighters of all time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What of it?\" Chifuyu asked sounding like she was talking to another crazed fan girl<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, I'm just wondering why a famous person like you is doing in a \"little\" scrounged up place like this.\" Lana replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just came her to see what the food is like.\" Chifuyu said. \u201cCouldn\u2019t find this place on the yellow pages either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t advertise that much and we prefer to put the money towards our food and making this place look and smell decent.\u201d Lana stated. \u201cAnyway are you ready to order?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes I am.\u201d Chifuyu replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood so what will it be this evening?\u201d Lana said while getting her pen and mini notebook out.</span></div></div>",

Another couple were slurping up spaghetti ravenously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'At least I won't eat like that,' thought Chifuyu as she rolled her eyes and sipped some of her water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chef's special here!\" Chirped Lana as she rolled a tray to Chifuyu's table.

It contained four beef patties, three types of cheese, a wide variety of vegetables, bacon, all topped with ketchup and mustard on two sesame seed buns. Plus the large basket of fries didn't make the dish any less intimidating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the heck am I suppose to eat this?\" Chifuyu asked herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen all of sudden surge of hunger swooped over her like a rising storm. She instantly felt she hasn't eaten in weeks and started chowing down on the burger. The beef patties were well done with each bite bursting with flavor and was complimented by crisp bacon which added a nice crunch to it. The vegetables added a their own unique flavors to the meal, fresh juices that came from elevated the burger. Plus the sweetness from the ketchup and zest from the mustard brought the entire burger full circle with its flavor and what made it so irresistible. But while Chifuyu was munching on the burger she hardly noticed that her stomach was slowly beginning to press against her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, my I've never seen the drug kick in that fast before.\" Lana said to herself while she watched Chifuyu eat. \"Not to mention down an ultimeatum like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to Chifuyu, the water she drank contain a special drug that increases one's appetite giving the impression of never feeling full. Also when the drug is introduced to empty calories (which is in all of the food at Debushi's), they combine and form super empty calories which make people even fatter and hungrier. As Lana watched Chifuyu take a break from the burger and started to eat the fries she couldn't help but chuckled a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think this little lady maybe just what were looking for.\" Lana stated while grinning.</span></div></div>",

She was surprised to hear another hungry growl from her normally quiet bowels. \"Oh my, I'm still hungry?\" she thinks to herself, placing a hand on her belly. Truth be told the sudden talkative nature of her stomach was rather worrying to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what should I do?\" she thinks.
