Your Mom has tried several different types of cloth but though at least they hold up well enough now that you don't lacerate your mattress every night you change the sheets are another matter. Maybe you'd be better on the floor?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling out of the torn scraps you stumble to the window and peek out between the blinds. It's a bright morning, sunny and cheerful, but you don't feel like it. More and more you have to hide now. Who knows what people would do if they knew your dad was a dragon? I mean, if they even believed that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing you concentrated and with the familiar cracking and popping sounds your body shifts and shrinks slightly, becoming pinker and softer, till finally you look like a normal, American kid. Yeah, normal! Right! You wish you really could be normal. Heck you can fly and yet you can't risk taking wing for fear of what someone might do to you!

Collapsing to the ground, gasping and shaking you try to throw up, but even that fails you, you just dry heaving a few times. It takes quite a few minutes before the disorientation fades and you lift yourself to your knees. You still seem to be in human form, so you didn't shift back instinctively. Through the fading pain you take kind of a weak sort of pride in that.

If that disk of fuzz beneath your feet weren't there you'd begin to think you were insane... well, it still is insane, just... your more sure your memory is real. As you stare around yourself you start to shiver, despite the heat. Shock is beginning to set in maybe. What in hell just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H... hello?\" you say, hoping this is all just an illusion or something, but the sound doesn't sound like it's indoors, your voice sounds just right for... a deserted desert. You've teleported? What, to the Sahara or something? Death Valley? Who knows. Is this something to do with your Draconic ancestry somehow? You never really met your dad and mom doesn't say much about him either. Maybe Dragons naturally can teleport and you just never knew it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking you peer around and see nothing but sand dunes in all directions, the sun glaring hard from the... well, either east or west you guess. It's either rising or setting. Wait, over there near the sun, on the horizon is a strand of smoke... several strands. Civilization! You manage a weak smile and try to quell your nervous shivering as you start walking off... wait. Why don't you... fly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've never been able to, never wanting to risk someone seeing you, but here there's no-one. You'd have to land near that... settlement? Whatever it is, and turn back into a human again before you approach, but other than that... heck it could be fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you go to strip to change is when you realize you can't do that... as you hadn't gotten dressed before the teleportation! Oh god, your stuck naked in the desert! Still, better scales than skin out here. Another sickening series of pops, creaking and stretching noises follows as you scale out once more. It takes maybe half a minute for you to do it either way. You have no clue whether it's possible to do it quicker or not, but it's always been like that... just more recently you've seemed to prefer switching to dragon form in your sleep now... and you seem to feel awkward as a human more recently too. A little anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stretch your wings wide and sigh. The desert feels good like this, warming your blood, making you faster as it sinks into your bones. Yeah, you've liked to sit in your room on hot days with the AC off, scaled out for hours sometimes. Heck, you even seem to think faster like that, though cold does seem to slow your thinking way down as a dragon. Weird. Maybe you should have done more research on biology about all this stuff, if there is anything on dragons.... Nah! That'd be too much like work!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPracticing a few beats of your huge wings you crouch down on all fours, feeling the muscles clench on your back hard, sand blowing around as wind from your wing beats whirls around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, you can do this. Just 'use the force Luke'... or something.</span></div></div>",

It's harder than you thought and you can feel yourself straining to get up into the sky, but you're doing it! Glancing down you see the patch of carpet, already half covered in drifting sand, dwindling beneath you. You shudder a bit in flight, but steady up carefully, still beating hard. If you were human you'd be sweating buckets by now, but the heat seems to help... um, can a dragon get heat stroke? Hot sun and lots of exertion might not be a good idea... well, too late to turn back now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slow the beats, nose down and head towards the distant smoke trails. From up here you can see white bulges in the distance, between some rocky outcroppings over there. Buildings? It's not a huge city certainly, but something. After some practice you manage to glide for a bit, just flapping every now and then to keep altitude, and you can feel your exertion diminishing. This is a little easier!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next hour the 'buildings' get nearer and you can start to make out details. It looks like a huge white dome thingy in the middle, then lots of white and brown buildings nearby. Vaguely reminds you of that Indian monument... what's it called? Taj-something or other. You never were good on geography. The whole place looks crowded, a largish town maybe, but simple somehow. It looks middle eastern in style, mud buildings? Well not very hi-tech anyway. As you get nearer thoughts of terrorists and ground to air missiles make you wary and you sweep in for a somewhat rough landing among dunes maybe an hours walk from the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, any landing you walk away from huh?\" you say, brushing sand from your scales before you scale in again, turning human once more. after a minute to catch your breath you set off.</span></div></div>",

The wall looks impressive, with a large gatehouse with roadways leading off in several directions. There is even a cart out there right now. Maybe you can sneak on board one and and ask nicely if someone has clothes you can borrow? OK, Middle East. Meaning, how do you speak the language? Oh this could be a pain to ge....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Crash* *Snap!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAHHHHH!\" you scream as you fall into a hole in the ground, your weight cracking some sort of wooden platform under the sand. Plummeting down a stone lined chasm you hit stone and rotten wooden walls repeatedly, careening from wall to wall, and sometimes through them. Sand is everywhere and you slide with it, almost passing out at one point as you slam through a sturdy wooden door, splinters everywhere!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a scream and a  crunch you hit a stone pillar and come to a sickening halt, your head throbbing. At least you know you'll heal well! That's one thing about your Draconic heritage that you learned the hard way from bullies at school. Even scaled out you weren't that strong... OK, you were seven years old at the time, but still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M'sesh lenra?\" comes a sweet voice, cutting through your headache. It's only after you turn your head that you realize the tone was rather agressive. An olive skinned woman in an ornate grey robe stands before you, glaring angrily at you, a necklace with a red gem hung around her neck which she fingers idly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I... I don't understand you.\" you stammer, trying to cover your nakedness as you simultaneously shimmy your butt backwards against the pillar. This girl looks pissed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes slit as she listens to you, then she sighs and turns abruptly, striding powerfully over to the far wall where a desk sits. She unfurls scrolls (yes, actual scrolls on those rod things!) and seems to be reading them. She then turns and grasps the gem around her neck and stares at you. The gem glows and sand swirls around you... then streams into your nose!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp and thrash at your face, but the stream carries on for several seconds and your headache gets much worse, tickling, scouring sensations spiral in your nose and forhead then you gasp and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*ACHOOO!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sand bursts from you in a huge sneeze, leaving you gasping on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bless you!\" the girl says... in English? No, that wasn't English, but you understood her! \"Now, answer my question; How did you find my inner sanctum? Did Aladdin tell you how to get in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aladdin? Wait...

HER?\" there was definitely venom in that last word!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean Princess Jasmine?\" then you mutter to yourself \"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Oh this is too weird!</font> Look, I didn't come from him, don't even know where in the story I am...

And besides you never did see why Aladdin and Jasmine were together. They are just so different throughout the show. Sure Sadira is a little... eccentric, but mainly she's just looking out for herself. How old was she on the show anyway? This version looks about seventeen, or maybe eighteen. Could you really side with her and offer to help get Aladdin away from Jasmine? Hmm.. Oh hell, why not?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Sadira, I... um... I'm not what I appear to be.

Tail snakes out behind you, your skin turns green, wings unfurl on your back, your neck lengthens and your talons emerge. She stares at your face as it undergoes it's own transformation, snout lengthening a bit, jaw widening, ears migrating up ontop of your head and getting all pointy.

This might take a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took most of an hour, not to tell her who and where you came from, but to work out WHEN you were in the story. Talking about Mozenrath, Mechanicles and all the other villains to see who she'd heard of. Not that she'd heard of most of them as it happens. You guess the normal girl in the street doesn't know what is going on, just rumors... and that a building just exploded from magic overload (or whatever happened that particular episode). She had for some reason heard of Abis Mal. You never really saw how that guy did ANYTHING. All he did was mess up, continuously!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think this is before Mozenrath in the story, possibly before Mirage too.\" You say after a long description from Sadira about some giant mechanical bug that attacked last month made you sure at least Mechanicles had been here. \"Not really sure about the rest, other than Jafar of course. He was in the two movies that led up to the series. Right now he's sealed in his lamp under the sand, and good riddance! Oh, right later on Abis Mal releases him in the third movie. Lamp gets destroyed and he goes fizzle. End of story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadira sighs shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You certainly are strange Grant. But what you know of our world, past and future apparently, makes me think you are what you say you are.\" she peers at you for a few seconds. \"Alright, dragonman, you can join me. I take it you know what I'm after?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling you nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, Aladdin. You know though attacking them directly isn't going to work. Didn't before.... Um, one thing I should stress. Just me being here is going to change things. Chaos theory and all. Butterfly and hurricanes, etc.\" Sadira looks strangely at you. \"It's... too complicated to explain, \" because you haven't a clue about the math, \"but basically tiny changes can make huge changes over time... or none at all. It's very difficult to tell. Back where I come from we predict the weather up to a week ahead, if the sims work. Basically they make a... um, how do I explain a computer simulation... kind of a... an illusion run through? That's close I guess. Anyway, they run through what the weather should be like based on records of what the weather is like now. If they change tiny bits of the information on the current weather and put that into the sim and with those tiny differences all the sims end up the same... then they know they can predict the weather. If they all end up different then they can't predict it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a magical law of... chaos? Hmm, I don't remember any of that in the scrolls. Maybe the sand witches don't know about it? He he, be nice to be the first to know about something for a change! OK. So your knowledge might be wrong?\" you nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But somethings that happen are based on things that have already happened...\" you say, trying to make sure you ARE useful to her, \"if you see what I mean. Like Jafar. Aladdin cast him into the cave of wonders a while back, so the fact that he'll be there to be discovered later is fact. Me being here won't change that, though Abis Mal, or someone else, could get him out earlier or later. He's just too evil and powerful, I'd say stay away from him at all costs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said he was a genie?\" Sadira said, greed shining in her eyes. \"Surely he has to do what you say, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was a Grand Vizier, sorcerer and collected vast amounts of magical and other knowledge from around the world. Somehow I think he'd manage to trick us, or pretty much anyone, into wishing what HE wanted. It's way too dangerous! That guy would find a way to do you in, no question!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, OK! I get it.*Sigh* Well what do you think would get me Aladdin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, tricky. The whole aim of the show is how wonderful he and Jasmine are together. Never saw it myself, but they do love each other. He isn't going to fall for you as long as she's there to take him back, or as long as he knows. One time you try to change reality to where you are the princess and Jasmine is a street rat. Didn't work of course. Hmm.....\" you ponder, what on Earth could ever work?</span></div></div>",

Make them argue and fight etc. Hmm, tricky though. They pretty much always kiss and make up after a fight... it'd have to be something big... they don't see eye to eye on everything, street rat and princess after all!\" You chuckle and Sadira smiles back \"But, to find something that would REALLY split them up? Hard...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drum fingers on the table, pondering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think... maybe their friends? If there starts to be problems, serious problems, between Abu and Raja, they'd pick sides. It'd have to be something they couldn't settle though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Sadira sit on some appropriated chairs by a stone altar as you ponder the situation. For hours you dicker back and forth, both you and she putting forward ideas, and often rejecting them. It all keeps coming back to their friends though and finally you come up with a possible way to pit Abu and Raja against each other. First manage to get Abu interested in some trinket in Aladdin's and Jasmine's many trips to the market. Make sure Abu doesn't get it for some reason and that Jasmine doesn't see it. After that get the item, then offer it to Jasmine as a gift for her pet. After that things get a little iffy. Sadira says she can use magic to whisper thoughts in their heads at night, but it must be simple. She wants Aladdin and Jasmine to both feel the item should belong to THEIR pet... you feel you should affect Abu and Raja directly, making them start to fight amongst themselves for it.</span></div></div>",

I still think a simple Sand-whisper to Aladdin and jasmine would do the trick. All of this elaborate... stuff. There is too much to go wrong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crick your back and stretch. It's been a long night of planning, and you haven't been able to resist staring at Sadira on occasion. He has a very hot bod!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... guess. Look, going after the two main chars never works! I've told you, you tried various different versions of that before and nothing ever worked, but if it was something permanent with their pets. That could do it! OK, OK, maybe this is a little over complex. Maybe we can simplify a bit. Maybe my plan with your technique?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadira slits her eyes, looking at you intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This compromise, would it be just your plan described differently?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sadira! How could you think that of me!\" you say, cursing that you'd been that obvious. I mean, everything you said was true. Her ideas hadn't worked too well before had they? \"Look, maybe your Sand-whisper can get Abu to try to steal something, something it's obvious he can't get, then we use the Sand-whisper on Raja... or maybe on Jasmine to want it for Raja?\" You ponder. \"No, too risky. Like I said, you've done things like that before and it backfires. Stick with the animals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadira crosses her arms and frowns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This sounds idiotic! Casting magic on lowly animals?\" She grimaces. \"Though they do set strong store by their pets...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's coming around to your idea!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure it'll work Sadira. Come on, at least let us try it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. We will try it your way Grant. Next time will be MY way. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin and nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, first try to find something that Abu wants at the market and we'll go from there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From what I can tell from the shifting sands,\" Sadira says, holding the Sand Gem up, \"They are at the market now. Including that little monkey of Aladdin's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding you motion for Sadira to head on up. She sighs and opens the exit and strides through it, you following on behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou in human form (and borrowing some clothes from Sadira), and her carrying the gem and some scrolls, head out through the secret exit towards the Agrobah market. Soon Aladdin and Jasmine will have more to worry about!</span></div></div>",
