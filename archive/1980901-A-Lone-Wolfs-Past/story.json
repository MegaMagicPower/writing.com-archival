Many were excited for the birth of Aphla Wolf Pack Leader Absolem and his wife Tsubaki, who was a half-breed of a rare wolf and echinda. A large crowd of mobians around the small shack in the middle of village as the cries of Tsubaki rang through the night as the full moon began to rise and several other wolves were lighting the pathway torches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the moon hung in the air, Tsubaki's cries started to become silent as she held a black wolf pup in her arms as she fed him. Absolem knew as he looked at his child and felt something about him, but remained silent and by his wife's side and looking at him as he comforted his wife...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Three and a half years later...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki was sprinting with her child in her arms, running away from the villiage in flames and from the cries of war, hate, and fallen warriors and didn't look back as she escaped from death and fled towards a small local village outside of border of Chun-cun where she was pursued by rival wolves and hid inside an old convent that seemed abandoned, losing her pursuers, but also having her make a tough choice to save her only child... Tsubaki took a small woven basket and a dark robe from the covent, placing her sleeping pup gently inside, and quickly dashed through the silent streets as her pursuers looked for her, but dropped off the basket on the doorstep of an old red fox and sprinted away from Chun-cun, drawing the rival wolves away from the village to make one final stand..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy name is Hyperion the Wolf, but many know me as Hypon. I am a Night-Blood Wolf and this is my story...</span></div></div>",

He was tired from the night before and from the brusies that were on his skin after spending the night in a jail cell in the Central City Police Department after being caught after a mission turned sideways and Scourage, the leader of the Anti-Freedom Fighters, ditched him to fend for himself after he was stopped by the spirit of his mother, Tsubaki, to take a shot at a GUN agent that was investing them. Hypon didn't move or flinch as he waited for the interagation to begin as he was transported to the GUN main facility in Downtown Central City from the Police Department with a sack over his head and beaten with nightsticks as he was transported to the van.

Agent Topaz wasn't known to hold a grudge, but if someone tried to kill her; she took it personally. The other was a white bat known as Rouge, who was shorter than the human agent, but looked at Hypon with more curiousity than hate for his reaction to being brought to the main HQ. She noticed that he did not retaliate to the beatings and was very quiet on the ride over. However, Topaz broke the silence. \"I don't like this one bit, Rouge. The Commander wants us to talk to this criminal just because he has certain talents.\" Rouge then responded to her partner's remark and looked at her, \"You didn't say that when we first met, Topaz.\" Topaz then countered, \"You didn't try to kill me.\" Rouge then tried to reason with Topaz, \"If the commander sees something special in him, then maybe we should give him the benefit of the doubt and see if we can get this wolf to tell us what he knows.\" Topaz just sighed and looked at Rouge, \"Then you go and interrogate him, Rouge. I don't believe I can be professional if I go in there.\"</span></div></div>",

She looked at Hypon for a moment before she sat across from him, opening up what looked like Hypon's file. \"Been a naughty troublemaker haven't you? Working for the Anti Freedom Fighters, not the smartest idea you ever had. Doing crimes all over Mobus, hurting a lot of citizens. A record like this, and you would land in jail for a very long time in any decent government agency.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon looked down, waiting for the words that would put him away. However, he looked up to find the bat smiling, before she slid a paper to his side of the table. \" However, GUN is a bit more particular when someone with your... let's just say skills is in a uncomfortable position. This is a paper that swears you will give up all criminal connections with AFF in order to work for us. That means no contact with old friends, no bad behavior, 24 hour watches with guard details, an ankle monitor with GPS and we will let you stay on the other side of the bars. Break any of our rules and you will be tossed in a cell faster than you can say 'I'm sorry'. So what do you say? I can have you in another transport in three minutes for prison if you want?\" The white bat pulled out her phone and hovered her button over the talk button.</span></div></div>",

GUN required a clear head and the tactical skill to lead and protect, along with being able to defend one's self from danger of missions. This was not seen easily in Hypon and Rouge bluntly thought that he would last perhaps a couple of weeks before he cracked and they either locked him up or he would go crazy and \"accidentally\" be dropped in an insane asylum.

Hypon just moved his fingers, slightly worried of his past record, since he did work with the Anti-Freedom Fighters, but was also responsible for putting Scourge the Hedgehog behind bars once as well as Fiona the Fox. Nevertheless, Hypon felt like that he had a decent record that he should be able to land him a decent rank and job as a part of this new squad <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and Hypon quickly stood up, noticing it was the secretary, an older female bunny. Hypon was about to sit down, but the bunny then spoke, \"Sally wants you to go to the training center, someone will meet you there.\" Hypon was going to ask why, but he nodded and walked out of the office and saw the sign that pointed to the Training Center and walked towards the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>At the Training Center</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hypon walked into the training center, he noticed that it was a small facility, but it had enough equipment to train many. But as Hypon entered the facility, a purple chameleon walked up to him and spoke, \"So, you're the new blood?\" Hypon then replied, \"You could say that, my name is Hypon.\" The chameleon smirked and said as he lead Hypon to the east part of the room, \"Espio. Has Sally told you what we are about to do?\" Hypon answered, \"No, I didn't even make it into her office and I have no clue about why I was brought in here.\" Espio then shook his head and spoke, \"I better explain then, this is a fear simulation and will test you mentally and physically.\" Hypon was silent for a moment and wasn't frightened,  but he was worried a little bit as he followed Espio to three sliver doors that looked like walk-in freezers and watched as Esipo opened the door to see how bright and deep it was into the wall. Esipo then said bluntly, \"Get in.\" Hypon complied and entered the room and heard it close behind him, the lights going out as well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon stood in the middle of the room and readied himself as he prepared for anything, but could feel an icy cold chill enter the room. He could feel the temperature drop, but he stood strong and waited for anything that would come his way. However, Hypon then quickly felt something whisper into his ear in a foreign anicent wolf tongue and then felt his body being punched repeatedly as the pain felt real and thrown into a nearby wall until his body sunk to the floor and saw a figure holding something that looked like a dagger and heard the words, \"You are pathetic, just like your father...\" Hypon then blacked out as he felt the blade enter him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Later...</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon quickly woke up if he woke up from a nightmare in a bed that he didn't remember getting into or even entering the very bedroom he was in until he heard the door open and saw Esipo enter and said with a chuckle, \"First day is always the roughest, is it not, Hypon?\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

GUN had soured him at the end of his tenure and led him to do a small amount of vigilante work after leaving before finally seeing a flier for recruitment being held by the Freedom Fighters. This was what he wanted and he was going to make sure that he was going to stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring his first week, Hypon remained very quiet during the advanced combat classes, speaking only when spoken to and waiting for his turn for demonstration. Blaze the Cat was the teacher of the class, someone that Hypon could easily see as a capable fighter by how she held herself and how she disciplined students who got out of hand by putting them in locks where they would become sore or worse. It didn't take long for him to show his prowess in the martial arts thanks to his many years of training and his talents of his clan that he had honed during the last couple of months he was with GUN. Hypon slowly raised up through the ranks in the class, wanting to take his time rather than risk going too fast up the chain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of the classes, Hypon would hang out around the gym area, training simulator, or one of the outside gardens where he would meditate. That's how he would meet several Freedom Fighters and get to know them: Lupe the Wolf, Knuckles the Echidna, Espio the Chameleon just to name a small few. He kept sharpening his skills and preparing for any situation where he would prove his skills, whether using his fists, sword, guns, or his newest weapon, the bow. There were several times where he would come across Sally's attack dog, Frost, but would keep his distance as the fresh wounds of their battle were still fresh in their minds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the late afternoons, Hypon would retire to his room and go and study his surroundings using his laptop and private network server while also keeping a track on leads that were tied to anything that was connected to his clan, wanting to retrieve it before it was in the hands of anyone who might not know what it was or could do as some of the artifacts were very dangerous when not handled by a member of the Night Wolves Clan. Hypon was a Night Blood member of the Night Wolves Clan, those who were born under a red moon, and were destined to be great warriors, protectors of the clan, and the next leader of the coming generation when they would come of age.  After doing his research, he would prepare for the next day, wanting to get an early start so he could wake up for his morning meditations and repeat the cycle over again.</span></div></div>",

Hypon told Espio to leave him be, he was able to take care of himself for now. Espio then left him and Hypon looked around the room and admired that it wasn't much of a downgrade from his time as a GUN Agent. Hypon went over to one of the bags and pulled out his black laptop and set it up on the desk in the room and then pulled out Frost's Hilt that he brought from the clash and started to analyze it, knowing a person who could make a better sword using the hilt and giving it to Frost as an olive branch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon got his computer set up and sent a very quick message to one of his closest friends, seeing if he could get the sword hilt out and back in a few days and a collection of other private matters, letting him know that he was okay and hoping that his mission was doing well.

After it was sent, he turned off the little black box, closed the computer, and placed the black box back into his bags and went to the bathroom, wanting to take a warm shower to relax and unwind from the fight with Frost, before looking around the base as it was still early...</span></div></div>",

Hypon was breathing gently as he sat in front of a single lit candle. The flame ever shifting and moving like as a gentle wind was moving it. Hypon was focusing on his first few weeks at the Freedom Fighter Base. It has been four months since Hypon signed up and it was a rough four months...especially with another wolf in the same base...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost and Hypon were two of the strongest fighters and normally challenged each other to hand to hand combat and even to blade on blade combat. However, Hypon knew that Frost had some connection to one of his earlier visions before he was an official Fighter and his fears came true when one recent match against and could feel the chill enter the sparring room. Sally tried to stop the match between them, but the room system was shorted out due the sudden climate change. But as the match went on, Hypon's \"rage\" turned the tide of the match and had Frost crawling into a corner. Hypon, however, calmed and then offered his hand and agreed to a draw...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to Hypon's mediation, he was controlling his breathing and was entering a peace he barely felt. However, as Hypon entered the peace, he quickly shook out of the peace as he saw a symbol of blue; a blue wolf claw with sharpen edges...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon opened his eyes and saw the candle was still lit and then mumbled to himself, \"That is the third time this month I've seen that symbol. I don't know why, but I can hear a lot of screams around this symbol... Mother, if you can hear me, I hope this symbol isn't going to haunt me when I find this answer....\" After Hypon says this to the darkness, the flame of the candle quickly was blown away. Hypon then nodded and quickly got up and left the sun room...</span></div></div>",

Even when she gave everything she had to the fight, he had something better, it infuriated her. \"Damn it, I cannot let him beat me again. What kind of guard am I to Sally when I get beat by a new recruit?\" Frost muttered to herself as she put on her rather heavy guard armour that labeled her as Sally's royal guard, which went well with her blue fur and gave an opening for her wolf tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I am going to be late of I don't hurry up to the meeting.

It was a shame, as she was rather pretty and Hypon didn't want to have such a block between teammates.

Hypon saw Tails, Sonic and some new recruit but Hypon didn't know him well enough for a name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, now that everyone managed to find the room, we can begin.\" Sally stated as she brought up a 3D image of a factory. \"This factory has taken in tons of parts for Swatbots and the like, however, the output of these robots is very low to the parts going in. So where is all of those materials going? Team A will infiltrate and find out what is going on while Team B causes a distraction by the central hub on the other side of town. Team C will keep a track of Swatbot presence in case they get close and hack into the factory's system to aid Team A. We assume it's just a new prototype, but it is better to be safe than sorry. If it turns out to be a real threat, download any and all information you can find and blow it sky high. Sonic and Tails are on A while myself and our newbie keep watch. Frost, you and our more experienced newbie Hypon will cause the distraction, keep the pressure off of Sonic and Tails while they work. We head out at midnight, I want the reports by lunch time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen everyone started to leave, Hypon saw Frost smirk as she came over to him. \"Guess you will follow my lead Nightblood, try to keep up with the amount of damage I can cause.\"</span></div></div>",

However halfway through she felt her normally razor sharp focus waver and think about Hypon, and snagged her foot on a stray rock and slowed her down. She managed to get to the end and checked her score to find that her time was shy of her best by only fifteen seconds and frowned. \"<i>Damn it, I'm too distracted today, I won't be breaking any records...</i>\" Frost sighed and turned off the course, watching it shut down as she walked out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been like this since her little roll in the bed with Hypon a few days ago, after dumping her two-timing bitch girlfriend who slept with another guy. Frost flipped out and kicked her out of her room and Hypon had the misfortune to be there when it happened. Eventually he got her to cool down and over a few drinks they went out to Emerald Beach, somewhere she had never been to and watched the sunset. The whole walk back, Frost was wondering about herself and new feelings she felt towards Hypon from the few days they were together and how he tried to help her. She wasn't sure why, maybe it was the scotch they shared on the way over and back, or her feelings towards him or her anger towards her now ex that made her take the bull by the horns and tested waters she had never considered sailing on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning after was quite the spectacle and since then both of them were pretty awkward around each other and with the few friends who they trusted with the knowledge of their \"relationship\". It was not just different for Frost, in her clan, it was also against the law to have a relationship with a clan that you were at war with. So she was also worried about how her family would take any news about her with Hypon, as they could possibly disown her completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost just shook her head as she went to her room, right next to Hypon's, and went in to get changed out of her exercise clothes, hoping to get a shower and clean up before lunch. She would deal with her family in time, but ease them into it slowly, first with the news of her break up and eventually with knowledge that she was looking into a guy for the first time. </span></div></div>",

Yet instead of her ex, Frost turned the corner of the hall and found Hypon leave one of the rooms before walking to the door of the cafe, making both of them face to face as other people went around them. Hypon took a second to see her but immediately froze as if he didn't expect to see her so soon as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost felt a blush form on her face as she saw Hypon try to avoid looking at her head on, both of them quickly remembering the night they had spent together oh so passionately. She felt conflicted on if she should take the new feelings in her heart for him on faith or run away as fast as she could, as her eyes were betraying her private thoughts. \"Erm, Hello Hypon... good to see you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise...\" Hypon curtly answered back, now trying not to feel the awkwardness like he did with Rouge after his \" initiation\" night with Frost, who he saw a completely different wolf a few nights before in bed. He then noticed that they were slightly blocking traffic for lunch and gestured into the cafe. \"After you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing together was more uncomfortable for the two as they felt their friends who they confided in watch their every move. Slowly they both got in line and went through it to get there food, yet Frost quietly muttered to Hypon as she and he were served food, keeping her voice low as not to let others overhear easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I can go sit down out there, too much attention on us, it's like we have a sign on our necks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon took a brief second to image the two of them with matching signs and felt himself chuckle slightly before responding back. \"Walking away is a bigger problem Frost, I'm sure your friends are judging me on my actions and so are mine to you. We just need to be calm and not change our habits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost made a sour face as she spoke in a low tone. \"That means I sit with my ex... I don't want that either... especially since she's with that blockhead who's \"leftovers\" I found in the wastebasket.\" Frost was then shoved by an impatient recruit who wanted his food now, so she quickly put her claw to his neck until he backed off, but didn't even turn to face him. \"Maybe we should sit together, that way we don't get hassled by our friends with tips or advice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that sends a message itself about us, considering you hated my guts when I got here and tried to kill me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost slowly coughed but leaned into Hypon but kept her tone firm. \"I MAY have acted rashly, but now is not the time to play matchmaker with our friends once we sit down. I'm sick of hearing advice even though their hearts are in the right place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon rubbed his chin as he looked back at the tables and saw one which they could go to in a pinch to avoid their friends. Yet once he looked he caught the eye of a certain white bat at Frost's table that sent all types of messages at him, making him face Frost as he tried to give her an answer.</span></div></div>",

I'm not yours anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care about now!\" Frost growled as her claws slowly went out, close to taking the talk to the next level. \"I care about when you slept with him behind my back and the way I found out was a used rubber in my bathroom trash! If you wanted out, you should've fucking told me first instead of lying to my face!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrica however rolled her eyes as she stood up to face Frost head on, suddenly the room started to heat up around them as everyone was watching the events. \"Would you've prefered it in handwriting? I figured you would've guessed. Our fights, which always ended with you losing your shit like right now, and the fact you were so stubborn about me doing anything you didn't liked. It's a wonder why I put up with it at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Patty,\" The Ox spoke nervously as the situation was getting worse, trying to prevent another fight between the two of the women. \"Maybe we should go, now is not the place for this talk...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrica didn't even look at her boyfriend as she held a paw up to silence him as she crossed her chest at Frost. \"Shut the fuck up, just stand there and look imposing for her fuck-toy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ox looked down at the Lioness who comanded him and slowly nodded, as it seemed like he was afraid of her. \"Yes, Mistress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After all we went through, you're content washing your paws on our relationship?\" Frost's icy personality rose up and fought against the heat the Lioness put out against them, making their boyfriends suddenly cold and warm at the same time. \"Cheating on me, just because we had tough times? Selfish, as always! I did everything you wanted and gave up more than my share of needs to make you happy!\" Frost didn't even pay the Ox a second glance as she knew her focus was towards her ex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet Patrica just leaned into Frost face and put her paws on the table before she spoke with true venom in her voice loud enough for the whole room. \"You couldn't make me happy, you always had to focus on your duty, Sally this, get your tribe to take your ass back that. But you're not just angry about me leaving you, or that I cheated on you. No, that isn't why you're angry...you're angry because I'm just like HER and you couldn't keep me just like her!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is when everything went to hell when the howl of a feral wolf came from Frost's lips before she tackled Patrica and started to attack her with her claws like prey, screaming curses and death threats. The Lioness looked paralyzed at the beast who was above her and frantically fought against the hits and claws to get away, fearing that if Frost wanted to, she would kill her. Even with the muscle of the Ox trying to pull them away, Frost seemed to knock him away with a swat, like a bug as she nailed Patrica with punches and scratches.</span></div></div>",

Hypon then moved his hand and gently moved Frost away, picking her up rather than dragging her across the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe utter silence of shock, awe, and terror was interrupted by a group of EMTs who bolted into the cafe and ran to Patricia's side and make sure that she was stable and breathing while Hypon was checking on Frost before looking directly at the ox who seemed to regain consciousness and looked directly at the Nightblood. Hypon then picked up Frost, carrying her in his arms and simply said to him, \"Tell Patricia when she wakes up that I didn't save her for her sake.

Hypon left his room, locking his door behind him before walking to the next door over and gently knocking on Frost's door, speaking gently to it as he didn't know if Frost was in there or not, \"Frost, it's me...Are you in there? I figured that we need to talk about what happened earlier in the day.

What do you believe should be done in this matter and please provide evidence to support your position.\" The entire room waited to hear what he had to say, some assuming his position because of the relationship he had with Frost that had spread around, while others wondering if he would surprise them by picking something neutral to every side.</span></div></div>",

Hypon then started simple, \"Ladies and Gentlemen of the Court, I can understand why the prosecution would be pushing for Miss Lynn's removal as it would be the procedure in this case.

But first, we recognize the nature that this job has and the weight it carries on those whom cannot properly exercise their restraint. We have also heard evidence about the levels of stress that have happened over the course of several days where Ms Lynn had a failed mission, broke off her relationship with Ms Homes over an personal manner, and then suppositedly gained a new one before the event in question that was unlike any prior. It is our opinion that Lynn will be punished by being forced to take time off for a period of nothing smaller than 2 weeks to a month off without pay and have mandatory sessions with both a therapist and an anger management consular before she can return. The sessions can happen after the period, but are necessary before returning to work. Hopefully this time will allow her to find new methods to de-stress and lead to less issues in the future. Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could you get her off?! I demand an appeal!\" Patricia screamed out to the review board as they left, quickly drowned out in the crowd of people from different opinions on what was supposed to happen. Her representative said something to her before she slap him away and stormed out of the room, with him following behind with a case. \"This is such fucking bullshit...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrost seemed to exhale as Sally walked up to them, barely noticing the crowd leaving the room as she turned to ask Sally what was on her mind. \"I didn't think they would go for it, did you convince them to do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I was present when they were forming an opinion, yet they made the decision themselves to a majority...\" Sally answered her close friend with a hug, but held her in it and spoke loud enough that Hypon could hear. \"No more mistakes. I don't care what happens, no more fights outside of a ring and no more claws. Are we clear?\" The squirrel took her own sigh when Frost slowly nodded, pulling away and brushing her clothes while addressing Hypon. \"I can guess you are going with her on her trip. Unlike when I asked you to take care of Frost with Patricia, this time you will tell me the moment things change. Otherwise I won't let you return and you can figure things out yourself. Get packing and be prepared to leave by tomorrow afternoon.\" Sally thrn walked away into the last bit of the crowd, pushing past questions and comments about the case of her close friend.</span></div></div>",

It's a bit of a problem when I drink too much, I get a little fired up, which could get make me... a little lacking in restraint...\" When Hypon seemed to raise his eyebrow at her comment, he noticed a distinct rise in color on Frost's face to the events he would remember easily and took her a day to fully piece together. The Ice wolf seemed to clear her throat before continuing, although the blush on her face remained to his observing eyes, while in a softer tone. \"The other thing is, I'm not sure how we should move forward after what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What exactly do you mean Frost?\" Hypon quizzically as he could see the same nervousness as before starting to come back. \"Well...\" Frost slowly started to speak, but it was like she was trying to dance around the direct words she would use in any other situation, for her benefit or for his. \"The last few days, I... I have tried to pretend what happened didn't change things, like we could just move on with it being a weird night to never speak again about. But... I think we both know that isn't true, and it's turned what was before into... a form of relationship I didn't exactly think could happen or plan.\" The small bit of silence between them after her last comment went on, yet Hypon could see for himself what words she was struggling to say for herself. The Ice Wolf seemed to have genuine feelings for him from how she acted more closely to a shy crush than the tough girl she had worn proudly into every fight or arguement between them. He could also tell she was experiencing a level of attraction to him that wouldn't have happened in any other case of the past, which could be why the once rival of his seemed remarkably confused and awkward about the new feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts over what he saw were interrupted after it seemed the unsure Ice Wolf managed to finish what she started. \"I just wanted to know... if how I'm feeling about this... if you share it, or if I'm just making myself look silly putting something into this that you don't see...\" It seemed to make Frost a bit calmer after she spoke what was likely troubling her since the night they spent in bed. Although Hypon could tell that she was offering a way for the events before to be left alone, he could see that his choice of words could affect exactly more than that, having caught slight expressions in her body that seemed receptive to his eyes.</span></div></div>",

However, working with Sally and the Fighters meant he had to cut ties but he couldn't cut ties with everyone and beside a few several oversights of judgement; Hypon knew a few people he could trust on both sides and if he couldn't convince Sally that he made the right choice, he also had the voice of his former partner's vote to convince his boss.

Careful Tails!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric spoke as he laid on the metal slab, still feeling the jolt in the left side of his head as he looked towards his two tailed brother. He had each of the limbs of his robotic side hooked into Tail's computer, providing real time data on the system of the cyborg and the system that had previously taken control of him in order to do the bad things of his past. After returning from Robotnik's tower, Tails was ordered by Sally to clean his software from the program called \"Overlord\", but the concern over the program's return sparked monthly checks to prevent it's code from coming back. The last thing the Freedom Fighters wanted was a member who could become an enemy with the mere pressing of a button, even if that same member was only a part of the movement because of his brother's request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Eric, I'll fix the voltage next time. I'm still getting the handle on your system, with his fingers in places close to your heart and brain, if I don't be careful you could be in trouble.\" Tails answered back as he referred to his computer and the code-book for handling robotizated systems. It wasn't easy to alter the codes of his brother, as he was altered due to the tampering he did while he was being changed, making the structure of the fox highly unstable. Tails glanced as his brother who was staring off into the distance, knowing that the news that came earlier about fixing him was still sinking in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue fox had high hopes for the future where he could live without the influences of his dark master, but that dream was crushed by the hands of the kid he once was. Eric's tampering as a child caused the fusion of machine to his body instead of just altering it, making removal of the systems the equivalent of tearing off the muscle/flesh of his left side. Even if he could survive the process, which was about 40% according to top Freedom Fighter scientists, he would be physically disabled and unable to move. It was hard to hear and even harder to accept, but the time with his brother helped a bit. After believing that Tails and his parents were murdered by Robotnik as a way to brainwash him, it was earth shattering to find out that it was all a lie. After the situation with nearly handing over the base to Robtonik while holding Sally as a human shield, he didn't think he could hold his little brother long enough in his arms. It didn't excuse his actions to the others however, and he had a lot to own up to and fix in order to repair the damage he caused. Something he had hoped to aid in with the development and almost completion of a shackled AI that could increase his functionality and ability to provide more to the Freedom Fighters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe program raised a few eyebrows, but considering the level of ability of a synthetic mind like Nicole could do, another could be just as helpful or twice as deadly. It was the other thing Tails was to check as he scrubbed the system, to make sure that Eric had control and it wasn't the other way around. The data would be compiled for others to use if they needed it, but control belonged strictly to the fox.</span></div></div>",

Felicity knew why people used violence and saw it as a taboo item even as a former military-grade AI. She was still programmed to defend and protect to the best of the abilities she had but would prefer a less deadly option when one was available. Hypon noticed why she was a very odd AI very quickly and made sure there were a few added defenses in case anything could try and mess with her. Felicity seemed to enjoy learning more about people but that could be the fact she was alone with one person and the army of men who didn't really know or respect her. Hypon was her \"savior\" and she wanted to know more about him so that she could thank him accordingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hypon.\" Felicity began as she spoke towards him as her digital body sat on the table in front of him, not being able to cast a true appearance like Nicole, \"I've been looking into some of the files you've given me about the incident with Eggman. I know that you stopped that fox from doing anything towards that human. I may ask why?\" Hypon stopped for a second before sighing and stopped what he was working on, giving all of his attention to the curious AI, \"It is a multilayered item to talk about, Felicity, and depending on who you ask; they might tell you differently. I stopped Eric from getting his revenge because I know how quickly that slope of anger can hurt you if you do not stop yourself earlier rather than later. I've done a lot of stupid in my life and I would rather get yelled at by my friend who does not see what I am trying to do to help before having to put them at the business end of my blade and take them down by force. Eric will understand that I did him a favor eventually even if I have to be on the wrong side of Sally's wrath for letting Egghead getaway. Revenge only gets you so far before you finally snap and crave more of her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon's mind instantly went back to a time that haunted him occasionally; a dead body in a small village resting in the middle of the floor and the cry of a very young wolf who knew the person who did the deed. It was the first time that Hypon snapped and almost took the life of someone who deserved punishment for their actions. An arena floor draped in shadow could not hide the rage of the Nightblood Child who had nothing left to lose. Hypon then added, \"Eric needs to find his own happiness from this. He is not a murderer and not should he become one out of vengeance. I just hope he understands that one day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, the room went back into a brief silence before a small chime of a phone reminded Hypon of something. Hypon then changed the subject, \"I have a meeting with a friend in a few minutes, Felicity. You may want to go dark in case someone walks in. I would not like to give anyone more of a scare after what has happened recently. I assume you remember what to do if someone finds you?\" Felicity chimed back to Hypon, \"Yes, Hypon. Try to hide the fact that I am a military-grade AI with my calm personality and act like I am your personal assistant AI.\" Hypon answered her while grabbing his essentials for the meeting before going back to Felicity's screen \"Do not worry, Felicity. I will make sure that this secret does not stay too long in the dark. We will hopefully get you a body soon so you can get to interact with more people rather than just me and a few others.\" Felicity sighed, \"I don't want to be a prisoner again.\" Hypon then added, \"You won't, I will not let them. I'll see you later.\" With that, Felicity logged off and Hypon relaxed slightly as he was able to breathe for a moment after talking about the risky subject but was going to distract himself with a meeting with Vanilla and Cream...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A small time after Frost and Hypon \"officially\" became a couple in the eyes of the Freedom Fighters, Hypon took an assignment back in his old stomping grounds in the land of Chun-Cun to help start up a base in his first home after seeing recent attacks by Eggman's Forces. Hypon did want to take Frost with him to his first home to show her the beauty of the land, but they decided that it was best for Frost to stay back at Knothole so he could keep an absolute focus on assisting the local Freedom Fighters set up the base. Hypon didn't want to leave a giant space between them while they were starting to blossom during their relationship but it would also allow Frost some time to think about how they were going to explain this relationship to her father; the same person who killed his entire family and clan. They both knew that it was going to be very hard to make sure that Frost's father realized that he was actually wrong for doing what he did for attacking the Night Blood Clan and almost driving them to absolute extinction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a very quiet month since Hypon came up to Shijin Shrine, the main base of operations that was located right outside the main city of Chun-Nan.  The leader of the whole team was a green and pink mobian dragon known as Dulcy. Dulcy's second in command was a white tigress and former Egg Clan Army lieutenant, Jian. Along with Jian, there were two other fighters in the group: Cinder the Pheasant and Bunker the Tortoise. With Chun-Nan being such a small town between tall mountains, they didn't need a full team positioned there and most conflicts came as bandits or mild disturbances, so it was pretty peaceful for the Night-Blood Wolf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon was walking around Shijin Shrine admiring the beauty of the shrine that he remembered when he was a young pup. This was the same place that he learned his hand-to-hand combat skills and how to sense chi and the chi of others. It brought back several memories as he walked around and turned the corner to see the sparing arena, occupied by Jian and Bunker as Cinder sat on the sidelines. Hypon just watched from a distance and just smiled as Jian and Bunker spared, knowing that it was going to be a long fight as they were the best fighters in Chun-Cun. Hypon rested on a nearby pillar until he got a message on his pager from Dulcy, knowing that he was needed at the Operations Center. With that, Hypon dashed over towards the operations center and saw Dulcy, standing next to a group of computers, looking at a few screens that showed places around Chun-Nan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hypon...\" She began, \"Your friends over in Knothole have sent you some messages. They seem to miss you.\" Hypon just smiled and approached next to her, \"I'm a very likable person, Dulcy. But until I get a message from Sally to come back to Knothole, I'm here to assist you in getting your place operational.\" Dulcy just smiled at his loyalty and said, \"I'm glad that you think that we are that important, Hypon.\" Hypon then went around her to grab the messages that were on the map table and said, \"Chun-Nan is as much my home as Knothole. It needs to be protected from all that would do harm.\" Dulcy answered him back with a smirk, \"Speaking of that, The Egg Clan Army has been starting to make a comeback in some of the smaller villages. Conquering Storm's doing no less.\" Hypon looked at the small map and then answered back, \"She was rattled after the defeat of Eggman, but I figured that she would come back to avenge her master. She will make herself known soon enough and I know you four shall be ready to stop her.\" Dulcy responded with a small amount of wit, \"Five if you are still around to help us.\" Hypon sat down on a nearby chair and cycled through the messages, waiting around to see if Dulcy had anything else for him to do as she went back to looking at the screens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the messages were from several freedom fighters from Knothole, but he did see a message or two that was from Frost and placed those through the front before getting up from the chair to make his way to his room in the shrine, wanting to go through all of the letters quickly and start working on a reply for Frost if it was an actual letter that needed an actual reply. His room was a very comfortable suite that had a very great view of the village that he grew up in. He made his way over towards his desk and began to open up his letters, glad that there were a lot of fellow Freedom Fighters were actually missing him but wondered that if it was just Sally just trying to show her appreciation for him helping her with setting up a base in his home country by having some of the fighters write to him.</span></div></div>",

They had set up their video chat after the month since both were tired of long letters that occasionally got lost in the shuffle or weathered by elements. He did remember to lock his door if they decided to get a bit more personal over the camera, although something in Frost's eye made him double check the lock. She had gotten much more active with him since they made things official, to the point where Hypon had developed an awareness of where the hot spots for couples on base were for special times before he left. Frost seemed like she was excited to share something with him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to finally see you face to face Hypon, considering we are as far away as the bases go.\" Frost smiled as she fixed her camera, fixing small bits of static in the frames as much as she could on her side. She was in her bedroom of her room, with her laptop assumely on her lap as her face was mostly in view except for the frame of her bed behind her, wearing what he assumed was the pink nightgown from much earlier in their relationship. \"Although the mountains do not make streaming easier. I do have a bit of a surprise for you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon smiled as he thought of a few ideas that Frost could have cooked up, although he wondered why she shifted the laptop to her left side. \"It's good to see you too Frost. I'm curious what you mean, considering it wasn't too long since our last letters with our usual updates. What surprise do you have for me?\" He felt like she may have wanted to stir him up with maybe some fun over the camera, or that she got a gift for him that might be sent over with the mail and this was her way of getting him excited for it. However, he soon realized what Frost meant when she started to slide up her nightgown to show something brand new to his eyes on her behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight on her left cheek was what looked like a paw tattoo, very close to his hand and colored in with a small \"H\" in the center of it. Hypon thought back to before he left where Frost had asked him to draw his hand for her, now realizing she had gotten this from that picture. \"I got this a week after you left, it feels better now, but I wanted to show you that I meant what I said about making this work between us. In my culture, a tattoo is to show determination to a goal or objective, sort of like that white war paint you saw me wearing a few times. It's permanent, a symbol of  commitment that I want this as much as you do, and that we'll make this work as long as possible considering my family.\"</span></div></div>",

So how have you been since I've been gone; you haven't begun to crawl up the walls without me there? Been thinking about our plan to face your family in the upcoming future? Hypon just wanted to spend time with Frost, even if he just heard her talk for the whole time they had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn previous occasions, while he was in Chun-Cun, Hypon had recorded most of the journey for Frost to show she could see the home that he grew up in and basically give her slight updates about the assignment but as a way to keep himself connected to his life at Knothole. With his time in Chun-Cun being an open book, he just wanted to hear Frost's thoughts and just listen to her voice. She was the yin to his yang; the one person who was keeping him sane and focused as he was away from home. That being mentioned, he wasn't the only Freedom Fighter that came to \"help\" set up the base with him as Sally sent his friend and mentor, Lupe, a well-decorated leader, and fighter/leader of a group known as The Wolf Pack and Bunnie Rabbot, someone that Hypon had small brief encounters with when he was associated with Scourge in the past but finally earned her trust after finding the actual mole that was leaking information to Scourge from inside Knothole Base. Lupe was assigned to help train and teach any new recruits who were transferred there while also helping Dulcy set up certain plans for expansion/emergencies. Bunnie Rabbot was tasked with setting up the base's defenses and trying to find a way to boost the signal, having no so much with the latter than the former. However, Hypon had the mindset that Sally sent other people to keep an eye on him from doing something completely stupid due to being so close by to the people who slaughtered his family and clan but he enjoyed the company as he knew they weren't going to be alone for so long as he got word that a few more members were getting sent over to Chun-Cun Base for a \"small time\".</span></div></div>",

We might have to handle the situation in a more... aggressive manner than Sally or you would prefer.\" Frost slowly rubbed her scar in memory, only to pull away from it once she realized her boyfriend was watching with concern in his eyes. \"The last thing I want is to see him again after everything he did, but as we proved, the past has a nasty habit of appearing when you don't want it to. I think when the time comes we will try to be civil... to the best we can considering... if he tries to harm either of us, we should react fairly in turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon caught a small flicker of fire in her eyes that hinted of a desire to fight back, yet Frost shook it off and instead extended her claws of her hand to distract herself. \"Sally made it clear after you left that if we go on a revenge mission and start a civil war, that our service will end to her and the Freedom Fighters. I can't break the promise I gave King Acorn and her unless there really is no other way to make things right, I don't want to leave her defenceless. Yet I want to see my homeland again, to see my home and birthright.\" The ice wolf took a breath before returning her gaze to the screen, shaking off a feeling of dread on her mind so she could address Hypon. \"I-I just made this more depressing than it needed to be, we should be enjoying our time together for as long as we can and push the difficult stuff away for now.\"</span></div></div>",

This is something we can't bury forever and with me being so close to the gaze of your father; it might come up sooner rather than later.\" Hypon then took that moment to bring up something that was on his mind when he noticed her gesture to him, \"You know that I'm going to have to return that favor of yours with something of my own, Frosty. I might have to pull out my kit of paints once again and see what I can do.\" Hypon rarely dawned war paint like Frost did, saving it for extremely rare occasions and when he did; it was a sign that he was not going to hold back anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon did want to talk about the plan but hearing Frost's distaste for it was good enough for him to wait for a better time but with him being some close to his clan's sacred lands, he knew that this would be the only time for him to hit two birds with one stone. Hypon wanted answers to why his clan caught the ire of the Frost Wolves or simply a reason for they thought to eliminate an entire clan was the only decision from the source; that being Frost's father. He knew the overall story that was told but part of him felt like there was something more to the story and he had a distaste for secondhand knowledge. He wanted answers and he saw Frost's father as the right person to get those answers. The second reason came from Hypon's task to recover an artifact that rested in the center of a locked chamber in the village temple, in a place that only the Nightblood Champion would be able to reach and if anyone else would dare to enter those halls; they would simply perish by the Spirit Guardians that protect it. This was the best time if any to recover it and get the answers he needed. Hypon was warned by Sally that he should mainly stay inside the walls of the Temple Base or the village unless on a mission to prevent any eyewitness events of him out in the open to keep suspicions low about who he was.</span></div></div>",

This tattoo was just something that was on my mind for a while until I got it for you, it's not necessary to get painted up for me in exchange.\" She stretched out on the bed for a moment as she considered the last times she saw him with war paint, which were a fight to test each other truly and another time for a ritual that he explained to her was from his tribe in honor of a past event. Frost did consider how Hypon watched her reply, thinking of the future between them, while being sure that it was just them that would hear her next words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides... if there will be returning any favors, we can think of a list for when you come back. A long list... or maybe somethings we can handle over this feed to make it shorter...?\" Frost spoke softly and sultry to her boyfriend in a playful manner to get him to think of ideas and consider their time back together once he was done over there. She had some ideas herself, but she didn't want to go down that path until both of them were both ready and no one would interrupt them to make a very awkward scene like the one time back at the base which made a very embarrassing moment.</span></div></div>",

Hypon took a short hour nap before waking up and sighing as he put on a set of relaxing clothes for the Chun-Cun Early Spring Night in the mountain temple, walking around the temple as he began to reminisce about the past...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany years back, Hypon and his adoptive rat father would go to the temple every chance they could to meditate, train, or seek knowledge. He wanted to give Hypon a starting education and didn't want him to end up falling behind like the other children in the village. It was also a gathering place for many of Chun-Cun's events that occurred every other weekend and gave him a chance to interact and meet with the other children in the surrounding villages. Now, the temple might have stayed the same with a small number of changes that occurred over the years, either due to when the world was in danger by the hands of Dark Gaia or by one of the many egg bosses that were under Dr. Eggman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon stopped near one of the older trees on the temple grounds and placed his hand on the bark to gently feel it before hearing a voice coming from behind him... \"Taking a walk in the moonlight, Hypon?\" He turned around to see Jian the White Tiger standing behind him with crossed arms which lead to him responding, \"I couldn't sleep, Jian. I figured a night walk would help calm my nerves.\" Jian nodded in understanding before adding, \"Well, don't stay up too late. We do have a mission to investigate a nearby disturbance that could possibly be either Conquering Storm or Lady Clove trying to move back into this region.\" Hypon just sighed before saying, \"I won't be long, Jian. Thank you for your concern.\" He watched as Jian smile and glance at him before entering back into the temple making him wonder if she had other thoughts on her mind while she departed, unsure if she fully knew that he was off the market. Hypon then looked at the tree and rubbed an old marking on the bark before returning to his room that read \"The Wolves' Bark.\" that he had carved many years back...</span></div></div>",

There was a chest that sat at the edge of the bed that contained his larger weapons that he used on occasions such as the sniper rifle that he used on observation-style or assassination missions, a semi-automatic assault rifle that was made custom for him back when he was a GUN Agent to suit any and all situations that would cross his path, and a pair of pistols that he was the most familiar with as he used back before he joined with the AFF. Outside the case sat a very worn blade that had been in Hypon's possession for some time and the newest item that Hypon had been using; a compound bow that didn't look that impressive but was just as deadly up close in melee than from a distance with a quiver of arrows laying right on top of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the left of the room sat Hypon's desk and where his laptop was usually placed when he was not having a conversation with Frost. His chair is covered up with one of his many jackets while the desk was had a collection of files stacked up about either Chun-Cun, the wolf clans that were nearby in the surrounding areas, or several missions that he was leading from his new spot away from home. Then finally, a small closet and bathroom rested nuzzled up against the right side of the wall. There wasn't much of a place to do his morning meditations in the room but he had the entire temple area to do that when he needed to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypon was already up, dressed, and about after only having a few hours of rest but that was where his mediation came in as he was able to rejuvenate when sleep failed him. Hypon was mediating underneath a blossoming dogwood tree that looked over the village that was nearby, taking in the fresh air and the sights in between moments of relaxation. He waited for Cinder's arrival to let him know that they were all ready for his arrival for the mission's briefing as he was still an hour early than everyone else as the breakfast had not even finished being made as it was the usual morning meeting they had since they had smaller numbers to do these sorts of things...</span></div></div>",
