Indeed the spanks just made him feel horny all over again<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRory was letting out little cervine grunts, puffing and panting as his bottom was worked over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Tiffany's side, she was figuring out Rory's hot spots VERY quickly! He seemed to be an average in terms of what he liked, like most males, he seemed to be most aroused when his 'sit spots' were pressed. Whenever she spanked the fleshiest parts of his bottom, a little more Pre dribbled out of his throbbing deer cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she figured out everything she wanted to know, she stopped spanking and turned back to her tool bag...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I leaned a lot of things with that exchange.\" She purred \"One is that you like more easily aroused then you let on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRory felt slightly embarrassed at that<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two, is that the the perfect spanking implement for you should be something that leaves you unable to sit for weeks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRory was beginning to get nervous all over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think the implement that will be most satisfactory tonight is...the strap!

And every species on Anthro had a different smell to it's urine, in her mind herbivores had the most pleasant aroma to their urine, that was probably another reason she liked herbivores the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Rory was done, there was a puddle, no more like a small lake of urine on the cave floor, Tiffany was impressed by the sheer quantity that he could hold his bladder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There now.\" She said patting his Buck Behind again \"Doesn't your belly feel better now that you've gotten that out of your system?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRory's bladder felt nothing but relief but Roy himself felt extreme embarrassment, he wished more then ever he had stayed home tonight </span></div></div>",

She had volunteered him without consulting him, but one thing Howard knew - you didn't want to cross his mother. You got one warning before you were up over her lap, tail in the air, and well, you didn't sit comfortably for a while. No sir, Howard didn't want to be late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went straight over to the neighbor's house. Mrs. Eekhoorn was a nice lady and he didn't really mind helping her out. The Eekhoorns moved in a few years ago so they could send their girls to Hollow Oaks, one of the best schools in the forest. Janet was a year or two older than Howard and a junior at Hollow Oaks. Becky was younger and went to Wavering Pine middle school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knocked on the Eekhoorn's door. Mrs. Eekhoorn answered the door. \"Hello Howard, thanks for coming by. I've got a whole kitchenful of cookies I need to take over to a meeting. Can you help me?\" She was dressed in her Squirrel Scout leader's uniform, a smart looking green dress. Becky stuck her head around the door. \"Hi Howard!\" she said. Becky was in the scouts and she was in her uniform too. Howard looked at her in her white blouse and dark green skirt with a cutout just below the waistband for her tail to stick out. Howard often wondered why boys in the forest only wore a shirt if they wore anything at all and the girls always wore clothes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, it's no problem Mrs Eekhoorn. What can I do to help?\" You enter the house and follow them into the kitchen. There are trays and boxes of cookies everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Janet and I were up all night baking Squirrel Scout cookies and we need to take these to the school. Becky's troop is selling them to raise money. I just need to help Becky find her sash and we'll be ready to go. Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, no problem\" said Howard. The two of them left. Howard was standing alone in a room with hundreds of cookies! Surely they wouldn't miss just one? He took an oatmeal cookie from a nearby tray. He was hungry from being at school all day and the cookie was gone in two bites. Then a second. Then a third and a fourth... In just a minute, the tray was half empty!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he realized he had eaten half a tray of cookies, he quickly tried to rearrange them to make it look like there weren't any missing. As he fumbled with the tray, he realized there was someone standing behind him tapping their paw on the floor. It was Janet and she didn't look happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think you're doing?\" she asked. \"Did you just eat all those cookies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmphno\" you say, trying not to spray crumbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why are your cheek pouches full? Why are there crumbs all over your fur?\" she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Janet. Your mother and Becky went off to look for something, and I, well, I... I'm so sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were up all night baking those cookies to raise money, not to feed you. I'm going to go tell my mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, please don't! She'll tell my mother and well...\" Howard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet looked at him quietly for a moment. Becky came back into the room wearing her sash and brushing her fur. Janet had an idea. \"Okay Howard, I'll cover for you this time because I know your mother would give you the strap for this, so I'll make you a deal. I have some extra cookies I can replace these with and no one except Becky and I will know. My mother will be out tomorrow afternoon and you come straight over after school and we'll deal with this ourselves. Okay Howard? A spanking from me can't be as bad as one from your mother. Is it a deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky looked at the decimated tray of cookies. \"Hey, those cookies were for my troop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet laughed. \"Yes Becky, they were. Okay. Howard, here are your choices.\"</span></div></div>",

Then again. Mrs. Eekhoorn looked at Janet, then Howard. \"One of you better tell me what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoward lowered his head and told her he had eaten them while he was waiting. \"Howard, you should be ashamed of yourself. Those weren't yours to eat. You knew we needed those for the fund raiser. We'll see what your mother says about this, and I guess I'll just have to go down to the bakery and buy some replacements.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, Mrs. Eekhoorn, please don't tell my mother. She'll...\" his voice trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll what, Howard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll probably take the strap to me for this. Please don't tell her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet interrupted to tell her mother she had baked extras. \"Mom, \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Janet could finish her sentence, her mother told her to be quiet. \"Don't defend him Janet or I might just have to spank you too. I ought to spank both of you right now but now I have to run to the bakery. Let me think about this Howard. I'll be back in 10 minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned and left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Becky, what do you say we spank him right now? Why wait?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky thought that was a wonderful idea. She got her mother's straight backed chair and put in the middle of the kitchen while Janet held Howard's arm. \"Becky would you like the honor of going first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoward tried to break Janet's grip but she was string and determined not to let go. Becky sat down and straightened her skirt. Janet helped, no, rather pushed Howard roughly over Becky's lap. When the first spanks fell, Howard was once again reminded that in the forest, males only wore shirts with no bottoms. It didn't seem fair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a dozen or two of Becky's best effort, Howard was uncomfortable and stinging, but not really sore. He was most embarrassed that he was getting spanked by a younger squirrel. Janet saw her little sister was tiring. \"Okay Becky, I'll take over now.\" They switched places and Howard lay over Janet's lap while Becky watched. Janet spanked much harder than her little sister. In all, he must have received almost 100 swats. When Janet let him up he was quite sore. Fortunately his fur helped hide the bright pink skin underneath. The girls laughed as did a little dance for them. They heard their mother coming back up the walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Janet put the chair back and Becky helped Howard stack up the cookies.</span></div></div>",

'Prices so good you'd think our stuff grows on trees' said the slogan on the bag. She removed trays from the bags and added them to the neatly stacked trays on the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Howard, would you...\" started Mrs. Eekhoorn but she stopped when the saw his face. He looked embarrassed in he presence and was trying not to make eye contact with the girls, especially young Becky. \"Did I miss something?\" she asked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Mom,\" said Janet. \"Becky and I spanked him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" She asked, looking first at Howard, then the girls, then back at Howard again. \"You were pretty naughty, eating the cookies Howard. Let's see the damage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoward blushed from head to toe. He stood, frozen in place. Time stood still until Janet said \"Howard! Turn around and let mom see the good job my little sister did to your bottom!\" He looked her, then Becky, then at Mrs. Eekhoorn. Her normally kind and generous eyes seemed especially dark and kind of stormy. Not wanting to anger her, he turned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bend over Howard, and let me see\" she said. He did as he was told. She gently parted the fur to see the skin underneath. Just the touch of her hand sent a jolt through him and he jumped at her touch. She laughed. \"Its okay Howard. I'm not going to spank you again. I can see that the girls did a very thorough job. Becky, did you really do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky smiled and nodded. She enjoyed having the older boy over her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs Eekhoorn patted Howard's bottom and told him to straighten up. \"Why oh why,\" thought Howard, \"don't males ever get to wear pants?\" He hoped that no one else would notice his bright red bottom. He knew the redness would fade into pink pretty soon, but would it be fast enough?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of them gathered up the cookie trays and loaded them into the car. Howard got in the back seat next to Becky and Mrs. Eekhoorn headed off towards the meeting. Howard was having trouble sitting comfortably and Becky was enjoying every delicious squirm and wriggle of the boy as he sat on his freshly spanked bottom.</span></div></div>",

The Squirrel Scouts were in the school cafeteria, organizing the paperwork for their annual cookie drive. The girls had divided up into groups, each working out which part of the town they'd canvass trying to sell cookies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the other mothers commented on how beautiful Janet's and Becky's cookies were. \"Why, they almost look professional\" one exclaimed. Janet wondered if she meant the ones she had made or the ones that her mother had purchased after Howard ate so many. \"The piping on these is gorgeous\" she told Janet. Janet had indeed piped the Squirrel Scout logo onto several dozen sugar cookies, so she thanked the woman for her kind words. Howard was pleased that no one had noticed he was walking rather stiffly and that none of the Eekhoornes had said anything about his being recently spanked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the meeting, Howard decided to walk home. There was a park near the school and Howard decided to walk through it on the way home. He loved that park - plenty of trees, lovely secluded paths where you could sit (well, not today) and think about stuff, and plenty of wild nuts &amp; berries to gather if you need a snack. \"Better idea than cookies\" he thought, rubbing his still-sore bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was most of the way into the park when he thought he heard a noise in the bushes.</span></div></div>",

He jumped from tree to tree towards the source of the noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he approached the clearing he heard voices. One was definitely a female, human, he thought. The other was male but he couldn't tell if it was human or anthro. He sat quietly on the branch straining his ears to hear what they were saying. Try as he might, he couldn't make out what they were talking about. Howard was a natural snoop and couldn't help himself. He had to move in closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell, I'm a squirrel\", he thought. What could be more natural than a squirrel in the trees? Sure he could get right near the clearing and no one would notice. As he got closer, he recognized the place. It was a beautiful spot filled with foxgloves. He could now hear the two voices clearly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment he was concerned that one of the might recognize him as an anthro. He decided he'd be okay if he just stayed still and quiet. He forgot he was wearing a shirt and that non-anthri squirrels didn't wear clothes.</span></div></div>",
