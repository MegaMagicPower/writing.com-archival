That works better, so you take another bite and then another.  Balance, you think to yourself, and take a slurp of orange soda and a fry.  Then, back to the burger.  Slowly but steadily, you make your way through the big burger and fries.  Sitting back, you feel full, but not as full as you expected to feel - and you feel strangely warm, and almost accomplished.  You look at the apple turnovers and wonder if you can eat them too.  Taking another sip of your soda, you decide to push on - after all, the bigger you get before Gregg gets back, the better!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe turnovers go down a lot more slowly than the burger, but the warm feeling continues, and you finish them off, draining the last of the soda with the last bite.  You get up from the table and are suddenly aware that your jeans are more snug than before.  Maybe you'd better buy a bigger pair.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, though, your stomach doesn't feel right.  You rush to the washroom, afraid you'll throw up, but you don't.  A moment later a woman in Burger King uniform rushes in.  \"Did you just eat an apple turnover?\" she asks urgently.  \"Do you feel sick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and yes,\" you say, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad I found you!  Are you OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I feel like I'm going to throw up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear.  Well, some of one batch of turnovers was bad - not properly cooked.  They're not dangerous, but they seem to make people queasy for an hour or two, or even throw up.  You should just sit quietly for a while until the feeling passes.  Please come with me, you can sit in our employee lounge until you feel better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow the woman through another door and down a staircase to a large room, simply furnished with sofas, soft chairs, a big TV, a stereo, and a couple of video games.  On a counter are snacks and a soda dispenser.  The woman gets you a glass of ginger ale.  \"Here, sip this slowly, it'll help the queasiness pass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit for an hour, sipping occasionally, and steadily feel better.

You drop the bag back on the seat, then, when he's finished with the stroller, try again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, as he's closer, he notices you, and hustles over to help you.  \"Here, let me put that up for you,\" he says, his big hands taking the bag out of your grasp.  You step back, the better to watch as he swings your bag expertly up, displaying both his strength and his delightfully tubby physique.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\" you say warmly,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think nothing of it,\" he replies, then hurries back towards the door to help another customer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral more times during the journey you 'need' the attendant's help with your bag, or get a glass of water from him, or just walk along the car to where he's sitting for a moment between jobs.  His warm smile tells you that he's onto your little game, but he doesn't seem to mind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You stuffed pieces after piece of greasy fried chicken, big baked potatoes, and vegetables and rolls drenched in real butter.  Bill ate the contents of his one plate quickly.  He wasn't there to eat; he was there to make sure you did.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nOnce you finished a plate, Bill would refill it for you.  As before, he saw no need for you to do any kind of work.  He would return with all of your favorite foods waiting for you.

In your hands you are carrying a half eaten bag of candy, following Bill's order to eat little things at all times of the day.  On your way downstairs you catch a glimpse of yourself in the mirror.  With pride, you stroke your growing tummy.  You know that you can't have gained more than 15 pounds at this point, but it really is showing well.  Soon enough, you'll be just like you lovey boy.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nWhen you finally open the door, you are greeted by Bill and his wife, Lydia.  Although he had told you ahead of time that she was heavy, you are quite shocked to actually see her.  Just to look at her, you guess that she is somewhere within the 400 pound range, if not over.  But you notice that she carries this weight gracefully and is really quite beautiful.  'God, if I could just look like her, I'd be happy,' you think.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nBill leaves the two of you alone so that you both can get acquainted and so that he can bring in the food that they have brought over.  For a few moments, you both sit in silence, unsure of what to say next.  Lydia is the one to break the silence.  \"I'm sure you're wondering how I got to be this size.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Well, I kinda was. I just didn't know how to ask.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"No need to fear,\" says Lydia sympathetically.  \"I have no shame in this.  You see, Bill and I fed one another.  We both started out our marriage rather slim, but, as it is with most newlyweds, we gained a little weight.  At first, we were willing to loose the excess baggage, but each diet left us starved and we would soon gain back the weight--and more--each time we gave the diet up.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"We soon realized that the most enjoyable part of our diets was the part where we gave up and gave into our hunger.  It was at that point that we decided to gain weight.  For us, feeding was a way for us to bond, to make our relationship stronger.  It was a blow to Bill to have to lose the weight, but we both decided that I would continue the gain.  He would live vicariously through me, and the people that he helps.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Wow!  How much have you changed?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"When I met Bill, I weighed 124 pounds.  At my last weigh in, I weighed 412.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAlthough your shocked by the extremeness of this gain, you're also impressed.  It must have taken a lot of determination for Lydia to get so far.  \"I have to commend you, Lydia.  I only hope that I can have that kind of will power.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"That's Debbie.  And remember, I'm here for you in case you lose hope.  You're really progressing nicely.  I'd hate to see you lose your will\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou thank her profusely.  \"Well, why are you here tonight?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Oh, I'm going to cook for you!  You don't gain 288 pounds without learning a few things about cooking.  You're going to have the Italian feast you won't soon forget!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nAt that moment, Bill walked in carrying bags of groceries.  You help Lydia from her chair and guide her into the kitchen.  At both Lydia and Bill's orders, your not allowed to watch them, leaving you to sit outside the door and smell the glorious food that Lydia is preparing for you.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nAn hour or so later, Bill and Lydia present the meal to you.  You can barely contain your delight as you feel plate after plate with spaghetti, lasagna, fettuccine, Caesar's salads covered in heavy dressings, and large pieces of garlic and butter covered bread.   Bill and Lydia help you the best they can by filling up your empty plates and by occasionally replacing the slowly emptying pans with ones filled with hot, delicious food.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe only reason you stop eating is because your food filled belly is pushing painfully against your pants.  You reach down to unbutton, and possibly unzipped, your pants but the button pops off before you reach it, flying up from its place and landing in a bowl filled with Zita Parmesan.  Lydia lovingly washes the button off and hands it to you.  \"It's your first pop off!\" she exclaims.  \"Keep it.  There's nothing like your first.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou gladly except it.  You know you're just one step closer to being like Greg.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nAs Bill and Lydia leave (taking half the leftovers with them so that they can deal with their glorious feeding), Bill asks what you want to do tomorrow.  \"I can't do anything tomorrow.  I have to go to my mother's house,\" you say with a cringe.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Is she adverse to your gaining?\" asked Bill.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"She doesn't know about it,\" you sighed.  \"I guess I'll find out about it tomorrow.\"</span></div></div>",

Your mother has definitely changed since last you saw her: she's started to get fat.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nWhen she returns, a tray of sandwiches held in her heavier hands, you notice the rest of her gain.  Her face is a bit swallowed in a thin layer of fat.  Her arms are more spherical and her upper arms look sort of dimpled.  Your once flat chested mothers is at least now carrying a C-cup above a round tummy.  \"Mom,\" you ask before stuffing the sandwich in your mouth, \"are you alright?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Oh, I'm fine, honey.  Why?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Well, you just seem a bit different since I last saw you.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"This?\" she asks as she rubs her belly.  She laughs at you as you shake your head.  \"Darling, I've decided to do away with strict dieting and just enjoy life.  Sure, I've gained about 45 pounds, most of it deciding to settle in my lower half, but I've found it interesting to finally be one of those voluptuous women that your father always admired.  Well, since I've gained this weight, you won't believe how amorous we've been.  Why, just the other day...\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Sure mom,\" you muttered, stuffing your third sandwich in your mouth as you try to filter out the details of your parents' romantic excursion.  Gross!  At least your mother is supportive of your weight gain.  As of this day, you've gained about 24 pounds, most of it settling in your stomach, although you're sure that your boobs and butt will catch up with you soon enough.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nBesides, if your mother has had this much good fortune in her relationship after gaining, think of the joy you and Greg will have after yours!
