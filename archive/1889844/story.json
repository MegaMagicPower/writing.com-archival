        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This story takes place in the anime universe of Onmyou Taisenki and focus on Kogenta the anthro Byakko(White Tiger) or Gentarou. Kogenta's fur is white, and his stripes are blue. His eyes are a reddish color.<br>\r\nWhile he strangely never appeared in the anime(except for a very brief silhouette in Naraku/Hell), Gentarou is Kogenta's 'brother' of sorts, looking like him but far more heroic and tall in appearance.<br>\r\nThen again, because Gentarou is technically a rogue Shikigami, he is with kogenta.<br>\r\nSome rules:<br>\r\n- kogenta and gentarou must remain gentle/peaceful<br>\r\n- Nothing dirty, and no profanities.<br>\r\n- if kogenta starts to grow make it slow.<br>\r\n- kogenta's and gentarou's growth in endless.<br>\r\n- No paw stuff or vore. Sorry, but that's not welcome here.<br>\r\n- no Destruction and nobody is killed.<br>\r\n- when kogenta and gentarou grew bigger they can't transform into a Daik\u014djin and their clothes and their swords grew with them.<br>\r\n- even though Shikigami's are immortal kogenta and Gentarou can breathe.<br>\r\n- if kogenta and Gentarou too big they can still fit on earth no matter how big they are<br>\r\n- people did not sceared of kogenta's and Gentarou new size.<br>\r\nI do not own kogenta, Gentarou or related characters.</td>",
