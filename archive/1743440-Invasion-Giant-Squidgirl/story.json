She decided to go outside and do some stretches to help wake herself up. This was where everything went in a not-so-ordinary direction. The instant that she began her stretches, Squidgirl felt a strange tingling sensation in her body. She looked down to see the ground getting farther and farther away. It took a few moments for Squidgirl to register what was going on, but eventually everything clicked: she was growing! She quickly freaked out and began to worry about just how big she would get. As if responding to her thoughts, Squidgirl's body suddenly stopped expanding. She had already doubled in size by this point, and knew that something like this was not natural. She knew that if anyone saw her like this, they would freak out! She began thinking about how she could return to her original size, and reacting to her desires, her body shrunk back to her original size. Finally realizing that the bizarre size changes were being controlled by her thoughts, Squidgirl got a broad smile across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what I should do now... Either way, I ink that this could be really fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nWhat will Squidgirl do next?</i></span></div></div>",

Her new size, combined with the unique abilities she already possessed, made her confident that she could easily conquer all of humanity now. She looked around and saw a notably tall house to her right. Walking up to it, she smirked at what she had planned for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nManipulating her powerful tentacles, she began to effortlessly reduce the building to rubble. Squidgirl's many blue tentacles were ripping the whole structure to shreds, wrapping around the support beams and tearing them straight out of the ground. She watched as her mighty appendages slowly caused the house to collapse inward on itself. Squidgirl felt the surge of evil glee as the building which once towered over her had now been reduced to nothing but a pile of debris at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so inkredible! I'm more powerful than I could have ever swimagined! Now it's time to finally get my squidvasion of humanity started for real!

Who knows what they would say if they woke up and saw me bigger than their house...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquidgirl then walked back inside and prepared a plate of shrimp for breakfast. She had always enjoyed the taste of shrimp, no doubt due to he squid-like nature, and as she was feeling extra hungry this morning, she decided to grab a few more than she usually did. She wasn't paying attention to just how many she had grabbed, but she had actually taken more than twice as many as she normally did! Squidgirl had almost finished off her breakfast platter when Eiko woke up and entered the room. She was clearly still quite tired, and put her hand to her mouth as she let out a yawn. Walking into the kitchen, Eiko then noticed Squidgirl sitting at the table. She still had half a shrimp sticking out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Squidgirl, good morning...\" Eiko mumbled in her half-asleep state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquidgirl responded without even bothering to swallow the shrimp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmemym Emimkom...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't talk with your mouth full, Squidgirl...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEiko's eyes were then drawn to the plate of discarded shrimp tails.

That many shrimp should have lasted you all day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIka then ate the shrimp in her mouth and spit the inedible tail out onto the plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well <i>excuse</i> me... I can't help it if a massive growth spurt makes me hungrier than normal...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, Eiko was confused... Squidgirl was the same size as always... Either way, it was way too early in the morning for her to deal with this, and she was getting rather annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck are you talking about! You're just as short as ever! I bet you're just making up excuses to sneak extra shrimp! At this rate, you'll have to pay us for more than just that massive hole you made in the Lemon Beach House!

She decided to take the day off from her work at the Lemon and just have fun for the day. She had managed to keep her growth under control all day, and nobody but Eiko ever even noticed that anything was different about her. Eiko had allowed Squidgirl to take the day off so that she could have some time to wrap her head around what she had just witnessed, but she didn't want to tell anyone else about it just yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything went great for Squidgirl over the rest of the day, but suddenly things went wrong. As she was riding on the bus, a sudden jolt of electrical energy surged through her body. Her mind blanked out for just an instant, and her growth quickly spiraled out of control. She soon exploded through the roof of the vehicle. In seconds, the whole thing had all but disappeared beneath her massive feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike her previous spurts, where she had grown slowly and focused on keeping her clothing in proportion to her body, this incident of growth was almost instantaneous. As a result, her clothing had been quickly ripped to shreds by her expanding form. Squidgirl now stood fully exposed in the midst of a crowded street. Without her even realizing it, her tentacles had begun to grab several people off the street. One flew right by her mouth, and she instinctively tried to bite down on it. As she caught her own tentacle in her mouth, a group of helpless people who were ensnared by it were dropped onto her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgainst better judgement, Squidgirl swallowed the captive people. However, as the people slid down the moist tunnel of her throat, Squidgirl couldn't help but enjoy the feeling of their pathetic struggles coming from within her. Instead of being mortified by the fact that she had just eaten at least 5 innocent civilians as though they were common shrimp, she just smiled and giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquidgirl then surveyed the rest of the people who had been captured by her tentacles and decided to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She immediately came to her senses, and lowered her tentacles down to release her captives. Sensing that they were still quite terrified, she decided to try and apologize to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Look guys, I'm <i>REALLY</i> sorry for that... I honestly don't know what came over me. Don't worry, I promise that I won't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a tantalizing aroma wafted into Squidgirl's nostrils. Taking a moment to inhale the scent deeply and enjoy the wonderful aroma, she looked down to the source of the smell. She quickly discovered a truck by her feet that was carrying a large delivery of crabs! Squidgirl began drooling at the sight. She immediately scooped up the truck with one of her tentacles and dumped it's driver into the palm of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey little guy... Sorry for this, but I'm <i>REALLY</i> hungry right now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man trembled in fear at that statement. He obviously thought that Squidgirl meant to eat HIM, but his fears were calmed as she set him down onto the roof of a nearby building. She then peeled the back of the truck open like a can of sardines and emptied all of the crabs into her mouth. The driver simply watched in a mixture of relief and confusion as this colossal girl chewed up his delivery and swallowed. Either way, better the crabs than him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*burp* Oh, excuse me... Thanks for the crabs, mister. You can have your truck back now. I'll try to pay you back later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquidgirl then placed the truck back onto the road below. She decided to help the man get back to his vehicle, so she lifted him off the roof with her tentacle and placed him gently next to the empty crab truck. The man quickly (and nervously) thanked her for letting him go, and then drove off as fast as he could. Squidgirl then looked around again to notice that many of the people who she had captured earlier were still standing around watching her. She then realized why; in all the excitement, she hadn't noticed that her dress was shredded in her most recent growth spurt! She quickly blushed and wrapped herself up using her own tentacles as a makeshift bikini. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Feeling incredibly embarrassed by the fact that she had been seen naked by so many people, Squidgirl immediately ran back home. She shrunk back to normal size and entered. She was greeted by a rather surprised Takeru! Takeru simply stared at Squidgirl, who was wearing a tentacle bikini in place of her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm... Good morning Squidgirly... Uh, do I even want to know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long story! I'll explain later, but first I need to get one of my spare dresses!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquidgirl then ran upstairs and into her room. She searched though her closet for a very specific dress, and eventually pulled out one that looked almost identical to all her other ones. The only notable difference, aside from the fact that it was slightly tighter than her usual one, was that the markings around the sleeves, neck hole, and bottom of the dress were red instead of blue. Holding this dress up, Squidgirl allowed her tentacles to relax from the makeshift bikini form she was holding them in and quickly slipped into the dress. The reason she chose this particular one was because of the material it was made of; it was an ultra-stretchy and form fitting fabric that would expand along with her body on its own no matter how fast she grew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* I never thought that I would need to wear THIS dress... I don't really like the color scheme, but at least now I don't have to worry about an accidental growth spurt leaving me naked again... Sheesh... I just can't believe that actually happened! I've never been so squidding embarrassed in my entire life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquidgirl then returned to the room below and ran into Takeru again. This time, she would be able to explain the whole situation to him... He was like a little brother to her, so he probably would think that this was the most amazing thing ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Squidgirly! Cool dress... It's a nice change from that same one that you always wear...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, I don't wear the same dress all the time! I just have a bunch of different ones that look exactly the same... And as for <i>why</i> I'm wearing this thing instead of one of my normal ones, it's because I don't want to outgrow it and wind up naked again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm, I think you lost me there... How exactly did you outgrow your dress? You don't look like you've gained an inch...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquidgirl then began to recount her recent experiences. Starting with the discovery of her new power, and ending with her most embarrassing moment ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you mean to tell me that you can change your size at will now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that red-marked dress is able to grow with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you <i>REALLY</i> ended up naked in the middle of <i>that</i> many people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ye-Hey! Listen Takeru, I don't <i>EVER</i> want to speak of that incident again! You have no idea how embarrassing it is to be the size of a building, completely naked, and surrounded by all those people!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Other than the 'size of a building' part, I've been there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, <b>WHAT</b>?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... One time in first grade, I forgot to get dressed before going off to school... I didn't notice it until I was half way to school, but by that point I had been seen by at least a couple dozen people...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...

I don't think it's a good idea at all, but whatever\" Eiko conceded.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Thank you very much Chizuru, I really appreciate it.\" Squidgirl said, almost moved to tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome. By the way Squidgirl, could you please go on an errand for me?\" Chizuru said, writing down what she needed in a paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I'll be back soon!\" Squidgirl replied cheerfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquidgirl then quickly ran Chizuru's errand so that she could have some free time.

Ika Musume\". One day, Squidgirl wakes up to discover that she somehow gained the ability to grow to the size of a giant squid (that's about 43 ft. tall, just so you know). How will Squidgirl use this new power? Will she maintain the friendly, if not slightly mischievous, personality that she has grown into over the course of the show and use it to help people out? Will she take this as her ticket to fulfilling her original mission of conquering all of humanity? Maybe she'll just use it to go out and have some giantess style fun the way only someone who is part squid can. I'll leave it up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere's some info on the series for those who don't know about it:<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ika_Musume\" target=\"_blank\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ika_Musume</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, for those of you who haven't seen this series and would like to, here are some links to where you can watch it:<br>\r\nDub- <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://dubhappy.com/anime/squid-girl/\" target=\"_blank\">http://dubhappy.com/anime/squid-girl/</a><br>\r\nSub- <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://anilinkz.com/category/shinryaku-ika-musume\" target=\"_blank\">http://anilinkz.com/category/shinryaku-ika-musume</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Squidgirl can only grow to a maximum of 66 feet tall. That is the largest (yet unconfirmed) reported size of a real giant squid. Her size can be anywhere between there and her normal size. She only has the power to grow to the size of a giant squid, and I don't want her to go beyond the that. </span> You know what, screw this rule. Feel free to make her grow as big as you want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Don't write one line chapters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Keep the grammar at a point where I don't need an hour to decipher it. I want to be able to understand what I'm reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) No male giants!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5) Remember: as her name implies, Squidgirl is part squid. Be sure to make use of her tentacles and other squid-like powers. I want to see her using her tentacles to tear buildings off their foundations, or using her squid ink to flood the entire town. Try to make her squid powers remain a common theme so that this doesn't become just another generic giantess story with no original concept. (not that I have anything against those stories, but that's not what this one is meant to be.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6) Just to be clear, Squidgirl is only able to use her power to make <i>herself</i> grow. Not anyone else. Her normal clothes won't grow with her on their own, but she is able to concentrate some of her power on them in order to keep them in proportion to her body. I would like the general assumption to be that she always does this unless otherwise stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7) You can have other female characters grow by means other than Squidgirl's power (Cindy and the scientist guys invent a growth ray that only works on women, radioactive waste contaminated their dinner, whatever crazy excuse you want to come up with), just try to keep giantess Squidgirl as the main focus of the story for the most part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b><u><br>\r\nIn order to improve the reading experience, I'll try to correct any spelling and grammar mistakes I find. I also reserve the right to make minor alterations to chapters if it is necessary to insert detail or correct one of the above rules being broken. If a chapter is too poorly written for me to fix, then it will be deleted. Chapters that I have to delete will not qualify for the GP reward.</u><br>\r\n</b></i></td>",
