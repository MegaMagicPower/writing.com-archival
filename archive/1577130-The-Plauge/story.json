Almost every one I have ever known or loved has fallen victom to this disease. All I have left are Dan, Haily,and Jaden, my closest friends. \"Tiff, its gonna be ok.\" Dan said as he embraced me. \"I'm going to get all of us out of this safely. I promise.\" I sobbed in the comfort of his polo shirt for a few minutes before pulling away from him as I heard foot steps come from behind us. Quickly, I wipped away my tears and faced whoever it was who just came in. It was Haily and Jaden. \"Hey guys! Come look at this!\" Haily exclaimed, motioning for us to follow her and Jaden. Obediantly, we followed them down stairs to see what they wanted to show us. When we reached the end of the staircase, we saw...</span></div></div>",

There's no police left in the city...\" said Dan. \"Well, yea I know, but-\" Hailey angrily cut her off, \"But WHAT, Tiffany?!\" She stood up, with noticed force, and rolled her eyes. \"What's the problem? Just eat the damn food!\" <br>\r\nThe staircase was eerily silent for a moment and suddenly, Jaden scolded Hailey, \"SHUTUP! Stop speaking so loudly, they,\" she jeked her head up the stairs motioning toward the front door,\" might hear you!\" All was silent except for the constant chewing of Dan's mouth against the chips. A noise suddenly emerged from the dark depths of the passageway beyond the base of the stairs. \"What was THAT?\" Hailey said with much fear in her voice.
