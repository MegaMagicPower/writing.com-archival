            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hi. My name's JJ Juspeczyk, and this is my story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the summer I turned 17 when it happened. I lived with my parents, Frank and Amelia; my 14-year-old brother, Frank, Jr.; and my baby sister, Grace, who was 3. Dad was a police detective, and Mom was an architect who worked from home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince it was summer, I was working on my podcast, <i>The J Files</i>. On it, I examined mysteries old and new that had the authorities stumped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWant to know more about me? Well, I was moderately athletic, with light brown hair and seafoam green eyes. Of course, if you were to look at me now, you'd never suspect that I looked like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatter of fact, if you were to look at me now, you wouldn't even suspect you were looking at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen people hear that my podcast is about mysteries, sometimes they assume that I'm doing tons of legwork, following up on leads, or even mixing it up with the bad guys in person. But I don't do that. Even today, I prefer to keep a low profile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, my strategy is completely straightforward: I ask people questions, and they tell me things. Then, I put those things out there on my podcast, and my listeners give the authorities any tips they might have. It's worked pretty well: By the time my life changed, three of the cases I'd spotlighted were officially closed. Officially, the police chalked it up to good police work and cooperation from the public. <i>Un</i>officially, Dad has thanked me three times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy last podcast before the big It happened dealt with a mystery that was close to home, as I told my listeners: Joanna Binkley, my great-great-aunt on my mother's side, had vanished without a trace, back when she was about my age. Everybody looked for her, but nobody could figure out where she went, or who might have gone with her. There was even a spooky bit, which sold me on making it an episode of <i>The J Files</i>, and which I made sure to pass along to my listeners: Several family members said that they had heard her voice after she disappeared. However, when they looked, she wasn't there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter my friend, Izzy, got done editing what I'd recorded, I uploaded it. Then, we blew off some steam at the mall, I had supper and hung out with my family, and I went upstairs to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was the last anyone saw of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, I took a shower. Everything started out normal. The only thing that was <i>different</i> was that, once or twice, I thought I saw the shower head while I had my eyes closed. But neither time lasted for more than a second or two. I chalked it up to a vivid imagination, and finished my shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrapping myself in a towel, I began brushing my teeth. That's when it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne second, I was brushing my teeth. The next, my toothbrush was there, the toothpaste on my teeth was there, and the towel was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I,</i> however, had disappeared, right before my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI closed my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only didn't I reappear, but closing my eyes had no effect at all on what I was seeing. <i>I could see through my eyelids. I could see through</i> me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was invisible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think I was justified in screaming at the top of my lungs.</span></div></div>",

I didn't want Frankie to see me in nothing but a towel, even invisible. \"Yes.\" I opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Mom a minute to process what she was looking at, not that I blamed her. \"Jessica? Are you... there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here,\" I said, nodding, though she couldn't tell. \"I don't know how it happened, but... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute or two, Mom said, \"Finish what you're doing and get dressed. Maybe we can figure something out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust act normal. Okay. That gave me something to do. After the shock, I had no idea how to react. I had no frame of reference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPregnant? I knew girls my age who got pregnant, so I knew how I would feel if it was me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCancer? We'd lost a neighbor to cancer, so I knew how I'd feel about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who the hell turns invisible?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting dressed was a little bit difficult. You get so used to seeing your own body that, when you're invisible, it takes a couple tries to get it right. Finally, though, I stood fully dressed in front of my mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then I watched as my clothes disappeared. \"Shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no alternative, I went downstairs. This took longer, too, without being able to see my feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Dad were talking at the breakfast nook, about me. \"What are we supposed to do about this?\" Dad asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Mom replied. \"Maybe, when she gets down here, we can figure something out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Dad both jumped. \"You startled us,\" Mom said. \"Why didn't you get dressed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>am</i> dressed. My clothes just turned invisible, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie and Grace came downstairs. \"What's going on?\" Frankie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit down,\" I said, \"it's a long story.\"</span></div></div>",

So, where is she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right here,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Garrett looked around. \"Where are you hiding, JJ? And how did you do that with your voice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI picked up her medical bag. \"I'm right here. The problem is, nobody can see me. Not even me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't a lot Dr. Garrett could do in the way of examining me. She could shine a light in my eyes (which was so much worse, now that closing my eyes and covering them with my hand had no effect), but it told her nothing. She checked my ears (invisible) and my throat (ditto). About the only tests she could run were listening to my heart and lungs, and taking my blood pressure. She had as much trouble with this as I had getting dressed. \"Can you tell us anything, Doctor?\" Dad asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, JJ's blood pressure is elevated,\" she replied, \"though that might just be stress. Other than that, all I can say is that she seems to be healthy, as much as I can tell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a little relieved,\" I said. \"I was afraid I'd be poked and prodded, trying to find out why I'm invisible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't know where to start,\" Dr. Garrett said. \"I can't take a blood sample without knowing by sight where your blood vessels are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Dr. Garrett left, I started thinking about what was next. My friends, Izzy and Mina, would be coming over sooner or later. So would my boyfriend, Nick. How would they react when they saw me, or <i>didn't</i> see me?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I got the answer to my first question fifteen minutes after Dad left, when Izzy and Mina came by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy Kessler, as you will recall, was my number one assistant on <i>The J Files</i>, helping me with editing and content. Mina Johnson didn't help with the podcast, but she was my oldest friend. We grew up together. She learned the fastest how to pronounce Juspeczyk (it's \"yoos-PET-chick\"), which certainly got her points from Dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Mrs. Juspeczyk,\" Mina said. \"Is JJ busy? We were hoping to get some shopping done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, she isn't busy, Mina,\" Mom said. \"But I don't know if she feels like going anywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can fix that,\" Izzy said. She was carrying a metal water bottle: she had had a kidney transplant, and needed to stay hydrated. At that moment, she tossed her bottle aside... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n... right into my shin. \"Ouch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, JJ,\" Izzy said, turning in my direction. Then, she turned back where she was going, and made it three steps before she stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to look in my direction. \"JJ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina had seen the whole thing. She came as close as she dared. \"JJ? Are you... there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's left of me,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich caused both of them to freak out, a condition which, in their cases, caused flailing of limbs. When they hit me, they would apologize, then they'd remember why they hit me, which caused them to freak out again. Repeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, they calmed down enough to start asking questions. Unfortunately, most of these were the same questions I'd been dealing with all morning, so there wasn't much new information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what I know,\" I said. \"I'm the only one who's ever turned invisible, and I don't know why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Are</i> you, though?\" Izzy asked. \"<i>Are</i> you the only one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, Izzy?\" Mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The podcast,\" Izzy replied. \"Your great-great-aunt, the one who disappeared? What was that really spooky bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>They thought they heard her,</i>\" Mom said, \"<i>but, when they looked, she wasn't there.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They <i>heard</i> her,\" Izzy said, \"they <i>looked.</i> Well, I hear you, JJ, but, when I look,... \" She gestured at the indentation in the couch cushion, the only visual indication that I was present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom clutched Frankie and Grace to her. \"My babies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure they're fine, Mom,\" I said. \"If Izzy is right, I'm the first in four generations this has happened to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I was pretty sure that Izzy was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, maybe it was wishful thinking, but it fit the facts as well as anything had. And it gave me a frame of reference for what had happened to me: I was invisible because it ran in Mom's family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You couldn't have known,\" I replied.</span></div></div>",

I could hear him rummaging around for something, before his heavy footfalls announced his return. He was carrying a bulky reel-to-reel that looked like a miniature version of an old fashioned computer from the nineteen fifties. \"What on Earth is that, dad?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a modified reel-to-reel recorder that can speed up or slow down a person's voice in real time, so I can better understand what a person is saying during an interview.\" Calmly, Dad replied. \"Those who are excitable tend to talk very fast. Also, there are those who talk very slow for various reasons, and this speeds it up into normal speech.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJo Jo wrote, <i>My mom has something similar.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad set up the recorder, then placed the microphone in front of where Jo Jo was sitting, unseen. He then instructed Jo Jo to say 'hello' again and again as he adjusted the dials. At first, nothing seemed to happen but everyone froze when we heard a voice similar to my own say, \"Hello.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a winner at 15,000 Hz.\" Smiling, Dad said. \"It's just beyond the normal hearing range of the average human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I'm talking in such a high pitch, no one can hear me?\" Worry in her voice, Jo Jo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing that Jo Jo has not fully crossed over into this world.\" Serious, dad explained. \"She is talking through the barrier, which is causing her voice to be too high-pitched for anyone to pick up, other than animals, who have more acute hearing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least we can talk instead of writing everything down.\" Calmly, Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a relief.\" sighing, Jo Jo said. \"I was starting to get cramps from all the writing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise.\" Sighing, I replied. \"How do you make yourself intangible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith my eyes closed, I could see Jo Jo shrug. \"I was thinking about calm waters, a relaxation technique, and it happened...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI drew a cleansing breath then visualized an open beach near the ocean, my own relaxation technique. As I did, I heard gasps in the room. Opening my eyes, I saw that I could see an outline of myself! I was ghostlike, but visible! Only, just as it had happened, I vanished again. I closed my eyes and turned to Jo Jo, who sadly shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured out that I can make myself sort of visible for a short time too.\" Softly, she said. \"Only it's like flexing a rarely used muscle, it tires me out very quickly and leads to cramps later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI winced, feeling a dull ache falling over my body. \"I see what you mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There has to be a way to see or detect both of you.\" Serious, Dad said. \"Perhaps a specific scent, or some form of makeup...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried makeup.\" Serious, Jo Jo said. \"It vanishes the second it is on my face.\" She sighed. \"As for a specific scent, it becomes useless once one becomes used to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There has to be a way.\" Serious, Dad repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only became sort of visible with water on me after a shower.\" Sighing, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad paused then said... \"This might take some time to figure out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dad never quits on a case that is handed to him.\" Looking at Jo Jo, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJo Jo smiled. \"Neither does my mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Dad said, \"It might work...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What might work?\" Curious, Jo Jo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You know, apart from nobody being able to see me. And she promised not to tell anybody about me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. And then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My friends, Izzy and Mina, came over.

To me, being invisible was - <i>is</i> - something I have to deal with.

What do you do with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tell my listeners about mysteries that the authorities haven't been able to solve, and hope that they can come up with the missing pieces. My last one was about an ancestor of mine, who disappeared when she was my age. Izzy and I think it might be connected to my invisibility.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's take a look at that.

I ended up studying parallel worlds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought that was science fiction,\" I said. I winced as soon as I said it. After all, I was in a parallel world, wasn't I?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So did I.\" Ruefully, Joanna replied. \"I began to fantasize over meeting my true love in a parallel universe, a grand adventure, if you will.\" She giggled. \"Little did I know that by doing so, it actually happened, only because someone was doing the same in this universe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So when I began searching for you...\" Stunned, I began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoanna nodded. \"Jo Jo began searching for her great, great uncle.\" Softly, she said. \"You and Jo Jo are invisible because you are in between two universes, neither here or there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how are we...\" Surprised, you began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love, my dear.\" Interrupting me, Joanna said. \"I fell in love here, hence I became visible. A new resident of this universe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll become visible again?\" Hopeful, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoanna shook her head. \"You also have a fast friendship with Jo Jo.\" Serious, she said. \"I'm still an investigator at heart, I can read notes with a glance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I do?\" Worried, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need make a choice or make a balance.\" Serious, Joanna said. \"Forget about me, about Jo Jo, and focus only on your boyfriend, and then you will become visible again; or hold on to me, onto Jo Jo, and become her twin sister in this universe.\" She sighed. \"That is the choice. Now, the balance is to give it all equal attention: then, with time and practice, you can become invisible at will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you be invisible at will?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoanna shook her head. 'I made the choice to remain here, in this universe, where I found love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there any way I can return to my own universe?\" Hopeful, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think of your boyfriend.\" Simply, Joanna replied. \"That is how you get back. He is your beacon of light in the darkness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI closed my eyes and thought about Nick. His loving smile, his protective nature... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I knew it, I was back in my own dining room, where I found my great-great-grandfather standing in the room. I moved a chair to sit down, to which Grandpa smiled. \"Glad to see you made it back, pumpkin.\" Softly, he said. \"How is your great-great-aunt?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When I felt ready, I walked toward the closed door, and then went right through it. <i>Awesome sauce.</i> Then, I went back in, and made myself tangible again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecoming totally silent was a challenge. For a girl who had twice scared the poop out of my parents by surprising them, it was hard getting into the mindset necessary to cancel all noise. I felt like I was studying a martial art.

Remaining invisible, I closed my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, there was a flash of light, and there they were, all set for criminal mischief. I counted three, one for each painting.

And they had no idea that they were leading the police right here, wherever here was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis news gave me my confidence back. \"When I move,\" I whispered to Izzy and Mina, \"you move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crooks lined up the paintings, then lit them with a UV light. \"There's nothing on three of these,\" one said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A set-up,\" the ringleader said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, the windows were lit up from outside. \"<b>This is the police,</b>\" said the familiar voice of my father, over a loudspeaker. \"<b>We have you surrounded. Give yourselves up.</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when I made my move. I turned invisible and intangible, then followed Izzy and Mina. At least, I did, until the ringleader spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for our insurance policy. We use the devisualizer and the teleporter, then leave those girls holding all the evidence. By the time they get it straightened out, if they ever do, we'll be free and clear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, change of plans: Instead of making good my escape, I had to foil their escape. Heading off the crooks, I picked up something heavy and swung at the first machine I reached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI must have hit the right spot, because it blew up as soon as I hit it.</span></div></div>",

These people aren't my enemies: why did I distance myself from them, even for a few days?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, I was leaving the bathroom, when I heard Grace's little voice calling out, \"Mommy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Mom didn't rush right in, I figured she was doing something important (possibly involving homeschooling me), so I knocked on Grace's open door. \"Mom's a little busy,\" I said. \"Can I help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace held up one of her favorite books, <i>The Little Engine that Could</i>. \"Wead,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I'll read to you. Let's get you tucked in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Grace was tucked in snugly-bugly, as we put it in our family, I began to read. For the self-important trains who wouldn't help the circus, I imitated the voices of some of the men I'd butted heads with in my podcasting career. For the Little Engine herself, I imitated Grace's voice, letting her hear herself as the heroine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we got to the end, Grace looked in my direction and said, \"I miss you pwetty.\" Which, I guess, meant she missed seeing my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I miss it, too, Gracie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Mom came in. \"Did I hear you calling, Gracie? Is it time for your story?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JJ wead it,\" Grace replied. \"You can wead me Saggy Baggy.\" <i>The Saggy Baggy Elephant</i> was her second-favorite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI patted Mom on the shoulder, to let her know where I was. \"Thank you, JJ,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" I replied, \"thank <i>you.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I settled in for bed, I wondered, as if for the first time, what taking care of my own children someday would be like. Maybe it would be like me and Grace just now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, let's just hope they don't inherit my opacity-challenged status, or I might spend weeks worrying if I diapered the right end.</span></div></div>",

I knew they weren't heavy, but they might be awkward for her. \"Need some help?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got it,\" she replied. Then, as she carried the table, I heard her repeat to herself, \"I think I can, I think I can, I think I can,\" just like in the story. I guessed that my idea worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorbell rang. Checking the peephole, I saw that it was Izzy and Mina, so I opened the door and let them in. It was time to go over ideas for future installments of <i>The J Files</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, these bull sessions take place around the kitchen table. However, when we walked into the kitchen, Mom and Dad were sitting there. \"What's going on?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi, girls,\" Dad said. \"We've been doing some thinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what?\" Mina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what JJ can do for spending money. It's hard to find a job that doesn't require interacting with the public.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which is hard to do,\" Mom added, \"when you're invisible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's doing it now,\" Izzy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The podcast,\" Izzy explained. \"Already, she conducts interviews over the phone. We haven't had to meet with anyone since we started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you give us $50 a week each,\" Mina added. \"Either you're paying us to hang out with JJ, or we're making bank.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>The J Files</i> has brought in some money, I'll admit,\" Dad said. \"But it's not quite like you think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could try accepting sponsors,\" Izzy suggested. \"You know, online security, that app where they send you food so you can make a fresh meal at home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or we could start offering merch,\" Mina suggested. \"A lot of people want to show their support for our channel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Dad said, \"we'll think about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled. When Dad said he would think about something, it generally meant yes. \"Okay,\" I said, \"we'll be in my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe went upstairs, I checked on Grace (she was satisfied with the redecorating, and was celebrating with a tea party), and we sat on my bed. \"Looks like the future of <i>The J Files</i> is set,\" Mina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you tell?\" Izzy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little things,\" she replied. \" Dad taught me to look for the least little things. I saw your folks nodding at each other while we were talking. I'm pretty sure they're on board.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say,\" I said, \"the future of <i>The J Files</i> is set, in more ways than one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can come and go as I please, with nobody the wiser. Izzy's got some talent for locating me: who knows where it will lead to? And Mina's a natural detective. Put it all together, and we're the team supreme of amateur crimefighting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Mina said. \"The last time we tried going hands-on, we were kidnapped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were still operating solo,\" I countered. \"I'm talking about really working together, as a team. How about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in,\" Izzy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina shrugged. \"Let's give it a shot, see how it goes.\"</span></div></div>",

Then, he ran up to me, hopped up on his hind legs, and began licking my face. \"I guess he missed me,\" I said, turning my face this way and that to keep his tongue out of my mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up, Barney?\" Izzy's mom called out, as she came into the room. \"Is Izzy ho - what in the world?\" Clearly, she was trying to comprehend the sight of the family dog, on his hind legs, licking what looked like air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Mom,\" Izzy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the world is Barney doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's licking my face, Mrs. Kessler,\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JJ?

Mostly, this involved pulling levers and turning knobs. At one point, it involved tapping the machine at a particular spot with the side of a hammer. Finally, she gave a satisfied grunt and turned to us. \"Too much interdimensional travel can knock the machine out of alignment,\" she said. \"When those crooks started their scheme, they probably threw things off enough to dislodge JJ.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So they're why I turned invisible the first time,\" I realized. \"And why I traveled to Jo Jo's world. And now, she can travel to different dimensions easily. She hit the teleporter instead of the devisualizer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next time you see her,\" Mrs. Kessler said, \"warn her not to do too much dimension-hopping. It was only enough to shake things up for you, but too much can open us up for nightmarish other worlds.

I looked up and nearly screamed again as I found myself in the gentle grip of a fifty foot woman! \"Easy there, I have you.\" Gently, she said. \"You are safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help me!\" Terrified, I screamed. \"I can't...\" I screamed again as the bright light took me once more. The girl looked all around, startled, as I had vanished from sight. She turned to a policewoman, who could only shrug. \"There are tales of ghosts reliving their last moments here on Old Town Road, Summer.\" Sadly, she said. \"You may have just witnessed one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the light dimmed again, I found myself facing Dad, and I immediately embraced him, crying my eyes out. \"Please don't let me vanish again!\" Wailing, I begged. \"I'm sorry... I'm sorry... I know you are the real detective!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad returned my embrace, but surprised me upon saying, \"Jay Jay... what happened to turn you into a girl?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStunned, I pushed myself away from Dad, only to find that the man was not my father, as he had Mom's hair and eyes! Terrified, I looked around to find that my friends were now boys. \"Izzy...

At that same time, my world's Izzy and Mina walked in and froze, seeing doubles of all three of us. \"What...?!\" We all blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In my world, Mom managed to repair the two machines.\" Serious, Jo Jo said. \"Only we still need to work fast, before what happened to us both becomes permanent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Izzys walked up to each other, perplexed. \"You are me...\" In unison, they said. They then smiled and said in unison, \"Jinx... you owe me a soda...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Jo Jo and I sighed and said in unison, \"Izzy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith everyone calmed down, we began to compare notes on what we were able to dig up on the device keeping the alternate universes apart from each other. Every now and then, Jo Jo would vanish, but my Izzy seemed to be able to see her clearly, as could my version of Mina. \"That's interesting...\" Thoughtful, Jo Jo said. \"No one in my world can see me while I'm invisible, but your team can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They can't see me while I'm invisible,... can they?\" Wincing, i asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's try it.\" Serious, Jo Jo said. \"Turn invisible, but only focus on that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded and turned invisible, though it was hard not to think of any what ifs. Once I had managed it, I turned to both teams and asked, \"Well, can you see me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can.\" Jo Jo's Izzy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As can I.\" Serious, Jo Jo's Mina added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth my Izzy and Mina shrugged, looking around. \"We can't...\" Softly, they said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is so weird.\" Wincing, I said. I became visible again. \"What do you think that means for any of us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,... I hope.\" Darkly, Jo Jo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that look.\" Worried, I said. \"I've seen it in the mirror. What are you fearing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJo Jo sighed. \"That the device is beginning to fail...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'll have a talk with this Finola.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful.\" Serious, Jo Jo warned. \"If vampires are like what our stories tell...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped at that, then focused on the woman from my first jump and soon found myself again in her presence. Only this time, to my good or bad fortune, she was sitting behind a desk, with a tall and muscular man at her side. She turned to me, then frowned as the man fingered the hilt of a sidearm on a shoulder holster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We meet again, colleen.\" Flatly, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI steeled myself and said, \"We have no time for pleasantries... Finola Vimpir.\" That seemed to have caught her attention, so I continued. \"The tenth level of hell is coming to both our worlds, and I need your help to stop it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinola was silent for a moment before she slowly rose to her feet. \"Explain...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Criminals made use of a device to rob other universes of their riches.\" Serious, I explained. \"Only it has weakened the device you and others had put in place, keeping our worlds apart...I was told you are among the only ones who knows how it works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinola sighed, raising a hand to her head. \"I feared this.\" Shaking her head, she said. She looked at me, her eyes cold. \"What is your name, colleen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JJ Juspeczyk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinola nodded. \"We have a version of you here... a quite annoying but useful self-proclaimed detective named Jay Jade, JJ for short.\" She frowned. \"It will be interesting to see if she is jumping worlds, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Worried, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear, the portal was opened the first time because meddling teens like yourself kept jumping to and fro, to meet other versions of themselves.\" Sternly, Finola said. \"Consider yourself lucky that you are trying to close the device, and it was these criminals you spoke of who weakened it... otherwise...\" She bared her fangs.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I then briefly explained the chain of events and added, \"Now, I seem to have the ability to hop between worlds, and my friend Jo Jo, from another universe, is stuck invisible, unless she concentrates on being visible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinola seemed slightly relieved. \"That means that you two have become linked.\" More calmly, she said. \"It creates a somewhat stable doorway, which will eventually close on its own, solving both of your problems... in theory, that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Finola turned to the man next to him. \"Bring in Jay Jade. We need to determine just how bad this is, and quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man nodded, then left through an elevator. Twenty minutes later, he returned with a girl who looked much like me, only she was apparently a fan of early twenties detective stories, judging by the was she was dressed. She looked like a female version of Dick Tracy. \"What mess are you cleaning up this time, Finola?\" Frowning, Jay Jade demanded. \"I'm in the middle of a mysterious robbery case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess...\" Startling the girl, I said. \"You are dealing with invisible robbers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you...?\" Surprised, Jay Jade demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm JJ Juspeczyk... from another universe.\" Serious, I explained. \"If we do not stop these robbers soon, all hell will break loose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are likely after the map fragments, just like in your world.\" Serious, Finola said. \"I have the key piece here in my office.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we set a trap.\" Nodding, Jay Jade said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried that and got caught.\" Bowing my head, I said. \"That's why I can jump between worlds now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The devices are sensitive.\" Calmly, Finola said. \"We <i>will</i> set a trap, but we will need more than the painting as bait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
