He helped Kairi with building the raft and gather supplies for their trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he got into a fight with Sora, he sighed. Sora and he use to be good friends, but lately they been growing apart. After beating at a race, Riku went into a cave. He found an old drawing that both Kairi and he did when they where younger. Then a stranger in a black robe appeared and told him the island will soon be devoured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora haven't really mature yet, he always challenging him to anything. Riku knew why, both had feeling for Kairi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was lost in thought, Riku looked out his window.

He had to fine both Kairi and Sora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he stepped on the island, Riku looked up and saw some kind of strange vortex in the sky. He had to find his friends and fast, then suddenly those shadow creatures appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiku was unarmed but he dodged them and soon found Sora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Sora we have to fine Kairi !!\" Shouted Riku, Sora just started laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Don't worry Riku, we're finally going to leave this island together.

Riku was about to get closer to Sora, when suddenly he was consumed by a dark vortex beneath him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiku was horrified, he had to find Kairi before something like that happen to her. He was about to leave, when he was surrounded by a large group of those shadow monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all attacked him at once, Riku thought he was dead. Then suddenly a giant key appeared in one of his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the size of a sword, he used this keysword  to destroyed all of those shadow creatures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce done, Riku ran off to search for Kairi. Riku had to fight wave after wave of this shadow creatures. Then he went into the cave, hoping to fine Kairi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw Kairi, but she didn't look good. He ran to her, but Kairi only said his name. Then she vanished in a black wind, Riku was stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe screamed no, as he fell to his knees. He strated to cry, when suddenly he was teleport to an area like the one he has to fight that giant shadow monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiku was puzzled, but then he saw the same shadow monster appeared. Riku was angry and took his frustration out on the monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce defeat, Riku was exhausted as he was consumed by the darkness. He last thoughts where of Kairi, before he lost consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiku slowly opened his eyes, he head a powerful headache. He slowly stood up, it took a few moments for him to get his senses back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around, he was no longer in the island, but in a some strange town. It was dark, and he saw no one.
