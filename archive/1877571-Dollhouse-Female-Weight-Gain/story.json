She is the dream date for some rich and important businessman, Nate Summers who has a fetish about stuffing beautiful women, watching them eat, watching their tight clothes pop/rip off, etc. (and he has ties to the Rossum Corporation). For this engagement, Topher, the LA House's programmer, altered her glands or something to make her gain weight a little bit easier and faster (kind of like what he did to Echo in \"Instinct\" of season 2).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as Helen is concerned, she has always wanted to get fat, but since most guys don't like fat women (and being in southern California isn't helping any) she had never gained a lot of weight on purpose. But all of that changed when she met Nate. She met him while she was at a fancy all-you-can-eat restaurant, stuffing herself after her boyfriend broke up with her for \"getting too fat\" (she only gained 2 pounds). She was wearing a dark red button up t-shirt with the top button unbuttoned to show some cleavage and dark blue pants. She noticed Nate watching her eat a whole cake (about 4 in radius and 1 in tall) all by herself and started to tease him by eating it in a kinky way and \"accidentally\" dropping a few (kind of big) pieces in-between her boobs and asked him to help to get the pieces out since she was using both of her hands (one to feed her, what seems to be, never-ending hunger, and other to hold her plate closer to her mouth). He gladly helped her and feed her the pieces and the rest of the cake (and two more after that one). They talked for a while and Nate invited Helen to his home after she was done with the cakes. Helen, being so full and being comfortable around Nate, just went to sleep in his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As she laid there for a while, she remember what happened last night and turned to see if Nate was with her. He wasn't, which made her cry a bit, thinking that she was just some one night stand or something. Her stomach growled again. As she started to get up, the button on her pants popped off, which made her giggle a little bit. She looked in a nearby mirror to see her new potbelly. and cupped it with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wonder if Nate has any food? Helen wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she made it out of Nate's room, she saw him on a couch, sleeping in a sitting position, and she notices a folded paper and the table in front of the couch with the words \"To Helen\" on it. She picked it up, unfolded it, and started reading:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 As you might have noticed, you decided to \"borrow\" my bed last night (I\"m not mad or anything). I slept on the couch instead of with you so you wouldn't of thought I was talking advantage of you. If you wake up before me, you are welcome to anything I might be laying around in the kitchen.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0-Nate-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen smiled at the fact that Nate didn't leave her, but she smiled even more when she read \"anything\". She really wanted to kiss him but decided not to just in case she woke him up. She walked quietly into Nate's kitchen and saw a box of a dozen creme filled donuts on the counter with another note from Nate. This one read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 These are filled with an extra \"kick\" if you decided to put on a few more pounds of beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen closed her eyes, picturing herself hugging Nate, kissing him, getting bigger for him, having him touch her growing ass, placing his face in her boobs.

She started on her first doughnut and tasted the fatty chocolate creme filling and the rich, thick, glaze. As she savored her first bite, she went to the fridge to see if Nate has any milk. She found a full gallon jug and took it out while she was finishing her first doughnut. Helen didn't even bother getting a glass and just opened the jug and took a moderate sized gulp. She then went back to her doughnuts. She takes a bite of a fatty fried snack, a couple swigs of milk, and repeats this pattern until all of the dozen doughnuts and the jug of milk are gone. <br>\r\nAs she was eating, she felt her body getting bigger and bigger, and she was loving it. Her belly, along with her boobs, pushed out against her buttons, staining them to the limit. Her thighs and ass gotten nice and soft with fat, causing a little tears along the fabric.<br>\r\nHelen let out a little burp and started unbutton her shirt to rub her full, sexy, fat belly. <i>Man, that was so good.</i> she thought.<i>I should go back to sleep.</i><br>\r\nAs she gotten up, her fatter, sexier, body caught her by surprise. All of the weight made her tired, and the fact that she was already sleepy before didn't help any. She decided to lay down on the couch with her legs over the armrest opposite of Nate and her head next to his leg. She drifted into sleep as she was massaged her belly.</span></div></div>",
