You blindly grab a sock and change into it. Imediately you can tell something is wrong, you feel weak. Just then lauren walks in, noticing your abcence she decides she should go to the gym. She begins to change, she grabs some gym clothes out of the cupboard and puts them on, a pair of tight leggins and a fairly tight top which lets her belly show. She then sits on the bed and grabs at the sock drawer, her hand brushes past you, you feel your internal timer reset back to 48 hours. Her hand then comes back and wraps around you. She unravels you and the other sock and begins with puting you on. Her foot was not big but still caused you major discomfort as she squeezed her foot inside of your sock form, to her you are nothing, one of her socks, thats all. Once her foot is in you figure out the problem, this sock is almost worn through right where her big toe is currently wiggling to get comfortable. She suddenly rammed you into a training shoe roughly, not caring if you get damaged, because who cares if a sock gets ripped, she can always get a new one, right? As her foot settles the weight above you vastly increases, lauren has stood up, as she walks outside you are subjected to the full, unaware, farce of her.</span></div></div>",

You see the muscles of her jaw start to move as the faint sound of wood being crushed can be heard. \"Oh no\".</span></div></div>",

She smiled, then looked at an open shoe box with a pair of grey sport shoes. \"I have to leave for a while, the left shoe of that pair i just bought is a little ripped on the inside, while im gone could you try fix it?\". \"Sure\" you say, knowing that if you become the left shoe it will get fixed, not that lauren knows you are planing on becoming her new shoe. With that lauren hugs you, gets up and leaves you with your new body, the left shoe.</span></div></div>",

You grab the left shoe and in a second, you are tightly packed into a box, wrapped in paper. Just then someone came into the room, they came over to your box, closed the lid and sat down next to it. You heard a phone get dialed, \"hey lauren, its becca----yeah im here now-------no just me he mustve left-------the shoes are here yeah------thank you by the way-----its okay if i leave the box?-----okay great, thank youuu\" suddenly the lid was ripped  open and you were grabbed, thrown to the floor and then a huge socked foot crashed down ontop of you. \"Oh no, im a gift for someone, becca she said?\" You thought to yourself under the pressure of the foot. Not long after you were thrown down, you got picked up, you couldnt see beccas face but her body was amazing. Then your vision was cut off by the same black sock being jammed into you, stretching you out, as her foot got fully in and the laces (your arms) were tightened, she stood up, crushing down on you, making you feel faint.<br>\r\nShe bagan to walk, every step was agony, the loud bang as her foot hit the ground threatened to burst your fabric eardrums. She kept walking for 20 minutes, never once thinking her shoe was being tortured, or even that it could be tortured. To her, you were just her new shoe, something she owned, nothing more.</span></div></div>",
