You decided not to tell anyone, \"I mean they would probably send me to, like, area 51 or something for testing\" you think to yourself. You also think about your monkey tail, your parents told you to keep it tucked in when in public because people will think it's weird, and you knew they didn't have one and that other people didn't, but you never thought it was weird. Your parents told you it's a rare thing that some people have, so you just figured that other people who have it just hide it like you do. Now you are beginning to think it's because of the Sayain half in you. Not that it matters, you love your tail. On your way home from school, you couldn't help yourself, you look around to make sure no one is looking, then you pull out your tail and use it to swing from tree to tree, you are used to using your tail like a third arm, and it feels so much more comfortable to keep it out, when it's tucked in it feels all scrunched up and uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are home now. Your dad sees you swinging from your tail and laughs.<br>\r\n\"I guess you figured out that your tail is because of being a Sayain?\" <br>\r\n\"yeah, I was thinking that\" you say and laugh.<br>\r\n\"ready to train son?\" <br>\r\n\"yeah, where's that outfit?\" <br>\r\nHe shows you a dark blue body suit with white gloves and boots and armor that is white with yellow shoulder spikes (it looks like the Sayain armor from DBZ).<br>\r\n\"what do you think?\" he asked.<br>\r\n\"awesome!\" you say. You quickly put it on and it stretches to fit. Your dad then puts on a similar outfit, only bigger of course.<br>\r\n\"this is a Sayain fighting outfit, they were used on planet Vegita. I know how to make them so it doesn't matter if they rip a little.\" <br>\r\nYou and your dad begin fighting, by punching and kicking at first, but your dad tells you not to hold back, he probably won't feel it. So you suddenly release a big blast of energy that hits your dad head on. There is a big explosion, but when the smoke clears your dad is fine and grinning<br>\r\n\"Not bad\" he says. You laugh and feel really proud of yourself.</span></div></div>",

It was merely a ruse tocoax you into Achieving the Super Saiyan or maybe even further beyond.* Yamamoto Jr.: \"But it's absolutely pathetic for someone born with a power level of 7,777! Even my father Yamamoto would be ashamed to call you his grandson if he was still alive! When I was your age my power level wasn't a unimpressive 20x greater than my power level at birth, it was so much more! Your an absolute disgrace to the Saiyan race, I am ashamed to have such a pathetic weakling for a son! You'll never be strong enough to protect the ones you love from any foe! Your too soft! I'm sure If I destroyed everything and everyone you care about you'd be hardened into ruthless elite Saiyan warrior in no time!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-daddy your scaring me! Don't kill them! Plrease don't kill any of them Dad! I'll show no mercy in training, I'll never give up no matter how bruised and beaten I get! Just please don't kill them! If you kill them I will never forgive you! I'll make you suffer before you die by my hands!\" Yamamoto Jr.: \"Then come at me son with everything you've got! Let your Rage push you to even greater heights of power! Show me your Saiyan Pride! Focus on that rage!\" *He Goes Super Sayian after some screams of rage. You could feel your ki rising with your anger as you fought your father despite the blows he did land you continued the onslaught. Soon you transform into Super Sayian after your own shouts of anger. But your father was not impressed yet, he was still stronger than you. You come at him 50x the power, speed, and ferocity of before, your rage and Ki keeps rising as you continue to fight your father. An hour later you had Mastered SSJ, then you soon reach Super Sayian 2 grade 5 for a few minutes than passed out reverting to your base form once you knock out your father reverting him to his base form with a single punch. Saying just before he passes out.* Yamamoto Jr.: \"I knew you could do it son. The only reason I said those awful things as we fought was to coax you into going Super Sayian. You surpassed my expectations mastering Super Sayian so quickly only to then quickly master Super Sayian 2. I'm so proud of you son.\" *You and your father passed out with smiles upon your faces.* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow long does the nap last? </span></div></div>",

You were a bit bruised but nothing some senzu beans couldn't fix, your father however simply had one bruise on his belly.* Yamamoto Jr.: \"How about we image train for a few hours then we can go eat dinner?\" \"Sure Dad! What's image training?\" Yamamoto Jr.: Image training is basically meditating on fighting.\" \"That sounds so cool! Your telling me we can get even stronger without physically exerting ourselves?\" Yamamoto Jr.: \"Precisely my son. I'm so proud of you.\" \"Thank you Dad.\" Yamamoto Jr.: \"Your welcome son. Before you image train as SSJ or SSJ2 I want you to image train concerning your great ape form so you have control when ever you transform into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*For the next few hours you and your father image train. You dedicate one hour to Great Ape, 1 hour to SSJ, and 1 hour to SSJ2. At the end you achieved another transformation beyond SSJ2 but not SSJ3. It was similar to SSJ2 grade 3 with how the muscles bulked up a lot. However like grade 5 their was a significant increase in power and speed. While SSJ2 grade 3 is greater in power than the perfected state that is SSJ2 grade 5. This new transformation you glimpsed was beyond that having both the incredible power increase and an equally incredible speed increase unlike SSJ2 grade 3 which actually loses speed. You decide to put an extra hour into the new form mastering the yellow-green haired muscle bound form, your Ki sky rocketed countinuing to rise even faster once complete control of the form's full power is achieved. Your father was amazed. As you broke him out of his meditation he powers down to base form upon you achieving LSSJ grade 3, the full mastery of the form. Your father Yamamoto Jr. only managed to achieve as far as LSSJ grade 2 during his image training. He was completely speachless, and and filled with pride for you. Nothing does a Saiyan father prouder then being surpassed by their own children.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*You and your father power down to base form and stand up.* Yamamoto Jr.: \"You did it son. You have achieved Legendary Super Saiyan grade 3. You have surpassed me. Imagine if your potential was unlocked. You would be able to go toe to toe with the sayians who saved the earth time and again.\" \"There are other Saiyans on earth? How many full bloods? How many Half bloods? Any quarter Saiyans?\" Yamamoto Jr.: \"2 other full blooded Saiyans, 5 half blood Saiyans, 1 quarter Saiyan. But the 2 other Saiyans and one of their half breed son's are elsewhere. What ever it is I have a feeling they're  doing something crucial to the survival of our universe. Which is Universe 7. Not counting the various timelines of the multiverse Omni-King Zeno created long ago. If you must know about that strange badge you find me wearing sometimes I'm employed under the Supreme Kai of Time. As a member of the Time Patrol. Basically a temporal police force for the multiverse Lord Zeno created, which corrects temporal anomalies.\" <br>\r\n\"That sounds Super cool! Do you have anything to heal us with?\" Yamamoto Jr.: \"I have Senzu beans.\" *He throws you one which you catch, then eat. Your instantly healed, your father eats his and is instantly healed.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Both your Father's stomach and your stomach growled.* Yamamoto Jr: \"Let's head home. I'm sure dinner is ready.\" *You nod and flew home with your father. Indeed dinner was ready the moment you and your father arrived home. Elsewhere the tournament of power is won thanks to Goku and the universes that were erased due the tournament are restored by the power of the Super Dragon Balls. You and your father ate dinner.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens tommorow?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It didn't take long since the teachers had nothing but good things to say. Afterwards you fly away with your father, following him to capsule corp. On the way there he tells you about the Supreme Kais, the Gods of Destruction, Angels, the Grand Priest, and the Omni-King. There was a party going on with a myriad of interesting individuals, 36 of them sharing 3 different sets of 12 unique similar looking garbs, and there was a bountiful feast lieing before everyone. As soon as you and your dad landed he greeted Goku.* Yamamoto Jr.: \"Hello Son Goku. I am Time Patrol Officer Yamamoto Jr. While you have not met me until now, you did however meet one of my fellow Time Patrol Officers when your assitance was required to help defeat Mira. I am a Saiyan. Though my father and I did not believe Freeza was capable of Destroying planet Vegeta as your Father Bardock had claimed. My father and I fled the planet using a battle pods just to be cautious, following your battle pod to Earth but altering where my father and I would land it on the earth. I was only 13 at the time. My mother died of childbirth, my father was always soft on me in regards to emotions since I was the last family member he had left, yet he held nothing back in training. My father trained me until he died on my 18th birthday due to a Saiyan heart virus. The day after his death I met a human girl my age, her and I fell in love, later got married, and had children. *Your father looks to you.* This child here is my 10 year old son, Potaito. He's quite the prodigy, he's even already surpassed me just yesterday on our first day training together.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku: \"It's nice to meet you Yamamoto Jr. Wow. So you've been hiding your power on earth all the years I've lived here? What about Potaito? How did you keep him from killing innocents when he transformed into a Great Ape? Yamamoto Jr.: \"Preasure points are how I kept my son from killing anyone, then I cut off his tail once he is unconscious the few times he has transformed. I've mostly been successful on keeping him from seeing the full moon by keeping him inside always distracted by something he likes so he doesn't get the urge to peak through the blinds or curtains and look at the full moon.\" Vegeta: \"Only an elite could consistantly manage keeping their child from accidentally destroying a planet and suffocating in the vacum of space. Tell me, were you and your father Elites?\" Yamamoto Jr.: \"Yes. Just below the threshold of battle power to be considered Super Elites. Meaning my father and I were at the top of the Elite tier. Just so you know according to The Scroll of Eternity Freeza killed your father King Vegeta prior to destruction of Planet Vegeta. So technically Vegeta you are the king of all Saiyans in universe 7. It is an honor to meet you your majesty. *He bows to Vegeta the way a martial artist would.* Um where is the bathroom?\" *Vegeta tells your father where the bathroom is and your father bolts off to the bathroom.* Goku: \"So how strong are you Potaito?\" \"I would show you now but I don't want to ruin any of the delicious food.\" Goku: \"Heh heh. Good point. You can show after the party, ok?\" \"Ok. But can I reveal my tail ?\" Goku: \"Sure.\" *I reveal my Saiyan tail. It's color matched my white hair. My eye color purple. 4ft tall.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Beerus: \"My word, a Time Patrol Officer and his son? What an unexpected pair of guests. Well what are you waiting for kid? Come enjoy the party. Eat, play games, dance, talk, karaoke, nap. Their are plenty of things you can do.\" *I smiled at Lord Beerus. He smiled back. Considering the events that transpired he was in a joyful mood after the universes which got erased during the tournament were wished back. Beerus was happy that his brother Champa was back. Not that he would ever admit said fact to his brothers face. I go eat, my father returns from the bathroom in his Saiyan armor, and  partakes of the feast along with everyone else. Except Lord Mosco seeing as he is a robot.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what do you do after you ate your fill?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This mans muscles had muscles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, ok I\u2019ll go with you.\u201d You say with a little attitude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow the man into a small dark alleyway, filled with a dirty dumpster, and small pieces of trash on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAm I being mugged?\u201d You think to yourself as you stare at the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man turns around and looks at you, with very serious eyes that Pierced like daggers. The man looks at you for a few minutes before talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk from here we fly.\u201d The man says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren\u2019t sure if you had heard him right, \u201cdid he just say fly?\u201d You thought as you looked at him. \u201cOk this man must be insane.\u201d You think coming to your conclusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrab my hand boy.\u201d The man says reaching out his right hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really didn\u2019t want to, but you had no choice but to comply with this mans orders. Deep down you wanted to cry out for help, but for some reason you really wanted to trust this man, it was as if you knew him from some where, but where. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreaking out of your train of thought you realize that something is wrong, you couldn\u2019t feel the ground under your feet. You slowly look down and realize that you are floating a few feet of the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god what\u2019s happening!\u201d You yell, wrapping your arms around the mans chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing boy?!\u201d The man yells, obviously feeling uncomfortable with you grabbing on to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god, oh my god, oh my god, how is this happening?\u201d You yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust hold on.\u201d The man says breathing hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man flys above the buildings and soon above the clouds, you couldn\u2019t believe that this was happening, were you really flying. You soon realize that the man was flying far away from the city and soon he entered the mountain ranges. You couldn\u2019t help but wonder were was this man taking you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon arrive at a small house surrounded by trees and acres, and acres of grass land. As the man lands on the ground, it takes you a while to regain your walking legs. The man walks up to the door and knocks three times on the wooden door. You couldn\u2019t believe how far away you where from civilization. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA women soon opens the door, you had to admire the women looked beautiful. The women had black hair that was tide up into a small bun with some of her hair coming down to the sides, she wore a purple dress with a orange cloth tied on the top. The women upon seeing the man smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVegeta, it\u2019s so good to see you.\u201d The women says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVegeta so that\u2019s his name.\u201d You thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Chi-Chi, is kakarot here?\u201d Vegeta asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes he\u2019s here why don\u2019t you and your friend come in.\u201d Chi-Chi says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to say you liked this women more than Vegeta. You and Vegeta walk into the house and sit down on the couch. Vegeta sits next to you, and there is nothing but a awkward silence as Chi-Chi goes and gets a guy named Kakarot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo boy what\u2019s your name?\u201d Vegeta asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name? My names Jason Collins.\u201d You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see. Well Jason their is something I have to tell you.\u201d Vegeta says not looking at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you need to tell me?\u201d You ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are a say.....\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Vegeta. How you doing best buddy.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head to see a man with black hair, wearing a orange Gi, with blue boots. The man wore a smile on his face, and Vegetas scowl seem to get even worse, which you liked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s your friend?\u201d The man asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKakarot, this mans name is Jason Collins, and he is the reason why we are hear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakarot walks towards you and sticks out his right hand for a handshake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Jason my names Goku.\u201d The man says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake the mans hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait I thought your name was Kakarot.\u201d You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s my Saiyan name, my earth name is Goku.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh ok, wait what?\u201d You ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we are here, Jason.\u201d You turn and look at Vegeta <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are a Saiyan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(Sorry to say to any readers or the Author of this interactive - THIS is a new beginning. I've been wanting to add to this story, but unfortunately, I didn't like any of the options. So I am commandeering this one to begin a new story...I hope you enjoy it.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll my life...I've felt different. I always believed that there was something off about me - like I didn't belong in my family. I felt like I was just...stuck in their group. I've had a pretty bizarre life. The weirdness started when I was born. When I was about 10 years old, my parents decided to tell me that when I was born, I was born with a tail. I was told that shortly after, they ordered it surgically removed. I didn't think much of it at first...except when it came to my brother. All my life, he made fun of me by calling me \"Monkey-Boy\" or \"Freak\". And I didn't know what he meant until then, so now I felt a bit embarrassed. Whenever I was in school, whenever someone looked at me funny, I felt like they could see it...like my tail was there for all to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finally decided to face the tail-issue head on. I had looked up pictures of infants born with vestigial tails to see what the disfigurement was. It seemed alright to me. But unfortunately because of my curiosity, I was shown a picture my parents took of the tail before I lost it. And to my shock and amazement, it was nothing like the pictures I had seen on the internet; it was much longer, opposable, and hairy. It really did look like a Monkey Tail...Needless to say, I was upset now more than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there were times where my tail was the least of my problems...I seemed to have quite the temper and was more prone to aggression. Usually it was against my older brother, but sometimes I'd lash out at other school kids. It got me in trouble a lot. I tried to control my temper and not cause much trouble...but for some reason I had this desire to fight. Once I started one, I never stopped - like it was an addiction. It made me feel like something that had been missing in my life had been found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as I matured, I began to calm down...for a time. I changed schools and ended up getting bullied again. I tried to resist so much that I just began taking it all in middle school. But everything changed when I reached High School. I had reached my limit so I was done taking it. Luckily I didn't get into any big fights even though someone else always threw the first punch...but it showed me something that day. I realized that even though I wasn't prone to working out or exercising, I somehow naturally bulked up. And with my physique, it showed all those creeps in school that I couldn't be hurt by them. Their punches literally felt like nothing to me. After that, everyone backed down and started leaving me alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that's not where my troubles ended. There were several teachers and administrators at the school who were convinced I was up to no good. They were always messing with me - even in my Senior Year, there were some teachers that I thought I had become friends with, that flat out turned on me and betrayed me. There were times where I wish I could just fly above the school and blow it up in a bright flash of light. Hell - there were times where I got so angry that I actually thought I lifted off the ground. And other times where I thought I could shoot fire and lightning from my hands...But I figured it was just my imagination...I never got anything I wanted in my life; why should I have gotten that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm not surprised that all of this started in my Senior Year...that was a bad year for me. My mother fell ill and had to go to the hospital for major surgery. She was gone for two months. When she came home, she was weak and fragile...and I helped her at every step, without question or even request. There were nights where I even carried her up the stairs. I thought that now that she was home, things would all be good...Except...the worst of our troubles had only just began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe week after Thanksgiving - my father lost his job of over 22 years. The Company - Capsule Corps - fired him, because he took so much time off to be with her in the hospital...And apparently, the new Manager of his branch of engineering didn't like that. I was so angry when I realized that, that I often formulated plans of domestic terrorism against Capsule Corps. How dare they fire a man who's wife just came home from a hospitalization? I wanted to destroy the whole corporation down, just to get back at that Office Skank who fired him. Hell, I'd kill that blue haired slut, Briefs - the owner of the company, just on principal. Does she know what it's like to have lost everything like that?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut things got worse; we held on for my last year of high school. So finally I graduated in the Spring. I remember it as one of the worst weekends of my life. You see - now that I had escaped High School alive, I looked back on my family. I loved my dad...I loved my Mom...I loved my two sisters; they never picked on me as a child. But there was one person in my family that I just despised beyond all...My Older Brother. He did nothing to me but bully and insult me as a kid. He had even attempted to kill me on several occasions by smothering me with a pillow or drowning me. I hated him...and luckily for me...the rest of my family followed suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was always fighting with mom while he lived with us - it was so bad that when he went to college it was a blessing on all of us. But the day my mom went into the Hospital, he clearly thought she was on her death bed. So he let her know just how he really felt about her. Telling her that she was a horrible person who didn't deserve to live. My sisters started a shouting match with him. I was half tempted to grab him and throw him out the window. But he left before I had the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mentioned that mom was home for Thanksgiving. That was a bad weekend too. My brother came to dinner and acted like he hadn't said anything. My sisters finally confronted him - I stayed out of it, because frankly, I'd had my fill of Thanksgiving fights with him over the years. Finally he admitted that he didn't care about any of us - that we as a family meant nothing to him. He left again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo in the months leading up to my Graduation - I tried to get my brother and sisters to reconcile so that we - as a family - could celebrate my graduation. The bastard lied to me about being sorry for what he did, and said he wanted to apologize to my sisters. Did he? No he didn't. But we'll get to that in a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn graduation, there was an irate student who failed to graduate. He showed up at the ceremony with a gun and tried to shoot the principal. I don't know how...but I saw it coming. I leaped at him and tackled him to the ground. I got off of him and tore off my cap and gown. He tried to shoot me, I hesitated when the gun went off, but I rushed toward him anyway. Before I knew it, I seized the gun and threw it away. I then punched him in the face and kicked him away. The police arrested him, and I was commended for my bravery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo we went home together to celebrate - at which point my brother made a big spiel about how I wasn't a Hero, how I was just an idiot. I tried my best not to get angry at him. So I just tried to avoid him the rest of the night. But the next day, while we were waiting for him to wake up so we can go have a celebratory lunch, he wouldn't wake up. My sister went to get him, and he started another argument. This caused God-knows how many shouting matches in our house, until he finally left...The rest of the weekend was ruined because everyone was so angry at him...It was then that I decided how much I hated my worthless brother.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So its the first summer after I graduate. I was on the edge about going to college, because I wanted to stay to help take care of my mom. Plus, due to all the emotional distress in my final year, I got into some problems with the College Placement Tests; I didn't score as high as I wanted. So I set up to retake the test in the fall and got the scores I wanted. I could start college in the following spring...but there was a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy brother got his ass kicked out of his apartment after mouthing off to his roommate. So he had to move back in. The month was December - and ironically, I had just spent the day helping my oldest sister move into her boyfriend's place; apparently I was good for heavy-lifting. So I had to help BOTH of them move that day. Did he thank me? No...what he DID do, was begin a shouting match with our mother about how he doesn't want to be there, so he shouldn't have to help out with anything around the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I got into college just in time...But I always came home as often as I could to take care of mom. Brother didn't like that...he kept trying to intimidate me, to force me to stop coming home. It got so bad that one night, he attacked me. And that's when I realized something...that I wasn't the little Monkey-Kid that he could push around anymore...This time...I fought back. I kicked him into a wall and punched him over and over. I broke his nose and told him that if he ever started this again, I'd break his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was about half-way through the semester. Two months later, I finished and moved back in for the summer. And of course, the idiot started it again. He fought me again. I didn't break his arms...but I shouldn't have held back as much as I did. What I did do, was take him over to the back patio and threw him off the balcony. I dragged him into the street by his ear and told him to get lost, to pack up his crap and go away. I warned him if he ever came near me or my family again, I would kill him. So he packed up and went to live with his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was at that moment where things got better...My father was upset with me for taking the authority to throw him out of the house. But judging by our respective sizes, my father knew he had no authority over me anymore. My mother on the other hand rejoiced that I got rid of that walking piece of shit. But my father was angered by my presumption...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...That's why he told me that I really had no right to. Because he revealed the great secret to me...As it turns out, I wasn't even related to any of them. I was adopted - so to speak. My parents were having a picnic up in the Hills when they overheard my infant cries. They stumbled upon me, finding me in the wreckage of what they had believed to have been an experimental hovercraft. They figured I was definitely special because of my tail - but there were no parents in sight. My father immediately began calling the police to report if anyone had lost a baby with a tail. But my mother loved me from the minute she found me - she said she knew that it was destiny to find me there. And since no one ever came looking for me, she convinced my father to adopt me and add me to the family. My siblings were too young to realize it...but I was their brother in class only.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't know how I felt about this at first. My father flat out told me, that I was a stranger who had forcibly estranged his one and only son and threw him out of his house...He then told me that he was going to call my \"brother\" the next day, and that I was going to beg him to return. I told my father no - that being related to them was trivial. His real son turned his back on him, his wife and his daughters. And i may be the true outsider to the family - but I have claimed his family for my own, and I would protect it from every threat. Because I cared about it more than that slimy bastard ever would...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy father agreed to leave my brother out of the house till he matured a little - but my mother and I made it apparent that he would never be welcomed here again. It didn't matter much - because my father had been unemployed for about a year now, he was no longer able to afford to keep our house. And my wages didn't help as much as I had hoped. So we decided that it was time for a new beginning. We packed up all our stuff into capsules and moved. We made a capsule house up in the mountains and be self sufficient for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe built a well that was fed by a nearby river. I got a new job as a lumberjack as I went to college. And I took care of both my father and my mother since. My father managed to get a new job at a clothing store - it wasn't what he deserved, but he did start to enjoy himself again. Yes...it seemed like our family would finally be okay again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then came the biggest and most hurtful strike against us yet...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I slowly sat up in my bed as he looked at me with tears in his eyes. \"Your grandma just called me...she died ten minutes ago...Your mother is gone.\" My dad began crying...I couldn't believe it. All I could do was hug him and try to comfort him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince my mom's operation, her health was teetering between deterioration and recovery. All of the family drama with me and my brother, and then moving into a smaller house was too much for her. The few months that we lived in that house, no matter what I could do, she just kept getting worse and worse. Finally there were days where she wouldn't get out of bed. So dad and I elected to take her to the hospital. She was there for about a week before they told us that there was nothing they could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFamily members flocked to our house to be with us in our last moments with her. I was dripping with regret and anguish. We moved her to a hospice where they would take care of her until she passed. She fell into a coma in one of her last days and never woke up. She was at the hospice for one day...and she was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo...while my family was reeling from this and waiting for the day of the funeral, my father was working on rebuilding one final bridge. He wanted my brother there to see her before she passed...he refused. Finally, I decided to call him...I told him to forget what happened with us in the past, that he should come back home for the funeral. But he refused, saying he didn't want to see her at all...He didn't care, yet again. I figured that with this refusal, I was certain he was gone for good...And that seemed to be a slight glimmer of hope for me...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still...I was angry at so many things. I was angry that no matter what I could do, she still died. That after all I tried to do, I wasn't strong enough to save her in any way. I was so angry that I began to resent all of the relatives that tried to tell me she was in a better place, that didn't matter to me...I wanted her back...I wanted her here. So now it was just going to be me and my dad...Me and a man who fully didn't consider himself my father no me as his son. But I had to take care of him...cause no one else would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't know how the situation could get worse...but I knew I was reaching my boiling point...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The funeral finally came...I wrote a eulogy to give. Everyone was so heart-struck by it. So much that they were flat out annoyed when my grandfather stepped up to the pulpit to give a service; it was comically apparent that he knew nothing about his daughter-in-law.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the real problems didn't start until after the service was over and everyone began talking...I suddenly saw people that I definitely didn't want to see. People who had no business being around my family or my mother's funeral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first were two teachers I had when I was in High School - they were some of the ones I thought I had become friends with - Dyson and Gale. The Drama Teachers. When I was high school, I discovered I had a talent for acting. I enjoyed being in the plays they would put on. But because my mother was in the hospital and my father was unemployed - I couldn't afford to pay them just for the pleasure of being in their play that year...they turned on me. They treated me like I was a traitor...a worthless vagabond. It was apparent that they didn't care about me; just how they could've profited from me. Seeing them, had me boiling and seething with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" Dyson said to me. \"When we heard about your mom, we knew you had to have been devastated. We came to give our respects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Respects?\" I replied to her. \"...If you had any shred of respect for me, my family, or at the very least my mother, you would've been smart enough to have never showed your face to me at all. You have no place here. Get. Out. Now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...How dare you?\" Gale started. I glared at Gale's face. She was always so ungodly fat and ugly in high school that we started calling her Gale the Whale. She was always a bitch too, so we didn't feel bad about it. And now, she was speaking to me in that arrogant, bitchy tone. \"We come here trying to offer friendship and comfort to you and your family, and you turn us away? You're just the same ungrateful prick you were in high school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ungrateful? I was supposed to be grateful for what you two did to me?!\" I snapped back. \"You turned on me because I couldn't afford to give you money to be in a stupid play - and THEN, you start spreading rumors about me to the other actors in the troupe, and made THEM turn against me! And I'm supposed to be grateful?! Leave now...while I still allow it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a threat?!\" Dyson snapped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to answer her, when I saw the one person who definitely didn't deserve to be there. A few teachers from my elementary school came to the funeral - not for me. Because they were once my mom's co-workers. My mom was a teacher when I was young. Unfortunately that was put to an end when I saw this person walk in - it was the school's principal, Nora Creed. She's the woman...who fired my mother. And when my mom lost that job, she lost so much more. She couldn't get a teaching job anywhere else in the country. She couldn't work, she couldn't do...anything except stay home. And that depressed her. Until a few years ago, when she first went to the hospital and became disabled...In my mind...this woman...STOLE...my mother's life from her and turned her into the miserable old woman who died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pushed past Dyson - my muscles tightening with anger, my teeth clenching. I walked up to Creed, glaring daggers at her. \"What. Do you Think. You are doing here?!\" I snarled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard the news your mother died,\" she said. \"She...was one of my best employees so I -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanted to pay your respects?!\" I yelled back at her. \"If she was one of your best employees then why did you fire her?! You think that nine years is enough time to forgive and forget what you did to her?! You're wrong! We got reminded of what you did to her, every minute of every day! She never recovered from being fired...She couldn't get a job anywhere else! She always considered it a failure. Her confidence and sense of self-worth were SHOT! And after that, she just let herself waste away as her life was taken away from her, bit by bit! And it's all because of YOU!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly on that last syllable, the sleeves of my black dress shirt tore away to reveal the muscles on my arms - they were at least three times larger than they had ever been. Now. I didn't even notice. I barely noticed, but I was so angry right now, that my body was quaking with rage. The entire congregation of mourners turned toward me when they heard me yell. A few tried to move toward me to calm me down, but stopped when they saw a golden aura surround me. Suddenly, the seats across the chapel began to rise off of the ground. Everyone backed away to the walls to watch what would happen. All I could do was glare at Creed as she slowly backed away. There was only one thought that ran through my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...You are going to PAY!!!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I grunted and strained as I looked at her, flexing my muscles. I knew my rage had reached its peak and could stand for this no longer. I would not sit idly by while the people that helped ruin my life smiled through their teeth at me. It's like I was completely unaware of everything that happened around me. I could feel what I was experiencing now was built up of years of repressed anger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd reacted when they heard thunder outside. Golden lightning bolts struck the sides of the church shining through the windows around the building, frightening the crowd. There was one that struck the roof and set the church on fire. But everyone was too afraid to move toward the door where I was confronting creed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could feel something inside of me...Something long dormant, waking up. It was very angry. I didn't know what it was, but I knew that when it came in full, my life would never be the same. I felt it rising...it was about to change me into something else. I was going to transform into a new person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI threw my head back - suddenly my dark black hair flashed shades of golden blonde. It faded as soon as it happened...But it happened again immediately after. I couldn't believe what was happening; this feeling was incredible. I felt like a Nuclear Reactor overloading with energy. I was a literal pillar of Power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, I could feel something inside me snap, and the full reservior of energy explode from within me. My eyes went white for a brief moment as I snapped my head back - my jet black hair shined with golden light. The aura around me pushed out like a powerful wind, knocking the levitating chairs across the church. The spectators had to look away from the light and shield themselves from the flying debris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they finally turned back and saw me, they were astounded. My muscles were much larger than before, my black hair had turned golden blonde, and my once green eyes were now bright blue. I was glaring down at Creed, as if completely unaware of what I had become. I looked so much more imposing over the tiny woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slowly turned toward the crowd and saw my dad and sisters standing near each other. They were completely astounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go now...\" I told them. \"Get the crowd out of the church before this whole place comes down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy father stood there, mouth agape. He looked like a deer caught in the headlights of an oncoming truck. Seeing him be so weak and helpless like this angered me until I finally snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU AGAIN!\" I yelled. \"Get out now! Leave before I do something I'll regret!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy sisters immediately tugged on my fathers arms and pulled him along. Everyone began pouring out of the exits. Dyson and Gale tried to slowly creep around me to escape when suddenly I turned toward them, flexing one of my arms. Suddenly a burst of invisible force flew in front of them, stopping them from leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aren't going anywhere,\" I snarled at them. \"All three of you...you dare show your face to me? After everything that you have done to me and my family - YOU INSULT ME EVEN FURTHER BY BEING HERE TODAY?! Well no more...today, I get the justice and satisfaction that I deserve, and have desired for so long! I'll have to enact it myself...\" I turn to look at Creed again. \"I'm going to start with you...I'm going to Kill you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Creed revealed a Taser-Gun from her purse. She pulled the trigger and the electric wires shot out of the end and struck me in the chest. I didn't even feel the electric discharge running into me. After I flexed my muscles so slightly, I felt a bit of my energy run from my body into the wires and back to the taser-gun. The weapon exploded when the energy returned to it. I suddenly realized that the energy in my body was looking for an escape. And while I might not be able to control it, I could harness it and possibly guide it. Creed on the other hand slowly stepped back - afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's OVER!!! CREED!!!\" I yelled snapping forward - the golden aura around me began to flow, with a notable CHRRRING sound.</span></div></div>",

I suddenly felt all my inhibitions and restraints leave me - not caring what the consequences of this night would be. Creed was sent flying back toward the double doors of the church. I was about to move my legs to sprint after her, when - as if by reflex - my body was pushed forward, by the golden aura around me. I was flying! I'd be more amazed if I wasn't so mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swerved around Creed to wait in her path where I kicked her back into the church. She landed close to Dyson and Gale. I flew toward all three of them. I moved toward Gale and struck her hard in the face - but not enough to knock her back like Creed. I began punching and kicking her all over her body - moving so fast I couldn't even believe it myself. Finally I raised up both my hands, closed my fists together and brought them down on top of her bloody, mangled, head. The strike knocked her to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then looked at Dyson. I panted hard and angry breaths at her. Dyson was the one teacher I thought I could trust the most. And she turned her back on me. I didn't know how or why, but for some reason I was compelled to raise my open hand toward her. I could feel the energy flow through me - like water looking for an escape. Suddenly a ball of yellow light shot from my palm toward Dyson. The flash was so bright that I don't know what happened to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll I remember is the creaking sound above me. The roof of the church gave in and it all came tumbling down on me, burying me in the debris of burning balance beams and ceiling tiles. I blacked out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I open my eyes - I'm staring up at a plaster tile ceiling. I look down - I see the rims of a Hospital Bed - much like the one my mother died in. I get spooked and try to move. I notice an oxygen mask on my face. I slowly lift it off my mouth and breathe in my first bit of air. It feels weak and labored - like my lungs are filled with smoke. I put the mask back on. I look about - I see my left arm has an I.V. line in the wrist. I continue looking about - I see the remote that is connected to the room. I reach over and press the Red Call button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n An alarm was sounded once, and a Nurse soon came into my room. She seemed very surprised and pleased to see me awake. She comes by my bed side. I look up at her, and pull my mask to the side. I ask, \"Where am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright - you were in an accident,\" she said. \"you're in the hospital now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...The Church was struck by lightning,\" she told me. \"The building caught fire and came down. You and a few others stayed behind - I'm assuming to rescue the casket.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when I suddenly remembered everything; I was so concerned with killing Creed, Dyson, and Dale, that I forgot completely about getting mom's body out of there. \"Her Body! My mom - what happened to her body. Did it survive?\" I asked sitting up. The nurse put her hands on my shoulders and calmly laid me back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright - you managed to get her out. You managed to drag the coffin out the front door - but the smoke inhalation caused you to black out, and a piece of the front patio fell on you,\" she told me. \"That was about a week ago...you've been here ever since.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been out for a week...wow,\" he said. I was thinking about everything that happened back then as if it were a crazy dream. Maybe I didn't attack them like that - maybe we spent the entire time trying to get my mom's coffin out the door. \"...The...the others...Where are the others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...uh...I'm sorry to tell you this but, the three women in the church...They died,\" she said. \"We assume once the roof came down, the debris broke one's back, shattered the others' skull...And the third one...Poor thing. The third one just burned to death. Horrible thing...she was burned alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI listened to what she said. I thought about it - they died rather conveniently similar to what I thought happened. I broke Creed's back, crushed Gale's skull...Then threw that energy ball at Dyson...Could it have all been real? It didn't seem possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is my family here?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes - they're all in the waiting room,\" she said. \"They've been informed that you're awake...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon my dad and sisters came into the room. They were followed by my extended relatives and family friends. They began talking about how happy they are that I was awake. I began to sit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right - go tell the doctors to get the paperwork ready; I wanna be discharged,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were in a coma for the good part of a week,\" my sisters said. \"You should continue to rest until they say you're ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse chimed in. \"Well, now that he's awake, his vital signs are returning to normal. He's incredibly healthy considering what he just went through. He must be very strong.\" She took my chart and began writing down some things. She then began to walk to the door. \"I'll go confer with the doctor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse left the room. My grandparents, aunts and uncles left as well, leaving me alone with my dad and two sisters. As soon as they left, my dad's attitude changed. He glared at me and asked, \"Alright - what was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was what?\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what - the funeral...You...got mad and started yelling. Then you...changed. Your hair was glowing...You told us all to get out. But Dale, Dyson, and Creed stayed behind. And only you walk out of there...What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stared wide eyed at him. I couldn't believe it...it actually happened. It was all real. Which meant that you flew around, killed three of the people you hated most in this world with your bare hands, and walked away without so much as a bruise. But then if it did happen, why would I know what it was? And more importantly...why would I confess to murder?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The nurse tells me that the forensic thinks they were killed by the falling debris,\" I said. \"I don't know what else to tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy dad gave me a suspicious look. My sisters shared a look of worry.<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you're alright,\" my dad said leaving the room.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day, the doctors deemed that I had made a full recovery. I was discharged from the Hospital. I was told to take it easy for a while, but I didn't have time for that. Now that I was better, my relatives finally left and went back to their respective homes. It was good because now I had some work to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could often be found out in the woods, trying to figure out just what this \"power\" of mine was. I went out to a secluded location where I wouldn't be disturbed and wouldn't hurt anyone. But no matter what I tried, I couldn't elicit a response. I tried mimicking the same thing that I did in the church - the straining and flexing of muscles and some tight clenching. But I just didn't feel it. I knew it was there deep inside - like a small underground pool. I couldn't get it to rise into a tidal wave like before. I wondered what I was doing wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decided that if I couldn't get myself to turn my hair blonde again, I might as well start with something else. I did fire a ball of light at Dyson, and it incinerated her on contact. I figured that I should try that again. I remember how it felt; my energy was looking for an escape - maybe the energy in me now could do the same. I raised my hand toward one of the trees in a manner I had done a week ago. But nothing happened. It was frustrating. I was beginning to think that whatever I did, it was a one-time fluke. But I couldn't take my mind off of it...I had to try something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I did some research on the internet about the things I did. \"Flying\" for example got a hit. Apparently, a few years ago, the World Martial Arts Champion, Hercule Satan tried to teach a few of his apprentices how to fly - on the basis that his daughter Videl, had learned how. His philosophy was that Human Beings were always meant to fly, but our bodies forgot how to do it. It was all about the manipulation of energy within one's body, known as \"Ki\". His training was a flop, but it was the only lead I had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went back out to the forest. I tried to focus my energy and just will myself off the ground. But I didn't even get so much as a centimeter up. It made me angry and disappointed. It had always been a dream of mine to fly. And thinking about what I did the other night gave me hope. But no matter what I tried, I couldn't get any kind of response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I got an idea. I walked up a tall mountain to the edge of a cliff overlooking the waterfall. I had a feeling already that this was a bad idea. But if what Hercule said was legit, maybe I had to force my body to remember how to fly. Needless to say - this was the only chance I had. I walked back a bit and got a running start. I ran up to the edge and jumped off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I assumed, I didn't take off flying. I began to drop. My body was poised into a nose-dive strait for the ground. I could see the hard ground, and the rocky shores of the river coming closer and closer. The speed of my descent caused my eyes to tear up - I had to squint to keep them open.<br>\r\nAnd all the while, I kept thinking, \"C'mon - fly! Fly! I know you can! Use your forgotten power and FLY!\" I began to feel something - the energy in me was rising. I was a bit relieved and I kept thinking, \"Hurry up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was afraid that it wouldn't be enough to make me fly, because the ground was getting closer and closer - to the point where I must've been within the last twenty feet. I saw the impact coming. Instinctively, I threw up my arms in front of my face and closed my eyes, bracing for the inevitable impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suddenly felt my self stop, suddenly and bobbed a bit. But I hadn't hit the ground! I opened my eyes and looked down. I had to have been ten feet off the ground...I was hovering. I looked over myself; my body was stiff as a board. It looked like I was being suspended from wires or something. But there was nothing there. It's like I was just stuck in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI leaned my head and torso back - my legs swung forward underneath me until I was upright. I was still in the air. My arms were stretched out - like I was in water. I looked about and smiled. I couldn't believe it...I was FLYING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI raised my head and looked up at the distance I had fallen. I put my legs together and raised one hand above my head - focused my energy with my will power and I felt my self rise up into the sky. Within seconds I was above the cliff I had jumped from. I flew away from it. I leveled out my body horizontally and began to leisurely fly over the forest. I couldn't believe how liberating this felt! I decided find out just how fast I could go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI collected the power within me and used it to push off from my position. I shot off like a bullet. I moved so fast that I had to keep my arms at my sides. It was such great fun that I couldn't resist betraying a long \"WHOO!\" every now and then. I lifted my head and torso again and it caused me to rear up. Before I knew it, I was flying in a loop-de-loop. It was better than any roller coaster than I had ever been on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decided to keep playing around with my new power. I flew toward the waterfall and dove down parallel to the falling water. Then when the water crashed into the river down below, I followed the river, easily outmatching the speed of the current. I lazily dipped my hand into the water beneath me to feel the water push against it. This was beyond the greatest day of my life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I began to feel a bit tired. I guess flying actually takes a lot out of the body than I originally thought. So, I decided to land back up on the cliff. I slowly came down. And when I touched the ground again, it was like someone turned the Earth's gravity back on. My knees went weak, and I staggered to stay on my feet. I felt fatigued but it was a great kind - the feeling that lets a man know he accomplished something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI began to jog back home to rest and recover. I was confident that now that I had learned how to fly, that my other abilities would come back. But I still didn't know how to do anything else. I figured that before I went home, I might as well try one last time to illicit that \"Golden\" form again. I proved that I could use my powers without it, but I had a feeling that it would be different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried one more time to do the transformation. But no matter what I did, it didn't do any good. I was getting frustrated, so much so that when I finally gave up, I rushed toward a tree and began barreling my fists into the tree bark, over and over, until the wood of the tree was exposed. I kept thinking about how angry I was. I was angry that mom died, I was angry that those three evil harpies had the nerve to show themselves at her funeral. Then I started thinking about all the kids in high school that teased me and bullied me. I imagined them laughing at me, mocking me for not being able to accomplish anything. And worst of all...I thought about my brother. Every single time I punched the tree, I imagined that it was him. But no matter how many times I struck him, he wouldn't stop laughing. It made me so incredibly angry that my stomach started to boil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it snapped again. I felt the wind pick up around me and my body give off the golden glow. My hair had changed from black to glowing blonde again. I did it! I had done it! I transformed!!! I looked over my hands and felt the power coursing through them. My arms felt unbelievably strong. My hair was flowing - standing up, like I was standing on top of a vent or something. And it felt incredible. I don't know what this power was, but whenever I transformed, I felt there was nothing I couldn't do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's when I realized what the key was - Anger. At the funeral, I was teeming with rage. And that's what first caused me to change. And just now, I got angry by thinking about my brother and all the people who teased me. I now had a trigger to unlock it. And with this trigger, I could use it to train myself to go in and out of this form at will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at my fist, clenched it and smiled. I turned back toward the tree. I pulled my arm back and threw a bunch toward the hole in the bark I made. With a loud crunch and a shower of splinters, my fist completely broke the wood, and the tree came tumbling down. My polite grin became a wide and confident smirk. It was going to be fun using this stuff...The question I would ask myself now was...how would I use it?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I found out that I could change back to my normal form by relaxing and letting my energy drop. Now that my training for that day was over, I went back home to get some lunch. I had never felt hungrier in my life - but unfortunately I couldn't stay long. I had to get to work immediately after. So changed into my work clothes and picked up my axe from the chopping block in the backyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was able to grab an extra-lunch on my break at work. I went into the city. That's when I noticed a billboard. It had Hercule Satan's picture on it. It said he was soon to sponsor an upcoming World Martial Arts Tournament. The next Tournament will be in two years and the grand prize is Ten Million Zeni. Seeing it, my eyes lit up. I realized that with my new found abilities, I could enter that tournament. If I won, I'd be on easy street for the rest of my life. Plus - it would give me a chance to give that Attention Craving Chump-Champ Hercule a well-deserved punch in the nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finished my shift at work, so I began to walk home. I got just outside the city where I felt it was safe. I got a good running start before I leapt into the air and flew the rest of the way to my home. I landed outside my front door. I looked around the forest. I had a feeling that I could win that tournament, but I knew better than to underestimate anyone. I had about two years to hone my skills and get ready. I had a lot of training to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, I woke up and went to the kitchen to prepare myself some breakfast. However I heard my father talking on the phone upstairs. I had a foreboding feeling that this phone call was going to mean bad news for me. I heard him come down the stairs right as I cracked open a few eggs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have something I need to talk to you about,\" he said. The minute he said that, I knew that it was going to upset me. \"Your brother can't stay with his girlfriend anymore. He has to move in with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he said that, I poured the raw eggs from the whisking bowl into an empty glass. I lifted it to my face and swallowed them whole. After I took a few deep breaths after that, I turned to look at him and asked, \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Your brother hasn't been able to get a job,\" he told me. \"His degree...it...Well, his grades weren't good enough for him to be hired in his field. So he's been planning to join the Army to begin Officer's training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so?\" I asked him before pouring a glass of milk. \"So...what exactly happened with his girlfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She has to take care of her grandmother,\" my dad told me. \"So there's no more room for him there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Uh-huh...and do you actually believe that?\" I asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not in the slightest,\" he told me. \"The truth was, he did what he always did. Started yelling at her, abusing her, until she kicked him out. It was either that, or she called the cops on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Typical,\" I said before taking a drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know - the guy has his head up his ass...But he's still my son, and I love him,\" my dad told me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm not your son...does that mean you don't love me?\" I asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy dad was quiet for a moment. \"You may not have been born of me or my wife...but we took you in. We raised you as one of our own, and we do love you. I don't want you to feel like you don't belong in our family. I care about you...just as much as I care about your brother. And while the boy has made mistakes...I can't turn him away.\" He put his hands on my shoulders. \"We're trying to get him enlisted in the Army...It means that he probably won't be here long - one maybe two months. So I'm asking you...regardless of how much you may hate him...please put your differences aside and let him stay here. Make him feel welcomed. Because I don't need this to be any more difficult than it needs to be. I'm going to tell him that if he's going to stay here, he will be polite and respectful. Granted if he agrees, I expect you to extend the same courtesy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was silent for a bit. Since he lost his wife, everyone was telling me how I needed to be strong and let him lean on me for support. So I had to basically go along with whatever he wanted. It's how I supported him...So I knew I couldn't refuse.<br>\r\n\"You know that eventually there's going to be problems,\" I told him. \"You know that...You know what he's like. But if there is to be conflict in this house...then it will not start with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, son,\" he told me. \"I'm going to take the car to go pick him up. We'll be back in about five hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo my father left me alone in the house. Immediately after he left, I went to the garage. I retrieved a weight lifting bench that my brother received from our parents on his fifteenth birthday...never been used. Thinking about him being in our house compelled me to take the set out and begin using it. My anger toward him kept rushing back - I was even angry with my father. The bastard doesn't care about us - doesn't consider us family. He's only coming back to live with us because he has no where else to go. And he wouldn't even show up for his own mother's funeral? Why? Why else? He didn't want to deal with all our crazy relatives! Plus, I found it very convenient that he just moves back in before our mother was even cold in the ground. He hated her most of all...And as soon as she was cut out, he cuts back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust thinking about it made me mad. I resisted letting my power explode for the sake of leaving the house in tact. But I could feel the muscles in my arms and chests tightening, getting stronger from using the weights. I didn't even realize it, but when I stopped, I saw that I had been using every single of the weights that came with the set - the heaviest that I had at my disposal. And all I could think about was, it wasn't enough. I had to lift more to get stronger! I didn't know why...but thinking about my brother motivated me to increase my strength, so that he could never be able to oppress me any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I burned just about every calorie I had taken in that morning. I left the house and went running for a few hours. Every now and then I would stop and punch a tree or a boulder - taking personal satisfaction seeing them shatter. I then realized that building myself up like this was pointless. I was already strong to keep my brother in line...And with that Golden form of mine, he couldn't even dream of beating me. I was going to be alright. I guess it was apparent at the time that I had completely forgotten about the tournament and could only think about my brother. So I went back to my home and showered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I was done, I got dressed and prepared for them to arrive. They did. When he came to the front door, we were staring each other down, not knowing whether to hug or shake hands. We settled on shaking hands until our father told us to hug. After that, I brought in all of his luggage. I suddenly realized why this wasn't going to work. Our house was already very small...and he had too much stuff. Nineteen boxes...All of which had to be left in the main living room - taking up space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, my old weight set,\" he said noticing it on the floor. \"I'm glad you guys kept it. I'm gonna need to start working out to be in shape for the Military.\" He looked at me. \"You lift?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sort of,\" I said. \"I tried it...it's just not doing it for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then noticed that the barbell lying on the ground took up space for his boxes. So he reached down to pick it up and move it...He strained and strained and couldn't lift it. \"Ugh...kind of heavy. Think you can help me move this?\" He moved over to take one end of the barbell. I reached down and lifted the entire bar off the ground with one hand. I moved it into the next room. He watched me with slack-jawed amazement. He couldn't believe that I had done that. Afterwards, he kept shooting me dirty looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few days were calm and uneventful. I went to work and classes when I had to. I came home to find him either working out or using his computer. It was stressful. I was never the best cook, and I had to be the one preparing dinner for me and my father since mom passed. And now that he was here, that was another person I had to cook for. And of course - he made fun of my new appetite every chance he got, saying that with how much I ate, I'd get fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were times in the night where he'd go into psychotic rants about how much he hated our sisters because of their success and happiness. He was convinced that they were at the center of a conspiracy to keep him from succeeding with anything he did. And by God, he annoyed me - using up all the Hot Water in the Showers, and wasting all the toilet paper. Never cleaning any of the dishes he uses. It was hard enough to keep Dad from loosing his mind with grief over Mom without him...Not to mention I was still sick with grief too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'd often have nightmares - bad dreams where I would see her dying right in front of me. But I wasn't allowed to talk to anyone about it. Because my only purpose in life now was to be a rock for the old man...it's like no one gave a damn about how I felt. But I missed my mom...dearly. And every single time she was mentioned in the house...he was always annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt got to the point where when the three of us had a drink together and toasted to mom's memory, he rolled his eyes and sighed. He then said the same speech about how mom is in a better place. But the way he said it was so monotone and so uncaring...that I was convinced that he didn't care about her being dead. And after a while...the fucking fascist tried to get us to stop talking about her all together. To the point of him taking down all of the pictures we had of her. I didn't do anything about it, per my promise to dad...So dad had to do it himself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Needless to say - whenever Dad had to get onto him about something, it wasn't pretty. They got into shouting matches all over. He said our father had no right to tell him how he should feel about anything. It's like the moron didn't even realize he was in OUR house. And he was disrespecting us all over again. It got to the point where I had to start grinding up sleeping pills in his drinks so that he'd be asleep by the time I got home from work. But whenever he wasn't - I always made sure to lock up my axe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there were the days where he got annoyed that I didn't want to stick around with him. He was saying that all he did since he got here was be nice to me, and I'm not even giving him a chance. I tried to walk away, but he just kept trying to get a response from me. Finally I told him how I felt - that he doesn't deserve another second chance after all the second chances I've given him - only to be jilted after each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You came here saying that you were sorry,\" I told him. \"That you were remorseful and wanted a fresh start. But I've heard that story before - you came to my Graduation saying the exact same thing - only to turn around and stab me in the back. You ruined what should've been the greatest weekend of my life. And then you move back in with us without so much as an apology...That was the last year of our mother's life...and you may not have ruined it...but you certainly made it worse. You did nothing but fight with us and try to bully and intimidate me, like you always do. Then you started the fights - you realized that you really woke a sleeping giant, but you're so thick-headed that you kept poking it with a stick. And the fact that you think you can just waltz back in here, after mom died - and get us to expect take what you say at face-value? You've never done anything to give us a reason to trust you...You've fooled us enough times. Now you can stay here to get into the Army...but once you do, neither me, or the girls ever want to see you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think that you can oppress me? I don't have to sit here and take this abuse!\" he said. \"You think I want to be here? I should be out there on my own already - but instead, I'm stuck here in scenic nowhere, dealing with you! You want me gone so badly? Why don't you just throw me out like last time? C'mon Monkey-Boy...hit me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'm not going to hit you,\" I told him. \"I made a promise to Dad that I wouldn't cause conflict...I didn't have to promise him, because you and I both know that the one who causes conflict here is you...So just get into the Army and go live your life. I don't care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So dad is keeping you from throwing me out, huh? Is that because you have no place in this family?\" he said. I had just turned away from him, but his question caused me to slowly turn back to him. \"That's right - I know. You think you're a part of this family? The only reason you're here is because that precious mother of yours found you in the garbage. No parents around though - because they knew where the Garbage like you belonged. Does it make you mad, Monkey Boy? Don't you wanna hit me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I made a promise to Dad that I wouldn't kill you,\" I told him and turned away. I didn't look back, but I could just feel the smug arrogant look that my brother gave me as I walked away. It was at that moment that he knew that I couldn't touch him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, the first month had passed and he finally took the Officer Training entrance exam. And as I expected - the mental, physical, psychological, and ethic tests - he failed every single one of them. Regardless of his college degree, the Army didn't want him as an officer. So when they got home, he was in a shouting match with dad. All the bullshit about how he isn't good enough to do anything. He finally stormed off to his bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it you're aware of the situation?\" dad asked me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hard to miss,\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what he's going to do now,\" Dad told me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Why doesn't he just enlist in the Army?\" I asked him. \"Tell him that's what he needs to do; it's his only option at this point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy dad was a bit side-lined...but it was apparent that was his only option at this point. After a few hours, my dad went up into his room to tell him that there was only one option left. You can guess the reaction the little turd had. He stormed down the stairs, and got in my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to enlist as a soldier?! Why don't YOU do it?!\" he yelled at me. \"I'm an intellectual! I HAVE a brain, and I USE my brain! The Army is for brainless THUGS like you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slowly stood up and looked at him. \"What do you think yelling at me is going to accomplish?\" I asked him. \"You've failed in college, you've failed to keep a job, you've failed to start your career, you've failed in every relationship you have...And now you've failed to get into the army as an officer...What are your other options at this point? Tell me what they are...Because if one of those options benefits from you yelling in my face, I would like to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jerk was seething with rage. He suddenly threw a punch at me. It struck me in the face and his hand gave a notable pop. He pulled back and shook his hand - I didn't react at all. My dad came down and told us both to stop it. But my brother ignored him and punched me in the face again. He was horribly disappointed that his attacks did nothing to me. He went for my midsection and began pummeling away at my abdomen, trying to hurt me - trying desperately to prove he was better than me in some insignificant way. Finally he tired himself out and fell against me crying. I used one of my arms to hold him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate you,\" he sobbed. \"I h-h-hate you! Go away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This...is MY home. You...are the intruder,\" I told him. I then pushed him onto the couch and went outside to chop firewood. I began thinking about some things while I chopped away. My brother wasn't going into the Army. And Summer was just around the corner. I was going to be stuck with him indefinitely now. So we obviously reached a breaking point. But unfortunately, he had no place to go and no prospects. I did have prospects. I figured I would give him one last chance...One final chance to disappoint me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>About a week had gone by and I thought about what I was planning to do. I could feel myself getting stronger by chopping wood - like in Rocky IV. I would practice my skills in flying - I knew the flying would be my key to winning the tournament. If I got knocked out of the ring, I would never touch the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at the billboard for the tournament. I still had near two years to train for it. I was confident that I could win, and I'd make 10 Million Zeni in one hit. I could do anything after that...So, I figured that I should do something about my brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked past me to the kitchen while I was stoking the fire place. I stopped him. He looked at me like I was getting ready to let him have it or something. He was ready for a fight. But I wasn't here to fight him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a proposition for you,\" I said standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Wha'd you have in mind?\" he asked me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you're scared; but you know that going into the Army is the only chance you have now. Boot is going to be hard. But the rewards will be worth it. You'll be a new man...a better man. The Army will pay for your student fees, they'll help you land on your feet, and you will be able to get a job ANYWHERE you go. It sounds like an already good enough deal...but I'm going to sweeten the pot a bit.\" I showed him the flyer for the World Martial Arts Tournament. \"This tournament is in two years. I know I can win it; the Grand Prize for the winner is 10 Million Zeni.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scowled at me when I said 10 Million Zeni. He didn't know how me making all that money was going to help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...here's my offer. Enlist in the Military...Go into it for the minimum that is required. Six months of Boot Camp - and I think...two to five years of service. If you do that - if you do that for me...And I win this tournament. The minute that your service is up, I will give you Two Million Zeni. You can do whatever you want with it. You can reinvest it, you can take it and go retire on an island somewhere; I don't care. So think about it - if you do this, I will guarantee that your life will a whole lot easier. I will make sure of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe crossed his arms and looked at me with such suspicion and disdain. \"So...let me get this strait,\" he started. \"You want me to enroll for Boot Camp, do a service in the Army, probably get myself either dishonorably discharged or killed in action...all based on the hypothetical possibility of you winning a Tournament?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not hypothetical, Bro. I can FEEL it; it's a deadlock,\" I told him. \"Look - something's happened to me. I don't know what, but I know that it's special. I'm getting...stronger...day by day. When you started punching me the other day, I didn't feel anything. I feel like I'm as solid as a rock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A brick wall, more like it,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey - c'mon...I'm offering you a great chance here,\" I told him. \"Just do this one thing for me and I will take care of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take care of ME?!\" he yelled back at me. \"You think I want my little, adoptive brother, taking care of me? And you think this is about me? No...it's about you! You think I believe you're gonna win, or even give me the money if you do win? You just want me gone! You've resented me being here ever since I got here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you're right on that one,\" I said. \"But that doesn't mean I think you shouldn't have a future. And don't think I'm some selfish bastard - the girls AND dad get the same deal as you. Two Million Zeni each. I love my family and I want them to be Happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh - so you're going to give THEM money? They don't need any money from you! They already have success AND happiness without you!\" He yelled at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you can have it too! Just go into the Army and make something of yourself!\" I told him. \"The only reason I offered you the Two Million was to give you something to look forward to once you were out. Something to land on your feet with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can take that money, AND your family and shove it!\" he said. \"I'm not doing what I don't want to do. And because you were dumb enough to make this offer for me; I'm not going ANYWHERE. You better batten down the hatches, Monkey Boy. The Storms' coming in!\" With that he pushed past me and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood there huffing angry and a bit insulted. He wouldn't take the offer of a lifetime JUST because it came from his \"little\" brother. That thick headed moron just buried his head up his own ass, so far that he's coming out his throat. And now he was going to stay here just to spite me.<br>\r\nI decided that if Plan A wasn't going to work, then I had to go with Plan B. I had finally had enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day I began packing my clothes into a bag. When I was certain I had everything I needed, I stopped my dad in the living room.<br>\r\n\"Dad...I've come to a decision,\" I told him. \"Since that...Idiot, isn't going to take the only option he has left...he's going to be stuck here with us indefinitely. And this house isn't big enough for the two of us. So...I'm leaving. I'm going to go check into a motel near the school and the lumbar yard. I'm going to spend the summer trying to find an apartment - maybe move in with a friend. I love you and I wish you luck in dealing with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait - you're leaving?\" he said. \"No - wait a minute.\" He rushed over to me. \"Son, I don't want you to go. Listen, I haven't been saying it much but...I appreciate everything that you've done for me. Since your mom died, you're the only one I can really talk to around here. You're the only one who gives me any semblance of comfort...You can't leave me here with him; he doesn't care that she's gone the same way you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry dad...But unfortunately - he doesn't have any place to go,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you do?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...have the chance to find a place to go,\" I told him. \"I have a good job - I'm in school...I can still have a future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry that you don't like him - but you have to understand; you can't leave. Your income at the yard is what's carrying this house - you pay your own phone bill, you pay insurance on the car. If you leave, and I have to carry this house on my own with my income...this house will go under.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then his time of living here for free is done,\" I told him. \"You need to let him know that if he's going to live here; he's going to get a job - KEEP that job - and pay for his phone, and help pay the bills here. That's your only option.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please - I'm begging you,\" my dad said. \"Don't...go...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Dad, I'm sorry,\" I told him. \"I tried to be fair to you; but you don't seem to realize that a long time ago you were given a choice. A choice between a son who loves you and wants to help you...And a son that doesn't give a damn about anything but himself. And you made the wrong choice, by letting him come back every time, just to pull the same crap he always does. So now...I'm sorry, but I have no other choice. I shouldn't have to live with him. Especially since he doesn't want me here, as much as I don't want him here...Good luck.\" I turned to get my bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy dad was fighting back tears in his eyes. He did look hurt that he was loosing another son. \"Well fine...if that's the way you want it. Just go! We'll be fine without you! He will get a job - he'll help me pay the bills and we'll be just fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa-whoa,\" my brother said now walking into the living room. \"Who said anything about paying bills?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad turned to him and said, \"Your brother is moving out. I can't afford to pay the bills in this place without him. So you have to get a job and you have to help me. First thing - you have to pay that cell phone bill of yours; it's too high.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second - I am NOT helping pay for anything around here,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" My dad looked shocked. I didn't know why. \"Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I get a job, I'm keeping every cent of MY money until I can get a place of my own,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't a discussion,\" my father said. \"If you don't go into the army, then you are getting a job and helping pull your weight around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" my brother said. \"I'm not paying for a goddamn thing. If it comes between living here for free, or being trapped here, paying for your problems...I'd rather be gone,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...But what about your family? I need your help; you don't turn your back on FAMILY!\" dad shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...Don't give a Flying Fuck about Family,\" he said. \"Sorry - but I don't. I don't care about any of you; I'm only here cause I have no where else to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy father finally gave him a look that I had been waiting to see. He was absolutely livid with this boy; he finally reached his breaking point. I knew at that moment, my father realized that I had been saying was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out,\" my father snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you say?\" my brother said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pack your bags and get out of my House - you are no longer welcome here!\" My father shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But - where am I supposed to go?!\" my brother asked - he looked like a deer in headlights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not my problem,\" he said. \"You're not my Son.\" He pointed to me. \"That young man right there...He's my son. He's done more for me than you could ever dream. And he was right; we've given you chance after chance to make up for what you've done - and you stab me in the heart like this? Well no more...we're finished. Get out before I call the police.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy dad turned back toward me and smiled. \"You still want to leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Not on your life,\" I said with a smile. Dad walked toward me with his arms out stretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I didn't believe you,\" he said. But as he came toward me, I saw my brother pull something out of the back of his pants.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I saw the gun appear and instinctively I rush toward my father. \"Dad! Look out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too late - the trigger was pulled and the shot was fired. If I accomplished anything, it's that my dad began to turn, expecting to be attacked with some blunt object or something. The gun was aimed at his spine. But because he turned, the bullet struck him in the lower back - in one of his Kidneys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad screamed and was pushed forward. I grabbed him and slowly lowered him onto the floor. He put a hand to the wound and screamed. I sat by his side - I was so shocked I didn't know what to do. I grabbed his hand and pressed his fingers down harder in the area. He grunted and screamed louder.<br>\r\n\"Just keep putting pressure on it there; it'll stop the bleeding,\" I said. I took his other hand and held it tight in my fist. \"It's going to be okay Dad...it's going to be okay.\" He tried to say something, but he was in too much pain. I was so scared; I don't think I had ever been so scared. I had just lost my Mom; I couldn't loose my dad right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suddenly heard the gun click again. \"This is MY house now,\" I heard him say. Hearing that, all of my fear turned into hot boiling rage. I knew exactly what had to be done now. I slowly turned my head and looked at him with a penetrating gaze. He was smiling back at me. \"I picked this up after what you told me yesterday...You may be immune to my punches. Let's see how you fair against bullets. We're so far from anywhere; no one is going to hear the shots.\" I slowly stood up and glared at him. He pointed the gun at my face. \"So long - Monkey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...Bastard!\" I told him. \"You Ungrateful, Bastard! You Heartless...Soulless...Monster! You shot your own father!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you hear? He's not my father anymore,\" he gloated. \"And besides...no one's gonna miss a washed up old widower like him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't let you get away with this ANYMORE!\" I shouted. I knew what had to be done. My fists clenched so hard that my fingernails cut into y palms. \"I'm going to make you PAY!!!\" On that last syllable I let go. My energy exploded from within me, and I made the transformation. My brother jumped back when he saw my hair go blonde and my body shine with Golden light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the Hell?\" he asked. He glared at him with my shining blue eyes. He sneered and raised his gun again. He fired three rounds. My hand rose up quickly and swooshed across my face three times. He saw that I was unharmed and widened his eyes. I held the clenched fist toward him. I slowly uncurled my fingers, letting all three of the bullets drop to the floor in front of him. He looked at them in shock. He looked back up at me and scowled. \"This is all a trick!\" He raised the gun to my face again and fired off another round. This time, I didn't even bother. The bullet moved so slow that I could've easily dodged. But I had to give my brother a new reason to fear me; I knew this was going to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bullet traveled strait into my left eye. It struck me, compressed upon impact and bounced off of me, without leaving so much as a scratch on me. It dropped to the ground with a clank. My brother looked down on it. He couldn't believe it. He froze up completely this time. His mouth slowly began to drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rushed toward him and seized the gun from his hand. I tightened my grip on the gun. The metal form compressed with my grip until I crumpled it up into a jagged and useless shape. I opened my hand and let it drop to the ground. My brother took one step backward. He finally knew the seriousness of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What...are you?\" he asked me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI scowled at him and said, \"I'm the guy...who's going to kill you.\" Without warning, I swept my fist across his face. His head was forced to the right with the blow - a tooth and a splash of blood escaped his lips. I immediately followed with my left hand. I struck his midsection hard. The blow caused hi to cough up more blood and it knocked his glasses off. I immediately struck him several more times in the same place before pulling my other fist back. I punched him in the face - breaking his nose. The force knocked him against the back-door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was on him before he could recover. I grabbed him and slammed his head against the counter before I threw him out the kitchen window. The glass shattered around him and he landed on the concrete walkway outside. He shielded himself from the glass and the hard ground with his arms. He was riddled with scrapes. He slowly shook his daze away and looked up. He found me standing over him immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe yelled and began crawling away from me. He looked back at me once - but I was no longer standing there. I had gotten in front of him again. When he smacked against my leg, my foot shot up and kicked him in the chin. His hands went to his face as he flew away from the house by the kick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got up on his feet and tried to run away. But he saw me coming after him. I flew toward him with a fist raised high. He ducked and managed to avoid my attack - causing me to strike a tree. In blind frustration, I threw my second fist at the tree's side, shattering the trunk into splinters, causing it to timber. My brother meanwhile had started running again. I watched him go before sprinting after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grabbed the back of his head and pulled him toward me. I punched him hard in the stomach - causing him to cough up blood. He tried to attack me with a hay-maker from the side. I easily blocked it with my arm. Like a snake, I slithered my arm down and wrapped it around his. I pulled it back and snapped it down over my knee. A loud crack was heard and his arm began to bleed. He screamed and staggered back. No doubt his arm was broken. I then swept one fist against the inside of his thigh, breaking his stance. He fell down onto one knee, panting and incredibly hurt. I brought up one foot and heel-kicked him in his stomach, knocking him down completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laid there on the ground and tried to crawl away from me with his one good arm. I stood over him, panting hard, like a mad bull. He looked up at me like a wounded animal - he looked so pathetic. I reached out my hand toward him. I felt my Ki travel through my arm to collect as a ball of light in my hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...I'm going to kill you,\" I told him.</span></div></div>",

He was broken...Bloodied and beaten, he couldn't defend himself at all from me. But best of all...he was in pain. I thought about how much pain my mother was in before she died. The only thing that gave me comfort was that her suffering was over...Death was her escape from pain. I decided that my brother's suffering...had only just begun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lowered my arm and the ball vanished. \"No...I'm not going to kill you. I'm not that nice...You aren't worth it. After all the misery you've caused, you do deserve to die...But I think it's crueler to leave you alive. Your punishment will be long and severe. I want you to know the pain that you're in right now! That's the pain that you've put your own family through! What you've put ME through! And if you ever think of us again, if you even THINK about coming back to us on your hands and knees...I want you to REMEMBER this pain! There is no door...there is no bridge...There is nothing you can do to ever come back into our lives! Now go! Run away! Run away and never return! You can go crawl under a rock and hide somewhere...I don't really care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood up strait and turned away from him and began to walk away. I turned back to look at him once. \"Goodbye Brother...for your sake, I hope we NEVER meet again!\" I rushed toward the house. I know he was still watching as I left. I ran into the house and picked up my father. He was still holding on. My brother watched as I flew off into the sky, carrying my dad in my arms. He couldn't believe what I had done to him and what I was doing now. I hope that was the moment where he realized he and I would never be equals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI flew my father to the Hospital. The orderlies outside were astounded when I flew in and landed at the front entrance.<br>\r\n\"I've got a very hurt man here!\" I yelled to the closest person. Three nurses rushed toward me and another one ran to get a stretcher to bring him into the hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" one asked me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bullet Wound - I think it struck his kidney!\" I told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We gotta get him to the ER, stat!\" she said. They put my dad on the stretcher and began pushing him into the building. I ran alongside him, holding onto his hand the entire way there. I was terrified of what was going to happen. I couldn't loose him too. After everything we'd been through in just the past few months, I couldn't handle anything else like this happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey called in the emergency response on-call Surgeon. They rushed dad into the Operating Room. I wasn't allowed to come in. A nurse directed me to the visitors' observatory where I could watch the operation. But I couldn't watch. I had to step out. I immediately got on the phone and started calling my sisters. They were devastated and dropped everything. They said they would be over within the hour. I suddenly heard some loud beeping coming from the operating room. I froze like a deer in the headlights.</span></div></div>",

I asked her how he was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's doing fine - we had to remove the kidney. You're lucky you got him here when you did; a few more minutes and he'd become septic,\" she told me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remove his Kidney? So...what does this mean, does he need a transplant?\" I asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I doubt it - the body can function with only one kidney; we speculate that he could possibly live for another 20 years before he'd need a transplant. You needn't worry thought - he's very strong and he's pulling through this nicely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later, they patched him back up and moved him into a room to keep an eye on him. They had him on morphine and he was resting comfortably. I was allowed to go in and see him now. I took the chair by the bed and took his hand him my own. After a few minutes I felt him tighten his grip. He rolled his head over and opened his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh-hey...\" he smiled. \"There's my boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled back at him. \"Hey Dad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...I'm a bit groggy; what happened?\" he asked me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...got shot,\" I told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed and leaned his head back. \"I didn't think he'd be that stupid...What did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I took the gun...and he ran off,\" I told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Figures...\" he said. \"The drugs are...making me dizzy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright Dad,\" I told him. \"The doctors told me that you're going to be okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good news,\" he said closing his eyes. \"Y'know...it might just be because I'm on drugs...but I could've sworn we flew here. You were flying...and glowing. Like an Angel...Heh...I finally understand why we found you. You're my Guardian Angel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that made my eyes tear up. I tried to keep smiling as best as I could. I was so relieved that my dad was going to be alright. Before long, the door swung open and my two sisters appeared. They were followed by their respective boyfriend/fiance. The girls rushed to both sides of my dad's bed and took his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy!\" one of them said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay - we're here for you,\" another one said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had excused myself to go talk with the men. The fiance pat me on the back to reassure me.<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" he asked me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...He...was shot,\" I told him - my voice breaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who shot him?\" he asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who do you think?\" I said slowly turning to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...He didn't,\" his eyes lit up with realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We tried to warn you about letting that psycho live with you,\" one of my sisters told dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls - girls,\" I started. \"You need to stay calm. He's already been in surgery. The bullet destroyed his kidney so they had to remove it. The doctors say that he will make a full recovery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" one said as she patted his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA police officer arrived in the room. \"Alright - I'm going to need to speak with the witness. Where's the son?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's me,\" I said standing up. \"I brought him in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cop looked at me strangely. \"The report says you were blonde,\" he told me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah - it's uh...long story; strange genetic anomaly,\" I told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright - I'm going to need a detailed description of what happened,\" he asked me taking his pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well - I had an argument with my brother, so I packed up and was prepared to move out of the house,\" I began. \"My father begged me to stay. My brother started an argument with him. My father decided to kick him out - my brother pulled the gun and shot him. I wrestled the gun from him - fought him off and he ran away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was your brother?\" he asked. \"Do you have a photo, or can you describe him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked over at my sisters and shrugged, \"Broken nose...broken arm...bleeding profusely. Black eye; missing teeth. Five foot seven...receding hairline - with tips of gray. He'll...probably have forest debris on him; broken twigs, dirt, etc.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll send a squad up to your house to secure the area and then we'll organize a search party,\" he said. \"We'll find him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cop left the room. I got on the phone to talk with my father's manager at the store. I told him that he was shot and is going to need time off. She was absolutely flabbergasted by hearing the news - considering he lost his wife. So needless to say, she was very understanding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse then corralled everyone out of the room so that my dad can get some rest. My sisters were relieved that my father was going to be alright. But they also took a small amount of pride from the fact that my brother was now gone for good. They elected that we all go out to eat. But before we left, the nurse took me aside for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe asked me if my dad had any health insurance. I told her that we lost our benefits when he lost his job at Capsule Corps. She then told me about how extensive my father's medical bills were going to be. After that she walked away. I went back to join my family. They were ready to head out. But I told them to go on and I'd meet them later; I wanted to hang about for a few minutes. They left and I was alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at my dad's room number. I slowly walked just a few feet away. I came to a stop in front of my Mom's hospital  room. I walked inside...it was vacant. I slowly walked over to the bed. It was made and well kept. I put my hand on the sheets and slowly ran it over them. I sat in the chair in the corner. I looked through the dark room and kept thinking about how just a few months ago, my mom was here...dying. This...was the last place I talked to her. And she was so zoned out because of the morphine she didn't even understand what I was saying...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made me angry...I started thinking about how she'd still be alive if my dad hadn't lost his job at Capsule Corps! How could they possibly justify firing him just one week after his wife left the hospital! In my mind, they killed her just as much as Creed did! And now, my father is in the hospital as well and could really use his Medical Insurance policy! They are the ones who are getting rich off of hard working people like my father, only to dispose of them after 20 years of service! They are responsible for all the evils that had befallen me...And I hated them so badly. I could only think about one thing...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"BRIEFS!!!\" I shouted before throwing a ball of Ki energy toward the main entrance. I couldn't help myself. I fought my urge at every turn, but I eventually found my way here. Every single night when I came home from the hospital alone - knowing that my father was in the hospital - I couldn't stop thinking about how all of this was THEIR fault. He gave up half his life to them and they just tossed him away like garbage. I was so mad just thinking about it. I began to think that maybe the reason I had gained these new powers was so that I could attain my own personal justice in this world. That I was meant to become this super powered angel meant to avenge my mother's death. And I knew where my first target lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an irritating day for Ingrid Forbes - the manager of Capsule Corps' engineering department on the 16th floor. She'd had this job for two years and was brought in to make the floor more efficient. But ever since she came in, performance had been low. And worse - her new underlings didn't respect her at all. They would constantly mock her behind her back - all because she fired one of their coworkers. She had to do something - quickly. Her performance review was coming up, and if she didn't turn this around by then, heads were going to roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she heard an explosion outside. She looked down and saw a smoke cloud rise from the street. She heard me yell as I swooped over the building, shooting a Ki blast at the front entrance. I then flew into the parking garage and blasted one of the support beams. Smoke escaped the openings from each floor. Eventually the parking deck came tumbling down. She was completely astounded when she saw that. Then suddenly without warning, an individual car was thrown from the ruin of the deck across the street. It was her brand new black sports car. She began to panic now. She turned and began to flee the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will pay for what you did to me!\" I shouted before firing another Ki blast at the building. I didn't know it at the time, but the president and owner of Capsule Corps appeared in her window at the top of the round building. It was Bulma Briefs - a young business-woman with blue hair. She was watching all of this happen. When she saw me throw a few Ki blasts, she rushed to her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad it's me,\" she said. \"Listen we've got a situation over here at Capsule Corps. What's Vegeta doing? Well tell him to stop training and get over here. Oh and call Goku as well - I have a bad feeling about this one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was finished destroying the parking lot. I didn't know what I was hoping to accomplish with this, if anything other than to cause Capsule Corps millions of dollars in property damage. I finally decided that I'd given enough warning shots. So I flew up above the building and finally decided to end it, once and for all. So I knew I'd have to blow this place away - the energy to do so couldn't be contained by only one hand. I put my two hands came together and I gathered my Ki in them. As I suspected, the energy formed into a large energy ball - one as large as my whole body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye!\" I yelled before releasing the blast. The energy ball flew toward the building. My vengeance would be complete in a fiery cataclysm of bright light and black smoke. I watched it intently with a manic gleam in my eyes. But without warning, my hopes were dashed away. A rival energy ball flew in from the side and detonated mine before it could contact with the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised I turned to the ball's point of origin, only to have my cheek collide with a balled fist in a white glove. It struck my cheek hard that I was sent flying down out of the sky. I regained my bearings and forced myself to stay in the air. I looked up at my attacker and I saw...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hey you!\" I heard call to me after I stopped reeling from the attack. I looked up and saw an older man. He wore what looked like a blue jump-suit with no sleeves, and white gloves and boots. His hair stood up strait and was very spiky. His arms and physique looked very toned - I could tell he was already much more stronger than I was. And to make matters worse, he too was flying. He continued yelling at me, \"I was at home, getting some solid training hours in - when I get a call from that woman telling me that you're destroying her business! So now, you're a problem I have to deal with! And since you've disturbed my training, I'm going to work out my frustrations by beating you to a pulp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're flying?!\" I replied. The man seemed a bit shocked at that being the only thing I noticed. He was about to reply with something smart, but I continued before he could. \"You can fly too?! I thought I was the only one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph - yeah right,\" the man continued. \"Sorry to burst your bubble, kid - but flight is a pretty common gift! Case and point - a pathetic human like you can accomplish it. If I were you, I'd take this momentary cease fire to start running. Maybe you can fly, but you're completely out of your league against me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this guy boast so arrogantly in front of me made me angry. He reminded me of my older brother, only more obnoxious.<br>\r\n\"Common gift?\" I began grunting. \"Pathetic human?! ...Out of my League, am I?!\" Like before, I could feel myself get stronger the madder I got. I could feel my muscles tighten and grow. I knew that my physique was outclassed by this guy's in almost every way, but I didn't care. Something inside me was burning and the only relief was to fight. It was pushing me to fight this man. I couldn't take it anymore. 'I'll show you!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly I rushed toward him and pulled back one of my fists. The man was surprised by my boldness. I struck him hard in the face and he reeled back. But unfortunately for me, I could tell the attack didn't do much. He used the momentum I used against him to rebound into a punch of his own directly into my left cheek. And I could feel just how outclassed I was. But I couldn't stop myself now - it was strange, but being hit in the face like that made me feel more alive than I had felt in my 20 years of life. I rebounded and punched toward the man's face. He dodged this time and tried to attack my midsection. I saw the attack coming and blocked it with my knee. Then I swept my other leg across his face and knocked him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I flew toward him, kicking both my feet toward his stomach. They struck him and I began pushing him out of the sky until we crashed into a nearby building. I relented at that point and the man back-springed onto his hands and then his feet. He rushed back to me and we began to exchange blows at a very fast pace. He would land some and I would land some, but more often than not, we would block each other's attacks. And so it continued as we flew across the sky - toe to toe in hand to hand combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally I focused all my concentration into a single attack and forced my fist into this man's stomach. He bent over from the attack. I then brought my hands together and raised them over my head. I brought them down hoping to strike the back of my opponent's head and knock him away. But suddenly, the man vanished and my hands passed through absolute nothing. Suddenly I was struck from behind and sent flying away. The man somehow teleported behind me hit me in the back with his elbow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI flew away for a moment before coming to a stop. The man was standing there with his arms crossed. He looked so smug, it made me sick. I wanted to break this man's neck so badly! I flew towards him getting ready to punch. But when my arm extended to throw a fist, he vanished again. This time he struck me in the back of the shoulder from the side. I grunted for a moment before sweeping my arm to the right to strike him away. But like last time, he teleported again. I suddenly felt him rush into me and strike me with his shoulder. I was pushed back. When I stopped I dragged my leg into a spin kick. But he vanished before I could make contact again. This was getting frustrating. For a time I was doing perfectly fine in this fight, and now I couldn't even hit this guy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" I heard him say in a hushed tone. \"Behind you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slowly turned and saw my opponent hovering there - that smug, shit-eating grin on his face. He wasn't moving to even make an attack. He was staying perfectly still, until he raised one hand and gestured me to come at him. This man's arrogance was very frustrating. It was how my brother used to be when I was a small child and he would beat me up. I yelled as I threw my next attack, a strong jab to his face. But he went under it and uppercut me in the jaw forcing me to look up in the sky and arch backward. Blood flew from my mouth. Suddenly the man spun around and kicked his right leg into my stomach, knocking me away. I flew a distance away until I stopped. I hovered there, glaring at him, wiping the blood from my lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must admit - dealing with you took a lot more energy than I thought it would. I underestimated what you were made of,\" he said. \"But still, you're no match for me. I'm on a completely different level than you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gritted my teeth at him as blood continued to seep through them. I clenched my fists and my anger rose, higher and higher. Regardless of my hurt pride or not, I knew that this man spoke the truth. I was completely outclassed. I was no match for him...as I was. But I knew that I still had one ace in the hole...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

TOO FAR TO FAIL NOW!\" I shouted at him as I clenched my fists and tightened my muscles. \"And I won't let an arrogant, pompous, egotist like you stand in my way!\" The golden aura appeared around my body as I felt my energy charge up. My opponent suddenly leaned back, watching me with wide eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It...Can't be...\" he said quietly. My muscles grew larger. I could feel myself reaching my maximum power. I finally decided to let go. My energy blew my hair back and it transformed into it's shining golden color. My opponent was pushed back a bit as he stared at me. \"That's impossible!\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I wasn't there to hear it, but in the Capsule Corps office building, Bulma Briefs was watching the battle take place from her office. She watched me begin my strange transformation in wide eyes. She was in just as much disbelief as the man I was fighting. Like I said - I wasn't there to hear it - but in her disbelief, she uttered what would be the four most important words I'd come to know in my entire life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's...a Super Saiyan,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood there, my arms at my side. My golden aura shining around me. I finally lifted my head up to look at my opponent. He was stunned with awe. Seeing that arrogant smirk wiped off his face made me smile.<br>\r\n\"Judging by your confused look, you're probably realizing how badly you've underestimated me. I'm a lot stronger than you thought,\" I told him. I poised myself to take off toward him and clenched my fists again. \"Let me show you what I'm REALLY made of!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suddenly rushed toward him and struck him hard in the face knocking him off to the side. I stopped and quickly dashed off in the direction I sent him. I was pleased to see that in my Golden Form, I was faster as well. I flew behind him and struck him with my elbow when he reached me. Stopping him on impact, I turned and began to punch and kick him several times all within the blink of an eye. I knocked him back and rushed on him again, this time kicking him in the face. I dropped down low and grabbed one of his legs. I began to spin, twirling him around and around until I finally threw him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rushed toward him again and balled my fists together over my head. This time I succeeded in slamming them down on his head. He began to fall out of the sky. I quickly dive-bombed toward him and pressed both my hands into his body. He struck the asphalt of the street, making a large crater. I hovered over him, continuing to rapidly barrel my fists into his face and stomach. Each blow I landed made a satisfying smacking sound - I could see blood flying from his mouth and bruises forming on his face. He finally raised his arms up in front of him to block some of my attacks, His defense helped as I could not penetrate it - but it was apparent that I wasn't going to relent my assault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ENOUGH!!!\" he shouted. He spread his arms and legs away from his body and suddenly a blue shock-wave - forming a blue sphere around him - appeared and knocked me away. The force of the wave sent my flying up into the sky in a spin. But I soon recovered and immediately flew back to the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the explosive wave, he had gotten back on his feet. The wave went down just in time for me to tackle him and wrap my arms around his waist. I carried him up into the sky again where I strongly struck him in the ribs. I then released him only to punch him hard in the face - the force of which turned him around completely. I then grabbed his left shoulder and with my free hand, struck him sharply in the kidneys, over and over again. He was able to resist though - his tolerance for pain must've been very high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe regained his composure and managed to turn on me and elbow me in the face before backhanding me with his fist. When his spin completed, he struck me again with his other fist. But like the others who tried to attack me in this form, they didn't do anything. Well, that's not true; this man was indeed strong. When his attack was completed, I paused for a minute, turned to the side and spat out a bit of blood before wiping my lip. I then swatted him back and rushed toward him, punching and kicking him quickly like before. I finally brought back one fist and struck him as hard as I could in his face, knocking him back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finally stopped, and panted hard with a confident smile on my face. He still hadn't straightened out to face me, so I figured that last one finally knocked him silly. \"Well...you look like you've had enough,\" I told him. \"Now do yourself a favor and stay out of my way! I've got a lot of business to finish here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly I heard him laughing. I was a bit surprised he was still conscious. He slowly lowered his head to me, to show me that confident grin on his smug face. He brought up one hand and wiped the blood from his lips on the back of his gloved hand.<br>\r\n\"Heh...impressive. It's clear that I seriously underestimated you,\" he said. \"But you've made the same mistake. You shouldn't get so confident kid...You clearly don't know who you're up against.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minute he finished that last statement, I saw a familiar golden glow appear...around <i>him</i>. My eyes went wide. I began to get a bit afraid. My arms, poised in an offensive fighting pose, now went limp and lowered, in a fearful defensive stance. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw that light appear. Then I felt it - something in my gut was telling me I was in trouble. The only way I could describe this feeling was that it told me something akin to a power generator reaching Critical Mass...I began to think it was my body's way of warning me that my opponent's power was increasing. And if he was glowing with the same golden light...there could be only one explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-n-no...It can't be,\" I said. \"Anything but that.\" I denied it at every step and begged the universe not to let it be true. If it was, I knew the kind of situation I'd be in.</span></div></div>",

His energy exploded and the same kind of wind began to rapidly flow around him. I stared wide eyed as I watched his jet-black hair change to a glowing golden blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was taken aback. When I saw this. It was like looking into a mirror. I was absolutely terrified by it. Or at least I was at first. Now I was overcome with this burning curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, what do you think now?\" this <i>Vegeta</i> person asked me. \"What's the matter? What happened to that confident smirk you were just wearing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tilted my head and crossed my arms. I then brought one hand to my chin. My nonchalant and curious expression angered him. I began to hover in a circle around him - slowly. I was examining him - trying to tell if this really was the same transformation. So far it seemed to be the same. But what did this mean? Could it mean that this man was related to me somehow? Could we be kin?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...You can become one too,\" I said. \"I thought I was the only one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh - while flying is quite a common gift, this transformation is not,\" Vegeta told me. \"I'm impressed that someone as...unimpressive as you, could achieve this Legendary status. Unfortunately, you're a little late to the party. And even this form, unobtainable to so many, is no longer unique. And it's nothing compared to my FULL Power! But even this will be enough to put you in your place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat threw me a bit. He transformed into...well whatever I was, and he wasn't even at his full power? I was beginning to realize just how serious my situation was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I don't know where you came from,\" Vegeta said. \"Or how you have achieved such a transformation. I guess I'll just have to leave you alive long enough to get some answers from you - even if I have to beat them from your bloodied carcass!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta suddenly rushed toward me. It was strange - like seeing a ghost of myself, from the point of view of all the people I had beaten up with this form. They felt so outclassed that they knew not to even bother fighting back. But I know I had to try to fight, because if I didn't, he'd only kill me faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe threw a punch at me. I threw up my arms to block it. But with his increased speed he threw a second, one that I couldn't block. He proceeded to pummel me in the same manner as I had done earlier. I tried to keep my hands up to block his assault. I managed to avoid most of the blows, but he'd get several quick strikes in. He hit hard and he hit fast. After just the first few punches to the face, I was dazed. It's like I could feel my brain being knocked back and forth inside of my skull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually my defenses completely dropped and I was knocked away. Vegeta pursued me and struck me hard in the stomach, causing me to spit up blood. He then knocked me out of the sky with the back of his fist. I landed with a crash. When I regained my composure and got back on my feet, I knew I was definitely in trouble. I saw him flying toward me. I back-flipped out of the way so that I could avoid the incoming strike. He landed where I was standing. When he touched down, I quickly rushed him trying to catch him off guard. But he was able to block all my attacks before kicking me in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battle took to the skies again. I kept trying to attack him, but he kept dodging my attacks. He wasn't teleporting like last time, but the confident grin on his face led me to believe he was just playing with me. He finally decided to hit me again in the face. And then again in the stomach. He grabbed my arms, pulled me over his shoulder and tossed me away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was dazed, hurting, and bleeding. I didn't know how much more of this fight I could take. I was without a doubt outmatched. It was like my entire life came back to haunt me. No matter how strong I was, my brother could always beat me down. Whenever I had something special, someone else would come along and take it away from me. Unfortunately, my older brother had been replaced with this Vegeta guy. And seeing him stand over me, all proud like he ruled the world was too much to bear. But he was so much stronger than I was. So what could I do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began laughing. \"Well that was fun,\" he said. \"By now I bet you're thinking you can't take much more. Bit off more than you could chew? Fools like you always do. But I've grown bored of this game - whatever challenge you posed to me before is long since gone now. It's finally time to finish you off! Say your prayers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was I to do now?</span></div></div>",

I began to pummel his face as quickly as I could. Vegeta put his hands up again to block my attacks and divert them away. He began to return his own. I blocked most of them, but I just barreled through the pain of the attacks he landed. He punched toward me - I now had an opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sidestepped out of the way of the attack, raising my right arm. I snapped my elbow down on his, and locked his arm against my side. He was surprised that I now had him in a lock. Suddenly I thrust my left fist into his face over and over. He'd reel back from each strike and would be pulled back forward because of his restrained arm, bringing his face back into my fist every time I threw another punch. I now managed to get his nose to bleed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cycle ended when he managed to throw up his hand and grab my wrist. He then tied up my arm in his - locking me in a similar fashion to what I had done. We were both restrained, unable to move now. Vegeta was smiling.<br>\r\n\"It appears we've reached an impasse,\" he said with that confident smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI said nothing, other than gritting my teeth. I leaned my head back and suddenly thrust it into Vegeta's face. He grunted in pain upon impact, but I wasn't done. I headbutted him again, and again, and again until his grip on my arm released. I then released his arm, and both of his hands went to his face after the final headbutt knocked him back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAARGH!\" he yelled as his hands went to his bruised face. I wiped some sweat from my forehead, lightly feeling a bruise on the top of my head. He continued to grunt and shake. \"UGH! WHAT'S YOUR HEAD MADE OUT OF?! Your skull must be thicker than Kakarot's!!! OW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kakarot, huh?\" I asked. \"Is that a friend of yours? Good - once I'm done with you; he's next!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally pulled his hands away from his face slowly to glare at me. \"Don't. Get. So. CONFIDENT!!!\" he yelled at me. Out of nowhere he began shooting Ki Blasts at me. Seeing them, I instinctively began flying off to the side. He pursued me and began shooting where I was going to be. I stopped when I got wise to his plan and immediately began flying towards him. He shot strait at me. I evaded by going under, and by then I was on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI struck him hard in the stomach. He grunted and bent over, clutching his stomach. I got above him and grabbed his head, locking it the curve of my elbow, to keep him facing down. Now that his head was locked he began to thrash about - but I had used this technique on my brother often. I knew I had him. I raised my hand and began punching him in the right kidney. He grunted and yelled with each strike. I kept hitting him as hard as I could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after a few strikes, showing amazing acrobatic ability, he flung the lower half of his body up toward me. Before I knew it, my head was seized between his legs. After the initial shock, I had to release his head to try and pry his thighs off of my neck before I choked. He suddenly sprang the top half of his body up and began to punch me in the face several times. He finally pulled back for a stronger punch. When it connected with my nose, he released his legs allowing me to fly back. He then kicked me away, making me fly faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will not be humiliated by ANOTHER Lower-Class Weakling like you!\" he said. I grinned. Not only did I hurt his body, but I hurt his pride as well. I was ready - he might be stronger than me, but at this point, there was no way I was ever going to stop. I'd keep coming at him from every angle I could. And I would eventually wear him down. I couldn't wait to see the look on his face when he realized that a Pathetic Human was the one who beat him. \"You think you're so tough?!\" he asked me. \"Wait until you handle THIS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stretched a hand toward me. I saw his palm light up with a Ki Blast. But this one was different - it was bluish white instead of yellow like normal. And as soon as he formed it in his hand, it suddenly began to grow. It was much larger than any I had fired - even the double large one I fired at Capsule Corps a few minutes ago. It was gigantic!<br>\r\n\"Let's see how confident you are after my favorite technique,\" he said. \"MY BIG BANG ATTACK!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bent his arm back and snapped it forward - firing the Energy Ball. It came at me like a Meteor! This time, it was I trapped like a deer in the headlights of an oncoming car. Except THIS time, it was like an oncoming train! All that energy would without a doubt vaporize me! I had to dodge, but I looked back on the street behind me. It was facing away from Capsule Corps, and was going to strike the street and take out a few buildings. Worst of all, there were also people on the street who had gathered to watch the fight. If I moved out of the way, the blast would kill them instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I was more than willing to take down Capsule Corps because I was angry, I couldn't condone these people being killed because of me. They were innocent in all of this. I looked forward and the ball was coming closer. What was I going to do? Could I...possibly catch it and throw it away? Or would I dodge and let them suffer because of my foolishness? My conscience got the better of me and I knew what had to be done. I threw up my arms out in front of me with the intent of stopping the attack.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I held my arms out to stop Vegeta's \"Big Bang Attack\" - if it was anything like it's namesake, I knew I couldn't let this ball touch the Earth. It was approaching fast. It was already so close that I could feel my hands and arms burning. It felt like the sun was coming right at me. I overestimated myself yet again. Maybe perhaps with me in its path, the ball would explode and just take me out with it. At least my conscience would be clear. I turned my head away and closed my eyes and waited for the inevitable pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly I felt that strange feeling again. I opened my eyes as it shot through my mind. It gave me this gut feeling that there was someone else here. Vegeta? No - not Vegeta. It was someone else...Someone stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAAAAAAAAAAA!!!\" I heard someone yell. It wasn't Vegeta - it was someone else. Suddenly - a bright blue light shined across the area - striking against our bodies - Vegeta's and mine. From off to the left side above each of us, a blue energy beam was fired. It struck the Big Bang Energy Ball and began to push it out of the collision course with me. The ball was pushed away until it exploded harmlessly above the buildings. The force of the blast pushed smoke and wind toward me and Vegeta. I covered my eyes with my arms to protect myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the dust settled I looked about for whoever shot the beam. I suddenly spotted a man hovering in the sky above us. He was wearing a large, orange, training gi over a deep blue undershirt. He wore matching dark blue wrist-bands and boots, and he had a dark blue sash tied around his waist to serve as little more than a belt. His hair was dark black and was spiky in a strange formation. I honestly wouldn't know how to describe it in words.<br>\r\nHe hovered there, panting - his two arms outstretched toward the area between Vegeta and myself. I saw smoke rising from his outstretched palms and he took heavy, panting breaths. I looked at the face of this man and I got that feeling again. It gave me a different feeling than when I sensed Vegeta. Something inside me told me that this person was a good man...a kind man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Vegeta - what's the matter with you?!\" he yelled at him. \"With that much energy, you could've blown the whole city up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta growled in frustration. \"Grrrrr - I should've known you'd show yourself sooner or later, Kakarot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Kakarot?!</i> I thought to myself. I looked up at him again. <i>So...that guy is friends with this Jerk? He can't be...Why would he be friends with an ego-maniacal psychopath like Vegeta?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was the energy I was sensing the other day, Vegeta,\" this new-person told him. \"I told you - and I was right; he's a Super Saiyan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat word caught my attention...A Super...What?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly this Kakarot person began to hover toward me. I braced myself for anything that could happen, but I was so fatigued I could barely lift my arms. If this situation turned ugly, I didn't know what I could do to defend myself. And regardless of how good I felt this Kakarot was, I was the one who tried to destroy a major office building a few minutes ago. And he was definitely more powerful than Vegeta. I had to be cautious - not knowing what to expect.</span></div></div>",

I saw my farther lying in the bed in the middle of the room breathing steadily along with the heart monitor machine. He was awake and saw me come through the door \"hay dad how you feeling\" \" I'm fine but....what happened to\" he paused as he new what may happen if he said the word, that word which had caused them so much pain and hatred but he had to ask \"what happened to...you brother\" he said with a little worry in his voice, dammit I'm going to have to tell him but not all of it I mean he's still in hospital and recovering, we'll here I go \"dad I.....I mean I...(sigh)we got in to a fight dad I get shivers now when look back on it, I ended up breaking multiple bones in his body and cracking others though the skin, he tyres to fight back but he wasn't strong enough to evan make me step back an inch\" I said this all very confidently and scared at the same time while I was looking at the bottom of his bed.<br>\r\nI then heard him ask me if was still alive and I answered yes he was a little surprised by this but grateful at the same time we talked for a little while and then I asked \"it's been a bit since you've eat dad what do you want from the cafeteria\" \"just a sandwich please\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I left to go to the cafeteria and get some food, after I paid I started heading back to dad's room when a bunch of doctors ran past me in a hurry, i thought It was anther patient so I just carried on walking but when I came round the corner I saw a lot of doctors and nurses outside the door to my dad's room wondering what was going on I asked what was happening a nurse turned to me and said \"I'm so sorry but your farther has just passed away from heart failure and blood loss\" so many things where going though my head now like how, why now and how I'm going to tell my sisters about this. Just then the doctor came out the door with a face that looked like it had seen it all but with respect he walked up to me and said \"we found out what caused your farther to die, when the bullet entered his body it chipped of a little piece of bone which was sent upward towards the heart and punctured it but at the same time acted like a plug stoping the blood from getting out, we didn't notice this until we looked at the x-Rays a second time and I'm sorry to say this but evan if we saw at the moment of the surgery his body would still not have been able to heal fast enough\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI clenched my fist so hard that my hand started to bleed once again the doctor must of noticed because he quickly left to see other patients, just then I got a text message from my sisters saying the plane had been canceled and that the next plane would be in two days.why now first my mother now my farther he was dead the moment my brother shot him, why did I let him live   </span></div></div>",

Your right about that part but the three dead women's corpses say otherwise Sarah for example the one which was predicted to have died first she had injures that could not have been made by some random piece of roof falling on her, no she was struck in the left side of her face by a fist as you can see in the x-Ray then her back was snapped cleanly in half by what I'm guessing was a leg...

Once I landed I fixed everything in the house and cleaned up and dicided that I would take a shower as well while I was at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned the shower on and started to undress when all of a sudden I fell to the floor in pain, I've never felt anything so extremely painful in my life. It was like someone was playing with my spian and twisting it and ofcuss I was screaming I mean I could take a beating but this was insane. The pain continued for about five to six minutes by which time I was starting to black out and I did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes slowly opened and I could instantly hear water hitting the bottom of the shower tray so I slowly got up feeling the blood rush back to my head, I lost my balance for a second but I steadied myself by grabbing on to the sink and standing up I turned the shower off as it had probably been wasting water as I had blacked out \" wait I blacked out and I remember my back being in a lot of \" at that moment I looked in the mirror and saw something brown and long behind my back \" what... I... I have a no no it can't be \" I rubbed my eyes to see if I was dreaming but when I lifted my hand away it was still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slowly turned a Around and the tail turned with my body and I started to feel the muscles inside it and I quickly got the hang of it and tried to see if it was fake and just a prank so I grabbed it and I could feel it but what creeped me out was I could feel my hand through the tail. After athouth tucks I comfermed that it was real and mine, so after feeling the feer and swing it side to side with my new muscles I saw that it stretched down to the top of my angle, I started to think of ways to hide it \"so I could hide it down the back of my trouser leg or maybe\" I swung my tail around my wast and it did a full lap round and stoped at the back of my spian \"yes I could have it like this so I don't end up siting on it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started to practice using my new body part and it was quite handy so I turned the shower back on and had a shower while using my tail to garb the shampoo and other things. After getting out getting dried and dressed (warping my tail round my body) and when I pulled my t-shirt over my tail and if I didn't know about the tail I would have thought I didn't have one. I went down stairs and sat on the couch and turned on the tv putting on the news when all of a sudden there was a knock at the door, I stud up and started walking towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear if that is my brother I'll kill him this time for good\" I swing the door open to see standing before me....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I have to finish my work here.\"  He reached for the salt cellar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few months?\" I said, really getting pushy now.  I suppose that extreme tedium had made me bold.  \"Would you say, not more than a year?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't say anything right now,\" he said, trying to look irritated, but succeeding only in showing his uncertainty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought about it as I slurped on my corn flakes.  I had a sudden inspiration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Dad, Mom,\" I said.  \"Can't I go back to the city and live with Aunt Flo while you attend to your work here?  You could come as soon as you finish.\"  I really had no hope they would accept the suggestion, but was calculating in my immature way that they would be shamed into setting a definite dateline for our return to the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy Dad surprised me.  \"That is the first workable suggestion we have heard from you since we came here.  I will talk to Flo, and to your old school to see if they will accept you back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy Mom looked up, and spoke up for the first time.  \"I don't think that is a good idea.  How will he manage without us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad turned away from he and looked at her.  I could only see his profile, and I had the distinct impression that he winked at her.  \"Oh, he will manage fine.  Flo is quite capable, and you know that.  She has brought up four children.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy Mom looked back at my Dad, and her face stilled.  The frown went out of it.

You looked to see that the monkey children were a good ways in front of you. \"Come on, stop!\" You start to jump through the trees, swinging from branch to branch. You happily crawl around tree trunks, and wave to the monkies mothers. They start to screech, and you mimic they're sounds. \"Don't worry miss Beanbag, I'll make sure Jonny dousn't get in any trouble!\" The monkey pays no mind to you, and you hurry your pace toward them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you get them more in your sight, you jump toward a high branch. As you make your grab, you start to tumble forward. You barrel toward a large tree trunk, realizing that it'll hurt a lot if you hit. You turn slightly to the left, preparing for your next move. You unravel your monkey tail, dispite your grandmother's spite toward the member. You're alread acustomed to your own tails control, and it wraps as much as it can around the trunk. It does enable you to twirl around the trunk, building speed as you circled the tree. You unravailed your tail, and flew upward. You were able to grab a tree limb, but you were already past the dangerous development. \"I gotta catch up with Jonny and the gang,\" you yell as you continue sailing through the trees with your tail completly frailing, as if nothing happened!</span></div></div>",
