She has a B-cup, no bigger than baseballs, coated in her iron-like, cyan flesh. all with pointy white nipples to finish the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEisen is a tomboy, and mostly hangs out with male Pokemorphs, especially those smaller than her. she also is known to have a navel fetish and even a pregnancy fetish. Eisen is an easy going girl, and gets along with others just fine. but if she's enraged, she won't pull any punches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere's a small list of her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictor, a mostly strong and muscle bound Houndoom-morph, and one of Eisen's best friends<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis, a girly-looking Virizion fem-boi, and Eisen's \"Polar Opposite\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCD, a nerdy and slightly fem-boish (not as much as Francis, tough) grey Keldeo-morph who has a crush on the Cobalion<br>\r\n--<br>\r\nI'm pretty lenient on rules here, so experimentations are welcomed in. just no cruelty to Eisen and her friends, and no death to said characters either. other than that, have fun!</td>",
