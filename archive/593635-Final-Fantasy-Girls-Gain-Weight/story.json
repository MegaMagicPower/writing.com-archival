There were some live people, too; she and the survivors staggered to their feet at about the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne couldn't help but wonder, what had happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lightning bolt,\" said one of the survivors. A technician, by his uniform. \"I warned 'em it was stupid to stand on top of a metal tower in a thunderstorm. But did they listen? Nooo....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me,\" said General Celes. \"What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, excuse me, ma'am,\" he said with an awkward salute. \"I didn't know you were alive. Er, that is to say.... Ah, your tower got struck by lightning. Ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is the Emperor alive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA harsher voice behind her responded. \"Regret to inform, General, His Excellency did not survive. Neither did Generals Kefka and Leo.\" She turned; there was a man who looked suspiciously like a drill seargant behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" she said. This was huge. She had to sit down. So she did. On the ground. \"Do you realize that the entire plot of Final Fantasy 6 has just been ruined?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry?\" said the Technician.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" asked Celes. \"Sorry, I guess my brain must have been a little fried. Or something. I don't know. What about the girl?\" She was referring, naturally, to Terra, Kefka's little experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe technician simply shrugged, and the drill seargant said, \"I haven't seen her. It's possible that she survived.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" said Celes. \"One of you, take me back to the capitol.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few weeks later....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new Emperor had been chosen, a completely mediocre, sane fellow named Frank. Emperor Frank. His sole redeeming virtues were that he didn't want to take over the world, and he didn't stand on top of metal things in thunderstorms. Emperor Frank is irrelevant to this story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeles walked out to the mailbox on her lavish estate, which she had been granted upon her promotion to the rank of General. She no longer had that rank, now; Emperor Frank was demilitarizing. She was given an honorable discharge and a crapload of money. Not to mention the workman's comp pay, and the extravagant salary generals made and she had scrupulously saved for her past four years in the position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mailbox had a single letter: the last of her back pay. 800,000 Gil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, she thought, that's good. She had collected enough to retire in luxury for the rest of her long life, even though she retired at such a young age that even professional sports players would find it out-of-place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell. She was young, she was rich, she owed her allegiance to nobody and nothing but her own country, the Empire that nobody seems to know what it's called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was open-minded. She thought she'd try something new. She had always wondered what it would be like to be fat.</span></div></div>",

Simply because peace had been declared and the Empire was demilitarizing didn\u2019t mean that there was magically no unrest. The world had been <i>at war</i>. Simple apologies would do nothing to alleviate the tension. And as the sole surviving general of the now disbanded military, and publicly known as the one who led the attack on Maranda, Celes was\u2026 not well liked. If the public saw her turning into a whale, they would be outraged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can she stuff her face like that when we\u2019re trying to rebuild?\u201d they would say. Celes even feared that she couldn\u2019t stay for too long in one spot, once again due to the\u2026 less than favorable opinion of her. In reality, she was waiting for her last payment before leaving Vector altogether. She wanted to make a fresh start for herself somewhere outside the Empire, away from the cold persona of General Celes Chere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what had happened to the girl? There had been no traces of her after the lightning strike, so she was either vaporized from being directly struck by the lightning, or she had somehow escaped. Celes honestly felt like it was the latter: unlike anyone else in the world, the girl possessed natural magic. Celes had no idea how different natural magic was from her Magitek infusions, but she felt that it wasn\u2019t too farfetched that it could activate on instinct. Still, though, they had found remnants of a Slave Crown, one of which the girl had been wearing\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever mind that,\u201d Celes said to herself. \u201cI have a boat to catch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, Celes had a boat to catch. She was headed south to Albrook to catch a boat to South Figaro, where hopefully she would make her fresh start.</span></div></div>",

Or to eat the meal backwards, starting with dessert?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted a burger,\" Garnett said, but remembering her resolution to make herself less of a petite little slim toothpick of a girl, added, \"but all that does sound pretty good....\"</span></div></div>",

I'm so glad you snaped out of the evil trance before you went, I don't know what I would have done If you hadn't\" she was feeling a little depesed now. then she remembered her mother kept an unofficial will in the library, surely she had put a few last words to remeber by mabye even a message to her so she wouldn't be sad at her (the queen) death.<br>\r\nShe ran to the library. in the back behide a table with an atlas on it Garnett reached behide and pulled out an old book \"it's been the familys seceret will book for generations\" she said. She opened it to the book mark there was a message to Garnett from her mom <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Dearest Garnett if your reading this that means I've passed on but I have left a magic feather here so you'll always remeber me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow she did leave me a message\" then she saw the date writen \"four months ago, that was when she was still evil. Could she have over come the spell long enough to leave me this?\" she wanted to belive it so much she just picked up the feather. suddenly she was compeled to put it in her hair, no sooner then she had then she feel a strong urge to eat. She ran to the kitchen \"Quentia I need food\" she yelled. Quentia had been hired as head chef at the end of their adverture but not before exploring the world and learning many new more fattening recipies. \"You want food?\" she/he said \"then me make some\". Quentia made a huge feast that Garnett eagerly ate. By night fall she had eaten almost her body weight in food, her stomach stuck a foot and a half out, some of the food had already begun the process of changing to fat and she really looked bloated in her current state. \"Beatrix!\" she yelled \"I need help getting to bed\" Beatrix quickly came to her side and helped her out of the chair no sooner than Beatrix put her hand on Garnett's shoulder then a strange look appeaed in Beatrix's eyes. Beatrix quickly got Garnett to her room and promptly left \"odd\" thought Garnett \"she usually says good night\". Down in the guards quarters (anyone who played the game knows Beatrix only hired women) Beatrix was stuffing the tied up guard's faces. \"I just need some sleep\" thought Garnett and she soon did fall asleep.

She wanted to get up and give her a hug but she couldn't move. Down in the Guards Quarters Bearix had put her hand on all the girls heads and untied them, Now they were eating on their own without the forcefeeding. She smiled at the growing guards and then pulled up a chair and started stuffing herself.<br>\r\nThe next morning Garnett awoke still puzzeled by the dream but stomach growled and she thoght she should get something to eat first. She got out of bed and put on her usual white blouse and orange overall things, They seemed reallt tight and then for the first time she saw herself in the mirror. She must have gained 50 pounds last night \"I don't belive it\" she said. Her breast were now a good C cup and her belly jutted out four inches in front of her, Her ass was huge and jiggly, her hips stuck out and her thighes stuck in, so much that they slightly rubbed together. \"Wow I don't feel scrawny now she tought\" but that was all she could feel. Not upset, not angry, not even sad about the weight gain. She saw her outfit wouldn't last long so she went to find Beatrix about getting a bigger one. As soon as she left the bedroom she saw the gaurds for the first time that day. They were all FAT! She couldn't belive it they were all busting out of their uniforms (In my opinion all they wore in the game were tight green one peiece bathing suits, a helmet, shoulder pads, and gloves) \"why did Beatrix hire all these fat gaurds\" she thought \"What the\" but before she could finish a guard aproched her and said \"Ms. Beatrix wishes to see you, shes in the throne room awaiting your arival\". She was so stuned at the size of the super large gaurd all she could do was nod her head and begen to walk to the throne room. \"That really fat Gaurd loked so familiar\" she thought and then it dawned on her \"THAT WAS MARY!\" Mary had been a gaurd for a year now she was asigned to guarding the bedroom Garnett slept in. Mary had always been a little plump but never that fat Beatrix had tried to get her to lose weight on several occations but never succeded, now she was huge.

Garnett knew they didn't gain all that weight in one night just because of no activity but she was to shocked to notice. \"well the royal chef has been cooking all morning to provide you with a breakfast fit for a queen\" said Beatrix \"if I could just get you to sign this before you go that would be wonderful.\" Garnett looked at the document she had been handed but she was too shook up to read, since she didn't want to look stupid staring at the paper for to long she just signed it and ran to the kitchen, she was really getting hungry. As she left Beatix smiled at the paper, She now had a royal order to build a reasturant just for women in the town square that served only the most fattening foods for free. She needed the royal order because the town square was zoned for  small stands only and the only way to put a resturant in the center of town was a royal order.</span></div></div>",

Panckes, biscuits, bacon, rolls, sausages, dumplings, eggsalad, Quentia who didn't know better even made some non breakfast items like hamburgers, baked ham, Pizza, and at the end of the table was a nine layer cake towering over the other food like a giant goal in the distance. All the non breakfast food was Ok since it would be well into dinner time before she finished the mountain of food. Garnett's mouth watered at the sight of this treat. She wanted so badly to eat it all but she didn't think she could ever eat the whole thing. She considered asking Quentia if it really was all hers, surely some of the now blubbery guards could help her finish it. But before she could open her mouth the feather sensed her thoughts and pulsed, without a second thought she dove at the table and ate with unrelenting fury. Over the next two hours she worked her way to the midway point of the table, a feat that before the pulse of the feather she never would have been able to accomplish even with several of the guards help. Four and a half hours after begening the feast she was working on the last few bites of cake, \"Wow\" said Quentia \"you must be hungry, you want more?\". Apon hearing this a firey anger came from deep within her, or to be more precise from deep with in the feather \"of course I'm still hungry! Now get your ass back in that kitchen and start cooking!!!\" she snaped. \"Y-YES MAM\" Quentia wimpered and ran into the kitchen. \"Fool\" said Garnett \"dosen't he know I need something to eat before I starve to death\". Though she was still scowling as the next course entered the room, she grined at all the food before her. as she began to eat the feather slipped lose and almost fell from her hair, \"wha-huh?\" she said in a dazed confusion \"what happened to this table?\" she asked when she saw the pile of dishes from her first meal on the other side of the table and a new meal lay out before her. \"And my belly!\" she remarked just noticing the spheroid object that came two feet out from her abdomin. \"Did I really eat everything on this table already?\" she said as she rubbed her belly. The feather sliped a bit more from her hair, almost as if it were her hair falling out she paniced about the feather and quickly fixed it back into place. She then looked at the table and then at her belly, \"I couldn't possibly eat any more\" she said and went to tell Quentia to let the guards have it since she saw them drooling at the food that was made for her, \"Y-Yes mam\" he quickly remarked. \"Odd\" she thought \"why is he so edgey?\". As she walked out she told the guards that could have the rest, no sooner then she said \"rest\" then the guards came running from every corner of the castle to dig in. As she was walking out she saw Beatrix standing on floor below the balcony. \"Hello Beatrix\" she happly remarked. \"good evening\" said Beatrix, \"how can it be evening already?\" she thought. \"Shall we make it mandatory for all women in town to attened the grand opening of your restaurant?\" asked Beatrix. Before she could think what restaurant? The feather took over \"Yes do it immediatly\" she barked. As Beatrix left Garnett blinked and wondered what had just happened, but a quick pulse from the feather made her forget what she was worried about and decide to go to her room and lay down for a bit but not before yelling at a servent to go order a few boxes of bon-bons from the kitchen and have them brought to her room.<br>\r\nIn her room Garnett was slowly rubbing her belly and occationaly grabing a bon-bon or two to stick in her mouth. \"what has been going on today?\" she thought \"come to think of in this started yesterday right after I put on this feather...\" she thought about it for a while \"mabye this feather is to blame, I love mother but I can't help but wonder...\". She removed the feather and stuck it on the dresser, She stared at the feather for a long time desperitly wanting to put it back on but thought otherwise. She decided to grab a few more bon-bons before just sleeping the rest of the afternoon, But apon placing her hand in the box she found it empty she looked to the floor but only saw five more boxes equaly empty, \"but how there are one hundred bon-bons in a box where did they all go?\". She considered looking under the bed for them but after looking at her still swollen belly she felt the trouble of fighting with it to just get down on the floor to look for a few bon-bons was to much and just fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

She got up and put them on, They were a perfect fit  she then took a look in the mirror, at 320 pounds she didn't have to worry about being to small ever again. She studied her body for a while, Her boobs were the size of her head now, her belly hung out on all sides and went out in front nearly two feet, Her arms and legs looked swollen and puffy, her ass was gigantic  it was like haveing a watermelon for each cheek, Her hips accented her ass perfectly and her hips were pressed together so tightly that you couldn't push a gil through them if you tried, But her face was the most empresive part of all her cheeks were round an puffy like she had fill each one with water and her second chin hung down perfectly and conected with her neck even better the fat in her face couldn't have ditributed itself better if it tried. As she was enjoy her view for the first time in weeks she felt a darkness behide her and tured to see the feather sitting onthe dresser calling her. She bit her lip and slowly pulled her self out of the room. As she roamed the halls she notice the guards weights had incressed during the night and a few were alomst to big to stand in place for long periods of time. As she walked though all the guards commented about how beautiful she had become which made her feel a lot better about her weight gain. Meanwhile Beatrix stood in the town square next to a restaurant foundation yelling at some workers to stop being lazy and start working. And thats how it went for the next few days, the guards steadily gained weight, Garnett's appetite retured to normal (or as normal as a 320 pound 18 year olds appetite can be), and Beatrix was to busy rushing the constuction to return to the castle. About mid week the restaurant opened and all the women of town were on hand for the grand opening and the first dish. As the women of town stuck the first bites into their mouthes they all found it impossible to turn away...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Garnett awoke once more, It had been almost seven days since she last saw Beatrix but that only gave her time to wonder about the changes going on around her. The guards were still geting fatter but now the process seemed to have slowed down a bit with the average weight being 450 per guard, She too was gaining even thouh she no longer was eating uncontrollabley but being a big girl meant being hungry and she was now about 340, and the most unusual thing of all was the town. She had been watching the town for some time from the castle and though she couldn't vist until the new bigger ferry was completed seeing as how the current one would never support her weight, but from what she  could see was the women of town looked bigger? She didn't understand, why was everyone getting so fat? she also saw less and less of the towns women, They seemed to be habging out in the town square more... What is that structure in the town square? That shouldn't be there, it's not allowed. Garnett went down stairs hopeing to find a guard who wasn't so fat so she could send them into town to find out whats going on. But just as she came to the main hall Beatrix came in \"Your majasty\" she exclaimed \"the restaurant is complete and the women of town are well on their way to obesity\". \"Beatrix what is going on?\" asked Garnett. \"It's as you coman... where is the feather?\" asked Beatrix just noticing it's disaperance \"I took it off\" said Garnett. Beatrix without a word rushed Garnett and draged her kicking and screeming to her room. \"Now you'll know whats going on\" Beatrix said as she placed the feather in Garnetts hair. Immediatly after she did this Garnett moaned and the feather glowed. \"Finally I back on this stupid girls head\" said an angry looking Garnett. \"Yes your majasty\" said Beatrix \"we have completed the second part of your plan\". \"I can't even take a nap without this imputant girl removing me and leaving me on the dresser. I knew I should have put my mind into something harder to remove that a feather\" said Garnett. \"Well it was still genius of you to make an object that would put you in your daughters body my queen\" Beatrix said as she bowed. They began to walk to the main hall.<br>\r\nMeanwile the rest of the gang was off on their own adventures Vivi had gone back to his home in the mountains mainly because he was home sick but also because he wanted to work with Dr. Tot in nearby Treno to make the greatest love poem ever to win Ekio's heart, Amarant was also in Treno but only because he had picked one fight to many with city guards and was blind sided by a guard with a club. Luckly he was able to prove his innocence with the auction house robbery but he still got 3 years for assulting a guard, only that was per guard so his sentance adds up to about 36 years he sent a request to Garnett to be pardoned for his crimes but in her current state she would never let a possible threat to her new plans out of prison, Freya had rebuilt Burmecia and gone to the Lifa tree to help establish a new Cleyra and do a new cerimony  to create a new wirlwind around the city, Steiner was in Lindblum helping them to train there own elite knight squad with is why the knights of Pluto were also not around, Zidane was also in Lindblum to get the new theater on it's legs, finaly Ekio, she had followed Zidane to Lindblum to see the theater but had now retured to Alexandria to see Garnett and was runing through the steets to the casle ask Garnett why the Guards were all so fat...<br>\r\n\"Did you meet any resistance\" asked Garnett \"no mam, just one girl in town didn't attend the grande opening, she said her name was Ruby and she claimed she was to busy with her mini-theater in town, but I took her to the restaurant stuffed a roll in her mouth and the magic took effect, she dug into that food so fast shes probably forgoten she even had a Theater\" chuckeled Beatrix. Just then Ekio burst in \"Dagger Dagger theres something wrong in town..\" Ekio gasped when she saw the now huge Garnett and Beatrix \"whats going on?\" Beatrix turned to Ekio \"Shall I give her the special touch my queen?\" said Beatrix \"no it won't work her horn protects her just like me there has to be direct contact with the feather to transform her, GUARDS!\" two guards waddled up and grabed Ekio \"hey let me go\" She exclaimed. \"Now now my dear it's time you joined us,\" Garneet said patting her belly \"I've gotten fat enought to retain contol over this girl, you see the fat in a woman has the amazing ability to retain a little magic, thats why all my guards and the women of town are so big, with all that fat a spell to make them totaly obediant perminantly is possible, without the fat I wouldn't have control for long, thats why when Beatrix touched me I made her and her guards gain weight fast so they would be completly in my power\" Garnett smiled as she removed the feather from her hair \"But our bodys are differant, those horns protect us from such dark magic unless the feather has complete contact, but now that I so big the fat can keep the magic while you catch up\" Garnett shoved the feather into Ekio's hair. At once she relaxed and sudenly burst from the guards hands and ran to the kitchen. Garnett smiled \"prepare the troops, we attack at dawn\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By late afternoon Burmecia had fallen to Alexandria. Without Freya around and their walls still in ruin they did not wish to witness a repeat of their last battle with Alexandria. The soldiers of the Alexandrian army were not as powerful as the blackmages that were used the first time but still just as effective, They only went along with this whole plan was because it was either face the angry orders or Queen Garnett or go home to their wifes who were now fat and under Garnetts control anyway so it either way they would be yelled at to go out there and fight. By the next day the soldiers had surrounded Lindblum and were demanding unconditional surrender of the Lindblum government. Garnett was no fool however she knew that Lindblum\u2019s strength lay in their airships so before Lindblum could even start their engines Garnett ordered her soldiers to fill their catapults with wood and set the wood on fire to launch into the airship hangers, the shotgun effect of the burning wood made quick work of the hangers and within an hour their wasn\u2019t an airship left in the city. Luckily for Vivi when he had come to Lindblum to give Ekio the poem he had written, he came early and had avoided the blockade around the city. \u201cWHAT IS GOING ON?!?\u201d Zidane was screaming as Vivi entered the Lindblum throne room \u201cfirst she misses our theater\u2019s grand opening and then she attacks the city? Shes acting just like her mother!\u201d Zidane exclaimed. \u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d asked Vivi speaking for the first time \u201cwe\u2019ll just have to hold out for as long as possible and pray for a miracle\u201d replied Cid. And so it began for nine grueling days Lindblum resisted every attempt by the Alexandrian army to enter the city, had it not been for Garnetts orders to take the city in one piece they may never had survived.<br>\r\nOn the tenth day on the horizon Alexandria\u2019s royal airship the Red Rose slowly came into sight. On board the ship once again wearing the feather sat Garnett now at nearly 720 pounds she took up every inch and then some of the couch like seat in with she sat. On her Right stood Beatrix at 680 pounds she too had grown quite a bit in the last nine days she smiled happily at her new growth. And finally on Garnett\u2019s left in a somewhat smaller couch like chair sat Ekio at 235 she was the lightest but due to her small stature she looked the fattest, since the gain her she had grown quiet eyes emotionlessly looked off into the distance and her mouth hung open with out saying a word with the except for the occasional question \u201cwhen are we going to eat?\u201d she would try to look at Garnett when ever she said this but due her fat covered neck this was quite a chore, like Garnett her cheeks had puffed out perfectly and her second chin hung down just right, as for her body  to call her a butterball  would be a vast understatement. \u201cIt was about time they installed that new steam engine in this old airship, it\u2019s not like I could come see my New Kingdom on foot\u201d remarked a very impatient Garnett. As she patted her big belly and popped a few more bon-bons into her mouth \u201cTake us down to their balcony\u201d she yelled at the two obese guards controlling the ship.<br>\r\nOn the royal balcony Zidane, Cid, and Vivi could only watch as the airship slowly descended towards them. \u201cI\u2019ve found a gap in their blockade, if  we were to ride some chocobos we might be able to\u2026\u201d Steiner stopped short when he saw the all to familiar Red Rose above. Slowly they all got a look at the new Garnett, Beatrix, Ekio, and now super sized guards. Garnett smiled at them from behind her mammoth breast and belly. Zidane, Steiner, and Cid were to shocked to move but Vivi looked at Garnett and saw the Golden glowing feather on her head and thought back to what his grandfather once told him, he told him of many magic\u2019s in the world one such magic was the ability to place ones desire\u2019s and ambitions into an item such as a feather and once placed on the head on a person they would be filled with the desire\u2019s of the person who enchanted the object, a good way to tell if a item had been possessed was if the item glowed golden. Vivi knew exactly what was happening and when he saw the emotionless expression on Ekio\u2019s face he was filled with rage. Without thinking threw his hands up and yelled \u201cFIRE\u201d a burst of red light shot from Vivi\u2019s hands and zoomed at the feather, the impact of the light knocked the feather backwards out of Garnett\u2019s hair. As the feather fell to the floor it was slowly engulfed in flames and by time it reached the floor it was little more than ashes. Garnett, Beatrix, and Ekio all stared at the feather\u2019s ashes and all simultaneously blinked. Garnett looked down at her body and shrieked, Ekio tried to look down but the fat prevented her from doing so but using her hands she was able to figure out what she looked like and had a similar reaction, Beatrix looked distressed but she was secretly thinking \u201cfinally\u201d.  Garnett just looked at Zidane and the others and could only say \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d. Zidane could see the hurt in her eyes and was so relived the ordeal was over that he just leaped on to the ship and embraced her, Vivi and Steiner also relived followed suit with Ekio and Beatrix. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Fortunately, the extreme hunger pangs that caused her to almost inhale the entire contents of the fridge earlier had subdued themselves into something more normal, allowing her to continue cooking rather than simply devour everything in site right out of its package. (Although the notion had crossed her mind every now and then.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Cloud arrived with the spices she required to finish the spaghetti sauce currently in preparation. When all was said and done, the two sat down to eat. Cloud didn't seem to eat too much (not surprising, since he bought himself a sandwich while out on his own, so that Tifa could have just about everything to herself). Tifa, however, was literally gorging herself with everything in sight. After wolfing down three plates of spaghetti, she helped herself to some chicken (just the legs, wings, and breasts, not much else. . .) even a whole salad and a side of mashed potatoes with lots of butter and gravy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she was done with that, she'd stuffed herself so full that her belly now pushed out beyond the lip of her skirt, popping her belt and forcing the zipper on the side to undo itself tooth by tooth. She looked almost as if she'd swallowed a basketball. At this point, Tifa was hit by a wave of fullness that caused her to fall back in her seat, exhausted from all that eating. She patted her distended stomach, and belched so loud the neighbors probably heard it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tifa, you okay?\" Cloud jumped from his seat and ran to her side as if truely concerned for her safety, but his wide grin gave away how much he was enjoying seeing her food stuffed belly push itself well beyond her large breasts. He had to admit, he found her sexier this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I *URP* think so,\" Tifa belched loudly again, and shifted in her seat. \"Oh wow, I'm so full. . . AND HUGE!\" She gasped as she saw how big she'd gotten. \"I can't believe I ate so much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can,\" Cloud thought to himself, knowing full well that the strange materia was responsible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, I can't believe I actually did that,\" Tifa grunted, attempting to get out of her seat. \"Ooh, so heavy. . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she struggled to stand, Tifa heard and felt a low, grumbling sound emmitted from her belly. She suddenly felt very hungry again, which was odd ebcause she also felt stuffed at the same time. Looking at the food at the table, and then down at her large gut, Tifa began to struggle with what course of action she should take next.</span></div></div>",

She tried her best to make words to give Yuffie an offer to stop, but they were lost in her beautiful giggles and laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Tifa fell over on to her back in an attempt to stop Yuffie. In result, this freed Yuffie from her prison under Tifa's large bosom. Standing atop Tifa's vast stomach, Yuffie looked around, and spotted that Tifa's shirt had ridden up, exposing a large hole that apparently was her belly-button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...diving in there, I could tickle her and she wouldn't be able to stop me. This oughta be fun...\" she said, running towards it. She bounced off the belly flab and landed in Tifa's belly-button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa's eyes widened, feeling where Yuffie just dove into. \"Yuffie, stop! Don't please! Stop, I'm extremely ticklish in there!\"</span></div></div>",

Time to get fat.' with one final thought Yuffie activated the \"WG3\" power of the materia on herself. Instantly Yuffie began to fatten up and within seconds was already pushing Tifa's breasts off of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a minute Yuffie hit her former 3,600 pound weight and it was then Tifa fully realized what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it can't be...Yuffie's growing again.\" exclaimed Tifa. Soon Yuffie hit 4,000 and her two ton body began to slide off Tifa's. \"No stop Yuffie!\" yelled out Tifa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way Tifa. I'm not letting you have any of my materia and that's final.\" said Yuffie as her body hit 5,000 and roll after roll of fat piled on top of her. Her face became even more puffy and her neck had long disappeared from all the fat. But this time her weight was piled on her body more evenly as her thighs, butt, belly, and breasts all got fair share of her new blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuufie's body continued to balloon out and soon she hit Tifa's weight of 6,000. Yuffie with a hard shove pushed Tifa off of her own massive body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa landed to one side with a very loud \"thud\" crushing the ground under her she then stared at Yuffie with hatred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why you! I'll get you for this Yuffie...but wait look at you now you're as big as me now.\" Tifa then laughed at Yuffie sending huge ripples through her massive body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah so that how it is Tifa, it always has to be about you. Tifa must always be number one well I was simply going to reverse this on to you. Which would have left you a living mountain of blubber. But I think I'll do one better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa then noticed the Materia shine and gained another level. \"What another level?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right and I'm going to use this to crush you Tifa. I'll become so big that you'll be the size of an ant to me.\" said Yuffie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What wait Yuffie you don't want to do that. I'm sorry I just want to be thin again so please reconsider Yuffie.\" begged Tifa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...nope I've made up my mind. Now feel the wrath of my new attack, I call it \"A sea of Yuffie\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuffie then used WG4 on herself several times and once again the magic took instant effect. Yuffie's body trembled for a second before it exploded with new found fat. She quickly reached 8,000 pounds as her new fat poured out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolls gathered on top of old rolls as her city  sized belly sat under her now multi mile wide breasts. Her hands became small objects lost in the sea of her arm fat. Her feet as well shared the same fate to her leg fat as she continued to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa stood wide-eyed at the growing Yuffie as she now only came up to her mountainous belly. Now well over 40 feet tall and weighting in at a homogenous 12,000 pounds, two times bigger than Tifa. Yuffie was easily the biggest thing on the planet. Her form spread for miles but stopped right before Tifa only a bit of her belly blubber fell on top of Tifa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Tifa how does it feel to be the small fry now and I guess you should be happy I stopped for a moment since I did say I would grow to the point where you looked like an ant to me. But I've come up with a better idea this gaining is great and now I want the entire planet to feel my fat. I'll become Planet Yuffie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then called upon the materia's power again and began to grow once more quickly hitting  45 ft. and 15,000 pounds. Tifa was slowly getting crushed under more and more of Yuffie's belly blubber. She had to fight back and began to push back the sea of fat she then noticed the WG materia was at the tip of Yuffie's now state sized breasts(yes the plains were now covered by Yuffie). Tifa knew if she couldn't reach the materia Yuffie's fat would crush her then the planet...she had to reach it.</span></div></div>",

Her belly stretched like a vast ocean in front of her, easily covering 3/4 of the Earth, and covered in so many rolls, her deepest rolls were covered by tens of larger ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't see behind her, but she could feel her ass cheeks touching the tip of her belly since her humongous body had wrapped itself around the earth, effectively obliberating everything.

Yuffie's facial features were becoming more and more insignificant in comparison to the size of the face they were on and yet from what Tifa could see, she was smirking and giggling with glee, sending undulating waves over her blubbery body as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body raised her up to such a height she was over a few hundred feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuffie grinned with happiness, she was the largest and most powerful creature on Earth! -but how would it feel to be the largest and most powerful being in the Universe?

Tifa was much smaller than an ant to Yuffie, she was now closer to a bacterium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuffie's blubbery body surged across the Universe obliberating everything in it's wake, whole civilizations were wiped out instantly with a surge of Yuffie's belly, this continued for a very long time until Tifa spotted the boundaries of the Universe itself approaching fast, suddenly she realised to her horror there would only be room for Yuffie in this new universe. She struggled and writhed in vain, there was no way out, would it have to end like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yuffie's fat filled in the last remaining space in the Universe and her fat had displaced all of existence, she heard Tifa scream loudly and felt her struggling in her folds, before it was cut off abruptly as Tifa felt a vast squishy pink object cover her completely and crush her out of existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I win!' Yuffie thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole of space and time was now occupied by Yuffie, all there was was Yuffie stretching into infinity and nothing more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuffie's arms and legs had submerged into her belly ages ago, a belly which now covered a good deal over half the universe, her whole body now weighed far too much to ever be calculated or imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer vast ass and breasts took up roughly equal parts of the rest of the space available, millions of rolls squished upon each other and every breath she took sent tidal waves running along her infinite ocean of fat. Her face had nearly submerged into her blobby mass and was so fat she was beyond speech and had slight problems seeing beyond herself, though everywhere she looked she only saw more or herself. The number of her chins alone reached onto the Trillions and gigantic cheeks rested on her neck. Yuffie lay back in her existence of fat, in a state of euphoria from her own hugeness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the Gods stepped in and decided to make her an evil goddess of fat, since she had wiped out the entire universe, then they moved on to another Universe and left her to wallow in eternal bliss in her endless ocean of fat for eternity.</span></div></div>",

However, they both knew that the materia must have something in storage for this kind of situation. After examinating it a while, they realise that they have both learned a couple of new spells. However, neither has any clue of what the other girl has learned. Both spells had something to do with becoming mobile again, though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuffie tried first. She starts feeling funny and notices that her fat disappears until she's as thin as before: \"Oww damn, I think I overused that spell. I was starting to enjoy being so large, although immobility wasn't really all that much fun. At least now I know the spell for weight reversal... and the opposite.\" She said grinning but she also noticed that she just consumed her MP. That spell apparently uses up a lot of MP. But before she could  start using any ethers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa is very surprised at the sight and after a while, desided to try out the spell she learned, believing that it would be the same spell. However, she soon learned otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the next following minutes, her body felt as if it was on fire. Limbs and her skeleton felt as if they were stretched and she also felt as if she was growing overall. After a while, it stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa came to, rose up and checked her body, which seemed to have slimmed down but just enough for her to move. She looked about 300-400 pounds heavy, alhthough something told her that she didn't weight any less than before.  She was wondering that what the heck was that all about until she looked at Yuffie.  And her surroundings. The 10-foot tree next to her was barely taller than her and Yuffie (with a shocked expression) seemed quite tiny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had become not only fat, but a fat giantess. Apparently these were the two means of gaining mobility and all. She also ran out of MP too, and unlike Yuffie, she forgot to take any ethers with her. So <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what would Tifa do now? She could share the knowledge of this spell with Yuffie in exchange for her her ethers and discuss about this awhile. Or she could try to snatch the ethers by force and try if she could grow more right away with both the wg spell and this new spell. Of course, Yuffie might know this spell, too.

Then, before she could react, Tifa leaped and caused an earthquake.

Her breasts, snapping her bra, were now as soft and as large as giant pillows. To top it off, her butt had expanded greatly. Each cheek was the size of a yoga ball! Her arms and legs got incredibly thick, and her face and hands were also pleasantly plumped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature stopped spewing for a moment to admire it's handiwork. Tifa also looked at how large she had gotten, enjoying it greatly, but not letting the creature know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast ran toward her, tackled her and pinned her to the ground.
