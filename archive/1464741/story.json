Over the last week or so, things had been strangely quiet, and no requests for missions had come out. This left many of Konoha's ninja to their own devices. While Naruto initially used this opportunity to train, he found himself training less and less and frequenting Ichiraku Ramen more. This was evident by looking at him; his eating habits and relative inactivity over the last week had caused his stomach to bloat somewhat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting his money down on the counter, Naruto took off, oblivious to the questioning looks of Ayame and her father. As he walked the streets of Konoha, he considered training, right before he let out a huge yawn. \"Must be sleepy from the ramen...\" he muttered. Letting out another yawn, he started towards his house to get some sleep, regardless of othe fact that it was still early afternoon. While he walked, he rubbed his slightly bloated stomach, grinning at how soothing it felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile continuing towards his house, Naruto... </span></div></div>",

As he opened the door, he yawned again. \"I guess the walk tired me out a bit...\" Naruto mumbled to himself, even though it was only a few minutes between his house and Ichiraku Ramen. Failing to register this, Naruto walked in and threw off his orange jacket, leaving only his black shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking off his leaf headband, Naruto walked into the kitchen, and, despite the fact that he had just eaten a large meal, opened the pantry and pulled out a bag of potato chips (he'd snatched them away from Choji while the rotund Genin had been looking the other way,) opened them, and began cramming them into his mouth. Even as he continued eating, he walked over to his bed and sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued eating for a few minutes. Then, tiredness overtook him, and he fell back on his bed, the half-eaten bag of chips falling out of his hand. He snored softly for a couple of minutes before he unconsciously brought his hand up to his stomach, pushing his shirt up and revealing the slightly larger belly underneath. His hand's path eventually ended just below his chest. For the next several hours, Naruto remained like that, stomach exposed and snoring away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

I'm not that easy to surprise.\" Kiba smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bark...\" The dog sighed in resignation. This wasn't going to end well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kiba made his way over to Naruto's bed, he glanced at the blonde's stomach. \"Wow, it looks like Naruto's put on a couple pounds...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru glanced at him and barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaddaya mean, I've put on a few pounds too?\" Kiba demanded. Akamaru barked again. \"Well, things have been kinda slow lately... and we've been walking less...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba shook his head. \"I'll check it out later.\" Kiba fumbled around in his pocket until he pulled out what he was looking for; an old, rolled up, dusty scroll. \"Kurenai-sensei's gonna kill me for this...\" Kiba winced. Immediately, he smiled. \"But, man, will it be worth it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened the scroll and grinned, his sharp canines showing. \"Oh yeah...\" After looking at it for a few minutes, he put it down and began performing the hand signs. \"Let's see how he reacts when he wakes up... as a kid!\" Kiba thought to himself. After completing the hand signs, he uttered the name of the jutsu:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Secret Art: Age Regression Jutsu!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, the mass of light began to contort and flash different colors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what the hell!?\" Kiba frantically searched the scroll for a way to cancel it, but found nothing. \"Aw, crap...\" he mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the jutsu had been gradually making its way toward him. With a sudden burst of energy, it sped into his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agh!\" Kiba grunted in pain. He dropped to his knees, clutching his chest. His breathing became increasingly labored, and Akamaru trotted up to him, whimpering in concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his pain, Kiba managed to smirk. \"I'll be fine, Aka...\" A sudden jolt of pain interrupted him... and then the transformation began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba began to shrink, his surroundings seemingly becoming bigger and bigger. His clothes began to seem unnaturally large, as he tripped and fell backwards, and it was only by supporting himself with his hands was he able to keep from impacting the hard wooden floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA growing sense of panic gripped Kiba, confusing and frightening him. Wait... frightening him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, crap, don't tell me the jutsu's affecting my mind, too...\" he complained, startled at how much younger his voice sounded. Within the next few seconds, his fear and panic began to increase, and his clothes grew so large, the sleeves of his jacket and the legs of his pants trailed from him like snakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere once a 13 year old dog nin had resided, there was now a small, confused, frightened child that couldn't have been more than seven. Trembling, Kiba brought his much smaller hands up to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no way...\" he stuttered, his voice now sounding even younger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that time... </span></div></div>",

Regardless, he shrugged, got some money out of his pocket, and began running back to Ichiraku's.<br>\r\n*************************************************<br>\r\n\"Another miso ramen!\" Naruto called out loudly, setting his fourth bowl to the side. As his order was being prepared, Naruto rubbed his stomach with both hands, grinning. It had grown slightly larger, owing to the fact that he had just eaten four large bowls of Ramen in quick successiion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto rubbed his hands together in anticipation as his fifth bowl was brought out. Without another word, Naruto tucked into it like a ravenous animal.<br>\r\n****************************************************<br>\r\nClosing his eyes and breathing deeply, Naruto leaned back in his chair, hands resting on his stomach. He'd ended up eating ten bowls of ramen in total, and he was incredibly stuffed-and couldn't be happier. His stomach had increased in size, and it was about as big as it had been when he had pigged out on watermelon with Jiraiya. It didn't concern Naruto much, since it would probably go down in a few hours or so, but as he rubbed his hands against his gut, he sighed happily. This was the life...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stretched, put his money on the counter, and walked off into the streets of Konoha, rubbing his large belly and getting strange looks from the other villagers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he strolled about, he felt an uncomfortable tightness in his gut. Wincing, Naruto unzipped his jacket, giving his belly room.

It was mostly empty, and best of all, there was a big, shady tree just calling his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning sleepily, Naruto walked over to the tree, stretched his arms, and plopped down. He began to lay back when he felt a tightness in his belly again. Confused and probing around with his hands, Naruto's hands eventually located the source of the discomfort: his pants button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head, Naruto fumbled a bit with the hem of his pants before his hand finally found the button. Naruto undid his pants, and sighed in relief as his belly bulged out, peeking out the slightest bit from under his shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Naruto brought one hand up to his stomach, resting it on the top, while he just let his other hand lay to the side.

With that in mind Naruto made a beeline for one of the villages many training grounds.<br>\r\nUpon arriving Naruto thought about what to do first \u2018Well I guess doing some warm ups would be a good way to start, like Iruka-sensei told us training without warming up first leads to trouble.\u2019<br>\r\nHe then spent the next ten minutes running laps around the field however something was bothering the blond shinobi, for some reason he wasn\u2019t moving as quickly as usual? <br>\r\nOut of breath and panting Naruto decided he\u2019d warmed up enough he went about getting down to business. First up was Taijutsu so he went about making shadow clones and set about dispelling them with a series of kicks and punches however his movements were now fairly sluggish and his belly giggling with every movement. <br>\r\n\u2018What\u2019s going on, I\u2019ve never had this much trouble before.\u2019 Naruto looked down at his stomach, running his hand over it \u2018Maybe I should do something less physical until I\u2019ve given my meal a chance to digest.\u2019<br>\r\nUnable to do his usual training regime Naruto settled for target practise as well as perfecting his chakra control, he headed over to a nearby tree and after carving a target into the wood spent the next hour repeatedly throwing kunai and shurikens at the target several of them hitting the bull\u2019s eye. <br>\r\nWith that done Naruto turned his attention to improving his chakra control, looking up at the tree he began pondering how he would go about this when an idea struck him.<br>\r\nFiguring that there was no one around he removed his jacket and t-shirt revealing his chest and now larger belly to the world, then formed the ram seal and began channelling chakra into his feet. Once he\u2019s built up enough he charged up the tree until he came to a branch near the top and jumped up on to the bottom of it. <br>\r\nThere he closed his eyes and seemed to go into a trance like state. The idea of the exercise was simple, cling onto the branch for as long as he could using his chakra, sussed and he would remain attached fail and he would plummet to the ground and then a visit to the hospital.<br>\r\nUnbeknown to the blond ninja he was being observed from the bushes nearby....</span></div></div>",

Due to the lack of missions coming in over the last week and no reports on either Sasuke and his band of followers or the Akatsuki things had been quiet leaving the villages ninja's with more time on their hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike many of their comrades the pair had spent much of their time hanging out with each other doing most of the things that teenage girls do, gossip, shop, etc, but on the whole just enjoying being around one another like they were when they were kids before Sasuke had brought an end to their friendship. Not to say that they hadn\u2019t put their time to more productive uses either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the apprentices of the Hokage it gave the pair certain privileges such as access to the archives where thousands of scrolls were stored many of which contained difficult or forbidden techniques. Pouring over them in hopes to gain insight into more advanced medical jutsu the pair had come across a particular technique that had interested them no end and worked hard in secret to master it. <br>\r\nThe two of them were also involved in why Naruto\u2019s appetite had grown so much recently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno glanced over at Sakura and said \u201cNow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura smirked nodded. The two of them slipped out of their hiding place and ran up to where Naruto was hanging from. Slowly Sakura ran her hands over Naruto\u2019s exposed belly, the blond was so deep in concentration that he didn\u2019t notice. \u2018So big, but I bet we can make it bigger.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced over at Ino who gave her a devious grin and the two of them began forming hand seals \u201cForbidden Technique: Hunger Jutsu!\u201d Both of then poked Naruto in the belly which glowed momentarily then gave a loud growl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly the two of them vanished before Naruto opened his eyes. The rumbling in his gut caught the blond by surprise and almost caused him to lose his concentration. \u2018What the, I only ate an hour ago so how can possibly be hungry again?\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to ignore it however the longer he tried the louder the growling seemed to become. Eventually it became so loud that he was forced to give up on his exercise. Leaping down from the tree he collected his t-shirt and jacket. \u2018Well maybe a little snack wouldn\u2019t hurt.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently Ino and Sakura followed Naruto as he walked through the streets, what surprised them was that he wasn\u2019t heading towards Ichiraku Ramen. Instead they found him walking into the barbeque restaurant. This was perfect as barbeque was more fattening then ramen. Excited to see their little project in action first hand they entered the restaurant and saw Naruto sitting in a both by himself.</span></div></div>",

Usually whenever I see you eats its always at Ichiraku.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I was just doing some training and I felt a little hungry after all that, I came here cos it was closer then Ichiraku was.\u201d Naruto replied \u201cSo what about you two?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh y\u2019know girl stuff.\u201d Sakura replied \u201cActually we\u2019re in the middle of conducting an experiment and it\u2019s going rather well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that\u2019s great I guess.\u201d Naruto said not entirely sure what they were talking about. \u201cSo what do you two want to order?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell why don\u2019t we go for a spread, that way we can all share.\u201d Ino suggested. Not finding a reason to argue Naruto agreed and waved the waitress over, the two girls placed the order surprising Naruto with the size of the order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir order placed the three of them made small talk until their food arrived and the three spent the next hour eating; and once they had finished the girls then went about ordering seconds then followed by thirds. By the end of it Nauto\u2019s belly had grown so large that it pushed against the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn.\u201d Naruto said staring down at his belly \u201cI think I better start slowing down, if I keep eating like this I\u2019ll end up being fatter then Chouji.\u201d Sakura and Ino almost dropped what they were eating and quickly hid their excitement imagining Naruto being that large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder the table Sakura cast a Genjutsu knowing that it was Naruto\u2019s only weakness. Successfully trapping the blond in an illusion both kunoichi slipped round the table. \u201cForbidden Technique: Hunger Jutsu!\u201d utilising their new jutsu they once again poked Naruto in the belly then retreated back their seats and released the Genjutsu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreed from the illusion Naruto\u2019s stomach gave a loud growl. \u2018Huh, again. Even after all that food.\u2019 \u201cHey Sakura, I feel like some desert what about you?\u201d Ino said to her pink haired friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno I wouldn\u2019t mind some chocolate fudge cake and ice cream. \u201c Sakura replied, she then turned to her test subject \u201cWhat about you Naruto, would you like some?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto didn\u2019t answer at first; unsure whether he should eat any more when his stomach growled again \u201cWell maybe just a little.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls called the waitress over and ordered three whole hot chocolate fudge cakes and ice cream bar, when they arrived all the of them began digging in. \u2018That\u2019s right Naruto-kun, keep eating. Get bigger...bigger...bigger...\u2019 Both girls thought excitedly as they watched Naruto scarf down his food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother hour later all three of them emerged from the restaurant, Ino and Sakura supporting Naruto who was currently groaning. Naruto\u2019s shirt ridden up exposing his humongous engorged belly to the world giving the impression that he was seven months pregnant. Both of them had been sorely tempted to stuff him even more however decided against it as it seemed that Naruto was now so full that he would probably have burst had they pushed him any further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls escorted Naruto back to his apartment. \u201cOhh poor Naruto.\u201d Sakura cooed as she and Ino Naruto removed Naruto\u2019s jacket before setting him down on his bed \u201cDo you have a tummy ach?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry I know just what will make you feel better.\u201d Ino added. The two of them then pushed the bloated blond on to his back, before he could inquire what they had planned the two of them channelled chakra into their hands and began to gently rub away at Naruto\u2019s worn out belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes that feel good Naruto?\u201d Ino asked sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, y\u2019know you two are good at this.\" Naruto commented before letting out a yawn, the soothing feel of the girls chakra infused hands rubbing his belly was making him feel sleepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the complement Naruto.\" Sakura said, neither of them heard Naruto respond but judging the easy way the large orb of flesh that they had their hands on rose and fell in a calm and easy rhythm did didn\u2019t take them long to realise that he had fallen asleep. Smiling at one another Ino and Sakura then went about removing Naruto\u2019s ninja sandals before unbuttoning his pants and pulling them down off his legs leaving him in only his t-shirt and boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe looks so cute like that.\u201d Ino commented as she and Sakura climbed back on the bed either side of the sleeping shinobi. \u201cHow much longer are we going to keep this up because I don\u2019t think I can hold out?\u201d she asked running her hand over Naruto\u2019s stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh it shouldn\u2019t be much longer now.\u201d Sakura replied \u201cSoon he will be perfect.\u201d Grinning the two of them then removed their clothes till they were only clad in their underwear and lay next to Naruto and snuggled up to his soft and warm flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes soon Naruto-kun, soon you will be perfect.\u201d Sakura whispered before drifting off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Two VERY hot girls were spending time with him, and each day ended with a belly rub<br>\r\n<br>\r\nfrom gorging at Ichiraku's. Every morning his bloated belly would go down to its original size. This continued for a week. \"Time to get up!\" Naruto said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put on his black T-shirt and found it a little constrictive. \" Musta shrunk.\" he said. Then he tried to button his orange pants. He couldn't. He tried<br>\r\n<br>\r\nagain but he still couldn't get them across his thickening waist. \"COOOOOOOMMMMMEEE ONNNNNNNNN!!!!!!\" At that moment Konohamaru burst<br>\r\n<br>\r\ninto Naruto's room and screamed:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You up now boss? You promised to show me that new sexy jutsu you were talking about. TRAIN ME, TRAIN ME,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTRAIN ME!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on. Just let me button my pants.

Naruto noticed something different about himself as he looked in his full sized mirror. His cheeks were rounder, and his<br>\r\n<br>\r\nshoulders were broader. He also noticed that his belly stuck out a little from his black shirt. He took off his shirt to get a better look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep there was no denying it now. Small lovehandles were developing on Naruto's sides, small little moobs were appearing, a teeny tiny double chin<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwas forming, and worst of all, a small pooch kept Naruto from buttoning his pants. Naruto was getting fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey maybe you should go on a diet boss\". Konoharmaru suggested as he was rubbing Naruto's expanding butt slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto finally knew why Sakura and Ino were paying attention to him and giving him belly rubs. They wanted to fatten him up. Naruto......... </span></div></div>",

After a while he finally made it and it only took almost an half hour, and sakura and ino are waiting for him. Hi naruto. Sakura happily. You look exhausted here Ino and I made some lunchboxes for you. That will have to wait I need to talk to you about something. Naruto said. What is it? Ino ask curiously. Are you guys making me fat on purpose?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura and Ino gave a shocked look when they heard that naruto was on them about making him like this. Well what is it. Naruto said impatiently waiting for an answer. The two girls looked at each other with worried expressions and with that he got his answer. So you are doing this to me, I thought you two were acting a bit too nice to me. Naruto said angerly. Sakura then looked at him and said \"I hoped it wouldn't come to this but you leave us no choice\". What are you talking abou..OW!! Ino shot naruto in the neck with a tranquilizer dart. Then naruto started losing consciousness. She's not going to be happy that he found out her plan. Ino said. Those were the last words naruto heard before he passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOhh my head, where am I? Naruto asked waking up from his nap. He looked around and saw that he was in someone's house and his arms, legs, hands and feet are tied up to a large bed woth super strong chakra ropes. Not even the nine tailed fox's chakra could break these ropes. Then a door opened and sakura and ino entered. I can't believe you two did this to me, when I get out of here your so going to get it. Naruto said in rage. We had no choice she said she'd reveal out true forms if we didn't help her, although we had fun doing it. Sakura said with a worried look. Who told you to do this? Naruto asked. I did. A voice sadi entering the room. Naruto and the girls turned around to see the person behind the scheme. ITS YOU!!! Naruto said shocked.</span></div></div>",

Tenzou's face was calm and serene; his eyes were blank pools of chocolate that stared into far away space. But then, Kakashi noticed how the man before him was clenched, the knuckles bare-white. And then he heard it, a thin growl-like sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Nooo...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenzou was trying to fight against the genjutsu, Kakashi saw. Tenzou was good, but Kakashi was better. He increased the amount of chakra he sent to his eye slowly. He placed himself close to Tenzou and rubbed his back in a gentle circular motion, sending in light waves of calming chakra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh, it's okay, Tenzou.

Just relax and soon you won't have to worry about anything ever again. Trust me.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTenzou groaned, practically screamed as Kakashi pumped in more of his chakra. Now he couldn't stop, for if he did, Tenzou's chakra would go wild and potentially hurt both of them. He continued to scream, his body shaking, and then convulsing where he stood. It lasted far longer than Kakashi knew it should, but soon Tenzou grew quiet. His body swayed and collapsed into Kakashi's waiting arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit Tenzou, why did you make me do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe placed Tenzou on the cabin's couch.

He had essentially emptied the contents of the fridge, put them together in odd and, quite frankly, disgusting ways, as well as emptying the cupboards and adding them to the mix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's stomach rumbled again, causing a small amount of drool to run down the side of his mouth. His stomach wouldn't be rumbling for long...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout wasting anymore time, Kiba dove into the food. First, he tackled a rice ball smothered in both hot and chocolate sauce, devouring it in seconds and sloppily licking the remnants of the sauce of his fingers. Next, he grabbed a chicken leg that had been covered with small, hot peppers, greedily tearing the meat off the bone. To rid himself of the spicy feeling in his mouth, Kiba grabbed a carton of milk and downed the whole thing in seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPausing to catch his breath, Kiba rubbed his stomach in satisfaction. \"Damn, that's good...\" he said to himself, grinning. Suddenly, he heard an unzipping noise, and glanced downward; his gorging had caused his pot belly to expand, prying apart the teeth of a small portion of his jacket, exposing the skin and just a tiny glimpse of the belly button underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuzzled, Kiba stared at it. \"Huh, must have eaten more than I thought,\" he said as he blinked, unaware that he had been slowly gaining weight from his unusually sedentary activities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, his stomach rumbled again, causing Kiba to turn his attention back to his feast. Without a second thought, he dove into the food once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he shoveled entire bags of beef jerky into his mouth, topping it off with potato chips and cups of noodles, he felt more unzipping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPausing once again, Kiba looked down to see that his food-engorged belly had grown to the point where the entire area of the jacket around his belly had been pried apart, and it now stuck out for the whole world to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is Kiba's reaction?</span></div></div>",

Carefully, he placed the food he had in his hands down on the table, and tentatively prodded the protrusion with a finger. His finger in place, he glanced at the mountains of food still left. He hadn't eaten THAT much, had he? However, the exposed mass of flesh that had forced itself into visibility suggested otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's mind raced as he panicked slightly. Was he really getting fat? No, that couldn't be it; this sort of thing happened to Naruto all the time when he ate at Ichiraku, but the resulting bloated stomach usually went down pretty quickly, as far as he knew. Although...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My gut has been getting a little big, lately,\" Kiba thought, unconsciously drawing his finger down his engorged stomach. \"If I ain't careful, I could wind up like Choji...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething occured to him, though; the main reason his belly had grown previously was because Akamaru was still at the vet, and he hadn't been able to work off his energy training with him. That thought cheered Kiba up a little bit; once Akamaru was all better, things would be back to normal, and he would be able to work off his belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, he had unfinished business. Rezipping his jacket (for all the good it would do,) Kiba resumed gorging himself. Until Akamaru recovered, he was gonna eat, and eat good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later, Kiba finished his massive feast. Predictably, his stomach had grown even further, and he had unzipped his jacket to allow it to hang out freely. His pants were undone, Kiba having unbuttoned and unzipped them somewhere in the middle of his gorging to both give his gut room to breathe and keep the article of clothing from breaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping a bit of sauce from his mouth, Kiba let out a massive belch. Sighing, he plopped down onto a chair, smacking his belly with one hand and rubbing it with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, that was SO good...\" Kiba moaned. He spent a minute or so caressing his belly, surprised at how good it felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe this isn't so bad...\" Kiba muttered. Clutching his prodigious gut, he leaned back, his mind coming to a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was this decision?</span></div></div>",

From that point, he began grabbing at everything in sight, shoving it in his mouth and enjoying the myriad tastes and sensations of the food sliding down his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he grabbed a leg of ham and began gnawing off large chunks of meat, his belly, even further enlarged, began pressing against his pants, creating a very apparent quivering motion. Once Kiba ate the last of the meat, that was the last straw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, and without warning, the button on his pants popped off, unable to handle the pressure. This allowed his gut more room to breathe, a fact made evident by the stomach bulging even further into visibility.

For one, Naruto's stomach was great deal bigger than Kiba remembered it being; he'd resorted to unzipping his jacket and letting his belly hang out. Still, it stuck out a good distance from underneath his black shirt, pressing against his pants. His arms and legs were a bit thicker as well, and his face had the beginnings of a double chin. Aside from this, though, Naruto's face remained mostly unchanged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you've really let yourself go, Naruto...\" Kiba muttered under his breath. He mentally shook himself. \"I mean, what the hell are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned. \"What, I can't pop over every now and then, dog breath?\" He laughed, his belly shaking as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba frowned. \"Not if you don't tell me if you're barging in.\" He sighed, moving out of the doorway. \"Well, since you're here, ya might as well come in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" Naruto walked into Kiba's room and sat upon his bed.

Although, Naruto did have a point; what with his doglike habits, his room wasn't the neatest...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto's eyes continued wandering, they fell upon Kiba's stomach; it was once again beneath his jacket, but was pressing against it with an alarming amount of force, owing to its larger size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa... Kiba...\" Naruto's eyes grew wide. \"Have you gained some weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you're one to talk?\" Kiba snapped, reflexively reaching out and poking Naruto's exposed stomach with a finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked down at his gut. \"Oh, this? Yeah, I haven't really been training much. But I've been eating at Ichiraku's more, so maybe you're right.\" Naruto began massaging his stomach, smiling serenely at the sensations it gave him. A few seconds through, he paused and looked up at his friend. \"What about you?\" He continued rubbing his belly as he leaned back to listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba sighed loudly. \"Well, Akamaru got hurt pretty bad in my last mission...\" he grimaced, mentally kicking himself for letting his companion get harmed in such a way. \"He's at the vet right now, getting worked on. I'd be there with 'im, but they're worried his wounds might be infected; they don't want me near him.\" Frustrated, he kicked the floor. \"So, yeah, I've been stuck here, mostly laying around and eating...\" Kiba put his hand on his gut. \"I got kind of hungry today, and made myself a snack.\" His expression changing to a smirk, he smacked the large mass protruding from his waist. \"That's how this happened.\" He looked at it, a reflective expression on his face. \"It's not too bad, actually. It's sorta fun to rub...\" Of course, Kiba also liked the way it looked, but he wasn't sure he felt comfortable saying that right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto paused in his rubbing to glance at Kiba. \"Wow, that sucks. About Akamaru, I mean.\" His face quickly returned to a smile, and he once again commenced his belly rubbing. \"You're right, though. This thing &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; fun to rub.\" He took one of his hands and used the the fingers to probe his exposed navel, giggling as only a &lt;i&gt;baka&lt;/i&gt; like him could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba watched Naruto, thinking to himself how much fun it would be to spend a half hour or so rubbing &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; own belly. Before he could think any further, his stomach growled. Kiba winced. \"Ah...that reminds me. I haven't finished my food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbruptly, Naruto stopped and stood up from the bed. \"You have food?! Can I have some?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba opened his mouth to say 'no,' but faltered. \"Ah, what the hell. There's a lot of it left, still.\" Walking towards the exit, he opened the door. \"C'mon, it's down in the kitchen.\" Naruto followed him, looking excited, until they reached the kitchen. It was then that Naruto let out an audible gasp as he surveyed the mountains of food in the kitchen. \"Kiba... This all looks awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Kiba wrapped a friendly arm around the blonde's shoulders. \"Yeah, and it tastes awesome too. Smell it, will ya?\" Kiba took a deep breath, taking in the smells of the food before them. Unknown to him, however, as his stomach rose from the intake of air, it slowly began to pry apart the teeth of his jacket. Kiba exhaled, and his stomach returned to its previous, bloated size, but the affected teeth, mostly around his stomach, remained partially open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMotioning to the food, Kiba grinned. \"Come on, I'm hungry!\" He dove upon the food and started shoveling it down his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, clutching his exposed belly in anticipation, followed suit, setting upon the food like a wild animal. It was a feeding frenzy... and both boys were enjoying it immensely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What was once a toned and slightly muscular chest was now showing the start of some moobs. Naruto also had a double chin going on and his pants were obviously tight on him due to his thighs being increased in size, along with his ass which had a bit of a balloon look to it. his arms were starting to look less defined and had a small layer of flesh covering them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Naruto,, you certainly have put on the pounds\" Kiba commented, which earned a smile from Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Kiba, to tell you the truth, I've always wanted to put on weight, but since I kept getting missions, any weight I did manage to put on, would be gone by the end of the mission. That's why I constantly eat at Ichiraku Ramen, their ramen is really fattening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba could see that. Naruto used to be skinny but now, he was definitely fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you gain weight with me?

Chouji would often visit since he too had nothing better to do and the two would eat crisps and other snacks whilst converse about past missions they had done where often Ino would talk about herself and her own brilliance but Chouji didn't mind. Whilst he liked hanging out with Shikamaru, he didn't really talk much at all so Ino was a nice change of pace.<br>\r\nChouji had noticed however that Ino's mannerisms and attitude had changed since Sasuke left and Sakura was constantly busy. The young girl didn't care too much about her appearance as before since she had no one to impress or compete with, and also she would sometimes spend a few days without showering as she sat around and snacked. Ino had defiantly formed a bit of a pot belly during this time as the rest of her body has also put on a bit of weight, not much but compared to her usual stick thin self it did make a difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChouji eventually left Ino and went to his usual meeting spot with Shikamaru, there were some nice clouds in the sky today so Chouji knew he would be there leaving Ino to sit around bored again, eventually deciding to call for a fast food delivery since she had nothing better to do.<br>\r\nHowever she didn't realize that the longer she lounged around inactive the more likely it would be that her metabolism would change and her body store more of the food as fat. She also didn't realize that this had already happened a bit and it would only get worse if she continued like this, but still, she sat around eating the huge pizza she ordered and drinking her soda until she let out a large belch and just continued ignoring it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day continued to pass like this until she finally was able to close shop, her belly showing through as she didn't bother putting on the bandages she normally wore round her midriff. It was then that...</span></div></div>",

There was the paperwork, the job of training students, diplomatic work, and so much more for her to do. This was a lot for someone who just three years ago was a wondering gambler with no responsibilities. However, to deal with this stress she relied on her old habits of drinking, gambling, and sleeping, which her assistant, Shizune, did not condone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Shizune, you can't be serious about this!\" shouted Shizune as she looked at the giant bottle of sake that Tsunade had just signed for with the delivery man. \"We can't let any of the students see you drinking this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the hokage,\" said Tsunade as she popped the top off the bottle and started pouring herself a cup, \"if I want to drink a little sake then shouldn't that be my business?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune started struggling with Tsunade to get the lid back on the bottle, \"But.. ungh... but Lady Tsunade, when you drink a little... arg... n-no one sees you, but with a bottle this large the students will see what a heavy drinker you are. They all look up to you, what will that do to their image of you and the office of Hokage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade had to think it over, and she sighed when she realized Shizune was right. \"Fine, take it away, I'll drink it in my private quarters tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Lady Tsunade,\" said a relieved Shizune, \"and, while we're on the subject, do you think it would be possible for you to hold off on all your drinking during office hours?\" Tsunade shot her back a look that made Shizune realize she'd gone too far. She tried to laugh it off and said, \"Um, ahaha, it's really alright, just a suggestion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune left Tsunade there in her office, alone without any sake but with lots of stress and paperwork. \"Great, now I have to do all this without any kind of buzz,\" said Tsunade. \"Well, at least Shizune didn't say anything about taking these away,\" said Tsunade as she opened her desk drawer and pulled out a chocolate bar. She started working and munching on the chocolaty snacks and candy bars she kept in her desk for quick energy boost. She only meant to eat one or two, to giver herself something to pass the time, but the more she worked on this paperwork the more distractions she felt she needed. Before the day was over she had eaten her whole week's supply of candy and ordered a pizza. She thought she was just hungry on that day, not realizing she was substituting food for the alcohol she used to enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just because she lost the booze from her bad habits, didn't mean she lost any other ones. She had always been rather lazy, but the kick she got from the alcohol gave her a little extra energy, while this food had the opposite effect, weighing her down. She didn't even bother to wipe the chocolate off her lips, or try to clean up the little grease stain that appeared on her clothes when a pepperoni fell off her pizza and landed on her. And that night when she got home she was feeling so sluggish she didn't even bother to change her clothes or take a shower.</span></div></div>",

But two hours later she had yet to show up and Shizune was getting nervous. So she decided to go to the Hokage's bedroom, a little secret room located six floors below her office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knocked on the door and awaited a response but none came. \"Hello? Lady Tsunade?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no answer except for a faint munching noise, and Shizune decided to venture inside. The moment she opened the door a pungent odor hit her that was unlike anything she had ever smelled. The air was so thick she could almost feel it. She looked up and saw Tsunade on her bed, almost a hundred pounds heavier. Her jacket was gone and her belt had been flung off, letting her robe stretch open with her breast pushing both ends of it to the side, letting her stomach hang out and sit on her chubby thick legs. \"Oh, Sh(urp)zune,\" belched Tsunade as she shoved greasy lasagna into her double chinned mouth, \"what are you doing here today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I doing! What are you doing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm relaxing what does it look li- wait a moment,\" said Tsunade as she lifted one large cheek off the bed and grunted a little. (FRRRRT) \"Ah, much better, now what was this about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune put her hand over her face as the hot air filled the room. \"Lady Tsunade, what has become of you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, I simply realized something is all.\" She dug her hand into a tray of lasagna and began stuffing her face again. \"Mmm, I (munch) realized that TonTon has it all right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TenTen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not her (uuuuurp) she's too active. I meant TonTon (faaaart).\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're, you're pet pig?\" asked Shizune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. He doesn't worry about anything, he just eats and rolls around in the mud all day and letting it all out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because he's a pig!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could learn a lot from them,\" said a very calm Tsunade.</span></div></div>",

Now I need you to get me some food and bring enough mud back to cover this floor!\" Shizune felt herself getting turned on by Tsunade's commanding voice as she normally did and nodded after a moment. Tsunade grinned and motioned her to come closer. Doing so, Shizune should have seen the belch coming but was still caught off guard as it wafted through her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe only had a moment to release it was a scent Genjutsu before it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing the gas in, Shizune's thoughts started to get fuzzy. Nodding slowly, the brunette left the room and came back thirty minutes later with a cart of food and several servants carrying loads of mud in sacks. They dumped the mud where the Hokage directed them and soon left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shizune,\" Tsunade cooed, \"My belly needs filling.\" Shizune walked towards the cart and grabbed several slices of cake and managed to bring along two huge bowls of ramen as well. Tsunade opened her mouth and Shizune shoved the first cake slice in. Munching nosily and getting large gobs of chewed cake all over Shizune's face, Tsunade sighed in pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing Shizune's dreamy expression, Tsunade then took the bowl of ramen from her, placing it on the floor. Then with a deceptively fast movement shoved Shizune's head straight into the hot bowl of noodles, Shizune starting to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finish it all up. You need some meat on your bones and a smell to leave behind.\" The Hokage then rubbed some mud from the floor into her greasy hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune came up after five minutes, the bowl empty and her stomach having a little pooch to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delicious URPPPPP Lady Tsunade,\" Shizune mumbled with something akin to an intoxicated look on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade grinned and inhaled deeply as her subordinate farted a moment later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed...</span></div></div>",

She rushed over to it as fast as her thick legs could take her and walked past the curtain entrance. \"Lady Tsunade, stop this right...\" she froze when she looked and saw it wasn't Lady Tsunade at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting at the counter were Sakura, Ino, and Hinata, each about one hundred and fifty pounds heavier, so large that their fat sweaty love handles and bums were rubbing against each other. Each of their clothes were stained and ripping, Sakura didn't even bother with pants at this point as she just wore a pair of panties with a cartoon pig on the rump. Each of them were leaning over the counter and shoving their faces into long bowls of what Shizune assumed to be ramen, only to realize it was just a collection of mismatched foods that were thrown together. They had no respect for table manners as they're faces and clothes were getting covered with the slop they were sucking down. Shizune looked each of them over and realized one other thing was different. On their headbands the symbol of the Hidden Leaf Village had been replaced by a round circle with two strait lines on it, almost like a pig's nose. Where did they get those? Could it be that Tsunade was handing them out as she spread this strange new philosophy of hers?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune realized as frightning as it was she had to interrupt them.

Normally Shizune would never accept such disgusting food, yet for some reason it did look decent enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever Shizune quickly regained her focus and asked the three \"Where's Tsunade?\" then Sakura, Ino, and Hinata began to try and concentrate. They just sat there thinking for about five minutes until Hinata said \"What were we doing?\" \"Oh! I know since there's food in front of us we must be here to eat!\" said Ino as she looked at the sickening food in front of them. \"Yeah, that's it!\" said Hinata as she re-continued gorging on food, followed by Sakura and Ino. \"Girls! What has gotten into you? You're all fat, misbehaving, and yet you act as nothing is wrong. Especially you Sakura, you're not wearing pants!\" said Shizune. \"I'm not? Oops, I forgot!\" she said blushing a little, but then focused on eating her slop. \"Ha ha!

How could they have given in so fast? Then Shizune realized something, as she looked in their eye she noticed something was wrong with them. Their eyes showed no emotion and had a light pink glow to them. Shizune realized it was a form of Genjutsu. It was different from the one she was under. Instead of giving complete control over someone, this Genjutsu decreases intelligence making them willing to do almost anything. It is temporary like the Genjutsu used on Shizune, but can last for weeks instead of a couple of days. It is rarely used since it often makes warriors incompetent, but apparently Tsunade is willing to use it to help them become part of Tsunade's attempt to create more slobs. If she doesn't act now, by the time the Genjutsu fades they maybe too fat and accustomed to this lifestyle to go back to normal. Shizune does know of a special counter Genjutsu but she's never tried it on this type of Genjutsu before. It may work or nothing may happen, either way Shizune felt obligated to try and help the girls.

Your appearance will be able unnafected by the weather and... hmm, sounds interesting.\" She didn't bother to read the rest of the scroll as she began performing hand signs, many of which involved the \"pig symbol.\" She completed the art as shown and her body was covered in a cloud of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the smoke cleared she...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Light crept over the rooftops of Konoha Village as the sun began to rise. A cool crisp breeze rolled in from the forest and swept along the streets of the sprawling urban borough. Slowly the streets began to fill with people coming and going as a new day began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the Hokage's building Shizune swiftly moved through the halls headed toward the office of the Hokage. Shizune carried with her two things she was taking great care in handling. One was the morning reports for the Hokage, just the start of the long list of paper work the Hokage would need to tackle before the day was out, a fact the current Hokage hated. The other was a box of donuts she gently pressed against her side, it was large enough to hold 18 donuts but already Shizune had eaten 4.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Lord Hokage!\" beamed Shizune as she burst into the office of the Hokage, Tsunade. \"I have your early morning paperwork sorted and ready for you to review. Lucky you, today's first stack is lighter than usu- Huh?\" Shizune trailed off as she looked at Tsunade. The chair the Hokage usualy sits in was turned off to the side and all that could be seen was someone's back sticking up behind the desk as they hunched over into one of the drawers. Shizune approched the desk with a frown already knowing what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade looked up from the drawer and smiled sheepishly crumbs and frosting dotting her lips. Inside the drawer a half eaten box of frosted tarts was half hidden behind a stack of shinobi preformance reviews, a second already empty box was hidden behind her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Tsunade I thought you were staring your diet toay!\" Shizune chastized her \"And aren't those the preformance reports you were supposed to evaluate last thursday?!\" Shizune slamed the armload of morning reports down on the desk and yanked the preformance reports out of the desk and stuck them on top the pile of paperwork. \"These reports need to be finished, I didn't go to the trouble of dividing all the shinobi up for reveiw this quarter into three groups so you could have the work spaced out for you just so you could push it to the side!\" Shizune yelled getting mad as Tsunade just looked up with her with tired eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shizune put a sock in it will you?\" Tsunade sighed \"I'll have them done by the end of the day alright? I only have 4 more to go...\" Tsunade sat back up in her chair and pulled the box of tarts out and placed them on the desk beside her pile of paperwork, no sense in trying to hide them now anyway. \"Just call in the remaining 4 for their interviews and they'll be done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune's head slumped forward depressed \"But thats only the first batch, the second batch comes in tomorrow and then you'll have to review those and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow?!\" Tsunade repeated \"But I thought you were spacing them out giving me 2 weeks to get through all the shinobi for each group before starting me on the next one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did!\" Shizune fired back \"you've had those reports for 2 weeks! If you had spent more time going over them and less time cramming food in your mouth you might have noticed you've been procrastonating about both your work and your diet for 2 whole weeks!\" Shizune growled fire in her eyes. Shizune quickly back off calming down and reached for another donut from the box she was holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh like you're one to talk!\" Tsunade spoke up \"You've been hitting the sweets pretty hard yourself lately. I seem to recall it started with just a half dozen box a few weeks ago, now what are you up to? 2 dozen?\" Tsunade grew defiant<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not 2 dozen it's only a dozen and a half! And I don't plan to eat them all I share these with the other girls filing your left over paperwork!\"  Shizune got upset again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suuuuure you always say that\" Tsunade cut in \"But by lunch time there will just be an empty box on your desk and you'll be asking what you can pick me up for lunch because you're hungry and you're going out to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah and you'll order enough food to feed a cow!\" Shizune quipped before realizing the mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade lept over her desk and tried to grab Shizune by the neck so she could pound some respect for the Hokage into her. After a brief struggle the two girls were left panting heavily leaning against oppasite wall of the Hokage office and making every other working in the building wonder what was going on in the Hokage office, none dared to check knowing if it was Tsunade and Shizune again they'd only be pulled into the brawl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade placed her arm on the desk panting trying to catch her breath. \"&lt;pant pant&gt;  Shizune... &lt;pant pant&gt; a thought just struck me... &lt;pant&gt;\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune slumpped down into a chair near the door and let out a long sigh \"Y-yes Lady Hokage?\" Shizune meekly answered weak from taking on the Hokage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"&lt;pant pant&gt; Why haven't we recived any reports on the escaped prisoners lately?\" Tsunade slowly asked. Shizune nodded her head to one side and sturck a confused look. \"Don't tell me you forgot! Several prisoners escaped from the Maximum Security Prison just over 2 weeks ago how could you not remeber?!\"  Tsunade looked at Shizune conserned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my I remeber!\" Shizune suddenly lit up \"You're right how did I let it slip my mind!? I've been such a scatter brain lately!\" Shizune quickly stood and hurried out of the office. Tsunade stood up stright and dusted herself off. Slowly returning to her seat Tsunade reach for another frosted tart when she noticed Shizune left her box of donuts on the desk. Smiling devilishly Tsunade opened the box and picked a few donuts out popping them in her mouth and started thrumbing through the shinobi preformance reveiws, She still had to do the interviews with a few of them before they could be filed. Tsunade looked through to who was left reading them aloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rock Lee... wonderful I get to spend some time with Gai's energetic clone...\" Tsunade sighed 'Sakura Haruno...  that shouldn't be so bad... provided she doesn't ask for more leasons today...\" Tsunade grumbled \"Hinata Hyuga... I'll be lucky if she even takes her eyes off the floor long enough to talk to me\" Tsunade shook her head \"And lastly... Oh no... Naruto Uzumaki?!\" Tsunade's eye twitched and she began gripping the paper hard enough to tear her fingernails into the paper out of frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune returned a few moments later shaking her head \"Lady Hokage I don't know why but it seems like we've lost all reconosince on the escaped prisoners. It seems like everyone involved with handing the matter either turned up nothing or just completely forgot to follow up on it. Something isn't adding up...\" Shizune stopped and glared at the Hokage. Tsunade looked to her assitant and smiled sheepishly again, part of a donut still hanging out of her mouth, the box of donuts nearly empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you're back already...?\" Tsunade tried to brush away the jelly still stuck to her cheek. Shizune charged the Hokage's desk and the two girls fought over what was left of the box of Donuts.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours later Sakura Slowly entered the office of the Hokage, spots of Jelly still stained the walls and celing in several area's from the fight over the last of the donuts. Tsunade tried to look dignified as she patted a stack of paperwork into a neat pile and set them asie before motioning to Sakura to have a seat, there was still some jelly in the Hokage's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade looked up as Sakura took a seat, Her red dress was tighter, where it once fit perfectly around her wasit it was now stressed, stretched over a softer wider midrift. Sakura's face was fuller, softer around the jaw line. Her arms which were now exposed with her new dress wern't as slim and toned as they once were, now they were smoothed out slightly thicker. Her behind streched her plat pants tighter, the fabric was lighter from the the skin that could be seen between the seems as they pulled the cloth tight against her fleshy rear. Sakura's legs like her arms were softer, no tone left to them, her thighs were lighter with celulite staring to filter in with her skin tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Sakura\" Tsunade greeted as the pink haired kunoichi sat down. Tsunade caught sight of a few chocolate bars hanging out of Sakura's kunai pouch as she was leaning forward to sit down. \"So Sakura, how are you doing?\" Tsunade asked as she glanced over Sakura's file.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine Lady Hokage\" Sakura proudly stated. Despite her cheerful confidence Tsunade could see Sakura's hand was digging into the arm of the chair she was sitting in while her other hand rested in her lap slightly stroking the kunai pouch with chocolate bars in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura's preformance reveiw didn't go well. Sakura's mind seemed distracted, sometimes taking Sakura a long time to come up with answers. Sakura also had to admit it had been a few weeks since she did any training insteed spending a lot of her time recently taking it easy. By the end of the review Sakura was practicly chewing on her lower lip fingering her pouch of chocolate. with a heavy sigh Tsunade thanked Sakura for her time and sent her on her way after asking her to meet her later that week for a meeting about her training. Sakura jumpped out of her seat her softer body already swaying more than her toned muscle body used to and quickly started for the door not even waiting to get out of the Hokage sight before she yanked a chocolate bar oout and started to tear into it. Already Tsunade was conserned with her star pupil's new behavior.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nNext up was Rock Lee. He entered witha look of determination and quickly took his seat. Lee was still the trim lean fighter he always was. Lee's green tights showed his body's shape was still in top form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good Morning Lee\" Tsunade greeted glad to see someone was still taking care of themself. Lee looked at the Hokage with fiery eyes and sat up straight waiting for her review. Lee sat with his legs close together and his hands rigidly on his knees. \"So how has your training been going?\" Tsunade asked aware of how much detail Lee goes into over his training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Lady Hokage I have been doing 1000 push ups every morning. And I have been running as many laps around the village as I can until my legs are to tired to even move!\" Lee proudly recited every detail of his training as if it were vital to his very life. \"And Then I practice all of my fighting moves with the test dummy Sensi Gui provided me. And then I do more laps around the village. And then I.... And then I....\" Lee continued on for an hour before Tsunade became to frustrated to listen anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLee's review went better then Sakura's but Tsunade was still as annoyed as she had been with Sakura after sitting through an hour long chat with Lee about how his training was going. Lee stood and jogged out of the Hokage's office picking up speed as he went.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nNext was Hinata Hyuga. Hinata sheepishly entered tugging at the bottom of her Coat. Hinata was as bad off as Sakura, maybe worse. Her belly was pushing against her coat forcing it to lift up trying to expose the bottom of her belly but Hinata kept tugging at it in an attempt to hide the fleshy belly underside. Unlike Sakura, Hinata seemed aware of her recent weight changes. However just like Sakura, Hinata was doing little to remedy the problem as her coat pockets seemed to bulge with snacks and sweets. Hinata's bust was also fuller bouncing more than usual as she awkwardly approtched the Hokage with her eyes buried in the floor shyling twisting a lock of her hair. Hinata's face was wider her checks filling outwards and turning red as she blushed aware the Hokage was eyeing her up and down as she got closer. Hinata's legs were a little better off than Sakura's still holding some tone and not over run with celulite but they were still not the shape they were once in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata sat slowly pointing her fingers into each other and rubbing them together in slow circles, her coat lifting higher as her soft belly and love handles mashed together and formed a larger roll of fat that allowed her belly button to peak out from under her coat. Hinata quickly realized the Hokage was eyeing the deer navel and squeeked as she yanked down on the coat hiding her soft pale belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Hello Hinata\" Tsunade said closing her eyes and slumping back in her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hello L-L-ady Ho-Ho-Hokage....\" Hinata stumbled over her words turning bright red her eyes stareing miles into the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata's interveiw went very badly. She was so shy about her weight she could barely answer any questions. Worse still any mention about her weight made Hinata withdraw into her mental shell completely losing the ability to speak. Hinata spent much of the Interveiw listening to Tsunade recap her recent decline in preformance over the last few weeks and only give a short high pitched yes or no before turning her face back to the hold in the floor she was buring with her intense stare all the while her cpat slowly riding up again so her Belly button could be seen again. Hinata left the Interveiw with a brisk walk trying to get away from Tsunade's sight as fast as she could her new poundage shaking all the way. Before she was out the door Tsunade could see Hinata's hands deep in her pockets dragging candy out and putting it in her mouth.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nLast was Naruto Uzumaki. Tsunade scowled when Naruto entered her office in his usual manner, hands crossed behind his head swaggering like he was king of the world. Naruto was at least as well of as Lee had been. He also had avoided the lazy routine Tsunade was seeing in many of her reports. Naruto's Orange jacket and pants were still fitting perfectly and his hace showed no sign of any double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto proudly came in and took a seat without being told even starting the conversation himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So whats up Grandma Tsunade?\" He asked chipper and boldly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you to stop calling me that!\" Tsunade barked already upset with him. \"So hows your trainign been going...\" She sighed hoping to get this over with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well with pervy sage out of town I haven't been able to train much with him but I have been getting a lot of practice at stealth manuvers and outrunning my foes\" Naruto explained picking at his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Tsunade asked not convinced \"Just who are these foe's you've been hinding from and outrunning exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sakura mostly!\" Naruto jumppd in \"That girl's been snacking like crazy and I made one little comment about it, now every time she sees me she tries to pound my face into the dirt! She won't leave me alone for two seconds I tell ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I see...\" Tsunade sighed thumpping her head into the desk<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ino is no better!\" Naurto started up again \"She may actually be hitting the buffet harder than Sakura! All I did was suggest she get out more often and spend less time behind the flower shop counter with a bag of chips in her hand! Now shes trying to kill me too\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't...\" Tsunade looked up, even she was surprised Naruto could be so bone headed \"Still I'm shocked Ino is letting this new trend get to her too...\" Tsunade trailed off thinking<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but Lee's the worst one of all!\" Naruto yelled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lee?!\" Tsunade shot back shocked 'But he was just in here this morning he's not having any weight trouble...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's not that!\" Naruto waved his hands \"Just the oppasite! Lee's been looking for a sparing partner! And with everyone snackign their butts off I'm the only one he says would make a real challange for him! Now he's been hunting high and low so he can drag me off to that dojo of his...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade had had enough \"Naruto I have a mission for you..\" She said standing up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Woohoo! Mission Yeah!\" Naruto cheered \"Ehhh...but wait, what about my review...?\" Naruto asked calming down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will have to wait' Tsunade told him \"Something is going on in the village. To many of our Shinobi are getting lazy and slacking off from their duties, I think this is more than just some bad case of couch potato syndrome, I think someone or something may be behind this bizzare behavior! I want you and Rock Lee to head out and investigate!\" She commanded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Lee?\" Naruto repeated \"Why Bushy Brows?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you and Lee are the only ones not acting lazy\" Tsunade explained \"What ever is going on isn't affecting you two so you two will be the ones to go around the village and gather information, then report back to me so we can decide what needs to be done. if you find anyone else who isn't falling into this behavior bring them too, as well as  Shikamaru, If anyone can figure out what might be behind this strange new phenomina it's him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it Grandma Tsunade!\" Naruto smiledand took off out of Tsunade's office. Tsunade just shook her head and sat back at her desk to finish her paperwork.As she worked her hand kept wanding into the bag of cookies hidden in her desk drawer.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto left Tsunade\u2019s office soon after his evaluation. \u201cOh man this mission is going to be so cool!\u201d he said with excitement, but then he thought to himself \u201cbut why do I have to work with Bushy Brows?!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\na few minutes later Naruto met up with Rock Lee in the woods. Lee was doing some pushups and got up when he was done. <br>\r\n\u201cAh ha, I see you have finally come to spar with me Naruto! You will have to forgive me I only did 500 one handed pushups today for each arm.\u201d <br>\r\nNaruto shrieked and said \u201cno, no, no, no, no Lee, I\u2019m here to tell you that you that we got a new mission from Tsunade!\u201d  <br>\r\nRock Lee said, \u201cOh ok! I guess I\u2019ll have to wait until were done! So, what is the mission?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWe have to figure out why so many people have been getting lazy.\u201d Said Naruto <br>\r\n\u201cI knew it! I thought people were getting lazier!\u201d said Rock Lee. <br>\r\n\u201cI suggest we look around town first to see who\u2019s affected by it,\u201d said Naruto. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe two ninjas rushed into town to observe this phenomenon. They got into the village and started their surveillance. They noticed that it was mostly women slugging around. Most of them were fatter, smellier, and just plain old lazier. The two then ran into Neji. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Neji, you just came back from a mission with Ten Ten right?\u201d said Lee. <br>\r\n\u201cYes I did. Why do ask?\u201d said Neji.<br>\r\n\u201cWe need to know how was Ten Ten acting during the mission.\u201d said Naruto.<br>\r\n\u201cHuh, how was she acting during the mission? It was almost a disaster.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!? How so?\u201d asked Naruto. <br>\r\n\u201cIt was a C-ranked mission, simple to say the least.  We had to protect some cargo coming to the village. There were some attacks but nothing we couldn\u2019t handle. However, Ten Ten was off her mark on this mission. She woke up late, ate more than her fair share of the food, and hardly could fight. I had to watch out for her the whole time. The mission took 4 days instead of 2.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI cant believe it, Ten Ten is always on point.\u201d Said Lee.<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for your help Neji.\u201d said Naruto. And then they were off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went off to ask their friends about how the girls were acting. First, Chouji said that Ino was eating just as much as him now. Next, Kiba and Shino said Hinata was lazier too. Then, Kakashi and Asuma told them that Anko and Kurenai were burping and farting a lot while on missions. Even when they were getting some ramen they noticed the shop owners daughter was stuffing her face. Finally they noticed that even Tsunade and Shizune were getting fat too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan its like some type of epidemic or something!\u201d said Naruto.<br>\r\n\u201cWe must go back and report to Shikamaru!\u201d said Lee.<br>\r\nThey arrived at Shikamaru\u2019s house and saw him sleeping on the porch.<br>\r\n\u201cOh no! He has got it too!\u201d said Lee.<br>\r\n\u201cNo he\u2019s always like this.\u201d Said Naruto  \u201chey! Wake up Shikamaru!\u201d yelled Naruto. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat the? Oh it\u2019s you guys. What do you want?\u201d said Shikamaru. <br>\r\n\u201cAll the girls are turning into slobs in the entire village! We have to report back to the Hokage and tell her,\u201d said Lee.<br>\r\n\u201cYou guys are just now noticing it? I\u2019ve seen it happen to a lot of women in the past two weeks.\u201d said Shikamaru.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?! Why didn\u2019t you tell anyone!\u201d yelled Naruto.<br>\r\n\u201cIt would be another problem I would have to worry about.\u201d said Shikamaru.<br>\r\n\u201cWell whatever. When did you first see it?\u201d asked Lee.<br>\r\n\u201cI first saw when I was in the sand village a few days ago. Temari could hardly hold her fan. And most of the women there were slobs too. I also noticed that this happened around the same time of that prison breakout. Someone must have been responsible for this.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then! Lets gather everyone we interviewed and go back to Grandma Tsunade and report this to her!\u201d said Naruto.<br>\r\n\u201cAww man\u2026what a drag.\u201d said Shikamaru.   <br>\r\n <br>\r\n      <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just remember though, if you mess up then the number of ninja's we have will be halfed and your work will therefore be doubled. So if you ever want some free time again then you better find out where they are!\" she said as the boys all agreed and left shortly after.
