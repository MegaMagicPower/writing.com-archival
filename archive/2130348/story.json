There is only one rule- if you wish to take the fifth option and provide more characters to suffer their own naked experience, please give us a brief introduction as I did for the main characters here, and be sure to leave the last choice available for \"Other Characters\". I would like there to always be an \"open slot\" available to a writer to tell a story about a character we had thus far overlooked or even bring in a character from a previous title if the mood strikes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpdate: It was recently announced that Persona 5 would receive a \"definitive edition\" in the form of Persona 5 The Royal. There will be some changes to the interactive to reflect this when more information is available. Most likely this will just involve a few additional characters, but it may go the Persona 3 Portable route and grant us a female Joker. If so I will edit some of the introductions to the chapters to make joker more gender neutral and add an extra choice at the bottom for him to be female rather than male. None of the stories we've already told will be impacted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll right. The year is 2016 (yeah yeah, the calendar in the game says 20XX. But all the dates on that same calendar line up with 2016 perfectly, and Atlus has state the ages of some of the characters from previous games as being four years older than before (last game was set in 2012) and it was the year it came out in Japan. So, yeah, totally 2016). The place is Tokyo. The city is filled with uncaring masses being exploited by the power hungry and corrupt. People are filled with distorted desires and ruin lies just over the horizon. A certain group of thieves aims to stop all that by stealing hearts and reforming society. But tonight one or more of those thieves will learn how difficult that can be when those same desires include leering perverts and mocking crowds. Any sensible thief fears exposure to the public, but tonight someone will learn just how bad certain forms of exposure can really be. But who will that be? </span></div></div>",

As a sleeper being jarred awake, Joker once more found himself abandoning his recollections and slipping back into the cold, hard reality of his present. His throat was dry and heavy from speaking so long. The countless cuts and bruises from his interrogations and beatings continued to throb in protest. He was aware of a growing, aching pain in the back of his head like every caffeine addicted headache he had developed when skipping his morning coffee at Leblanc over the past year was now coming back to haunt him at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, painfully he raised his eyes back up to the intense stare of Sae Niijima. She sat across from him in the dark, bleak chamber that they shared. Her arms were crossed, the scowl on her face a blend of judgment, wonder and focus as she took in his account (again weighing each piece of information, whether to trust it or discard it, and once more reassessing her impressions of her now exposed nemesis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoker said nothing, expecting another prompt to help center his mind and provide a place to pick up the narrative he was untangling for the both of them. The silence stretched on and on. Joker's eyes narrowed in exhaustion and confusion. The look Sae was giving him had changed slightly. This wasn't the vicious, judgmental stare she had first confronted him with, nor the bewildered and awe filled look she occasionally assumed when the details of his account clicked into place despite the sheer absurdity of his statements, nor even the ever so brief yet increasingly frequent sparks of genuine camaraderie she occasionally flashed his way (despite her every effort, she was growing increasingly FOND of the bastard). This was...pensive, unsure, as if for the first time she was actually hesitant to ask her questions despite the time limit that was dogging them throughout the process. If Joker didn't know any better, he would swear she was starting to blush in the dim light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't going to ask about this....\" She sighed at last. \"But I need a full account. And as strange as your story has been so far, this incident still stands out to me.\" She withdrew another picture from her briefcase and slid it across the table to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoker's eyes widened in disbelief as he began to remember. He felt his own face flushing to match his interrogator's as the events began to play out in his mind. He covered his mouth to hide the noise which threatened to escape from his throat, a combination of a laugh, a groan, and a small sigh of glee. The photo showed a familiar young woman, face contorted in a cry of dismay and terror, her body completely naked and poorly hidden behind her hands. Small black bars blotted out her exposed anatomy and hid her eyes from view, but Joker of course immediately knew her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ann Takamaki. One of the founding members of the Phantom Thieves, by your account. A young model talented in distraction and using her feminine whiles to obtain information and gain entry into places of interest to your group. But something went very wrong in this incident. We don't even know if it was related to Phantom Thief business. How did it come to pass that she lost her clothes...and suffered through such a strange series of incidents? Tell me everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoker cleared his throat, his mind still fuzzy from the drugs and trying to decide whether he felt more mortified or ecstatic about what his friend had gone through. Finally, he spoke, his voice cracking slightly. \"All right. This is how it began...\"</span></div></div>",

Next week at school, keep your eyes open for any clues. The culprit is probably someone within the school itself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere should we start looking?\u201d Ann asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d Morgana continued, \u201cMost of the people have targeted so far are people with expensive tastes in clothes. The more recent targets have been mainly girls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no risk of Ann being targeted,\u201d Yusuke said in a huff. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t even pick out matching underwear, let alone expensive ones.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up! exclaimed Ann. \u201cI just washed these this morning. I was in a rush! It\u2019s your fault for scheduling this so early.

It clung to the curve of her breasts, displaying her generous cleavage and the pastel pink bra underneath. Blushing furiously, she stormed off, her arms folded over her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll show them tomorrow,\u201d she declared. \u201cThey\u2019ll learn not to underestimate me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should Ann do to prepare for the next school day?</span></div></div>",

She carefully stepped up to the platform in front of the board, mortified that if she reached too high or bent forward that she'd give the front row a free show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" repeated the teacher, impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne looked at the question on the board. She didn't recognize any of it. She quickly surveyed the classroom nervously. Joker was asleep.

He was an artist, nothing more or less. The nude was a time-honored form of art, and countless artists throughout the centuries managed to evade thoughtless accusations of deviancy... Yusuke would be no different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept the small matter of fact: Ann refused to be naked for the project. He supposed it was to be expected, old-fashioned sentiments of feminine modesty and all... especially among the Japanese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat in his studio, tapping a dry brush against his empty easel.

TRICKERY?\" Yusuke said to no one as he paced around his small living space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned towards a mirror in the hallway of his small studio. In typical melodramatic fashion, he stalked up to his reflection, glaring at his doppleganger in a fury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trick her into undressing, Yusuke Kitagawa? How dare you? To even consider such a course, for even a moment! That you would consider sullying your forthcoming masterpiece with such base tactics....is that the sort of artist you wish to be? One who would abuse and manipulate to achieve his visions? Then by all means, walk the path of Madarame!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed dramatically and shook his head. \"No. No more subterfuge or demands. It was an act of foolish desperation, trying to force Tamaki-san to pose for me before! Sensei needed a new masterpiece and I was running out of time. But I knew, even then, that it would be futile to try and capture Ann's inner fire by force! She must be a willing partner, not a prisoner! I cannot capture the essence of what I see in her if she is not willing to show it to me. I must convince her with pure sincerity. Yes! I must tell her what I see in her, what I am seeking to show the world!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he strode forth from his apartment, a man on a mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you will say. And you are correct. My actions before were beyond unconscionable. I was driven by desperation...perhaps even a touch of the perversion you accused me of. It was absolutely inexcusable, and should I apologize from here to the end of time it would not make up for the slander I inflicted on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yusuke...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But hear me out! I beg you, see what I see! Ann Takamaki, you are beautiful. I do not speak of physical beauty, though that certainly applies! No! I see in you an inner fire, a woman who spurns the expectations and the shackles of this corrupt society! I see a fire! Dangerous! Potent! Powerful! I see one who has no need of foolish expectations the modern world would impose upon her. Certainly nothing so confining as mere clothing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yusuke...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you wish to say! The world looks upon you, and all they see are the exotic features and physical beauty. They presume you are a woman of loose morals. They want to use you, like that lout Kamoshida. I beg you to understand, I am not like those fools! I do not want to strip you for my own perverse pleasure! I wish to...to show you...liberated and unimpeded by the stupidities and lusts of those fools! You are your own woman! Your body is yours, your sexuality all your own! It cannot be claimed by any other! It is fierce, and powerful, and yearns to be liberated!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuusuke!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to understand! I am an artist! I do not seek to be some base pornographer! I wish to make of you a grand nude portrait, the best ever made! Nude, not naked! I know, to your ears they sound the same! But they are worlds apart to an artist! To be naked is to be stripped against one's will, thrust into a situation outside of one's control or desire! A maiden chained up and awaiting rescue is NAKED. To be nude is to be unclothed willingly and without shame! Nude is claiming the fundamental beauty, the power of the human form and presenting it uncaring of what the world might think. Its...it is like the difference between a shadow and a persona! Both seem the same, but one is all that the mind rejects about itself while the other is embracing everything about oneself! Consider! Your life as a model implies you are not afraid of your body or your looks! You are merely tired of others seeing your beauty and assigning their own idiotic assumptions to it! There is a part of you that wishes to display....even flaunt your lovely form before all others...but on your terms, not those of a foolish society or drooling bastards like Kamoshida!

Ann was as red as a tomato, her hands balled into fists. Thankfully there weren't many people around at this time of day. Even so, Yusuke's impassioned speech was loud enough for Ryuji to be impressed. And, well....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn continued to stare at him in livid humiliation, stepping out of the doorframe enough for Yusuke to see into her home. A couch, a television on...and a pretty brunette girl with a long ponytail sitting nearby, a bemused smile on her face. She gave an awkward wave to Yusuke when she realized she had been spotted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a guest.\" Yusuke noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a guest.\" Ann confirmed, her words caustic enough to eat through the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should have said something. I was being rather loud.\" Yusuke noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn's lips curled back into a snarl as she clenched her teeth to avoid screaming. One hand reached forward, grabbed the nape of Yusuke's shirt, and pulled him inside her living space, all the while fighting the rising desire to commit an unimaginably brutal homicide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yusuke...this is my friend, Shiho. Shiho...this is an idiot I know.\" Ann said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yusuke Kitagawa.\" the artist said, extending a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be Madarame's pupil. Ann's talked a lot about you.\" Shiho said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. And you must be Ann's friend. The one that scoundrel Kamoshida drove to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yusuke!\" Ann snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ann, its fine. Really.\" Shiho sighed. \"If I'm ever going to move past it, I can't force everyone to tiptoe around it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".......\" Ann paused, still glowering at Yusuke. \"I'll get some tea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. That sounds wonderful. I'll take a cinnamon blend with-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Green tea. Plain. And if I hear one complaint about how it isn't some stupidly fancy obscure blend from some highbrow cafe or something I promise this tea pot and the scalding water inside it are going to get shoved up places you will not want them. Clear?\" Ann snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem. Yes. Quite.\" Yusuke whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn stomped out of the room. Shiho instantly broke into a fit of a suppressed laughter as Yusuke seated himself on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should apologize for the interruption.\" Yusuke said after a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, please don't. The look on Ann's face was the most priceless thing I've seen in years!\" Shiho said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, I'm afraid I conducted myself a bit...umm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was very passionate. You might want to work on the volume, though.\" Shiho smiled. \"Still, its refreshing. I'm glad your as enthusiastic about your work as I imagined from your pieces.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You follow my work?\" Yusuke asked in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, absolutely. I really admire great paintings, you know. I wish I had some talent for it myself, but my drawing skills are terrible. At least I never sucked as much as Ann, though.\" Shiho said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shiho, you know I can hear you, right?\" Ann said from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" Shiho said with a smile. Yusuke was liking her more by the minute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some of my tirade must have seemed strange, though.\" Yusuke mused. \"Sensei always scolded me for my eccentricity. I really should learn to reign it in a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's fine, really. Like I said, its nice to see an artist getting excited about his work. And...\" Shiho shifted to a whisper. \"Between you and me, I'm glad to hear someone else sees the Takamaki-san I've been seeing this whole time! She acts all sweet and timid, but there's a lion hiding in there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lion? You think so? I pictured her as more a panther.\" Yusuke whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm. Maybe. But why do I get the impression I'm missing some inside joke now?\" Shiho asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. You are an observant one. I apologize again, Miss Suzui. I am being rude.\" Yusuke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries. I assume its some kind of Phantom Thief thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusuke's face went blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Oops. I'm not supposed to know about that, am I?\" Shiho giggled softly to herself. \"Don't tell Ann, okay? She's been trying really, really hard to keep it a secret, I just didn't have the heart to tell her I figured it out months and months ago. I mean, everyone who visited me in the hospital was buzzing about how Ryuji and the new kid had butted heads right after...what I did. Then Ann came along and told me that 'someone' made Kamoshida pay for what he did, and when I asked who her voice took on that fake accent she only uses when she's trying really hard to act innocent and coy and doing the worst job at it. All the stuff with Madarame and you becoming a regular friends of theirs just cemented it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusuke hung his head and sighed. \"It may be the worst kept secret in this city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your secret is safe, obviously. But I want Ann to tell me herself when she's ready...even if I'm dying to know how exactly it all works.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You probably wouldn't believe me if I told you.\" Yusuke whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation was cut short as Ann reentered the room. Ann eyed Yusuke suspiciously as she poured him a cup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what were you two whispering about in here?\" Ann asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you know....how to get you to pose naked.\" Shiho said with a straight face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Yusuke was spared Ann's look of outrage and promise of painful death due to choking and sputtering on his tea. </span></div></div>",

Ann nodded just as seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout preamble, Shiho rose to her feet. To the shock of both onlookers, she unbuttoned her shirt and pulled the garment over her head. Yusuke blinked several times in surprise, while Ann's eyes grew wide and her blush deeper. By the time Ann had thought to scramble to a stunned Yusuke and clamped a hand over his staring eyes Shiho had divested herself of her skirt and stood before them in a skimpy sports bra and panties. Blind as he now was, Yusuke had seen enough to appreciate how athletic yet shapely Shiho's body was. Thinner, less bouncy compared to Takamaki-san, but still very attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They took the stitches out awhile ago, but you can still see the scars if you know where to look.\" Shiho said, gesturing to her left side that had taken the brunt of the fall during her suicide attempt. \"They aren't much to look at now, but in rehab you could help but notice. It wasn't easy learning how to walk again. Some days I wanted to give up altogether, you know? You remember what kept me going, Ann?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn blushed intensely, for reasons that weren't entirely due to her friend standing half-naked in front of her. \"Because of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because of you.\" Shiho said. \"Brave, determined, beautiful Ann Takamaki. You inspired me to stay tough and keep trying. Your the reason I can sit here and smile over this situation. You inspired me. You saved my life. Now think about how many other girls are out there who need a reason to keep going. Yusuke says he can capture the Ann I know and show it to the whole world! If you could save even one more girl like me, isn't that worth your embarrassment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shiho...\" Ann whispered, then shook her head. \"I keep telling you, your wrong about me. I'm weak and selfish. Your the one who kept ME going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusuke chuckled, his eyes still covered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something funny, Inari?\" Ann snapped, using the hated nickname Futaba had given him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. Familiar, more than anything. Madarame took great pains to convince his disciples that their own skills were meaningless and that any talent they displayed was because of him and him alone. It has taken a great deal of effort to dissuade myself of his message. I simply find it ironic that two girls who are clearly very strong in their own right have come to recognize the strength in the other without understanding their own power.\" Yusuke mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn paused, trying to hold on to her anger while the turn in the conversation inspired so many melancholy feelings inside her. \"Th-this isn't fair, Shiho. Y-you can't just play the 'inspire people' card on me out of nowhere. Your playing dirty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho shrugged. \"Its how I feel. One reason, anyway. I'd also like to see this masterpiece your friend was shouting about. I wanna see how a real artist shows the you I know to the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shows me to the world stark naked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nude, not-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is that, too. I am looking forward to watching you squirm.\" Shiho said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it!\" Ann snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But just a little! Its mostly about the other stuff! You know...all the time everybody just stayed silent and ignored Kamoshida and let him get away with turning us all into victims. I just...never want that to happen again. Like Yusuke said, this is a way to reclaim who you are...who we are! Here she is, Ann Takamaki! Unchained! Unhindered! Unclothed! Ready to take on the world without giving a damn! And the world won't stand a chance!\" Shiho said, trying to mimic Yusuke's earlier spiel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your still not fighting fair!\" Ann pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" Shiho said, without a hint of apology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Fine!\" Ann said at last. She yanked her hand away from Yusuke's face, then stomped around his chair to stare straight into his eyes. \"Listen up, you! If I'm going to do this, we're doing it my way! First off, Shiho is coming with us. I want someone observing you to make sure you don't turn into a pervert again when the clothes are off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When have I ever-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were acting skeevy as hell when I stripped off in Madarame's place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....She stripped off at Madarame's place?\" Shiho asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That hardly counts. You were actively trying to seduce me to get into Sensei's private collection! Even the most stoic artist would have fallen for your allure and honeyed words! So long as you do not try to take advantage of my naivete again I will be the very picture of decorum and professionalism.\" Yusuke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ann, don't bully the artist!\" Shiho said in mock horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't bull....Shiho comes with! Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've no objection. As long as she can sit and observe without distracting us, at least more than Ryuji could, she can do as she likes.\" Yusuke nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a very high bar to reach there.\" Shiho nodded. \"I'll be there for moral support, too. Cheer her on from the sidelines! Oh! And I can look after her clothes. Just in case you do turn out to be skeevy after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can assure you...\" Yusuke sighed at Ann's glare. \"Yes, fine. No objections. She does seem to inspire more confidence in you anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Second, I get final say in what we do with the portrait! If it ends up being too lewd or embarrassing, I can have it destroyed or whatever I want. Understand?\" Ann said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But....yes. Fine. If you can't agree that it is as magnificent as I claim it will be I'll consider it a failure anyway.\" Yusuke nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. So...uhhh...when do we get started?\" Ann asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...a good question. I hadn't contemplated a proper venue. My studio? Or perhaps somewhere in the countryside? I don't know....give me a moment to ponder...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho let out an excited squee and glomped on to Ann, giving her a tight hug and a enthusiastic kiss on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....In the meantime...\" Yusuke said. \"Miss Suzui...I apologize, but could you put on some clothes? The underwear is a little too distracting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiho blinked, looked down at herself, screamed, and ran behind Ann with a sudden blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me you forgot.\" Ann sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...I got wrapped up in the conversation! Then you agreed to it, and I got excited! J-j-just shut and don't move!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, but then I would get to see you squirm...\" Ann said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ann, don't you...stop walking towards him! Ann, I mean it!

You will pose before the Sayuri, and match the pose of the subject.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusuke made a square with his hands, framing his subject as an entranced smile crossed his face. He was inspired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn was skeptical to say the least, and staring daggers.

So both of you listen up, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusuke and Ann each raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First off...Ann! No bullying!\" Shiho said with a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard him! He wants me to get naked right out on a public street!\" Ann snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Bully.\" Shiho said, folding her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn glared back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem. Yusuke, correct me if I'm wrong here. Until recently, you've been living with that Madarame guy, right?\" Shiho asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's correct.\" Yusuke agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So earlier, when you asked for some kinda special cinnamon tea blend and Ann growled at you-\" Shiho said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one was growling at anyone!\" Ann interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Acted annoyed by the request, I take it this wasn't the only time you've asked for something a little above your friends price range?\" Shiho asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....I am uncertain. My requests usually go unheeded.\" Yusuke offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In other words, your used to have a certain lifestyle and aren't aware of how expensive it is because Madarame was always footing the bill.\" Shiho nodded. \"At least, for the sake of argument let's assume that, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going with this?\" Ann asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm guessing in a similar way, whenever you were inspired to do painting, all you had to do was say 'Sensei! I want to do the painting this way!' and poof! You could do the painting that way.\" Shiho said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...suppose Sensei did take care of the preliminary measures.\" Yusuke confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That isn't surprising. One way an abuser victimizes someone is by maintaining control over them. They like to handle the finances, get their target expensive gifts, that sort of thing.\" Shiho scowled. \"That way their victim starts associating their abuser as a kind and generous sort while at the same time having their ability to pay for the simplest things dependent entirely on the person who abuses them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn sighed and shut her eyes. Dammit Shiho. Stop drawing parallels between the pervert and yourself. How was Ann supposed to properly deal with Yusuke if she was thinking about what made him like her best friend?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...yes, I suppose that is accurate. I have little experience with the outside world, so I cannot say for certain. Yet that tactic sounds like Madarame, and it certainly resembles my lifestyle until recently.\" Yusuke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. So I don't blame you for making certain mistakes here. But you need to start being more considerate, too.\" Shiho said, her voice a little more scolding than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I had done just that.\" Yusuke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but no. Your the artist here. You don't have a Mr. Moneybags to snap his fingers and prepare the stage for you to paint on anymore. You have to take care of all of that yourself. That means becoming aware of your budget and all the footwork you need to do to prepare the space and everything. And that also means considering the needs of your model and whoever else you work with.\" Shiho said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What precisely was I doing if not that?\" Yusuke asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been living a sheltered life, but that's no excuse. Asking a girl to be naked on a public street? Think about that! First of all, at the very least consider her modesty and how she might get embarrassed! People, some of which she might know, would be passing all around her seeing her naked! While that sounds like fun from a certain perspective...\" Shiho winked at Ann, who offered a rude gesture in response. \"...from another it will screw up her composure and ensure she won't maintain the pose or look you want from her. And that's just the beginning. Public nudity is illegal, so if someone catches her like that it would be big trouble for all three of us! Plus...we know better than anyone that there are bad, bad people out there. If one of them found Ann like that...we don't know to dwell on it. My point is, you the artist are asking a LOT from Ann here. She's on record as being insecure about her looks and the way people treat her and assume things. She putting aside all of that for the sake of your portrait. She's allowing herself to be really vulnerable and putting herself in your hands. In return you are responsible for making her comfortable and safe in whatever setting you put her in. So our location needs to be somewhere we won't get in trouble or have too much interference from other people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But there are examples of artists doing outdoor nudity.\" Yusuke protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sure. But I'm not an expert on that stuff. At the very least we would need permission from a business (like Leblanc) or some kind of permit from the city to legally do it in public. We'd need to arrange to keep foot traffic out of the area if its outside, too. And the problem is...that costs money. Money none of us have. So, we need a private place, like your studio. Or a place we can legally do artwork while naked (like a nude beach or something). Or we need to side step the law a bit and find a place remote enough to get away with being naked without getting caught.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusuke pondered this point for a moment.</span></div></div>",

No matter where they went it almost certainly would have to be at night. But a subway was still a nexus of people getting around the city.

She took a tentative step forward, the feeling of the tiled floor surprisingly cold with only her red stockings covering her feet. Nervous and feeling slightly cold, pressed hugged herself and took another few steps on tiptoe. She shot another suspicious look at Yusuke before stepping behind the billboard. She took a moment to breath in and out. Ignoring the way her fingers shook ever so slightly, she carefully guided the zipper all the way down. Shrugging off the hoodie and putting it aside, Ann was left in a thin tank top that exposed a large amount of cleavage and left her midriff exposed along with a plaid short skirt and her red stockings. With a sigh Ann wiggled her hips, pulling the tight red stockings down and off her hips and legs. She deposited the item beside her hoodie, then paused. She popped her head around the side of the banner, glaring suspiciously at Yusuke, who glanced in her direction. He hadn't moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Yusuke asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing. Stay there!\" Ann snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he wasn't trying to peak. Then again, why would he bother. She was going to be posing in front of him soon enough! Right? She could still back out....make up an excuse....Except Shiho seemed to really want this, too...but she was acting more pervy about this than Yusuke! Except she also said this would mean more to her than JUST seeing Ann naked, that it could inspire other girls in trouble...plus pervy or not the way she was acting right now was more excited and...well, just plain happy than she'd been in much, much too long. Shiho's smile was precious, after all, and if getting naked was the price to be paid of course Ann would do it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's it. In the end it was all for Shiho's sake. Ann was definitely not in any way curious about how the painting would turn out, or why whatever vision Yusuke had made him so desperate to push for this. And it definitely, definitely, definitely had nothing to do with the occasional thrill she got in modeling by assuming a provocative pose or wearing a skimpy outfit that made the film crew gape a little and made her feel just a little sexy knowing she was being stared at and was the only thing on their minds in that instant. She definitely didn't want to feel that way but even more intensely. Nope. Not at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a big sigh, Ann hooked her hands under her shirt and stripped it off in one quick gesture. Her skirt followed, as did her black underwear. And then she paused, and paused, and paused. Here she really was. Naked, in public. And other people were about to see her like this. Only a little banner between her and them. Ann inched forward. The feeling that overtook her when she was unzipping was back, and much more paralyzing.

For future reference, I have placed us-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I GET IT!! HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS IS A 'SAFE ZONE'??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Are you certain you want a detailed explanation as to how an artist can assess details about angle and depth in an area, or is the absurdity of that question as obvious to you as it is to me?\" Yusuke asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get smart with me! Its your fault there's a whole train about to unload on me in the first place! Your safe zone is going to be useless!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps.\" Yusuke shrugged. \"But we do have a plan B, if you recall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held up a cell phone, the tell tale red eye already loaded on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...Shiho...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can handle the truth if necessary. But I suspect we will not need to go that far. As I said, this time of night passengers are rare and this terminal is closed off to above ground access. I might have overestimated the subways moving through here, but there is no reason to get off at this stop. Except for some late night artwork, of course. Speaking of which, this current portrait is...decent, I suppose, but its not bringing out the qualities I was hoping for. After a break perhaps we could try a less...standoffish pose? I think this one will make the audience uncomfortable, as if the woman is accusing them of some wrongdoing. And while that will be an interesting motiff to develop, I feel we can do better....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you out of your mind? We can't just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold that though.

The Palace of the general public had proven itself useful as a kind of training ground for the team to hone their abilities, as well as the best way to fulfill the many requests posted on their website.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing that didn't seem to improve, however, was Joker's ability to negotiate with Shadows that had been knocked to the ground and surrounded. The cornered Shadow was showing signs of retaliation when Panther finally decided to step in. Shooting a glare Joker's way (who returned the look with one of his own, doing his best to convey the idea of \"How am I supposed to know what food this thing wants?!\") she stepped forward and, putting on her biggest puppy-dog eyes and most pleading voice, turned on the charm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, come on. You don't have to be so mean, do you? Can't you take it easy on me?\" Panther asked, her voice dripping with honey and appeasement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Shadow's expression changed. Where before it had looked ready to jump up and resume trying to kill the humans that had intruded upon its home, it instead regarded Panther with a look of appraisal. Just as Ann had hoped, the Shadow's expression softened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, hell. What am I supposed to say to that?\" the being asked nobody in particular. \u201cI don't wanna fight you guys. Besides, I can tell when I'm probably outmatched. Thing is, I don't have any cash or goodies to trade for my safety.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoker sighed and took aim with his pistol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHOA! Whoa, buddy, settle down!\u201d the Shadow begged, throwing its hands up in a defensive posture. \u201cI don't have anything on me, but I know where you can find something nice. It's not in the kind of place you guys would look. You'd never find it without my instructions! So, whaddaya say? I tell you where to find a goodie, I get to go free?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick glance between his teammates to get a consensus, Joker nodded. \u201cDeal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd after that, you're gonna break down the wall just around the corner. Treasure chest will be right there.\u201d the Shadow finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Phantom Thieves disappeared with a wave, piling into their odd transforming van. Or cat. Or whatever that thing was supposed to be. And the humans looked at the Shadows like they were the weird ones? It didn't matter, the Shadow had done its job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, they took the bait.\u201d the Shadow said as it turned to face the swirling darkness that had manifested a short distance away. \u201cI don't get what you don't just kill the brats.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt isn't for you to understand.\u201d the figure said as it emerged from the darkness. \u201cBe content knowing that my plan will greatly hinder, if not completely stop, the Phantom Thieves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight... Anyway, uh, pleasure doin' business with ya, er... what are you called again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust call me Temptation.\u201d the figure replied.</span></div></div>",

After more twists and turns than seemed reasonable, and crashing through a wall to Morgana's mild discomfort, the Phantom Thieves saw the gleaming treasure chest the Shadow had promised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, the Shadow could have easily lied and sent us to a dead end and just run off as soon as we left. I didn't think it'd actually be true to its word.\" Queen said as Joker opened his door and hopped out. Panther followed suit, trotting up alongside Joker to see what her seduction had earned the team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chest was secured with a heavy lock, which the Shadow had failed to mention, but Joker always seemed to come prepared. Pulling one of his self-made lock picks that Panther still didn't know how he got away with making in the middle of the school day, the team leader went to work. A few moments of deft finger work later and the lock's tumblers clicked into place, the padlock falling open and sliding off with no trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was always one of the blonde's favorite parts of being a Phantom Thief. Sure, reforming society by stealing the hearts of rotten adults was a feeling of pride and accomplishment that couldn't be beat, but the thrill of opening a chest and finding something pretty and expensive was a close second. Joker was always the one to do the honors of actually opening the things, but Panther stood beside him, her eyes wide and expectant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chest opened to reveal a decent pile of yen, and a pair of beautifully sparkling earrings. The accessories the team found inside Mementos and the various Palaces their work had taken them to always proved to have beneficial effects, and something about the way the earrings sparkled almost captivated Panther. Eagerly reaching inside the chest and plucking them from the top of the money pile, she flashed Joker a wide smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna go ahead and put these on! It's not like you or the other guys would want to wear earrings anyway, and I already have pierced ears.\" she explained as she deftly removed the simple studs that normally decorated her ears and slid the new accessories into place. Panther felt the effects almost immediately; she felt stronger, more energetic, and in general just better than before. \"Let's go test them out!\" she said, taking Joker by the wrist and practically dragging the leader back to the team van (though not before he had managed to bag the rest of their prize.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Panther's performance throughout the rest of the team's foray into Mementos was fantastic. She hit harder than before, dodged attacks with the feline grace of her namesake, and seemed to tire out slower. What none of the Phantom Thieves noticed, however, was the dark glimmer in her new earrings with every Shadow the team defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team eventually returned to the surface to call it a day. They'd progressed deeper into the mysterious dungeon and made off with a good haul, all things considered. Returning to the normal world and going their separate ways, Ann returned home with a happy bounce in her step. It wouldn't be until the next day that the true purpose of her new equipment manifested, and the energy built up from the defeated Shadows and diffused into her own body fulfilled its purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...</span></div></div>",

After that it was a simple matter of grabbing breakfast if she didn't sleep in too much, then shower and get a move on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiving alone also meant that Ann never had to wait for the bathroom to be free or worry about having to mold her routine around anybody else.

Sometimes that meant her school bag, or (much less often) her phone, and one time she even forgot her shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, however, Ann forgot much more than one small thing. After her morning shower she dried off and skipped out of her bathroom. A quick glance at the clock showed that she'd slept in far more than she intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, crap! I'm gonna be late!\" Ann said, rushing over to the front of the house. Ann grabbed her school bag and slung it over her shoulder as she slipped into her shoes and threw open the door. A warm morning breeze blew across Ann's body. Her bare body. She'd completely ignored getting dressed after hopping out of the shower!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, why do I feel like I'm forgetting something?\" Ann asked herself idly as she stepped outside and let the front door fall shut behind her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ann shrugged, dismissing her vague concerns. She definitely remembered placing all of her homework in her bag last night, and that was the only really important thing that she needed to bring. And it wasn\u2019t like she had plenty of spare time to just stand here trying to remember whether she\u2019d packed a pencil or whatever else it was that was niggling at her memory! With her worries assuaged, the platinum blonde teenager raced out of the entrance of her home and onto the sidewalk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, most girls would have noticed they were naked. At least, most girls with any kind of chest would have noticed when they started running with unsupported breasts, anyway. But Ann was in an unusual position. She\u2019d spent a large part of her recent life fighting in the Metaverse. And when she fought in the Metaverse, Ann was clothed in a skintight catsuit that zipped only halfway down her breasts, and it didn\u2019t help that her costume didn\u2019t come with a bra, either. Thanks to that, she was very used to the feeling of running around with her breasts effectively unbound, to the point where she didn\u2019t even glance down when she felt her tits sway and jiggle as she ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what tits they were! Ann Takamaki had been blessed with a perfect mix of genes from her attractive parents. Part Japanese, part American (of Finnish descent), she had a body that was quite literally the envy of some models. That had been proven when she\u2019d almost lost her part-time modeling job to another model who\u2019d tried to undermine her due to their jealousy, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut really, who could blame that other girl for her jealousy? Ann\u2019s inherited beauty was effortless, coming more from a lucky mix of features from her parents. She barely needed makeup, and she barely needed to diet. Even straight out of the shower, her skin was flawless, pale and unmarred despite the dangers of her extra-curricular career as a phantom thief. Her body was eye-catchingly proportioned \u2013 with a toned stomach and ass, along with a pair of healthy breasts that looked even bigger on her thin frame. Despite their size the large breasts, capped with pink nipples that were bare for all to see, were still perky thanks to Ann\u2019s youth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove her completely exposed pussy was a small patch of pale-blonde pubic hair, carefully trimmed to ensure that the girl could do her swimsuit modeling jobs without fear of any of it showing. Thanks to her unintentional nudity, it now acted to prove to anyone watching that her hair colour really wasn\u2019t the result of a dye-job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there were people watching. This was Tokyo during the morning rush hour, after all, and not some backwater village in the middle of nowhere. It hadn\u2019t taken Ann more than a few seconds after leaving her house before she\u2019d started passing random people as she rushed towards her destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDozens of commuters, slowly drudging their way down the street as they mentally prepared themselves for another soul-crushing day of work stopped and stared and gasped as their day getting suddenly got a hundred times more interesting as a beautiful and quite naked teenage girl ran past them, her long legs eating up the distance as her large breasts bounced and swayed enticingly for all to see. After the girl had passed, they were still treated to the sight of her bare buttocks swaying as the underlying muscle flexed and moved to keep her gait steady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long for the teenager to notice the gasps and cries of shock of the people she passed, and the widening eyes and stares of the ones in front of her when they saw her. For a moment, doubt and puzzlement flashed through her at the unusual reactions, before she remembered\u2026 one of the recent photo spreads that she\u2019d posed for was for that popular magazine. A magazine that had been due out yesterday! Was this why everyone was staring at her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn blinked as yet another person saw her out of the corner of their eyes and spun around to stare at her with gape-mouthed shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow\u2026 she\u2019d known that the magazine was popular, but she wasn\u2019t expecting so many people to recognise her from it and be so awestruck that they\u2019d react like this upon seeing a model from its pages! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with her internal explanation for the reactions she was getting, Ann started to smile and wave to people as she ran by them, certain that she was being friendly by thanking fans of the magazine, and having no idea that it looked like she was happily, comfortably, and willingly exposing herself as she ran along.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ann sped her way through the underground complex that housed the subway system in this part of Tokyo. She was feeling increasingly annoyed and exasperated with the way everyone was acting. The station was crowded as usual, but today it was much worse as crowds just seemed to stop and gape at her wherever she went. She practically had to slap the dumb ticket provider into doing their job. She was of course thrilled that her popularity was growing but this zombie like behavior was slowing her down and pissing her off. Fortunately, most of the gates were automated so she was able to navigate through the corridors despite the perpetual stares and the occasional photo. People were just plain rude today! It still took an extra burst of speed to get onto her train before the doors closed. As usual she felt herself packed in tight like a sardine as more commuters flooded in behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder most circumstances, Ann's cognizance at this point would have awakened to the fact of her nudity. Her body was brushing up against business suited men on every side. It should be impossible to ignore that way more of her skin coming in contact with other people without the expected barrier of a school uniform. Alas, the very forces that had caused her to forget her clothes were still at work on her mind. The mysterious earrings she found in the Metaverse were dangling from her ears, one of the only accessories she was actually wearing at the moment. They were humming in her eyes, singing a song only her unconscious to hear in a language older than the human race. They assured her that all was well, that nothing strange or out of place was happening. Certainly, there were gropers on the train, like everyday, and perhaps they were more active than normal. An annoyance, but nothing to fear. This was, in a way, fortunate for Ann. Under normal circumstances, a naked girl on a crowded train would be in all sorts of danger. But the same song that eased her worries also spoke to her fellow passengers. 'This one is a gift from the gods. Savor her, play with her, but do no harm to her. Her body is yours to explore, but only if you do so with the grace and dignity her beauty deserves. Be gentle. Be careful. Bask in the moment. Do not ruin it.' Ann was thus safe from any would be predators looking for self-gratification. This was also a mixed blessing, however. The men around her were free to grope and play with her body all they wanted. The earrings merely forced them to go about it a bit more gently than they might, focusing and appreciating the feel of her skin and the way her body responded to being touched. A hundred groping hands were touching and caressing her in a soft, intimate way they might a lover, with all their focus aimed at enjoying the feel of the girl while softly teasing and playing with her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn's mind was caught in a semi-dream state. The earrings could not entirely filter out the experience of being groped and foddled and fingered, but it did keep her awareness down to a minimum. Her thoughts revolved around how annoying the gropers were today, and embarrassment that her body was reacting despite herself. On another level, her body was luxuriating in the sensation of so much attention. Hands were stroking her thighs and stomach, dancing along her ribcage, playing with her hardening nipples, squeezing her exposed butt, and a few daring fingers were even stroking her wet inner folds and hardening clit. It was all building up to an inevitable conclusion...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The train came to grinding hault and the lights flickered. Ann sighed to herself in irritation as a voice came over the loud speaker, announcing the unexpected delay. Wonderful. Not only were people be particularly rude today with their gawking (not an uncommon occurrence when it came to the life of Ann Takamaki in a public setting) but now her train was delayed! And worst of all, that nagging feeling she was forgetting something important was back and worse than before! Really, this was worse than those awful anxiety dreams where she hadn't studied for the important test and after she finds out she failed she also realizes she wasn't wearing any clothes! Truly awful! It was getting worrisome and frustrating, and the people in the car were crowding in too close...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, as her oblivious conscious mind was struggling to understand the messages her subconscious was screaming at her, a dozen perverted hands were squeezing and stroking her naked body from her breasts to her stomach down to her butt cheeks and long legs and thighs! Given the influence of the earrings the crowd was being rather congenial with their new toy. Ann was slowly being moved about the car, passed from one pair of lecherous hands to another, every person given a few minutes to enjoy her nakedness. Often the crowd would thin in a certain direction, adjust Ann's position at the request of a would be photographer. On instinct Ann would strike a lewd pose, the crowd ensuring her naked form was not obstructed by other passengers. By now there were assuredly thousands of photos saved onto hundreds of cell phones exposing parts of her body she had always kept hidden at angles that would make her die of embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBereft of the guiding hand of her consciousness, Ann's poor conflicted subconscious (that part of her mind allowed to be completely aware of every embarrassing second of her public foray into nakedness) was dying of humiliation and reveling in the excitement of exposure at the same time. At the root of this paradox was Ann's own insecurity towards her beauty. As a child of a foreigner and a native of Japan, Ann naturally had different features from her fellow school girls. She was, for example, taller and much better endowed than many of her classmates. This had caused no end of attention and no little contempt from her fellow students, some attracted by her exotic beauty and others repulsed by her partly barbarian heritage. Ann similarly developed a pride and shame of her own appearance. She certainly reveled in her beauty from time to time, as befits the femme fatale role she claimed with in the group. The excitement she gained from manipulating a man enamored by her body into doing whatever the phantom thieves required was immense (especially on those occasional when she realized she had managed to get the idiot erect...a particularly strong thrill of excitement she had very deliberately never mentioned to her friends). On the other hand, the sense of indignation and outrage she felt towards anyone who wished, like Kamoshida, to use her or control her for her appearance could not be understated. The current situation, in which she was both the slave and the master of this crowd of enthralled men, subject to being felt up by thousands (japanese train cars have an immense maximum occupancy, which was strained to the brim this morning!) but also directing them about when she desired to pose for a camera or place herself in a new position for maximum viewage and access left her completely horrified and overwhelmingly aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiggling her tits and ass Ann gently pulled the exploring fingers off her body and out of her inner folds. With a collective sigh of awe, the mass of humanity pulled free their cell phones as one. Ann parted her legs, giving everyone a clear shot at her wet pussy. With one hand she grasped a handring above her head, and with the other she began to play with herself, finishing off the probing the strangers had given her earlier. To the delight of a thousand cameras and the utter mortification of her subconscious Ann fingered herself in public to yet another climax, her whole body shaking with the power of her orgasm as her hips gyrating lewdly in front of the cameras. Thanks to the magic of the earrings, this latest orgasm (the fifth she had experienced thus far) was as powerful as the last, and her body showed no sign of tiring or being content with the pleasure it had received.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the conscious and oblivous mind of Ann was growing concerned with her shaky legs...was she catching a cold? Suddenly she had a thought....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"I wonder if any of the others are getting delayed like this? Maybe we can find a way to meet up?\"</span></div></div>",

She considered asking if Makoto would rather see another movie, but she figured the other girl would likely decline, being too stubborn to leave the movie before it ended despite being terrified of it.

Ann was trying to brainstorm what she could do to help Makoto feel better, when another screaming jump scare came across the screen and the choice was taken from her. Makoto seemed to temporarily forget her plight as she clung to Ann even closer than before. If not for the armrest between them, Ann was sure her senior would\u2019ve been sitting in her lap. As it was, Makoto leaned over the armrest, both arms wrapped around Ann\u2019s side, pulling her as close as she could be and holding her tight. Makoto\u2019s face burrowed into the side of Ann\u2019s bosom, which ordinarily would be enough to make the blonde blush on its own. But that wasn\u2019t the reason Ann\u2019s face blushed cherry red. No, she owed that cherry red tint to Makoto. In her tight embrace, Makoto\u2019s own bosom was pressed firmly into Ann\u2019s side, a fact Ann was well-aware of. And from what she was feeling, Ann at the very least could confirm that Makoto did not have a bra on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm-uh, Makoto, y\u2019know, you\u2019re holding me a little tight there,\u201d Ann whispered, accenting it with a quiet, awkward giggle. \u201cMind letting up a little bit?\u201d She looked down at her friend, whose eyes were firmly closed and appeared to be trying to shut everything out. \u201cMakoto?\u201d She asked, only to get no reply. She tried to pull away some, but for each inch she scooted away, another inch of Makoto came up over the armrest to fill the void. She considered trying to shift in her seat, make the position a little less comfortable for Makoto, but two \u2013 or rather three \u2013  things stopped her. The first was lingering guilt that her movie choice was the reason Makoto was so scared. Ann shifted some to get a better look at her friend, only to be reminded of the other two reasons. Makoto\u2019s soft breasts that were pressed tightly against her. Any time she shifted even a little, she felt them squish or jiggle and her face blushed again just from how awkward it all was. She wasn\u2019t sure how much longer she could continue to stay like that, but what could she do to get Makoto to get off her, if even just a little?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No sooner than she had done it did she realize her mistake. When she jumped up, her bra slid out the bottom of her dress. It joined the popcorn kernels on the sticky theater floor. She froze up, stomach in knots, torn between what to do. It would be noticeable if she bent over and picked up her bra. What would the people around her think she had been doing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d Ann whispered from her seat.

She was surprised she hadn\u2019t found it yet. After all, it had to be somewhere around their seats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning back, sitting on her heels, her knees resting on the messy floor, Ann decided she may as well try her eyes again.

She turned her head away, even going as far as to close her eyes, so she didn\u2019t have to see whatever disgusting thing was in her hand. And then, her hand released, setting the garment free from its grasp and dropping it into the depths of the trashcan. With the weight gone, Ann cautioned a peek at her hand to check for any lingering trash. She happily found that with the exception of being sticky her hands weren\u2019t too gross. She still wanted to wash them as soon as possible, though. That would have to wait until she checked on how Makoto was doing, of course.

I'm feeling a bit peckish myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, then it's decided!\" Ann led the way, moving at a brisk pace. At least she had been, until she looked over her shoulder and saw her friend way behind her, arms crossed over her chest and looking all around her as she moved at a turtle's pace. Ann let out a sigh and returned to her friend. \"Uh, Makoto... what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer senior's face lit up. \"I-I don't want anyone to notice that I don't,\" she whispered then motioned toward her chest with her eyes. \"You know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn shook her head incredulously. \"You're just going to bring <i>more</i> attention to yourself walking around like that. It looks suspicious, like you're trying to hide something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I sort of am.\" Makoto looked around again before continuing. \"It's, uh, a tad cold out here... and I think it's... noticeable that I don't have one on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure it's not that bad,\" Ann said, waving her concerns off. \"Let me see.\" Makoto's uncertainty was plain to see, but the insistent look on her friend's face eventually made her cave in. After all, it wasn't like her friend would lie to her about something like this. So, slowly, Makoto forced her arms to her sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How bad is it?\" Makoto forced herself to ask, wincing a bit, a blush on her face. She couldn't believe she was asking that. Ann looked her over for a moment, not saying anything, just staring at her friend's chest. She would have to admit her friend had a point. There were two prominent nubs poking through the thin, white fabric of her dress. They were definitely noticeable if you were looking at her. She would just have to let Makoto know, and if that meant the end of their little movie date, then it was what it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn took a breath, trying to figure out the least embarrassing way to phrase it for her friend. As soon as Ann opened her mouth, though, her earrings started to glimmer subtly. \"See, I told you it wasn't bad at all.\" She said cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto was taken back, surprise and uncertainty written on her face. \"Are-are you sure about that? To me it looks-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, Makoto,\" Ann said. \"It's all in your head. You can't even tell, really. This is your first time not wearing a bra, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ann!\" Makoto gasped out, looking around in a hurriedly. \"Did you have to say that so loudly?\" Her face was a deep red tint. Thankfully no one seemed to be around to hear it. \"What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn giggled. \"Ooops, sorry... but don't worry about it. Tons of girls go out without one all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And those girls are usually <i>planning</i> to, though.\" Makoto said. \"I imagine they wear clothes more suited to it than I am right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn shook her head. \"I just told you what you're wearing is fine. You can't even tell. You're just being paranoid. That movie must have scared you more than I thought.\" Ann laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It did not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riiight,\" Ann said, locking her arm with her friend's. \"Well, you don't need to worry anymore, because I'm here for you. Now let's go get our snacks.\" Ann started at a brisk pace again, not even giving Makoto a chance to respond. She practically dragged her friend through the hallways of the theater and back toward the snack bar, ignoring all Makoto's requests to slow down. The pace made Makoto's modest bosom bounce slightly, and every part of her mind screamed out at her about how obvious it was that she didn't have a bra on. She forced those thoughts away, however. She trusted Ann, and she knew her friend wouldn't mislead her like that. So, if Ann said it wasn't noticeable, then that was that. It really must just be in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the pace they were going, it didn't take them long to make it back to the lobby where the snack bar was. They were both panting lightly, and Makoto was almost appreciative that the cold air conditioning was blasting even harder here than it had been in the hallways. Without wasting a second, Ann led her over to the concessions line and released her so they both could look for something they wanted.</span></div></div>",

She could practically read the cashier's thoughts screaming at her to hurry up. \"Uh, sorry,\" she mumbled, looking over the options again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay,\" the young man, who looked to be around her age, at the register said. He didn't sound very sincere. \"Take your time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were just so many choices... but there were people waiting behind her in line, too... She decided to just get something at random, whatever that sounded good. \"Um, an order of nachos and cheese? Can I get extra cheese on that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and a large popcorn! Lots of butter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all?\" He didn't even try to hide his annoyance anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn bit her lip then put some candy on the counter. If she was going to cheat, then she was going to make the most of it. \"Uh, this too. Sorry. That's everything.\" He gave her the total and swiftly began preparing her items. It only took a moment after she paid to be sent away with her goodies. With her arms full, Ann looked over for Makoto. It didn't take long to find her. She was staring intently into an ice cream cooler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you find anything yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto nearly jumped at the sudden question, her chest bouncing. \"Oh, it's just you, Ann. And, wow, you weren't kidding when you said you were hungry. Are you going to be able to finish all that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably not,\" Ann admitted. \"But I've got you here to help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, maybe,\" Makoto said. \"That still looks like a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, live a little,\" Ann laughed. \"A few snacks never hurt anyone. Anyways, what were you looking at in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They have Buchimaru character ice cream pops,\" Makoto said, a hint of excitement in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From that old kid's show? That's so cute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right? I think I'm going to buy one.\" Makoto's mood seemed to be returning, and that was enough to sell Ann on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You definitely should, and then we can take a picture with all our snacks to show the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto nodded, opening the cooler and grabbing a panda-shaped ice cream. \"I'll be right back,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, I'm going to go save us a bench,\" Ann said. She claimed the first open one she found. She sat the popcorn on her lap and the other snacks beside her. While she waited, she was sure to open the box of nachos, seeing the steam coming off them as soon as the lid came off. She set the lid to the side, letting them air out a bit. It wasn't a long wait for Makoto to come back. She had her Buchimaru ice cream in one hand and a large drink in the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oohh, smart! I totally forgot to buy a drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can share if you want,\" Makoto offered, when she got closer. \"It's just lemonade. The guy at the counter gave it to me for free. He was really nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn raised her eyebrow, wondering if Makoto was talking about the same guy that she had. As far as Ann had noticed, there was only one concessions guy working the register, and he hadn't seemed the type to give something away for nothing. It didn't matter, though. As long as Makoto was feeling better, then it was mission accomplished and she didn't care. \"Thanks! Now hurry up, slowpoke. We have a picture to take.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto laughed. \"All right, just give me a second.\"  She made it to the bench and went to take a seat, and that's when it happened.</span></div></div>",

Unknown to either girl their combined quivering was about to cause a problem. Between the girls\u2019 seats was a cheap, plastic armrest that happened to be holding Makoto\u2019s forgotten drink in its cupholder. When Makoto first leaned into Ann, she unintentionally started applying pressure onto the already weak armrest. And when Ann finally started to lean back into Makoto, she started applying pressure back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuick and quietly, a crack formed along the base of the armrest. With each quiver that pushed it back and forth ever so slightly, the crack grew. Soon enough, the only thing keeping the armrest upright was a small piece of plastic only as thick as a few sheets of paper. Meanwhile, the movie grew louder and louder as the monster chased a young woman into an isolated bathroom, preparing to carry out its unholy curse. Ann peaked at the scene, while Makoto kept her eyes firmly closed, trying to block everything out. Just as the monster\u2019s torment of the young woman reached its peak, right as she let out a bloodcurdling scream \u2013 the armrest snapped!

This would make a good cheat day, Ann thought, the idea communicated to her via the pair of earrings. Moreover, she decided to pick the most sugary, sticky, fizzy drink she could. The size of the drink was a little obnoxious in the normal fashion of movie theaters- more like a small bucket than a large drink. But who cares? Tonight was a night to splurge on treats and enjoy tormenting a friend!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment the armrest broke was the same instant both girls reacted to events on the screen (what Ann saw and what Makoto heard in the loud screaming). Both girls jumped violently at the scares. The motion caused both their legs to effectively smack into the armrest at the same moment, turning the broken piece of plastic into an effective catapult even while the restraint keeping it in place snapped. The drink flew straight up, tipping end over end, until the momentum ran its course and it began its journey back down to Earth. In the process the flimsy top burst open. A waterfall of soda came crashing down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls, again huddling close to each other in fright, were at the epicenter of an epic soaking, instantly drenching their clothes.</span></div></div>",

The drenched duo slipped out of the auditorium and made a beeline for the women's bathroom across the hall. They earned a few stares, being something of a spectacle dripping with soda like they were. The pair simply did their best to ignore it all as they stepped into the relative privacy of the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you have to get dark soda?\" Makoto said as she grimaced at the sight of herself in the mirror. \"This is going to stain! How do we even begin to clean this up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn, after a subtle sparkle of her earrings, quickly grabbed her shirt and pulled it over her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ann!\" Makoto exclaimed. \"What are you doing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said it yourself. It's going to stain if we don't do something, right?\" Ann explained as she tossed her shirt in the nearest sink. \"Our best bet is to rinse out everything that got hit and dry them off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ann.\" Makoto said, her voice exasperated. \"EVERYTHING got hit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we rinse everything.\" Ann shot back, though a blush still came to her cheeks. \"C'mon, Makoto, we're in the bathroom. It's the safest place we can be, and we can just hide in a stall if we think anybody's coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn continued to strip as she argued her case, her skirt, socks, bra, and even her panties all eventually joining her shirt in the sink. Makoto couldn't help but blush as her friend stood in front of her stark naked and apparently not bothered by Makoto seeing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Makoto.

Hesitantly, she slid her fingers under her dress\u2019s collar and pulled it off, feeling it peel from her skin. She felt her heart begin to race, clutching her formerly-white dress to her chest and looking around for a moment before setting it down in the sink next to Ann\u2019s. Next, she moved her hands shakily to hook into the hem of her leggings, slowly peeling them down her legs and depositing them with her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI \u2013 I think I\u2019m ready,\u201d Makoto said, looking to Ann. The blonde girl had her arms crossed, her foot still tapping impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to clean your underwear?\u201d Ann asked, incredulous. Makoto shook her head, a thick blush on her cheeks. \u201cBut look at them, Makoto! If you don\u2019t clean them now, they\u2019ll stain, and you won\u2019t be able to wear them again.\u201d Makoto caught her reflection in the mirror, inspecting the damage. Her white bra was currently a light brown, and the Buchimaru-themed panties she wore were now poor simulacrum of their former selves, the white parts now a light brown and semi-transparent, not providing her any real cover anymore. She bit her lip and frowned, those were her favorite pair, she didn\u2019t care how childish they may appear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you\u2019re right\u2026\u201d Makoto said, heart pounding in her ear, as she reached behind her back and unhooked her bra. Limply, it sat on her chest until she pulled it off, one arm at a time. As soon as the bra came off her skin, she shoved one of her arms over her breasts. The bra joined her other clothes in the sink as she stood there, trying to will her free hand to pull her panties down. It wouldn\u2019t move. Makoto was so focused on her panties, she didn\u2019t notice the unique glimmer that passed over Ann\u2019s earrings right before her friend suddenly hooked her fingers in her panties and tugged them down to her ankles in one swift motion. Instantly, a neon glow resonated from Makoto\u2019s face, her free hand darting between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-what are you doing?!\u201d Makoto found herself practically yell out, trying to position herself so her friend couldn\u2019t see her butt. She nearly tripped over her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were taking too long!\u201d Ann exclaimed. \u201cAt this rate, all our clothes are going to be stained. Now, come on, step out of those panties.\u201d She instructed, bending down and grabbing hold of her friend\u2019s panties. Slowly, Makoto pulled her feet out of the leg holes, nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-uh, sorry?\u201d Makoto said, watching Ann throw the panties into the sink with the rest of her clothes before turning on the sinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right, let\u2019s get to it.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ann sighed to herself as she paused in the midst of the crowded beach. Hoping not to draw any attention to herself, she carefully drew her fingers beneath the flower spotted bikini bottoms she wore and pulled the material free of the space between her butt cheeks it had conspired to hide within during her brief journey from the dressing room. There was a blush on her cheeks despite her attempts to play it off. Wasn't there little enough material for her to work with without it being transformed into a thong? Ann had bought the tiny swimsuit almost as a dare to herself. She knew she had a fabulous body, of course, but the exotic blonde hair and blue eyes from her mixed parentage made her self-conscious about flaunting it. Since day one it had made her something of an outcast, as people ether gawked at her or spread rumors about her. Yet the incident with Kamoshida was something she was determined to put behind her no matter what. If that involved getting used to wearing something as tiny if not smaller than the slutty cognition of herself Kamoshida had prancing around his Palace, then so be it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven so, she had no desire to increase the amount of skin now on display by any fraction! Alas the bikini seemed to have a difference of opinions on this subject! In addition to the bottoms riding up, the strings on the bikini top had a worrying habit of loosening and needing to be retied. Ann had to constantly be on her guard or her eye openingly large breasts and round bottom would be on display on top of her meticulously maintained slim stomach and long fit legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScanning the crowd Ann spied her fellow cohorts decked out in their own attire. Makoto wore a white bikini, more modest by the standards set by Ann but still clearly more exposure than she was used to judging by her reaction to the occasional once over she was getting. Futaba, of course, wore the bright orange on yellow tube top and bottom they had selected for her not so long ago. Both Ann and Makoto had resolved to wear similarly skimpy suits as a way to help her build confidence around crowds. The way she huddled close to Makoto and cringed at every look (which only made the salicious ones look longer and smirk) showed she still had a way to go. Which made Haru's choice of a green one piece with yellow trim along with a white straw hat to keep the sun off a rather galling inclusion. But neither she nor Makoto had thought to include the recent addition to the team in their pact of exposure in time, so here they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...where'd the guys run off to...?\" Ann asked as she joined fellow beach goers. On cue, Joker and Ryuji ran up to the girls. Ryuji especially looked terrified and immediately began cowering behind the group as they all exchanged puzzled glances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help...\" Ryuji begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked at Joker for an explanation, who simply sighed and gestured back the way they had come. Behind a pair of flamboyant and rather effeminate looking men dressed in heart patterned and rainbow colored swim-trunks ran up to the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm...\" Ann began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop right there! Those two lovelies hiding in your midst are under arrest! They are charged with interfering with an ongoing fashion investigation and being a pair of cuties in the first degree!\" The first man announced, the lisp all too expected and fitting with the rest of his sterotypical behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...sorry? Your...police officers?\" Makoto asked, totally bewildered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you idiot!\" Ryuji snapped. \"They aren't police. They're...monsters!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're from Shinjuku. They...umm...have a taste for men, and they are being particularly aggressive about it.\" Joker spoke up, glaring at the pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such defiance! Luckily, we know how to break our prisoners. I little interrogation will get you cooperating soon enough!\" The beefy trendsetter said with a toss of his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okkkkkkaaay. I don't exactly get what's going on or why Ryuji is flipping out about this so much..\" Ann said with a glance to her whimpering teammate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long story.\" Joker said, while Ryuji just mumbled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...but your obviously bothering our friends here, so why don't you back off?\" Ann finished, glaring at the pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me? We don't take orders from- eep!\" The scruffy romantic said as Ann stepped forward, her bouncing breasts inspiring a reaction something like a cross presented to a vampire. \"St-stay back, blondie! How dare you flaunt your shameless girly bits in my face like a uninhibited whore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse ME?\" Ann snapped, fury darkening her face. \"I-Its not like it was my idea to dress like this in the first place! Who the hell are you even-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy there, rookie.\" The older man interjected. \"It seems our suspects have sought refuge outside our jurisdiction. We need to withdraw for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-\" Ann and her gay counterpart protested, but the beefy trendsetter guided his companion away with remarkable speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not uninhibited! I-I mean I'm not a whore! Get back here and...and...\" Ann fell silent as the subject of her wrath disappeared around the corner. \"Okay, what the hell was that about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoker made a face and Ryuji refused to meet anyone's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear, you guys end up in the most bizarre side quests in this game when we're not around.\" Futaba finally interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no idea.\" Joker said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what? We're just giving up after that hussy flaunted herself right in front of me? Those poor boys getting manipulated by that seductress! No wonder they ran from us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your making a scene.\" Beefy reprimanded while fetching out a cell phone. \"And I never said we were giving up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long series of rings before a deep voice muttered from the other end. \"This better be good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heya, Sarge!\" Beefy intoned, again adopting his 'policeman' voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....I'm hanging up now...\" The voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on sweetie, hear me out!\" He begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Fine. So what kinky RP bullshit are you two doing now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rookie cop and hardboiled partner.\" Beefy said quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what, I'm supposed to be madame sergeant reminding you two to stop playing outside the rules? Not in the mood, boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I hear. Another Rosie induced hangover, dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you. And yeah, not that's its any of your business, but sake has been a pretty damn good friend since she left. So have fun whatever it is you are doing. Just leave me-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie, sweetie, sweetie. You think I'm that insensitive? I just happened on the perfect little game for us to play! Get you out off to the beach. Sand, surf, fun! Have a girls night out! Get up to some naughty trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of naughty trouble, exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want my report after all, Sarge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god. Fine. Yeah, rookie! Let's hear it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we were pursuing these two suspects. Had them dead to rights. Penalty....stripping!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two are awful, you know that? Not that I have any room to complain. So what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were ambushed outside of our jurisdiction by four new suspects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By jurisdiction you mean-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They had girly bits, yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh. You got a sketch of these perps?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh of course.\" Beefy sent the photos he had casually snapped of the girls while the blonde and his partner were arguing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....Okay. Okay, yeah. I'm in. Holy crap am I in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought so. Its pretty straight forward, Sargie. We need some backup to keep these hussies off our tail while we secure our prize. You up for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four teenager goddesses to strip and tease? Is that even a question, rookie? Too many for me to handle, though. Probably gonna need a taskforce on this one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meaning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meaning we're gonna flood the beach with every frisky lesbian we can find from Shinjuku. Those girls won't know what hit them. Go around cock blocking my poor man-gays? Not on my watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere along the line while the rest of the world was moving beyond the flamboyant gay sterotype the community at Shinjuku decided to double down. In this, the lesbian community was in fact the most shameless. As incredible as Beefy and Romantic might appear, they were nothing compared to the flirty, teasing legions of lesbians hiding in the seedy parts of Tokyo's district. And the female members of the phantom thieves were about to get to know the entire community very, very well.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As far as the Phantom Thieves knew, Ann had solved the problem when she scared the two men off. While the blonde had felt a little bad for Akira and Ryuji and whatever those two had been through to put them so on-edge, she wasn't about to let that get in the way of her fun! Neither were the other girls, for that matter, as the four of them went on to enjoy a ride on a banana boat Makoto had set up a rental for. Even the normally skittish Futaba let loose and had fun with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should really go to the beach more often.\" Ann commented as she and the rest of the girls crossed the hot sands of the beach to the changing and showering stalls set up for visitors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree! These group outings are great fun!\" Haru said, nodding. \"I feel like we grew a bit closer as a team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFutaba grumbled as she tried to wordlessly get the group to pick up the pace. \"If there's a next time, I'm picking out a new suit. One with pants. And sleeves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFutaba's comment drew an exasperated sigh and shake of the head from Makoto. \"That's the exact opposite of the point, Futaba. Besides, you had fun, didn't you?\" she argued, earning a reluctant nod from the hacker. \"I just hope the guys had a good enough time. I wonder if Yusuke bought lobsters again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foursome continued their idle chitchat the rest of the way to the stalls, unaware that they were being watched. Scattered throughout the crowds on the beach were countless women from Shinjuku, drawn by a mass picture message sent out to them with a simple caption: \"Time to have fun.\" A plan had quickly been put together, and now the four young beauties were walking directly into the spider's web.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn sighed as she stepped into the shower stall. The ocean was fun and all, but the sooner she could wash the salt water off of herself the happier she'd be. Unwrapping the towel she'd put on for modesty, Ann felt around for the hook on the other side of the stall door and set the towel there to wait. Turning back to the shower head, she bent over and turned the faucet controls to be rewarded with a stream of cleansing water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the-?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-excuse me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe startled cries from Futaba, Makoto, and Haru clued Ann in to something being wrong moments before the door to her own shower stall flew open. A tall woman with a stylish pixie cut walked right in to the stall without a care in the world, or a stitch on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! This stall is occupied\"! Ann cried out as she scrambled to cover her naked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman waved Ann's complaint off with blatant disregard for the girl's discomfort. \"Oh, what's wrong, darling? All the stalls are in use, and it's not like either of us have anything we haven't seen before. Can't two girls share a quick shower?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not the point! You can't just barge in and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise I'll behave! It'll be hard with that beautiful body of yours, but I can be a good girl~!\" the woman continued, bowling right over Ann's protests. \"Really, dear. Just relax and go with the flow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn knew she was in a predicament. The woman was blocking her way out of the stall, and something about her words and attitude told her that things weren't as innocent as they seemed. But... maybe she was just being paranoid? The beach was definitely crowded, and it wasn't like there were an abundance of shower stalls. Would it really be so bad to just get this over with?</span></div></div>",

But the sounds of alarm coming from the other stalls indicated something similar was happening to her teammates. Something was definitely wrong here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn paused, squared her shoulders, and moved towards the woman. To her relief, the woman made no move to keep her from passing. With determination, Ann marched to the curtained door and reached up to obtain her towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd found nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn blinked, her hand feeling around blindly for the cloth she had hung just outside the stall a moment ago. All she felt was the wall and the hook. Where was the darn thing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer unspoken question was answered a moment later with a sudden stinging sensation on her left buttcheek. With a yelp, Ann spun around. The woman stood there was an enormous grin on her face, Ann's missing towel being wound up in her hands. The bitch had stolen the towel then used it like a whip to smack Ann's butt! Ann blushed in embarrassment and rage as the woman flaunted her sole means of modesty in front of her like a bull fighter with a cape. Clearly she was inviting Ann to take the towel if she could. </span></div></div>",

One particular helper that liked to go by the name Nymph after her time as an Olympic swimmer (as well as other aspects of her personality) had been quick to propose a plan, one that was straightforward and utilized her particular talents perfectly. Now, if only something could be done about the name she insisted on calling it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Operation: Muff Diver is ready to go!\" Nypmh's message in the group chat being used to coordinate the team read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never call it that again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?

She borderline flew beneath the waves as she searched for her prey, though she also took the time to appreciate other sets of lovely legs she passed in her search.

She was going to relieve all of these girls of their suits in due time, but her first attack was crucial. She had to throw them off balance without making a scene above water. The redhead looked like the jumpy type, so she was out. The brunette seemed the most leader-like of the team, so she was probably the smartest one to make uncomfortable right out of the gate, and she'd be smart enough not to draw attention to her predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, Nymph reconsidered as she looked at the floral-print bikini bottoms before her. She was quite curious to know if blonde was that girl's natural color...</span></div></div>",

A simple and graceful flick of her wrists pulled the knots loose and hid the movement in the current of the waves. The unaware girl's bottoms swayed and slipped as they came loose, and her pink treasure was soon on full display as the cloth floated away. Nymph was quick to grab the free bottoms, shoving them down into her own for safe keeping as a trophy for her wall back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as she wanted to stay and admire the blonde's neatly groomed pubic hair and pink slit, she knew she had to put some distance between herself and her quarry before they realized what was wrong.

Worried that her bottoms had ridden up again and exposed parts of her skin that she didn't want shown off, she quietly slipped a hand under the waves and felt around her hips. When she felt nothing but her own smooth skin her heart skipped a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck...\" she whispered. \"Uh, Makoto? I think I've got a problem.\" she whispered to her friend, not wanting to draw too much attention to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up, Ann?\" Makoto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, uh... my bottoms are gone.\" Ann whispered. \"Can you... uh... go back to shore and get me a towel or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto's cheeks went pink at Ann's statement. \"U-uhm, of course! Just give me a minute!\" she said. \"Hey guys, I, er, forgot something back on shore, be back in a minute!\" she told the others before turning and starting to head for the shore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNymph was close enough to eavesdrop on the whole exchange with glee.

As a sleeper being jarred awake, Joker once more found himself abandoning his recollections an slipping back into the cold, hard reality of his present. His throat was dry and heavy from speaking so long. The countless cuts and bruises from his interrogations and beatings counted to throb in protest. He was aware of a growing, aching pain in the back of his head like every caffeine addicted headache he developed when skipping his morning coffee at Leblanc over the past year was now coming back to haunt him at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, painfully he raised his eyes back up to the intense stare of Sae Niijima. She sat across from him in dark, bleak chamber that they shared.

This wasn't the vicious, judgmental stare she had first confronted him with, nor the bewildered and awe filled look she occasionally assumed when the details of his account clicked into place despite the sheer absurdity of his statements, nor even the ever so brief yet increasingly frequent sparks of genuine camaraderie she displayed before snuffing it out (despite her every effort, she was growing increasingly FOND of the bastard). This was...pensive, unsure, as if for the first time she was actually hesitant to ask her questions despite the time limit that was dogging them throughout the process.

And as strange as your story has been so far, this incident still stands out to me.\" She withdrew another picture from her briefcase and slid it across the table to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoker's eyes widened in disbelief as he began to remember. He felt his own face flushing to match his interrogator's as the events began to play out in his mind. He covered his mouth to hide the noise which threatened to escape from his throat, a combination of a laugh, a groan, and a small sigh of glee. The glare shot at him from the stern woman across the table helped kill the noise shortly after it began. The photo showed a familiar young woman, face contorted in a cry of dismay and terror, her body completely naked and poorly hidden behind her hands. Small black bars blotted out her exposed anatomy and hid her eyes from view, but Joker of course immediately knew her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makoto Niijima. We both already know my connection to her. You claim she joined your team, and used her intelligence to plan your crimes, acting as a kind of chief strategist, to make no mention of informing you of my actions. But something went very wrong in this incident. We don't even know if it was related to Phantom Thief business. How did it come to pass that she lost her clothes...and suffered through such a strange series of incidents? Tell me everything. And keep in mind that if you had a hand in this and try to hide that from me... it won't end well for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoker cleared his throat, his mind still fuzzy from the drugs and trying to decide whether he felt more mortified or ecstatic about what his friend had gone through. Finally, he spoke, his voice cracking slightly. \"This is how it began...\"</span></div></div>",

Whether that was her own personal drive or the expectations placed on her by her somewhat overbearing sister was hard to say. If she had to guess, it was probably at least a bit of both. Her dedication to success had paid off immensely, as her academic prowess was recognized and regarded throughout the school, and she had secured the Student Council presidency despite not exactly having the love or social standing of many of her peers. No, Makoto had earned everything she had through sheer aptitude and determination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, all it had taken was a group of outcasts to throw off her focus, even if only a little. Becoming one of the Phantom Thieves was something Makoto never would have imagined happening to her, but it had proven to be one of the most significant moments of her life. Awakening to her inner rebel, embracing Johanna and rejecting corrupt authority had practically turned Makoto into a new woman. She still took school seriously, of course, but it no longer dominated her every waking moment. She was learning to enjoy other aspects of life and the joys of having a group of friends. She hadn't known the rest of the Phantom Thieves for very long in the grand scheme of things, but it wasn't an exaggeration to say Makoto would go above and beyond for any of them. They deserved that much for helping her wake up to the world around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the path of thought Makoto's mind had wandered off to while her teacher began to ramble off topic and drone on about nothing of particular academic importance. She was only snapped out of her daydreaming by the chime of the school's intercom activating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-will Makoto Niijima please, ah... please report to the Student Council room. Immediately. Th-thank you.\" the voice said, quickly cutting off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto raised an eyebrow, though she rose from her seat all the same. Her teacher simply nodded in consent as Makoto slipped out of the classroom and into the hallway. Something about that request seemed... wrong. The person speaking was clearly nervous for some reason, and she was sure she recognized the voice. The distortion of the intercom system meant it wasn't perfectly clear who was speaking, but it still sounded familiar enough to make Makoto curious. Makoto pushed these thoughts aside with a light sigh. The question would be answered soon enough, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding the door open, Makoto stepped into the Student Council room to find herself facing-</span></div></div>",

She didn\u2019t know what to do\u2026 She couldn\u2019t just leave her friends like this, but what about herself? If she went with the first option, she\u2019d be stuck half-naked until she got something to cover up with. It would be embarrassing and risky. Someone could see her if she wasn\u2019t careful, though she supposed her friends had already been dealing with that problem themselves, seeing as they had one article of clothing between the two of them. If she went with the second option, she would be completely covered still, but she\u2019d have to go through the rest of the day without her underwear, and she didn\u2019t know if she could handle that\u2026 She would have to be extra-vigilant all day long, and if someone found out\u2026 She shook the thought out of her head, it was best not to think about it. Alternatively, she could tell them she didn\u2019t want to give up her clothes and insist they let her find something for them to wear instead. It didn\u2019t seem unreasonable to her, despite how unwilling Ann was to consider it. Maybe Ann would be more accepting of the idea if Makoto put her foot down and told them it was either that or nothing? She didn\u2019t know if she could do that to her friends\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Makoto,\u201d Ann said, impatiently. \u201cHave you decided yet?\u201d Makoto bit lightly on her lip. <i>What am I going to do?</i> She wondered.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With a single deft movement, Makoto grabbed the zipper on the front of the sweater and yanked downward. In a single stroke the front of the garment popped open, and Makoto followed through by maintaining her hold on the zipper and yanking her arm to the side. Almost like a stage magician dramatically revealing a trick to her audience, Makoto unveiled the naked bodies of her friends and teammates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what are doing?? Give it back!\" Ann wailed, although in that moment she and Haru were more concerned with covering their suddenly visually accessible bodies than reclaiming the sweater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its true....\" Makoto said in disbelief. \"You both...were just roaming the halls...without any clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn blushed. Makoto didn't sound at all sympathetic to her plight! Instead she was giving them a pinched, put upon expression that screams 'why am I in the situation, having to deal with this nonsense'. Her voice was also carrying that put upon overtone of disapproval and resigned self-pity she saved for troublesome students and when her fellow phantom thieves were doing something particularly boneheaded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its not like we wanted this!\" Ann snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then explain it.\" Makoto responded in that half-way tone between actual outrage and whining about the mess she was having to clean up. \"Your both breaking more school rules and laws of indecency than I could even list. I don't...just EXPLAIN why your wandering through your school in the middle of the day when your completely naked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way she said the word naked, with a strained emphasis that the course was not merely a dumb decision, but was perhaps the dumbest possible of all decisions, made Ann grind her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop asking questions and get us some clothes! Your a phantom thief, and we need your help!\" Ann said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its because we're phantom thieves that I didn't immediately call the principle in here! Explain this, and do it now! If there's somehow a reasonable explanation for why you are exposing yourselves like deranged perverts I'll listen. But if I'm not satisfied, I will have to punish you both. My loyalty to the Phantom Thieves doesn't mean I can just ignore behavior like this! This school has been on edge ever since Kamoshida. An incident of public indecency? Both of you could be expelled or worse! And I could get in trouble for not preventing this kind of degeneracy! As your student president, I have a duty to uphold school rules AND protect students. Before I decide whether to assist you or report you to the school I need all the facts. Tell me how you....how you managed to be in this...absurd situation.\" Makoto sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn was feeling mortified and angry. The disdain and contempt was now plain in Makoto's voice. Her attitude was approaching the \"so much smarter than you\" Makoto that had so infuriated Ann when the president first confronted them with her knowledge of their double lives. </span></div></div>",

I thought I still had them with me, but I was wrong. I\u2019m so sorry\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you were to ask most students at Shujin how they thought their president would take this news, they would recommend that the messenger run for the hills because it would not end well. Those students would be wrong. Instead, Makoto cast him a soft gaze, took in his tear-stained face, and sighed, giving him a pat on the back. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said, trying to offer him a small, reassuring smile. She saw no point in giving him a hard time about it, especially not when he was clearly already giving himself one. \u201cI\u2019ll find them, don\u2019t worry.\u201d Despite saying that, she couldn\u2019t help but wonder whose idea it was not to back up the documents in the event something like this happened that got them into this mess in the first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll find them in no time,\u201d Makoto said, giving a thumb up and an earnest smile. Or so she hoped, at least. The festival was only a few weeks away, and they couldn\u2019t afford to spend the time to remake the budgets and plans. They were pushing the deadline as it was, and if they didn\u2019t meet it there wouldn\u2019t be a festival. Makoto refused to let that happen. Finding those documents were now her top priority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But what exactly was she going to do? The school day was only about halfway over, but she could start searching now. After all, the longer they\u2019re missing the more likely something could happen to them. It wasn\u2019t like she couldn\u2019t afford to miss a few classes, and her absence would be excused since it was official student council business. Alternatively, she could search the school after hours when there were less students around, but then there was the risk that someone might pick up or throw away the documents.<br>\r\n</i></span></div></div>",

She could simply try to play it off as a case of her being momentarily unobservant when she headed to the girls\u2019 bathroom. \u201cNow that I\u2019ve settled that, I just have to go to the\u2026\u201d Makoto fell silent as the gears turned in her head and her eyebrows furrowed some. And she soon came to a realization. \u201cI forgot to ask which bathroom he used\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto quickly slid open the Student Council Room\u2019s door, hoping that her fellow Council member did not get too far away yet. But, when she cast her gaze up and down the hallway, he was nowhere to be seen. A small sigh escaped her lips. This made things a bit more difficult. Instead of only having to check one bathroom, now she needed to check them all. It was a rookie mistake \u2013 she should have known better. Internally, she kicked herself some. Absent-mindedly, her thoughts drifted to how her sister Sae would have handled the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto knew her sister would not have been as sympathetic, if at all, to the Council member as she had been. There were many words to describe Sae, serious and strict being the most opportune. But sympathetic did not seem to be one of them in recent years. Her sister always desired for and strove toward success. She did not take mistakes lightly. She also never seemed to make them. She would have remembered to ask the Council member which bathroom he used before dismissing him\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head to clear the thoughts away, Makoto knew she did not have time to waste getting caught up on something like that. No, she was on a mission! And she knew just where she would start. Makoto walked swiftly down the hallway and turned left, walking past classrooms until her feet finally led her to the entryway of the bathrooms. On her left was the girls\u2019 bathroom, and on her right the boys\u2019. Neither had a door. Instead, the entryways each wrapped around white-tiled walls so that no one could see in from outside. It assured that whoever was inside received at least some measure of privacy, which was something Makoto ordinarily approved of and supported. However, today, as she stood there listening closely, trying to identify if anyone was inside, she could not help but to consider the feature to be a nuisance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto stood outside the bathrooms listening closely for any noise coming from within while she also kept a watchful eye down the hallway, making sure there was no one there to catch her in what she was about to do. She didn\u2019t see anyone. Nor did she hear anyone inside the bathroom either. It seemed like the perfect chance to investigate, yet she found herself hesitating, her feet not yet willing to let her break the taboo. She breathed a deep breath and forced herself forward, bracing herself for whatever was about to come. Makoto was well-aware of the stereotype that boys\u2019 bathrooms were often filthy, but she hoped it was wrong. As she rounded the porcelain tiled wall, she was greeted with the sight of a shiny white room with three black-walled stalls and three urinals up against the left wall. On the right side were three sinks on a black counter-top connected to a mirror that reached the ceiling and spanned the length of the counter-top. She released a relieved breath, \u201cI knew they couldn\u2019t be as messy as they say.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon first inspection, Makoto did not see anything lying around in the bathroom, so her next course of action was to check the stalls. Much like the rest of the place, each stall she checked seemed to be clean. In fact, they were too clean. Everything was pristine, without a spot of mess to be seen. \u201cMaybe the janitor came through here recently?\u201d She said, standing in the middle of the room, looking at the sinks. There wasn\u2019t even so much as a drop of water on the counter. \u201cIf they did, I imagine that they would turn in anything they found\u2026\u201d Makoto stood there, her mind at work, for a moment. Honestly, she would admit that she wished the documents would have been in the first place she checked. Then, she could have the relief of knowing where they were and been able to return to class, but it seemed her journey had to continue.</span></div></div>",

She plans to go floor by floor \u2013 it is the most efficient method, after all, and if everything goes as planned it would have her finish her search on the Practice Building\u2019s first floor, just one floor below the entrance to the gymnasium. With that in mind, she takes a right turn when the hallways intersect, marches past the Student Council room and approaches the glass door to the floor\u2019s skyway. She tugs on the handle and glides through the doorway. She does not spare a moment to look out through the skyway\u2019s glass wall, instead she pushes forward, stopping where the hallways meet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto scans the hallway for anyone else who might be out and about. The Practice building\u2019s hallway is long, but it mirrors the Classroom building\u2019s. When she spies no one, she is thankful. With any luck, she could be done with this and back to class before she knows it. Makoto steps out into the hallway and marches toward the bathrooms. Once again, she keeps her eyes trained down the hall, making sure all is clear, while keeping an ear out for any noise in the bathroom. This time, she does not wait nearly as long before she heads inside, knowing she there is nothing to worry about \u2013 she already knows what to expect from the last one. Or so she thinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Makoto rounds the privacy wall, she realizes that might not be the case. Unlike the last bathroom, this one is rather messy and has a hint of a foul odor about it. She finds it to be a closer fit to the stereotype than the last one. Wadded paper-towel balls lay all around the garbage can, some are just strewn about the floor in front of the sink, as if they didn\u2019t even try to get it in the can. Under one of the urinals, Makoto sees a small puddle that she is going to pretend is just water and a light trail leading from one of the stalls. Part of her is thankful she didn\u2019t come in here to find the festival paperwork soaking in that puddle. Just the thought gets her stomach churning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is when Makoto moves on to the stalls that she seems to find the source of the odor assaulting her nose. There is an \u201cout of order\u201d sign on the first stall\u2019s door, and the closer she gets to it the more she feels the need to cover her nose. Against her better judgment, she pushes the door open and immediately wishes she didn\u2019t. Calling the sight before her grotesque would be an understatement. The water in the bowl is a putrid, unholy color, resting at level with the seat, even flowing onto it at some points. A small pool of water surrounds the toilet, but it doesn\u2019t look much better. The only bright side is that it appeared someone, probably one of the custodians, turned off the motion sensor so it didn\u2019t start flowing again when she opened the door. Makoto gives the stall the fastest once over in history before shutting the door and checking the other stalls, which thankfully are pristine in comparison to the first. When she does not see anything here that should not be, Makoto makes her way over to the entrance. She eyes the paper-towel balls on the ground on the way back, and, against her baser desires to get out of there as soon as possible, she stops. Soon she finds herself picking up all the paper-towel balls and throwing them into the garbage can, figuring the custodian already has enough to deal with in here without adding them to the list. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second the last ball is picked up, Makoto goes to make her leave.

She makes her way to the privacy wall\u2019s corner, when the sound of two boys talking reaches her ears. She couldn\u2019t quite make out what they were saying, but it was definitely getting louder. They were getting closer and closer, and if she didn\u2019t act fast, they would catch her. She wasn\u2019t about to let that happen. Reacting on instinct, Makoto darts to the one place in the bathroom she knows no one would dare go, the out-of-order stall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto pushes the door open and rushes inside, latching it shut behind her as she does her best to ignore the assault on her senses. She hesitates for a moment, staring the not-so-porcelain throne down. She really does not want to do what she is about to, but she knows she does not have a choice if she does not want to be caught. So, just as she has seen hundreds of times in action movies, her guilty pleasure, Makoto climbs up onto the toilet to hide herself from view. She is careful, going one foot at a time with her hand pressed against the wall to help her balance. She dislikes the faint squish and splash she hears when the bottom of her shoes makes contact with the puddle on the seat. She does her best to pretend it is just water. Once she is stable on the seat, she starts the process of turning around to face the door, all while making sure she kept hunched low enough that no one could see her over the stall wall\u2019s. No sooner than she turns around do the boys enter the bathroom, chatting away. The sound of the two boys relieving themselves joins the others in the bathroom, and despite not being able to see anything a light blush dusts Makoto\u2019s face and she turns to look away from the sound, hoping they won\u2019t take long. The longer it takes for them to finish, the more compelling it becomes for Makoto to seat herself on the metal bars that made up the toilet\u2019s water tank. When they finish but continue to stand there talking, she does take a seat, careful not to hit the toilet handle. She listens closely to them for any indication they were leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat reminds me, man, you\u2019ll never believe what Shinji says he did.\u201d Makoto hears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019d he do?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe says he put a couple cameras in the girls\u2019 locker room,\u201d the boy says, voice bursting with excitement. He immediately receives her full attention, her eyes focusing so hard on the door that it was amazing a hole hadn\u2019t burned through it yet. \u201cHe says he snuck into the school last night and put them in there. He says he\u2019s going to check them tonight to see who he got.\u201d <i>How dare he</i>, Makoto shook her head, anger rising up in her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, man, is that true?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho knows. I wouldn\u2019t put it past him, he is a skinny, little creep, after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think he\u2019ll share the goods?\u201d <i>Absolutely not,</i> Makoto thinks, trying to maintain her composure. If the cameras are real, she won\u2019t let anyone see what or who is on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Shinji, dude. For the right price, he\u2019ll do anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue,\u201d the other boy says. \u201cWho would you pay Shinji to see?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou kidding? The President, of course.\u201d The boy says, making her shudder.<i> I'll ever let that happen</i>, Makoto thinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou serious? She\u2019s so snooty, like she thinks she\u2019s better than the rest of us.\u201d<i> I don\u2019t think that\u2026 Is that how everyone thinks of me?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what would make it all the better, man. Seeing a girl like that all vulnerable in the locker room, not knowing she\u2019s being captured on camera, it\u2019d be great!\u201d the boy declares. \u201cAfter all, whenever she acts uppity towards you after, you can just smile and think about how you\u2019ve seen her undressed. What about you, who\u2019d you want to see?\u201d A blush spreads across Makoto\u2019s cheeks at the very thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, dude, you put a lot of thought into this,\u201d his friend says approvingly. \u201cI\u2019m just hoping he gets some pics of Kamoshida\u2019s bitch, y\u2019know?\u201d For a moment, Makoto sees red. She shakes where she sits in barely-contained anger, doing breathing exercises to keep her composure. She wants to tell the boy off so bad, but before she does anything too rash, she reminds herself about where she is. She couldn\u2019t risk them finding her, so she begrudgingly lets the comment slide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot cool, man, not cool.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, you\u2019re right, my bad,\u201d he says with a laugh. \u201cBut you can\u2019t really blame me, the girl\u2019s a total hottie and a model.\u201d Makoto\u2019s disdain for the boy grows as she begins to wonder just how much longer she is going to have to listen to them gossip.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I don\u2019t want another detention.\u201d The other one sighs as well, \u201cI probably should, too. But, man, class is so boring.\u201d \u201cYeah, but detention is even worse, bro. See ya later, all right? Oh, and bring some money to school tomorrow, so we can buy some of those pics off Shinji.\u201d \u201cYou know it!\u201d The boy laughs. Makoto waits another minute, listening for any sounds that anyone was still out there. She hears nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, Makoto starts to stand up, the toilet seat shaking and sliding with each little movement. She uses the walls to steady herself. Once she is steady, she stops and listens again. Like before, she hears nothing, but her nerves are on edge.<i> I should see if they\u2019re actually gone first,</i> she thinks, eyes glancing to the top of the partition. Despite standing on the toilet seat, she still isn\u2019t quite tall enough to see over it. The only way she would be able to see over the partition is on her tiptoes. She bites her lip. She presses her left hand firmly against the wall to keep her steady as she rises to her tiptoes, the seat moving even more than before. But even on her tiptoes, she still can\u2019t quite see over the partition. The rest of the bathroom lies just out of sight. Determined, Makoto grips the top of the partition with her right hand and tries to pull herself up. More of the bathroom slips into sight, but not enough. She stops pulling, setting herself gently back on the seat. This time, she knows what to do. She turns toward that side of the partition, bringing her left foot onto the same side of the seat as her right. The whole seat slides over, the outer part of the right-side hovers over the floor, and the seat tilts that way. Again, she rises to her tiptoes. This time, both of her hands grip the top of the partition and pulls herself up. Her toes barely touch the seat below her as the rest of the bathroom finally comes into view.</span></div></div>",

Her foot moves forward, ready to take its first step back into the hallway, but, before it even got the chance to set down, the still silence of the hallway was shattered like glass by-</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was early in the morning on the weekend. Makoto was of course studiously up and about with the early morning, the thought never entering her mind that she could simply sleep away the early hours like the rest of her team was doing. She was wearing her more casual clothes, a white button down dress over leggings and a pair of sandals. Sae, for better or worse was sleeping off another late night. Makoto was just finish up her chores when her phone rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" She said, slightly out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makoto Niijima?\" Came an unfamiliar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Makoto asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's make this brief. Go out your front door, turn left. Under a telephone pole at the closest intersection you'll find a box with a phone in it. Little old fashioned, but I trust you'll figure it out. Leave your normal phone and your keys behind. Make sure to turn the lock in the doornob of your front door. When you leave you won't be able to get back in the house. Remember that. Ignore my instructions and it won't end well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who...what is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time's up. We'll talk more on the other phone. For now let's just say I'm here to collect a debt. One involving you pawing around a dive bar underaged. Don't expect me to text you the pic, don't want it ending up on your normal phone. But I trust you remember it well enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...your...but those pictures-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Talk to you soon.\" The voice hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto stared at her phone. The old trouble with the blackmail should have been well and truly ended with Kaneshiro's arrest. How did anyone still have those pictures? What did they want? For a moment she considered calling Sae or the Phantom Thieves. However, she realized immediately that this would be an obvious move. Her caller most likely had a way to monitor her phone. Any deviation from her instructions or any hesitation would likely get the photos sent out to everyone she knew. With butterflies in her stomach Makoto realized she could not risk defying her caller. Not until she had time to think of a plan, which her new blackmailer very obviously did not want to give her. Tossing her keys and phone aside, Makoto left her house, locking her door behind her as instructed. She was nervous about being outside with no way back in and probably being watch but what else could she do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found the intersection and the phone without any trouble. As expected, the device immediately started ringing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello again, Miss Nijima. Thank you for being punctual. That's a good sign we can get on with business and not make this any more painful than it has to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I..I don't know how you found Kaneshiro's-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's not bring up that name. He's dead to us.He only matters now because of the mess he's left people like me to clean up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought the pictures were destroyed.\" Makoto whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He tried. Unfortunately, our mutual \"friend\" is not as tech savvy as he thought. It took some effort, but we have been able to recover most of his sordid little network.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look...I...I don't have a way to pay back 3 million yen. This is a waste of time. Its impossible.\" Makoto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Rest assured, Miss Nijima, we are far more reasonable than our former associate. We aren't asking for money. Kaneshiro typically asked for the impossible from his victims. Frankly, the full extent of his enterprises went well beyond what many of us consider to be respectable. Frankly, I'd rather just forget the matter entirely. But that isn't my call to make. The men in charge don't like debts to just be forgiven, no harm or penalty. So I'm in the awkward position of finding a compromise between exposing your secrets and collecting an absurd debt. Obviously I don't expect you to trust me, Miss Nijima-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just...say Makoto. Miss Nijima sounds too much like my sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough, Makoto. I'm going to be candid with you. My job is to make your life a living hell for a very short period of time. This whole Kaneshiro betrayal puts us all in a very awkward position. We have to get our fingers out of certain places in this city very, very quickly and not draw too much attention or blood in the process. But honor and good business mean we can't just let you and other debtors be either. So I have a bit of a tight wire to walk here, Makoto. Personally, I think Kaneshiro was scum and I loathe the way he did business. But I don't have the luxury to be kinder or gentler about this. And your particularly problematic cause of the way you blundered into his business trying to play hero in the clumsiest way possible. I need your debt collected in a way that's quick and awful enough to warn others not to mess with our business, but done without money changing hands or blood being spilled. Not an easy job, let me tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't expect me to feel sorry for you, I hope?\" Makoto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all, Miss Makoto. Not at all. I'm expecting the opposite from you before this is all over. But for what its worth, its not something I do out of malice. Hell, if the people I work with allowed for such things I'd pass it on in a heartbeat. But they don't. Its my job to make you regret ever hearing the name Kaneshiro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way ahead of you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Miss Makoto. Not good enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh. I get it. Can we...just get on with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Miss Makoto. The bosses say I have a habit of rambling. That's why they call me Mr. Words. Say I talk everybody to death. Which has only actually happened once or twice, and mostly because of the bloodloss, not the conversation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto decided not to touch that comment with a ten foot pole. Instead, she cleared her throat. \"What do you want me to do, Mr. Words?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing major, honey. Don't worry. Very simple, very straight forward...\"</span></div></div>",

How would you even know if I followed through?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, it's the first step, honey. As for how I'll know, well, the spot was picked so it could be watched. That way I'll know you're actually doing what I tell you to do. Now go ahead and get to it, Miss Makoto. I'll call you back once you've done the deed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe call abruptly ended and left Makoto alone with her thoughts about what she'd just been told to do. It just seemed so bizarre to her, such an odd request from a group of hardened criminals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absurd or not, I guess I should consider myself lucky.\" Makoto told herself as she started walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip to the dumpster was uneventful as people paid little heed to the girl making her way down the street. Everyone was too absorbed in the routine of their own lives to cast a second glance her way, and Makoto was more than fine with that after the emotional roller coaster she'd already been on this morning. After walking two blocks and looking around, Makoto quickly spotted the dumpster in question, tucked away in a dirty alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto stepped into the narrow pathway and made her way toward her ordered destination. Her nose wrinkled in disgust as she came close to the dumpster in question, its rotten contents less than pleasant to be around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath (through her mouth rather than her nose), Makoto took a quick look around. She didn't see anybody, yet Mr. Words had said the spot was being watched. Either it had been a bluff or the observers were stealthier than the girl had given them credit for. Regardless, she reached up under the hem of her white dress and gripped the hem of her leggings. Sliding them down her legs in one smooth motion, Makoto was quietly a bit worried about the length of her dress. It was plenty long to cover everything, but she normally never had to worry about it with her leggings around as a second layer of protection. But if this is what it took to finally shake her debt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief struggle with getting the leggings around her shoes, Makoto finally pulled the garment free of her body. Bundling them up in one hand and using the other to lift the lid of the dumpster, she quickly threw the leggings in and let the lid fall shut. A waste of a good piece of clothing, but one she'd just have to live with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone Makoto had been given began to ring almost as soon as the dumpster slammed shut. She quickly answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad to see you can follow orders, Miss Makoto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't a hard order to follow, Mr. Words. A bit strange, but not hard.\" Makoto replied a bit sharply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, it always starts off easy. Now, Miss Makoto, if you'd be so kind as to tell me if you're wearing panties?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-WHAT?!\" Makoto shouted back. \"Why in the world would I tell you that?! What kind of perverted question even IS that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just answer the question, honey. Or I could always send out those pictures. Really, it's as simple as pushing a but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto sighed. \"Yes. Of course I am. Happy?\" Makoto answered as she felt heat rising in her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. Now was that so hard? With that in mind, you'll want to know your next task.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many of these 'tasks' of yours am I going to have to do, anyway?\" Makoto interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of your business. Well, I guess technically it is, but I'm not answering. You're not really in a position to demand answers, you know. Now, as I was saying, the nest thing you're going to have to do...\"</span></div></div>",

I was robbed and forced to take off everything! Or I did it for the sake of a student. Or as part of a hazing at school.\" Makoto paused. \"But that's not-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about the police? What would they do?\" Words persisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most likely, charge a minor fine. Possibly make me spend a day in jail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will it affect your career? Will you be expelled? Will it be on your criminal record?\" Words hammered home his point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Makoto whispered, utterly appalled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about if those pics get sent around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....I would probably be suspended. Maybe kicked out of school. I wouldn't be able to take my college entrance exams, and it would likely prevent me from entering a good school. It would be on my record and would impact what jobs I could find in the future.\" Makoto whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAUTHOR'S NOTE: If anyone cares, I totally made everything you just read up for the sake of the story. Any relation to actual Japanese law and how severely minors being caught in a barroom vs public indecency is in that country are purely coincidental. Usually I like to be accurate about this stuff, but in this case reality is less important than Makoto (who is definitely smart enough to see where this is heading) being convinced that it would still be in her best interest to comply with their demands even if it means a public striptease. So once more for emphasis- actual social and legal consequences for breaking the law in Japan are probably way different from what I describe here, so remember its all fiction and don't do something silly like go naked in a tourist group in Tokyo or something. Anyway...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad we're on the same page. So get your ass four blocks to the East, then get your ass out of your underwear. I'll give you 25 minutes to do that since I'm a nice guy.

A check of some street signs gave her all the orientation she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour city blocks wasn't a terribly far distance, but it was plenty long enough for Makoto to think about the situation she'd gotten herself into. Being blackmailed into doing these embarrassing and humiliating tasks because she already got blackmailed with staged photos that would have ruined her life. And what had caused that? Her own recklessness. She'd thought she could confront Kaneshiro directly and handle him, only to find herself outmaneuvered and made a fool of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it hadn't been for the others, there's no telling where Makoto would be right now. But even then, she couldn't bring herself to try involving any of them. This was her mess, and she needed to be the one to fix it. Besides that, Makoto had a feeling that Mr. Words would know if she tried using her phone to call anybody other than him. There was no telling what kind of punishment Makoto would face for trying to deviate from the track she'd been put on. She wasn't sure she wanted to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour blocks passed by quickly enough, and with plenty of time to spare from the 25 minute time limit. Makoto looked around the street, seeing passersby going about their lives, just like she'd seen last time. Except, instead of being able to duck into an alleyway to do her unpleasant business, Makoto was going to have to do it in a much more open setting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto slowly reached under the hem of her dress with an audible gulp. Shaking fingers grasped the waistband of her panties and froze in place. She couldn't believe what she was about to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like pulling off a band-aid. Just one quick motion...\" Makoto told herself. It didn't help her nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShutting her eyes in shame, Makoto slipped her hands down her shapely legs, her simple white panties following along. Quickly and awkwardly stepping out of the delicate garment, Makoto held her panties out clearly, just to make sure whoever was watching to make sure she complied could see she was really going through with it. Then, with a heavy feeling in her stomach, Makoto held her panties over the opening of the storm drain and let go. The delicate fabric dropped quietly into the darkness, unlikely to be seen again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately Makoto regretted what she'd done, even if it had been the only real option she had. A soft breeze sent Makoto's eyes wide as she was intimately reminded of what she'd just given up. Right on cue, the phone buzzed with another call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's done.\" Makoto said as she answered the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, Miss Makoto, you don't have to tell me.\" Mr. Words said calmly. \"Plain white, can't say I'm surprised, but it is a bit boring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto's cheeks burned. \"I... I don't care what you think of my undergarments, Mr. Words.\" she said. \"I just want this nightmare over with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well, don't hold your breath. We're just getting started. Now, after your complaint on our last call, I actually went ahead and changed your next task. You can thank me any time.\" Mr. Words said, followed by a long pause that made it clear what he was waiting for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thank you, Mr. Words.\" Makoto said. She couldn't believe this sleazeball was making her thank him for anything he was doing to her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I like to hear. Now, instead of taking anything else off, you've got a different job ahead of you.

Makoto bristled at the condescending way Mr. Words was speaking to her, but she knew she'd just have to put up with it for now. Mr. Words had better pray Makoto never meets her in person, she told herself, or it would end very painfully for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk to the station was uneventful, probably the calmest and most normal part of Makoto's day so far. Makoto almost found herself setting into the calm normalcy of life as she walked through the turnstile to the platform and waited for the instructed train. The familiar sound of the train slowing to a stop as it approached the station filled Makoto's ears and she turned to watch her fateful ride approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto's feeling of comfort and normalcy was interrupted as the updraft of the train's arrival sent the edge of her dress dangerously high. Anybody standing behind the demure girl would have been treated to a brief glimpse of the bottom edges of her shapely rear end before she frantically pushed the flapping fabric down. Makoto felt her cheeks go warm as she blushed intensely and looked around to see if anybody had noticed. Nobody was looking directly at her, but Makoto could hear a few quiet chuckles from behind her that gave her reason to suspect she'd had at least a few viewers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to push the incident out of her mind, Makoto quickly shuffled onto the train and looked around for the abandoned bag she needed to find. Normally this would be a difficult task, but whoever was behind the trials Makoto found herself being put through had been thorough, and the car had only one abandoned bag present, conspicuously poking out from beneath a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto made a beeline to the seat and sat down. Reaching underneath the seat to grab the bag and set it on her lap, Makoto opened the bag nervously and looked inside at the contents. The first thing she saw was a note, likely containing her newest instructions. Moving the note aside, Makoto saw the \"tools\" she'd be expected to use with her new orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from the note, the bag contained...</span></div></div>",

It looked strange to her. It had a narrow, rounded point that grew to about an inch at its widest part, before immediately shrinking to a size even narrower than the tip before it flared out to what appeared to be its base. Makoto\u2019s eyebrows furrowed as she looked at it. What exactly was she supposed to do with this? She spent a good minute staring at the object, hoping it would reveal its purpose to her. It didn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t that big, probably only around three inches long at most, so there couldn\u2019t be too much it could be used for. And what was the bottle for? She stared at both items and tried to figure out how they were related. When she couldn\u2019t, she turned her attention to the note, hoping it would give her some clarity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hello Makoto Niijima,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m sure a good girl with boring taste in underwear like yourself is absolutely confused at what you are holding. You see, it\u2019s a toy many adults enjoy playing with. And, who knows, maybe after today you might enjoy it as well. It\u2019s called a butt plug. You\u2019re a smart girl, so I\u2019m sure you can guess where it goes and what it does. Your new task is to insert that butt plug into your anus before the train arrives at Akihabara station. Once you have the butt plug in, return everything else back into the bag and put the bag under your seat. When the train arrives in Akihabara, you will get off and receive your next assignment. It\u2019s that easy. And we were even kind enough to make it even easier for you. Inside the bottle is some lubricant for you to put on the plug to help it glide right in. Of course, we only provided enough to get the job done, so if you waste it you\u2019ll have to find something else to use. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave fun,<br>\r\nMr. Words<br>\r\n<br>\r\nP.S. If you ask nicely, we might even consider letting you keep the butt plug as a souvenir.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto\u2019s face turned scarlet and her butt clenched. If Makoto didn\u2019t have enough reasons to hate Mr. Words before, she certainly did now. First, he made her throw away her panties, then he continued to insult said panties, and now\u2026 \u201cHe expects me to put this thing in my\u2026\u201d Makoto shook her head, her gaze returning to the two objects sitting on her lap. How could they expect her to do something like that, especially when there were other people on the train? At that moment, she remembered just what she had sitting out in the open for everyone to see and scrambled to put them back into the bag. She glanced around red-faced to see if anyone noticed. The train car wasn\u2019t crowded but there was a fair number of people on board. Despite that, it didn\u2019t seem like anyone had noticed her plight. She hoped it stayed that way. As Makoto sat there, blush refusing to subside, she tried to think about what she could do.</span></div></div>",

And try to live down the humiliation.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto went to work preparing the plug for its perverse purpose, keeping her hands hidden inside the bag to avoid anybody seeing exactly what she was up to. The bottle of lubricant opened easily and eased its contents out into Makoto's hands and the plug she held. The substance felt unlike anything Makoto had dealt with before. It was slick, oily, and thicker than she had expected. Stranger still, her palms began to tingle slightly as she worked the lube across the entire surface of the plug; the sensation wasn't unpleasant, but certainly not what she'd been prepared for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bottle's contents ran out in short order, and Makoto knew there was no more delaying it. It was time to try and do what the letter said. Makoto looked around the train car once more to see if anybody was watching her, and thankfully the people scattered throughout the car didn't seem to be paying her any mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto quickly withdrew the glistening plug from the bag and lifted her hips off her seat. The faster she did it, the less likely she was to be noticed, and this wasn't something she wanted to try explaining. Her trembling hand maneuvered the plug underneath her backside, blindly trying to position herself for the swiftest penetration possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to check her aim and her hand struggling to stay still, Makoto lowered herself down. The moment her anus touched the tip of the plug, however, her body tensed and a hiss of surprise escaped her lips. Even trying to mentally prepare herself hadn't been enough to truly prepare the embarrassed girl for what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto caught motion out of the corner of her eye, and it looked like someone was looking her way to see what the noise had been about. With the fear of being seen in her scandalous position motivating her, Makoto forced herself to sit, hitting the seat with a soft thud and impaling herself on the lubed plug. She couldn't help but gasp as the oiled plug was introduced to its new home, and her cheeks burned with shame as she scanned the car once again.</span></div></div>",

She knew just what it meant, he had seen her\u2026 Thankfully, it appeared that he was the only one that noticed. <i>That could\u2019ve gone a lot worse.</i> She told herself. Part of her felt bad that she might have just robbed the boy of his innocence.

It didn\u2019t work. As soon as she shifted, she finally noticed an awkward sense of fullness in her butt that seemed all the more noticeable in her new position. The added pressure from her new position seemed to push on the plug, pushing it in a little farther. Her face blushed light pink again as she immediately readjusted herself. She kept shifting and fidgeting until she found a position that seemed to minimalize the pressure on her butt. It looked anything but natural. Her back was pressed firmly against the back of the seat, while her butt hovered just above the seat as her legs held her up. She didn\u2019t know if she could hold the position for the entire trip. For now, though, she didn\u2019t care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting herself adjusted, she tried to cast a quick glance over at the kid. Knots started forming in her stomach. She saw him tugging rapidly on a woman\u2019s, who Makoto presumed was his mother, sleeve. The boy\u2019s head kept rapidly turning from the woman to her. The woman herself seemed more interested in her cellphone than the child next to her. For the first time ever, Makoto was thankful for people\u2019s addictions to their phones. Like most kids who are being ignored, the boy only grew more incessant, repeating \u201cMom\u201d every time he tugged, growing louder the longer it took. Eventually, it worked. Makoto felt a bead of sweat run down the side of her face, and she couldn\u2019t help but wonder if she should move to another part of the train car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong now, Ryo?\u201d the mother asked with a sigh, finally giving him the attention he craved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat lady,\u201d his voice almost a yell, garnering attention from some of the other passengers to Makoto\u2019s dismay, as he pointed at her, \u201csat on a binky, she\u2019s sitting on a binky!\u201d Her heart stopped. She felt everyone\u2019s gaze turn toward her, her face going from a light pink to a cherry red, managing to spit out an embarrassed \u201cWhat?\u201d The mom cast a lazy glance between her child and the red-faced girl he pointed to and sighed.</span></div></div>",

After all, you\u2019re a bright young woman with a promising future ahead of you, so long as we keep these pictures under wraps.\u201d Mr. Words said. \u201cI believe we\u2019re being more than fair in giving you a chance to clear your debt another way, don\u2019t you agree?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto stood quietly. Honestly, she had to admit it was better for her that they came to her with this offer rather than just releasing the pictures and being done with the whole matter. But what if these tasks were just going to keep spiraling until she\u2019s put in a worse situation than before? She didn\u2019t have much time to dwell on the thought before Mr. Words spoke up again, \u201cWe don\u2019t have all day, Miss Makoto. Are you going to continue completing our tasks or would you rather we release the pictures?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto hesitated for a moment more before finding her voice. \u201cHow many more of these \u2018tasks\u2019 involve me losing articles of clothing? Because\u2026 because if your plan is to strip me completely to repay my \u2018debt\u2019\u2026\u201d Her blush deepened at just imagining the prospect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to stop you right there, before you say something you might regret, Miss Makoto,\u201d Mr. Words said, cutting in. \u201cIf you start imagining all the what-ifs and things that could happen, you\u2019ll just work yourself up. I can guarantee that not all the tasks we give you will involve you losing clothing. Who knows, maybe in some tasks we might even give you some clothing. But, needless to say, some of our tasks will require you to shed some clothes. Of course, it is perfectly understandable, expected really, that a respectable, upstanding young woman such as yourself is concerned about her dignity. And, although I can\u2019t say whether or not or plans for you will involve getting you naked, I can say this: so what? Hypothetically, Miss Makoto, let\u2019s say you do find yourself naked in public and you get caught. What would happen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I would make up an excuse! I\u2019d come up with something to explain why I\u2019m naked, like that I was robbed or-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what if the police got involved, then what would happen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf they believed me, they would likely get me something to coverup with and have me give an official report of what happened before taking me home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd if they didn\u2019t believe you? What\u2019s the worst that would happen then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2026\u201d Makoto\u2019s voice caught in her throat. \u201cThey might charge a fine\u2026 or potentially detain me\u2026 They would call up my sister, and she would come pick me up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd your sister might even get that kept off the record,\u201d Mr. Words chimed in. \u201cBut even if she didn\u2019t, how badly would that affect your future?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t change much of anything,\u201d Makoto said, her voice merely a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn the other hand, how much would those pictures being released affect your future?\u201d Mr. Words\u2019 voice said, patiently continuing to guide her answers like one would a small child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe school would have to perform disciplinary action\u2026\u201d Makoto answered quietly. \u201cI would be suspended or potentially even expelled. Then, that would go on my record and might keep me from getting accepted to any prestigious schools\u2026 which would limit what careers I could go into\u2026 and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd would tarnish your bright future.\u201d Mr. Words finished for her. \u201cWe certainly don\u2019t want that, now do we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Makoto didn\u2019t know what else to say. They had her between a rock and a hard place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it, Miss Makoto. Besides, what\u2019s a little embarrassment now compared to happy life later on?\u201d Mr. Words said. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve decided that, let\u2019s continue. Head to the underground mall in Shibuya and ditch that bra. We\u2019ll even be so kind as to let you decide which shop you want to ditch it in. But do be quick about it, we don\u2019t have all day. I\u2019ll leave you to it-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, I have one more question!\u201d Makoto said, voice coming out rushed. She had an idea that could at least make this \u2018task\u2019 less embarrassing for her. \u201cCan I take my bra off somewhere else first, like the bathroom or something and just drop it off in one of the shops afterwards?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer came quick, \u201cNo,\u201d Mr. Words said with a small chuckle. \u201cThat\u2019s half the challenge after all. It might be better for you to think of this as a game, have some fun with it, and it\u2019ll be over before you know it.\u201d With that, the line went dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto just stood there at a loss as her frustration with this situation grew. More and more, she wished she hadn\u2019t have run off alone and gotten caught by Kaneshiro. After all, it was her own recklessness that got her where she was now, and that was probably what stung most about this whole situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst my leggings, now my bra,\u201d She thought out loud. \u201cWhat\u2019s next, are they going to try to take my panties?\u201d She tried to ask it as a joke, but for some reason she didn\u2019t think it was all that funny. Maybe it was because they actually might try to take those next? Thinking about it, Makoto felt a shiver go down her spine and dread building up in her stomach, she certainly hoped that wasn\u2019t what was coming next. She tried to shake the thought out of her head as she started to move back out of the alley and onto the road. Honestly, she wasn\u2019t too far from the mall, but the time it would take to get there would be both too long and not long enough for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked, she found her eyes drifting to watch her chest. Her eyes stared so intently and harsh that they might have burned a hole in her dress if she were able.  She searched for any hint of her bra through her dress, seeing if any spot of the dress was transparent enough to see through, and she wasn\u2019t finding any. \u201cMaybe I was wrong.\u201d She said to herself. \u201cMaybe it won\u2019t be noticeable at all.\u201d She could only hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll she had left to decide was which shop she would complete the task in.</span></div></div>",

Her hand touched the top of the railing, and she hesitated, staring down the stairwell. A handful of people were ascending, not a single one appeared to be paying her any mind, yet she suddenly found herself concerned with the length of her dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer dress wasn\u2019t short by any means, especially not in comparison to what she has seen other girls wear. But, without her leggings, she began feeling a little self-conscious. As people started moving around her to descend the stairs, Makoto steeled herself. It was silly of her to be so nervous over something so trivial. Though, that thought didn\u2019t stop her from holding the bottom of her dress down with her free hand as she descended. She took no time celebrate her victory over the stairs, making her way toward the Underground Mall the moment her feet touched down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was more crowded than she expected, full of families, kids running around, and people her own age just hanging out. She expected the place to be nearly vacant, considering the time. Admittedly, though, she didn\u2019t know much about the mall. She had only been there a handful of times, and each of those times Ann had been dragging her along, telling her it was the perfect place to relax. Makoto didn\u2019t feel too relaxed, quite the opposite. She was a bundle of nerves as she circled the mall, looking for the best place to complete her task, while also trying to keep an eye out for anyone tailing her without looking too suspicious. She was sure she was failing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew from shopping with Ann that the mall had a couple clothing stores, Lovely Melody and the ever-crowded Problem Child. Normally, clothing stores would be the best place to ditch clothes, or at least one would assume. It didn\u2019t certainly didn\u2019t seem that way to Makoto. Lovely Melody seemed to have a steady number of people entering and exiting it. Problem Child was worse. No matter the time, it seemed Problem Child always had an enormous crowd in its rather small store. Whenever you were in it, you were always shoulder-to-shoulder with someone else. And due to the hole-in-the-wall nature of the stores in the Underground Mall and the need to maximize space, neither of the clothing stores appeared to provide changing rooms for their patrons. Makoto cupped her chin in thought. If the obvious choices were out, where could she get her task over with?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto walked around the mall, scanning every business within it with a critical eye. The worst locations seemed to be the Shoe Repair store, the Sundry store (though, she would admit, it did have cute book covers), the Souvenir store and the Umbrella shop. The latter two hardly had enough space in their stalls for their product let alone customers.  The jewelry stores weren\u2019t any better, but for the opposite reasons. The mall apparently housed three different jewelry stores, each one spacious and open. Honestly, she commended their ability to maximize their spaces while still leaving plenty of room for customers to browse. However, that was part of the problem. In each of those stores, there would be nowhere for her to hide her bra after she removed it \u2013 if she even could without being seen. Likely due to the rather expensive cost of their product and quite possibly her age, the employees in each of the jewelry stores watched her like hawks. Similarly, the employee in Body Chop, a cosmetics store, was stuck to her like clue after she entered it, but she chocked that one up to the employee having nothing else to do than anything else, because they had been very friendly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto did eventually manage to find a few promising locations. Across from Body Chop stood a shoe store called Beauty Feet. Inside, the walls were covered with displays of shoes and shoeboxes. There were even aisles with shelves that nearly reached up to her eyes. She would be able to have at least an illusion of privacy if she did it there. A few stalls away from Beauty Feet was a purse store that for a reason Makoto couldn\u2019t identify was named Funny Face. Similarly, it was not crowded, and its large, circular displays provided cover for her. Plus, she would be easily able to hide her bra in one of the various purses. Aside from those, the only other promising store was Babel Records, a music and DVD store. It had the benefit of an inattentive cashier, who seemed more interested in his phone than doing his job, and a large shelf of CDs that would provide cover the wandering gazes of people looking through the establishment\u2019s wall of windows. She was deep in thought, weighing the pros and cons of each option, when a ringing noise snapped her out of it. Tentatively, Makoto pulled up the phone she had been given and answered it. \u201cHello?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo I need to remind you, Miss Makoto, that we don\u2019t have all day for you to finish this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, but-\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were generous in allowing you to decide where to complete this task \u2013 which I now see was a mistake. A mistake that will not happen again. You have 5 minutes to go to your store of choice and remove that bra. Fail to complete the task in the timeframe, and I\u2019ll have to determine you\u2019re not up to the task of clearing your debt to us. I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t have to tell you what happens then, Miss Makoto.\u201d With that, the line went dead. A jolt of panic passed through her, as her eyes dashed among her choices. <i>What am I going to do?</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her heart went a mile a minute, and her surroundings blurred around her. She only cared about beating the deadline. When she arrived at the entryway to the store, she slowed her pace some. Yet her heart only seemed to beat faster. She wondered how much time she had left, her stomach knotting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe briskly walked through the automated, sliding glass door, where she was greeted by the ice-cold air conditioning of the store. She put one eye on the cashier, who didn\u2019t even bother to look up, looking as bored as could be while she was in the middle of a crisis, while her other eye scanned the room. A couple people were inside, looking through rental bins or checking out what was stocked on the shelf. A slight feeling of relief came to her when not a person paid any attention to her entrance. She walked over the display shelf that covered the entire middle of the store, the only thing stopping people from outside from being able to see everything inside. She was thankful that the discount bins were toward the front of the store, because that was where most of the customers seemed to flock to. She was all alone on her side of the shelf. For a moment, her hand almost drifted to pick up a DVD case to at least pretend that was the reason she was here, just in case someone she didn\u2019t notice was actually watching her. Her hand stopped before it ever got anywhere. <i>I don\u2019t have time for that</i>, she thought hurriedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto kept the cashier in her sights as her hands worked their magic to unhook her bra as discreetly and fast as possible. As soon as the hooks came loose, she felt the slack in her bra. Now came the hard part, getting it off. Throwing all caution to the wind, Makoto pulled her arms, one at a time, into her shirt as she worked to free them from her bra\u2019s straps. Ordinarily, removing a bra wouldn\u2019t be too difficult of a task, even if you\u2019re removing under a shift, but due to Makoto\u2019s frenzied rush against an invisible clock the task involved a bit more struggling than usual. But she did succeed. Quiet as a feather, her bra landed at her feet and she pushed her arms back out of her top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the task complete, Makoto found herself panting hard and coated in sweat, almost like she had just been in a marathon, with one thought on her mind, <i>Did I make it in time</i>. She moved to rest her arm on the display to help support herself. With each deep breath and each minute movement of her body, she could feel the soft, delicate fabric of her dress get acquainted with parts of her it never touched before. She risked a glance at her surroundings to see if anyone had seen her. A sigh of relief left her mouth when she saw no one looking her way. The only evidence of what she had done laid at her feet. But just when Makoto thought she would have a moment to catch her breath, a sound broke through the quiet around her. The sound of-<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As a sleeper being jarred awake, Joker once more found himself abandoning his recollections and slipping back into the cold, hard reality of his present. His throat was dry and heavy from speaking so long. The countless cuts and bruises from his interrogations and beatings continued to throb in protest. He was aware of a growing, aching pain in the back of his head like every caffeine addicted headache he had developed when skipping his morning coffee at Leblanc over the past year was now coming back to haunt him at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, painfully he raised his eyes back up to the intense stare of Sae Niijima. She sat across from him in the dark, bleak chamber that they shared. Her arms were crossed, the scowl on her face a blend of judgment, wonder and focus as she took in his account (again weighing each piece of information, whether to trust it or discard it, and once more reassessing her impressions of her now exposed nemesis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoker said nothing, expecting another prompt to help center his mind and provide a place to pick up the narrative he was untangling for the both of them. The silence stretched on and on. Joker's eyes narrowed in exhaustion and confusion. The look Sae was giving him had changed slightly. This wasn't the vicious, judgmental stare she had first confronted him with, nor the bewildered and awe filled look she occasionally assumed when the details of his account clicked into place despite the sheer absurdity of his statements, nor even the ever so brief yet increasingly frequent sparks of genuine camaraderie she occasionally flashed his way (despite her every effort, she was growing increasingly FOND of the bastard). This was...pensive, unsure, as if for the first time she was actually hesitant to ask her questions despite the time limit that was dogging them throughout the process. If Joker didn't know any better, he would swear she was starting to blush in the dim light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't going to ask about this....\" She sighed at last. \"But I need a full account. And as strange as your story has been so far, this incident still stands out to me.\" She withdrew another picture from her briefcase and slid it across the table to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoker's eyes widened in disbelief as he began to remember. He felt his own face flushing to match his interrogator's as the events began to play out in his mind. He covered his mouth to hide the noise which threatened to escape from his throat, a combination of a laugh, a groan, and a small sigh of glee. The photo showed a familiar young woman, face contorted in a cry of dismay and terror, her body completely naked and poorly hidden behind her hands. Small black bars blotted out her exposed anatomy and hid her eyes from view, but Joker of course immediately knew her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Futaba Sakura. Adopted daughter of your ward and guardian. Chronic shut-in and borderline psychotic since the death of her mother. Expertise in computers and electronics. Alleged founding member of the cyber terrorists known as Medjed. Currently an active member of the Phantom Thieves. Given her nearly crippling phobia of crowds and open spaces, it must have been agonizing finding herself naked in public like this. How did this happen? Was this some sort of plan by the phantom thieves? A heist gone wrong? A distraction? Was this an attack by an enemy? Or something stranger still? Tell me everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoker cleared his throat, his mind still fuzzy from the drugs and trying to decide whether he felt more mortified or ecstatic about what his friend had gone through. Finally, he spoke, his voice cracking slightly. \"All right. This is how it began...\"</span></div></div>",

She always loved beating her rival, PricklyPrincess4729. As her (Futaba assumed) name ironically implied, she was always quite salty every time Futaba won, which was most of the time. The chat client lit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>PricklyPrincess4729:</b> you cheated.<br>\r\n<b>GoGoFeatherman88:</b> no i didn't.<br>\r\n<b>PricklyPrincess4729:</b> i know you did. you're a hacker.<br>\r\n<b>GoGoFeatherman88:</b> i'm the BEST hacker. but i don't need to cheat to beat the pants off you.<br>\r\n<b>PricklyPrincess4729:</b> is that so? that gives me an interesting idea.<br>\r\n<b>GoGoFeatherman88:</b> that would be a first.<br>\r\n<b>PricklyPrincess4729:</b> always ready with a snappy remark, aren't you futaba?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFutaba froze and she felt a knot from in her stomach.

How could she do something that stupid? That was a Ryuji-tier mistake!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>PricklyPrincess4729:</b> i never cared who you were before that, but then i got interested. so i hacked the game server and found some breadcrumbs of data that lead me to your house. a little digging later and i had your power word. the medjed stuff was just a guess because medjed never would have acted like that normally, but i guess i was right on that too.<br>\r\n<b>GoGoFeatherman88:</b> so what if i \"predicted their next target.\" that's not exactly substantial evidence.<br>\r\n<b>PricklyPrincess4729:</b> maybe not. but i bet it's enough to interest the police. even if they don't arrest you, i bet they start watching you. that would be a pain, wouldn't it?<br>\r\n<b>GoGoFeatherman88:</b> what do you want?<br>\r\n<b>PricklyPrincess4729:</b> now we're getting to it.<br>\r\n<b>PricklyPrincess4729:</b> i want another game.<br>\r\n<b>GoGoFeatherman88:</b> you want me to beat you again? or do you want me to throw the game for the sake of your fragile ego?<br>\r\n<b>PricklyPrincess4729:</b> i'm not that pathetic. i'd rather get some satisfaction out of this. i'm going to give you the chance to...what was it? \"beat the pants off me?\"<br>\r\n<b>GoGoFeatherman88:</b> ...where are you going with this?<br>\r\n<b>PricklyPrincess4729:</b> we're going to stream a game for the community. you're going to turn on your webcam and i'm going to turn on mine.<br>\r\n<b>GoGoFeatherman88:</b> w<br>\r\n<b>GoGoFeatherman88:</b> why do we need to use webcams?<br>\r\n<b>PricklyPrincess4729:</b> because every time i win a match you're going to take off something you're wearing.<br>\r\n<b>GoGoFeatherman88:</b> WHAT<br>\r\n<b>PricklyPrincess4729:</b> and, obviously, the same goes for me every time you get a match on me.<br>\r\n<b>PricklyPrincess4729:</b> first one totally naked loses and they have to do what the other says.<br>\r\n<b>GoGoFeatherman88:</b> this ha<br>\r\n<b>GoGoFeatherman88:</b> s to be a joke<br>\r\n<b>GoGoFeatherman88:</b> do you really want to get naked in front of the whole community that badly?<br>\r\n<b>PricklyPrincess4729:</b> i feel pretty good about my chances, actuall.<br>\r\n<b>PricklyPrincess4729:</b> you're trying to talk tough, but i think i've rattled you. and i think being on camera, especially with nudity on the line, is going going to trigger that 'tism of yours and give me the advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFutaba couldn't believe what she was reading.

Hacking the game servers was easy. She had never cared about Princess before either, but this was life or death! Or life or nudity, at least. It took her less than a minutes. Nozomi Kuruda. She quickly grabbed her phone and opened the chat program.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Oracle:</b> Guys! Nozomi Kuruda. You need to get to mementos and steal her heart pronto!<br>\r\n<b>Queen:</b> What? Futaba what is it? This is extremely sudden.<br>\r\n<b>Oracle:</b> No time! I can't really get into it, but if you don't then there's a decent chance we're going to get busted. Our identities are on the line! And probably my dignity too!<br>\r\n<b>Fox:</b> This is highly irregular. I know you are typically undisciplined and awkward, but these things need to be discussed first.<br>\r\n<b>Oracle:</b> Shut it, Inari! We're on a really strict time crunch here!<br>\r\n<b>Skull:</b> Well, I'm all for some action but this is kinda weird.<br>\r\n<b>Panther:</b> You sure you're ok, Futaba?<br>\r\n<b>Oracle:</b> Oh, I'm not, but I can deal with it.<br>\r\n<b>Noir:</b> Would you like one of us to come get you?<br>\r\n<b>Oracle:</b> I can't go with you this time. Let's just say my part has to be from here. Just get Mona to do the scany stuff. I'm sure he can still manage that at least kind of.<br>\r\n<b>Joker:</b> He was offended.<br>\r\n<b>Oracle:</b> I don't care!<br>\r\n<b>Queen:</b> Okay, I'm still worried, but we'll go.<br>\r\n<b>Oracle:</b> Good. Keep me posted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFutaba put her phone down. She only had a minute left. She looked at herself. Jacket, boots, stockings, shirt, belt, shorts, tanktop, bra and panties. She doubted she could get away with any more anyway. The RTS games weren't exactly fast, but they were streamlined and not super long either. She'd have to try and drag things out to buy time for her friends to come through for her. Hopefully before she'd shown anything that bad. Not that she was going to lose, of course. But...better safe than sorry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a sigh she logged into the game server and, for the first time, activated her never-before-used webcam. Princess, or Nozomi, appeared on the screen. She wasn't exactly unattractive. She had dark hair with a blue streak of dye through it. She was chubby, but not overly fat. Most of her weight seemed to have accumlated, as Futaba noted with a little envy, in her rather sizeable breasts and butt. She wore a confident sneer that was simply irritating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that you? Oh wow, you're actually pretty cute!\" She said with a giggle. \"Don't you guys think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFutaba suddenly remembered they would have an audience and looked nervously at the chat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>PimpsNHeeHos: is that really them?</b><br>\r\n<b>kekisreal: they're actually grills?</b><br>\r\n<b>PhantomReefer: she's a kid now. she's a squid now.</b><br>\r\n<b>SamHydeDidIt: &gt;girl gamers</b><br>\r\n<b>THOTpatrol: princess is thicccccc</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh, boy. This is going to be an experience.' Futaba thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, me and Feathers here have decided to finally put our rivalry to bed once and for all,\" Nozomi chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>kekisreal: &gt;rivalry</b><br>\r\n<b>THOTpatrol: you mean: you won a couple of games once or twice</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine. But we'll see how well she does when the pressure is on, because this...is going to be a strip match. And by the end the loser will be...bared for all to see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>PhantomReefer: theres a 0% chance this is not clickbait</b><br>\r\n<b>PimpsNHeeHos: bullshit</b><br>\r\n<b>KenpachiRamasama: i somehow doubt this</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't believe me? Why don't you just wait around and find out,\" Nozomi said confidently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFutaba bit her lip. She looked at Nozomi. She had a hoodie on, but it was zipped up. It looked like some kind of shirt below it. From what she could see she had jeans on too. She couldn't see her feet. She had to assume some underwear too. They were probably fairly evenly matched, maybe give or take a bit. In theory, she knew she could beat Nozomi. Easily even. But Nozomi was right. Futaba could feel the webcam on her like a spotlight. She could feel the eyes of the guys watching. Maybe they didn't believe it now, but she knew Nozomi wouldn't back down and once things started getting serious they'd start believing it. She tried to tell herself that this was just like every other time, but deep down she knew it wasn't. She could feel the anxiety welling up. This was exactly what Nozomi wanted. Her to panic and make mistakes, and the more she lost the more she'd panic. Futaba had to try and play her best while buying time for her friends to change Nozomi's heart and put an end to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, all she could do is play like she'd never played before.</span></div></div>",

Just remember when you're taking your clothes off that you asked for me to attack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just remember this was your idea when the audience is gawking at you!\" Futaba countered, her attention entirely drawn to the smack talk at this point. \"Hope you're okay with all these pervs seeing you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Futaba?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Excuse me? May I address one final item?\" Haru Okumura asked, biting back her nervousness as she rose to her feet and all eyes turned towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meeting had gone better than expected so far. There was a notable number of disapproving expressions and dirty looks among the board members and shareholders, but most of the business people at least seemed impartial or even cautiously supportive of her being there. And of course even her most ardent critics had not had the courage to challenge the acting President Takakura when he insisted on allowing her to sit in and contribute to the meeting. Most of her suggestions and thoughts had all been regarding new branches of the company and quality in their food and products, and while using higher quality ingredients and offering actual benefits and decent schedules to their workers was going to be expensive the board members were at present most concerned with rehabilitating the company image after the more heinous of her father's practices had come to light. Therefore, a passionate plea for cleaning up the company from the heiress was not at all unwelcome, although Haru wasn't naive enough to think this enthusiasm would remain so high when the cost analysis for the reforms came in. But that was a worry for the future. For now, she was only top happy to ride the wave of general enthusiasm for her proposals as much as possible to propose something truly controversial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it would be prudent...to run an internal audit on company gains and losses over the past year.\" Haru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Not that I object to the idea, Miss Okumura. But we routinely check the books several times a year.\" One of the executives chimed in. \"Why do another one so soon to the end of the quarter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaru breathed in. This was it. \"I believe, in light of recent events, we should do a focused audit around the dates of all mental shutdown cases in the last year. Appraise how our company profited, and especially which branches benefited most. And which people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Okumura...I understand that you'd be as eager to catch the Phantom Thieves as anyone after what they did to your father, but surely this is a matter best left to the police?\" Another boardmember popped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaru frowned. Of course she knew that the Phantom Thieves had nothing to do with her father's murder, since she was in fact one of them. \"I am not fully convinced this was because of the Phantom Thieves. As detective Akechi has stated, this does not fit with the pattern of their past work. And of course the mental shutdowns were happening well before the first incident of the Phantom Thieves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clearly that was their business prior to this stealing hearts routine.\" One of her critics said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, I don't find that convincing. If the two phenomena were coming from the same group, why create the phantom thieves at all? Let the incidents and deaths be written off as stress related or fluke accidents. Why deliberately draw attention to your ability to affects people's minds as the Thieves do when you were profiting perfectly well in secret?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe board members exchanged looks and whispers a moment. \"An...interesting theory, Ma'am, but surely it remains a matter for the police?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You misunderstand. I don't want to find the Phantom Thieves or the mental shutdown instigators. I want to ensure we are no longer doing business with them or anyone tied to them.\" Haru said, laying her hands on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakakura leaned forward in his seat. \"You think someone in the company besides your father had contacts with them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my concern, yes.\" Haru nodded. \"I loved my father, but the knowledge that he would go so far as to drive his competitors insane or even kill them makes me ashamed! And the thought that anyone else in this company conspired with him, and perhaps was in any way associated with his death...that is unforgivable! I fear we cannot possibly move forward or make a fresh start as a company until we have identified any and all areas of corruption leftover from my father's actions!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surely you aren't suggesting any significant profit made in those timeframed is a clear indicator of guilt? What if that is merely an example of shrewd business sense and the timing is a coincidence? Or perhaps your father merely wanted to grow that area of the company and his managers profited without knowledge of his methods?\" Another executive objected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am merely suggesting this as a place to begin. Obviously further investigation would be needed before any kind of action would take place on the company's part.\" Haru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally, all she wanted were a list of names. She doubted anyone in bed with her father would be capable of existing without a Palace or a shadow in Mementos. Rattle off all the names on the list and see which ones the App reacts to. The Phantom Thieves would take care of the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Okumura...do you believe anyone at this table is a part of this...corruption, as you put it?\" Another executive asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....I don't want to believe that. But after what I learned about my father, my faith has been shaken. I no longer know who I can trust personally or professionally. I believe the public currently faces the same doubts. Not to mention our shareholders. We want to restore trust, and that begins by knowing who can be trusted. I realize that is a lot to ask, especially for those who have been here the longest. I also hope you can see the necessity and can have faith that the truth will come out and loyal, dedicated members of our company have nothing to fear from any probe we conduct.\" Haru offered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected, the mood around the table had darkened considerably. Takakura at last cleared his throat. \"If we were to approve this audit, I presume we should begin with the Wild Duck Burger case?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaru paused. \"Wild Duck Burger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...umm...earlier this year there was an incident in which a wild duck burger employee suffered a breakdown and came to work without any clothes on. The incident caused a scandal, forced Wild Duck to close several locations, and effectively eliminated them as a competitor due to their damaged reputation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...yes. I...heard about that.\" Haru blushed. \"I had not made the connection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meeting went on. No firm agreement on an audit was reached, but the idea was better received than expected. A recess was called for lunch. President Takakura moved to pull Haru aside as the other executives shuffled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a...bold suggestion, Miss Okumura.\" Takakura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. I think it went well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. But are you certain this is wise? Poking a hornet's nest of killers could put your life in danger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for your concern. But I don't believe I will be a target. I think my father's death means whoever is responsible for these mental incidents has cut ties with the company. Anyone associated with them has to fend for themselves now.\" Haru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a lie, of course. She firmly believed their mysterious rivals in the heart stealing business were still connected to the company. But unlike her father, Haru had a Persona instead of a shadow. Unlike a shadow, there was no way to murder her by attacking her other self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, Haru took her leave and made her way to a subway platform to get some lunch before the meeting began again. Meanwhile, in Mementos, a figure covered in black watched her indistinct approach. This was a thin space, much like the safe havens dotted throughout the Palaces. Here the lines between the real world and Mementos were thin enough for the two to visually oscillate back and forth. Akechi had learned that in such places his unique Persona abilities could pass over and touch the minds of people in the real world. Of course, it was not lethal the way killing a Persona was. But he had a special talent for corrupting shadows and personas, driving them somewhat mad. Which was good. He had no desire to kill Haru Okumura if possible. But a message should be sent. A warning. And a bit of humiliation. A repeat of the Wild Duck incident should suffice quite nicely. And his contacts within Big Bang Burger would reward him handsomely for delivering that message promptly.</span></div></div>",

Well, someone's not getting any free time this week!\" Kawakami muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have it your way. Just try to finish up quickly.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Master. But for the record, you were way cuter when you let me walk all over you.\" Kawakami shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoker was going to retort when a loud 'keeyah!\" rang down the stairs, followed by a ominous cloud of dust. Joker made his way up the stairs to find his cute, fragile maid practically covered in dust and debris from head to toe. The vacuum cleaner lay on the crowd, the hose apparently having popped out of the main device regurgitated a considerable amount of its contents onto his teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gross! Gross! Gross!\" Kawakami said in dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoker snickered at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shut up! This is all your fault, you know!\" Kawakami wailed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My fault for expecting a maid to know how to properly use a vacuum cleaner?\" Joker asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That order to 'shut up' still stands, you know!\" Kawakami snapped. \"Crap! I need this for work tomorrow night too! I'll have to wash it....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you have a washer at your place, right?\" Joker asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on! I can't go home like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then change into some none-work clothes.\" Joker suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh...yeah. Good idea. If I brought any with me....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! I could borrow some of your clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm....putting aside the fact that I'm fresh out of bras or dresses....do you think anything I own will fit you?\" Joker asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh. No. Your way too lanky for a kid your age. You need to eat regularly and get a proper meal.\" Kawakami lectured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoker decided not to voice the counter argument that entered his mind, namely that a woman his teacher's age should try to eat a little less and avoid developing the kind of posterior that would make fitting into his pants an impossibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess you'll just have to do your laundry in the nude.\" Joker said at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right. In your dreams, buddy. Remember, might be a maid but still your teacher!\" Kawakami snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious. The only thing I can offer you to wear would be a towel or a bedsheet. Besides, you'd probably want to shower anyway.\" Joker said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKawakami glared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not trying to catch a peek here. Just saying- you have limited options. I'll be good and avoid staring at you. Probably.\" Joker said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKawakami glared. \"You'd better if you value your essay scores!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So....I guess you'd better....\"</span></div></div>",

Naked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoker nodded. \"Unless you want to try washing yourself off in the bathroom stall sink, or the kitchen sink.\" he offered, pointing at the places in question. \"Sojiro doesn't need a proper bathroom or laundry machine here when his house is a short walk away. How do you think I've been taking care of myself all this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That explains a lot...\" Kawakami mused to herself while ignoring the small look Joker shot her way. \"If that's really my only option... Y-you... you'd better stay put until I get back. If I even think you stepped outside after me-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have my word.\" Joker promised, holding up his hands in defense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a doubtful glare in Joker's direction, Kawakami stepped out of Leblanc and into the streets. The night was quiet and few people were around. Kawakami considered herself lucky as she made the quick run from the cafe to the small alleyway that housed the public laundromat and the bathhouse that apparently had been Joker's main source of hygiene since transferring here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Sadayo. You can do this.\" Kawakami told herself. \"It'll be quick. Nobody's going to be making an emergency visit to do laundry at this time of night. You'll be in and out before you know it! You'll only have to spend a little while... naked... outdoors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying not to dwell on the terrifying thought for too long, Kawakami went to the washing machine furthest from the door and quickly disrobed. One decent thing about the ridiculous maid outfit her part-time job forced her to wear was that it was rather easy to remove. Sure, that fortunate fact was intended for a more lewd purpose than easy laundry, but the specifics weren't important right now. The dress, stockings, and (with more than a little hesitation) Kawakami's undergarments were thrown in the machine. A few button presses later the machine rumbled to life, leaving Kawakami alone with the dull hum of the machine, the cool night air, and her own thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's settled.\" Kawakami thought. \"Since I'm already naked... maybe it wouldn't hurt to run into the bathhouse? It would be nice to get this dust off my body and out of my hair. But that would mean stepping out of this building, even if just for a second. And... crap! I don't have any money to pay!\"</span></div></div>",

Part of her wanted to just stay where she was in the semi-seclusion of the laundromat. But she just couldn't talk herself into feeling safe there with an open doorway only feet away. Besides...she NEEDED to be clean. Being covered in this dirt and who knows what else made her skin crawl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo resolved, she took a quick peek out of the laundromat to verify that 'Master' or anyone else wasn't hiding around the corner, then walked on tip toe to the bathhouse door. She was about to reach and open it when another thought hit her. No money. If she was lucky she could sneak past the front...hopefully no one would see her. Or if they did, she could make up some excuse...accidentally left through the back door, fell in a pile of gunk in a back alley, something like that maybe. Or....she could go back to Leblanc to retrieve her purse. That....was a whole other kind of risk, exposing her to potential view from either side of the alley, not to mention the high chance her student would see her. But it would prevent problems with the bath.....especially if she threw in a few hundred yen extra if they started to ask embarrassing questions. </span></div></div>",

She nearly grabbed it and threw it open, only to remember that she was trying to be clandestine just in time to stop herself. Stopping in place, Kawakami slowly knelt down and slowly inched the door open. As soon as the gap was wide enough for her to squeeze through, the teacher crawled forward into the bath house. The light and warm climate of the establishment was a welcome change from the chilly night air.

Dr. Takemi here is on a short list of 'persons of interest' who fit the profile of such a provider. That's how I learned about this particular incident. Despite the complaints and unsettling rumors surrounding her practice, I don't find any previous history of exhibitionism or indecency in her records. So enlighten me, Joker of the Phantom Thieves.

We need to account for that with you, make sure we note anything that isn't 'bland' that might skew the data. You should know how important that sort of thing is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTae scowled. Uehara was right and they both knew it. They also both knew that Uehara was going to take far more pleasure from this physical than professionally necessary. It really wasn't a big deal, Tae rationalized to herself as she shrugged off her lab coat. After all, they were both adult women. They were both doctors. They'd seen plenty of people naked, this wasn't anything different. Even if they knew each other. And one of them had a reputation. And Tae absolutely dreaded every moment of being at this woman's mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before Tae stood in front of Uehara in her fully glory.

The cold metal made the woman jump in shock and discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH! H-hey! At least warm it up first! What kind of bedside manner is that?!\" Tae barked, irritated at what she knew she should have expected out of the devious nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUehara simply smiled and winked. \"Don't be a baby!\" she teased. \"Now stand still and let me get your heart rate and check your breathing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTae scowled, but complied. Ignoring the cold metal against her sensitive breasts (and the hard to hide stiffening of her nipples from the cold), Tae grit her teeth and let Uehara do her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.

As a sleeper being jarred awake, Joker once more found himself abandoning his recollections and slipping back into the cold, hard reality of his present. His throat was dry and heavy from speaking so long. The countless cuts and bruises from his interrogations and beatings continued to throb in protest. He was aware of a growing, aching pain in the back of his head like every caffeine addicted headache he had developed when skipping his morning coffee at Leblanc over the past year was now coming back to haunt him at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, painfully he raised his eyes back up to the intense stare of Sae Niijima. She sat across from him in the dark, bleak chamber that they shared. Her arms were crossed, the scowl on her face a blend of judgment, wonder and focus as she took in his account (again weighing each piece of information, whether to trust it or discard it, and once more reassessing her impressions of her now exposed nemesis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoker said nothing, expecting another prompt to help center his mind and provide a place to pick up the narrative he was untangling for the both of them. The silence stretched on and on. Joker's eyes narrowed in exhaustion and confusion. The look Sae was giving him had changed slightly. This wasn't the vicious, judgmental stare she had first confronted him with, nor the bewildered and awe filled look she occasionally assumed when the details of his account clicked into place despite the sheer absurdity of his statements, nor even the ever so brief yet increasingly frequent sparks of genuine camaraderie she occasionally flashed his way (despite her every effort, she was growing increasingly FOND of the bastard). Now she was barely meeting his gaze at all, skittishly giving him brief looks before glancing back down at her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In any event, let's move on to the next target. The victim this time was-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait.\" Joker said. The next major incident was far down the timeline. Up until now Sae had insisted on a careful albeit abridged reconstruction of the events day by day. It had been an extremely effective work around to the drug impeding his recollections. Why was she suddenly skipping...actually, hadn't there been something significant very soon after the last point she had questioned him on? What was she...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have little time. We should move ahead to the next event.\" Sae said emphatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. There was something else. I'm sure of it. Something...\" Joker stared at her intently, confusion slowly giving way...a smirk slowly spreading across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-whatever you might be thinking r-right now is most likely an effect of the drugs! Let's move on before you grow too befuddled to give me a proper-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were naked.\" Joker said, a smug certainty in his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSae looked him directly in the eye now, the way a mouse stares at the cat who has cornered it. With a clear air of alarm she glanced back at the video camera. She doubted they had a microphone on the camera, but it was still possible to lip read. Unlikely, but suddenly Sae was feeling more than a little paranoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say that. As far as your concerned, it never happened. Am I clear?\" Sae said, attempting to look stern and authoritative once again. \"Now, answer my-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were there any photos?\" Joker asked, suddenly more at ease than at any point during questioning. \"Of course there are. You aren't the type to ignore evidence, even if it humiliates you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...\" Sae took another glance at the camera. \"You need to stop right now or...or I'll leave and...and....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And never hear the end of the story? Not likely. You don't like loose ends. Compared to some of these things you've done to make a case, a little loss of composure is nothing.\" Joker smiled. \"Show me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" Sae let out a stray cry. \"But...no one can know. If the camera sees...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then be discreet. I mean, if your worried now, just think what might slip out if your friends try interrogating me again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSae glared and opened her mouth in protest, then closed it and blushed in frustration. Slowly she withdrew a picture from her briefcase, moving it face down across the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well.\" Joker said, looking over the picture. \"Your shadow's little black dress made it clear you have a nice body, Niijima-san. But I had no idea it was this nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes. Enjoy your little joke. Now, let's move on-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This one little picture isn't really enough, you know. Especially these little censor bars. I'm sure you have others. You've probably collected all the pictures people took, right? And I'm sure you have the originals on hand to boot. The uncensored ones?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely not! This is...you are the prisoner! I am the prosecutor! I will not be...be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoker just gave a knowing smile. Sae's face fell, realizing that she would not be able to intimidate her way out of this. With a trembling hand, she produced a folder that clearly bulged with unknown contents. Joker casually took the envelope, and began fishing out one picture at a time. He made a show of looking each one over closely, like a thief assessing a stolen good. He nodded, clucked his tongue, whispered softly to himself \"Interesting.\" or \"I had no idea.\". Sae stood by, waiting, seething, and blushing, her arms clutched tightly around his business suit. Picking up one photo, Joker let out a small laugh as he glanced between the picture and the woman. Turning it around he revealed Sae making a nearly identical pose, except the picture was crossing her arms to hide her glorious breasts. Sae blanched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't let the camera see!\" She begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't. I'm being very careful, I promise. A gentleman thief knows how to be discreet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A g-gentleman is hardly a term I would use to describe what you are doing!\" Sae shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point. So how did it happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I'm...I'm not...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have much time. You should start talking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not the one under interrogation!\" Sae snapped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turnabout is fair play. Think of it as a chance for me to relax my mind a little so I can remember more detail later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makoto no doubt already informed you of the details. You clearly know what-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have some information. But I'll need your account to present my case. Please, won't you tell me what happened?\" Joker said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSae blushed. The prisoner was clearly enjoying himself, and the odd lilt to his words made it clear he was mocking her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't have time to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ANSWER ME!\" Joker said in a high pitched tone, placing both hands on the table in clear mimicry of Sae's own demanding pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....I...I don't sound like that.\" Sae whispered, slowly taking her seat across from him. Her hands were clutched in her lap. \"You...you promise it won't leave this room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Like I said, discreet.\" Joker smiled, a look of reassurance hidden under miles of smug glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-Fine!\" Sae said at last.</span></div></div>",

Her head was pounding, and even the simple gesture slowly raising her head off the sleek black table that had been serving as her pillowcase was overwhelmingly painful. She wondered to herself what she had been drinking last night strong enough to give her such a hangover. It wasn't her habit to pursue alcohol as a remedy for her troubles or even in celebration of her victories. Far less getting black out drunk. But what else could it be? Her recollections were anemic at best, and the dream of her interrogation of the legendary phantom thief was still more vivid in her mind than what had followed in her waking hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd speaking of the dream...Sae was getting a strong sense of deja vu...the most ominous sort of deja vu she could imagine. This...WAS the interrogation room, wasn't it? The walls, the table, the hard wooden chairs....all identical. Was she still sleeping? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy was she sittting where Joker had sat? Prosecutors weren't meant to be on this side of the table...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sae Niijima?\" A authoritative voice called from the shadowy corners of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Sae confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tall man in a black suit and a large square jaw stepped into her vision. She closed her eyes as the image blurred, another stabbing headache disorienting her. That was the man from the interrogation, one of thugs who had beaten on her suspect before she arrived. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back.\" The man said with disinterest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yes. Thank you. I apologize. I must have fallen asleep...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to apologize. How are you feeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frankly, quite awful. I'm having trouble getting my bearings. Where are we? Why...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it slow. You know better than most folks how the serum affects people....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The serum. Yes. You'd injected him with some sort of truth serum. He could barely remember what had transpired for the past six months. I was...dreaming about that interview...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you do remember the interview.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! We had captured the Phantom Thief suspected of stealing the hearts of various illicit individuals...and of course you idiots immediately began drugging him up and beating him for information. Honestly, I've seen gentler tactics from the Yakuza! I'm amazed I got any information at all out of him after that! You do realize that any information obtained that violates his rights is utterly useless in court, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My job, Mrs. Nijiima, is to get answer out of people. The folks looking for those answers sometimes need the information faster than the law allows, and in those situations they aren't particular about how they get them or whether they will stand up in court. This is one of those situations, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething finally clicked in Sae's mind. Although the room was the same, the temperature was different. It had been oppressively hot when she had spoken with the Joker. Now it was cold. Almost freezing. As if she was wearing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSae yelped in horror as it finally clicked that she was entirely naked. Outraged, embarrassed and humiliated, the prosecutor pushed her knees up to her chest and hugged herself, hiding her nudity from the man who was giving her a leering grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the meaning of this???\" Sae demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...here. Why don't you tell me?\" The man sneered, fishing a cell phone from his pocket and playing a video.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it came crashing back to her. She had finished the interrogation in her dreams, and somehow had been convinced to help the Phantom Thief escape with a little subterfuge against Akechi and some minor intimidation with the lone guard on duty. So the Phantom Thieves had inducted her into their circle, and found a new target in the form of Prime Minister Shido. They made the announcement publically, delivering the first ever live broadcast as their calling card. The police and their puppet masters had been outraged. She had feigned mental influence, pretending as if she had no memory of that night. Of course there had been backlash, vague threats of taking responsibility for the situation, an escort out of the building to the interrogation room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterrogation....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You son of a bitch!\" Sae cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, Miss Niijiima. What did you think would happen? Were you thinking this process would be any kinder to you than it was for him? Especially when the kid and his little cult have upgraded from making artists cry and taking down drug dealers to threatening the most powerful man in the country? Did you think a traitor like you was going to get off light when we need the little terrorist's location before he carries out his threat? Or that my bosses were kidding about making you an example?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know anything! Give me back my clothes, now!\" Sae demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, I'm actually inclined to believe you. Even if your mind control story is BS, and I'm pretty sure it is, I figure a nice smart lady who's been on this side of the interrogation a long time would know to keep her distance from learning information that could compromise her little thief's guild. I'm betting your completely out of the loop when it comes to where they are or how they plan to take Mr. Shido's heart. But we gotta be sure. And of course there's the other part. Its one thing for a brat like that Joker guy to be rebellious. He's a kid, he doesn't know any better. But you, Miss Niijiima. Your a full grown woman. You've worked in this system long enough to know your place. Yet here you are, acting rebellious and defiant towards your betters. The bosses would like me to remind you, throughly, who is in charge here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be serious.\" Sae gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately for you, Miss Niijima, my bosses are very old fashioned. They like things a certain way. Me, I have no particular problem with a woman with ambition who questions authority. But these guys, they have a preferred hierarchy to these things. The old men who have always run the country should keep running the country. They prefer their women to be useful, as you've been, but docile. Reliable, obedient, good at taking orders and happy with their place on the lower rungs of this business. You get results, but you have ambitions they don't like. Girls questioning authority is bad enough. Your sister annoys the hell out of them. But she at least is enough of a good girl that don't pay too much attention. Now you? You have her pride and stubborness, and enough of her sense of decency to be of concern, but the thing that actually scares the old boys? You are ruthless. You hate losing, you hate weakness, and you are ruthless when there is something you want. Someone like you could be a threat. So it falls to me to make sure you know what happens when you cross the bosses, and that tonight you lose so hard you don't dare take that risk again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you think torturing a professional prosecutor is the same as what you did to the boy I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax. No one is going to torture you. Heh. Not exactly. See, the bosses don't want you harmed in a way that could come up in court. Besides, they still have that good old boy 'never hurt a woman' mentality. Like I said, old fashioned. No, this is more about putting you in your place. Less pain, more humiliation. No one will be threatening to break your bones or lay a hand on you. A paddle? Sure. But not a hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSae turned pale. What was he plotting?</span></div></div>",

In the aftermath of the conviction, the duo had decided there was nothing wrong with having a little celebration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was how Sae Niijima found herself in a bar in downtown Tokyo with the original Detective Prince, Naoto Shirogane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really can't thank you enough for your help in there.\" Sae said, offering the detective a rare smile over her glass. \"I'm not sure I would have won the case without you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no need for thanks, Niijima-san.\" Naoto replied, idly sipping at her own cocktail. \"Seeing justice done is its own reward, after all. Though I won't deny that the drink is a nice little extra reward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two shared a chuckle at that. Their relationship had started out strictly professional, perhaps even a bit adversarial. Both were talented agents of justice, and both had their pride that made it difficult for them to acknowledge the skills of the other. Time had been the deciding factor in warming relations between the two of them, and while they weren't exactly close friends, there was evidence that such a thing could become the truth in due time. Besides, as far as Sae was concerned, Naoto was an exceptional ace-in-the-hole for a number of cases. In fact, the famed detective might be just the ally she needed to figure out exactly who the Phantom Thieves really were and how they operated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Shirogane, I know we just finished a case, but I was wondering if you'd be interested in another proposal.\" Sae began. It was best to be at least somewhat professional when broaching the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Phantom Thieves, correct?\" Naoto asked, correctly guessing Sae's intentions. \"We can discuss the idea of having me contribute to the investigation at a later date. For now, I'd much prefer if we could simply keep business and pleasure separate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSae nodded somewhat sheepishly. \"Of course. Now's not the time for that kind of talk, is it? My apologies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto simply shrugged off Sae's apology. \"Nothing to apologize for, after all-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, is that really...? It is! Naoto!\" came a voice, interrupting the detective's reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Sae and Naoto looked up from their conversation to see-</span></div></div>",

Well known among residents of the Shinjuku area for her street corner tarot readings and exorbitantly priced protection charms. She grew up as a simple country girl who developed a reputation for extremely accurate forecasts of impending disasters, which led the rural populous of her village to believe she was blessed and later cursed by the gods, a superstition that eventually inspired a mob to burn her house down and forced her to flee to the big city. Not long after her arrival in Tokyo she was indoctrinated into the group known as the Assembly of the Divine Power, or the ADP, an organization of supposedly divinely inspired mediums who provide divinations of the future to clientele for a hefty price. Mifune's skills as a fortune teller allowed her to rise quickly in the ranks of this organization as their 'Maiden of Relief'. Despite that high station, Mifune recently chose to cut all ties with the group, citing allegations that its leadership was making use of some unknown drug to brain wash and control the minds of its membership. You seem to put a great deal of stock in her extra-sensory talents, despite her association with such a group. And yet not even her cards could help her avert suffering such a humiliating fate.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Welcome to the Persona 5 ENF interactive. If you have participated in some of the other excellent ENF interactives, including several from the Persona series, you will already understand how this works and can move right to the next section. Otherwise, please read on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh yes, and just to state the obvious for the sake of posterity, THESE CHAPTERS WILL INCLUDE SPOILERS FOR THE VIDEO GAME. If you haven't played the game (and you should, it is as good if not better than the previous games in the series) please do so before reading further. It will give you a better understanding of the setting and the characters. Plus it supports the hard work of the people at Atlus, without whom we would have no female characters to write about and humiliate. So do that, and come back here to share your ideas! Thanks!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPERSONA: This interactive is set in a video game setting known as Shin Megami Tensei: Persona, or just the Persona series. Persona 5 is the fifth major title in this series (okay, technically it is the 6th if you factor in Persona 2's two games, and I'm not even bothering to count all the special editions and spinoff titles....let's just keep it simple!). The games all take place in the same universe (for the sake of simplicity, we won't be thinking too hard about Persona 1 and especially Persona 2 since it basically ended and rebooted the universe). The series generally deals with concepts pulled from Jungian psychology- to wit that the human mind is made up of various archetypes and that our myths tap into psychological traits shared by all humanity since the start of civilization. In the Persona verse, these archetypes manifest as Personas (masks people wear to deal with the traumas of day to day life, similar to the concept of the Ego) and Shadows (desires and thoughts that the mind rejects and suppresses in the subconscious). Both Personas and Shadows are broken into varying Arcanas loosely based on the Tarot Deck. The human collective unconscious (also called the Sea of the Human Soul) is a world unto itself, and the games typically explore the idea that some unknown manifestation of humanity's corrupted desires is working to influence the physical world in some unhelpful way. There are endless sub-realities in the Sea of Souls in which Shadows gather and Personas can manifest. Some of the these realities co-exist or touch upon the real world (such as a 'hidden hour' that most people aren't aware of, or a portal that certain people can open by touching a TV screen). Personas cannot generally be manifested in the real world (again, ignoring some of the implications from Persona 1 and 2), nor do shadows usually exist in the real world. But under the right circumstances (usually very bad, cataclysmic, fighting the final boss kind of circumstances) these mental realities can fully intrude on the physical world. The player usually is tasked with stopping such events. One rare example of a completely beneficial Unconscious reality is a place called the Velvet Room. It exists between dream and reality, mind and matter, and only opens to a talented guest, often one with a rare Wild Card talent for holding many personas inside their mind at once. The master of this world is called Philemon, a god-like entity that nurtures human potential and guides Persona Users. Since the second game, Philemon has manifested solely as a butterfly, leaving the affairs of the Velvet Room to Igor his creation and various subordinates that serve him known collectively as the Sisters of Power (even though there is at least one male among their \"sisters\"). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPERSONA 5: Every Persona game has their own themes and motifs. Persona 3 was all about living life and accepting the inevitability of death. Persona 4 was about seeking out the truth, even when it might be painful, and rejecting the excuses, lies and fantasies people tell themselves to avoid seeing the reality around them. Persona 5 is in large part about justice and captivity, and the bleary nature between the two, especially when society itself seeks to shackle and punish the innocent while protecting and empowering the corrupt and criminal to the point where the only possible form of justice left in the world requires stepping outside the bounds of the law. In more practical terms, P5 revolves around a group of Persona users called the Phantom Thieves, who discover a mental reality called a Palace, which congeals over the physical world based on the distorted desires of a single corrupt individual. These same users also learn that taking the Treasure of that reality will cause that corrupt person to regret and confess their crimes and abuses to the world. The game jumps deep into the gentleman thief/heist genre, with most of the Palaces being popular settings for such fiction (bank vaults, casinos, art museums, ancient tombs, etc.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease feel free to invent more corrupt villains and Palaces. If possible, think about the general themes of the game and of course the ENF genre when doing so. There's plenty of ideas to draw from. Wild West holdup, 1930s speakeasy, exclusive gentleman's club, hidden pirate cove, anything really. Generally have fun, but stories that stay somehow within those themes are greatly preferred (don't go bonkers and throw into some kind of sci-fi space station from a completely unrelated genre, that would just be...ummm...you know what, we're moving on!).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nENF: Simply put, ENF is a type of adult erotic story involving Embarrassed Nude Females. That's the (no pun intended) stripped down version of the story- girl loses in clothes in a way or place that makes her embarrassed at the situation. Broadly speaking, this genre appeals to and can crossover with Voyeurism, Exhibitionism, BDSM, humiliation, submission/dominance, bondage, and so on. What the genre does not often consist of is things like rape, sexual violence, vore, gorn, and similar stories. Now, some of this may feel ambiguous. I am aware that there are many grey areas in this context, and that my personal ENF stories and tastes might be more extreme than others in this community. Please email me if you are concerned that your story might cross a line (and I will try to warn you if I have misgivings about your content as well). As a general rule, public nudity (obviously), sexual arousal, being forced to strip for any reason short of being physically attacked, being spanked or whipped, any example of masturbation or self-gratification, getting caught on camera/posing naked, groping (unwanted or otherwise), and consenting sex of all kinds is never a problem. More than that is going to depend on context and generally just how you as a writer portray the situation and the characters. As a very specific in-game example, if what you want to happen in this story reminds the audience of what Kamoshida puts Shiho through in the opening portions of P5, then you have 100% crossed the line and need to scale it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, after that lengthy diatribe, let's get down to the ladies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn Takamaki: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://megamitensei.wikia.com/wiki/Ann_Takamaki\" target=\"_blank\">http://megamitensei.wikia.com/wiki/Ann_Takamaki</a> A blonde haired, blue eyed model of a mixed American, Japanese descent. Ann is by nature a care-free soul who saves her vindictive streaks for those who try to threaten or hurt her or those she cares about. She is perhaps a bit less shy than some of her female comrades due to her modeling career, able to for instance laugh off her friends lewd expressions at seeing her in a bikini. Still, she can be quite sensitive and embarrassed if she sports too much skin or is placed in too suggestive a manner (the catsuit she manifests in the Metaverse being too skintight for her liking). But if the stakes are high enough, Ann will very reluctantly get naked. For justice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto Niijiima <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://megamitensei.wikia.com/wiki/Makoto_Niijima\" target=\"_blank\">http://megamitensei.wikia.com/wiki/Makoto_Niijima</a> The president of the student council and younger sister to the prosecutor Sae Niijiima who intends to uncover the secret of the Phantom Thieves. Makoto has short brown hair and red eyes, combined with a good looking physique. She is a modest, intelligent student with a streak of naivete about how the real world works. Underneath the surface Makoto harbors frustration towards those who see her as either useless or just a pawn for their own schemes and longs to prove herself and walk her own path. That desire has proven useful in combat but also gotten headstrong Makoto into situations she could not easily extricate herself from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFutaba Sakura <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://megamitensei.wikia.com/wiki/Futaba_Sakura\" target=\"_blank\">http://megamitensei.wikia.com/wiki/Futaba_Sakura</a> The main navigator and computer specialist of the Phantom Thieves. A eccentric girl with waste length orange hair, thick 'nerdy' glasses, and a somewhat petite but very cute body. Futaba is on one hand a flippant, even crass girl steeped in the language and understanding of games and the internet. On the other hand, she has suffered from years of being a shy and guilt ridden shut in. The thieves have taken it upon themselves to 'train' her out of her crippling phobia of people and the public. Fair to say that being naked in public, while a humiliating situation for any of the girls, will be absolutely crippling for Futuba if she cannot find a way to cope with it. Hiding her face has worked in the past, as has the main male PC escorting her as her 'key item'. Course, the latter example would result in him seeing her naked, but one works with whatever they can find in these situations. Also worth noting, based on comments she makes in Mementos, that she finds the female Phantom Thieves costumes rather 'kinky'. Make of that what you will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaru Okumura <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://megamitensei.wikia.com/wiki/Haru_Okumura\" target=\"_blank\">http://megamitensei.wikia.com/wiki/Haru_Okumura</a> Born into riches and luxury but expected by her father to be meek and obedient, Haru has only recently discovered the joy of rebellion and rejecting what others expect of her. Not truly naive but not nearly savvy enough to differentiate true allies from those who want to use her for her influence and money, Haru has come to rely almost completely on the Phantom Thieves when it comes to who she can trust. She regards the others as mentors, especially Morgana. Much like Futaba, the thieves are the foil through which Haru is learning to be assertive and confident in herself...but that is a very long road.    Certain comments also suggest that Haru uses the fights with the Shadows as a method to stress relief and harbors a bit of a sadistic streak when they beg for their lives. What other secret thrills she might harbor in defiance of what is expected of her, or how she feels about other examples of people begging (including herself) can be left to the imagination and the writer.</td>",
