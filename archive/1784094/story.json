So I am going to say screw the contest if you want to make your own version of the lore do it.  Just leave a space if another person whats to make a different type of ghoul.  So the first choice is the original lore, The second space is my version and all the other spaces are for the lores of other people.  Ok go crazy.</span></div></div>",

You can make third way to be turned but make it reasonable.<br>\r\n2.\tGhouls must eat flesh (preferable human) to live, however how they need much per week, month, year, or if the need to eat flesh drops or grows the longer you are a ghoul and if you eat other foods is up to you.<br>\r\n3.\tThe finally item that they are night creatures they are more powerful in the shadows<br>\r\nLeave information about your ghoul for each way it can be turned, here is an example:<br>\r\nHumans who are bitten and become a ghoul have gray hair yellow eyes and have decaying skin those who drink vamp blood look like they did before turning<br>\r\nLeave start stats for the ghoul\u2019s strength speed intelligent and charm (if they are not decaying).  Rate the stat from one to ten with 5 being the status of the average human EX: 5+ means equals more then or equal to the average human<br>\r\nCan your ghoul become or make people pregnant (depends on gender the gender of the ghoul)?<br>\r\nAre there factors that make a half ghoul?<br>\r\nIs your can your ghoul live forever or does it still have a life line<br>\r\nWeaknesses, you may never know when you need to kill another ghoul<br>\r\nYour own crap that will dependently separate your lore from another<br>\r\n Rules of the story: your characters must start as human then ghouls or half ghouls when they meet a person around their age of the opposite gender who turn them.<br>\r\nuse real states and countries but not real twons and buildings<br>\r\nNo ending the story<br>\r\nThere is no growing, shrinking, weight gain, transformation (unless you consider turning into a ghoul a transformation) giants, giantess, cock vore, anal vore, bring fictional characters to life, age changes, gay or leisbain (unless another person of the opposite sex is there and you team up to rape them) toilet, poop, crap or willing vore (unless the person you will eat is begging you kill them becuase you are torturing them in a way).  But you can have sex, rape and hard or soft vore<br>\r\nyour characters starts by visit the grave of a relative<br>\r\nprewrite your paper for spelling errors and please keep it shorter then three pages on Microsoft word when double space with the normal body caption and 12 font.<br>\r\nNo killing the main starting character unless he dies of old age and you continue as one of his/her kids. <br>\r\nThe characters to pick from must one teenage boy, one teenage girl, a man 20 to 35, a woman 20 to 35, and one character for other writers to make and please leave names<br>\r\nIf you want a hybrid make a child with a human or another monster and continue as the child.<br>\r\nLast rule I like to use the maximum amount of options as possible please do the same.<br>\r\nI know I am a little strict on the rules but please bear with them and have fun.</span></td>",
