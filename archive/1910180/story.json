Jack had just laid off from his job, maybe it was a good thing that his apartment lease was about to run out. Given he wouldn't have a place to stay but at least he wouldn't be tied to a lease that he didn't have the money to pay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he gets a text message from his friend Tony, \"Hey man, wanna get a beer after work?\" Jack then smiles, \"Beer yes, but it's already after work for me.\" he replies, Tony then responds, \"Oh no, what happened?\" to which he responded, \"Layoffs...\" Tony then replied, \"Okay how about beers at 6, on me?\" Jack then laughs and replies, \"Thanks man, see you then.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jack asks, as it sinks in that he could actually get turned into a girl<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well not only would those requests involve a level of magic that i am currently unable to perform but even so it is not my kind of magic, my magic deals with contracts, Altering a consenting souls physical form is one thing, but making a random girl fall for you or getting another random person to give you a job is another, so for now this is what i am proposing.\" she says</span></div></div>",

Not wanting to deal with the attention that'd come being overlooked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, he was concerned that she couldn't be as pretty as she could manage. Her drink addled senses worked overtime to give Jackie Taylor Heart just the kind of body that Jackson would approve of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoft whimpers spilled from her lips, as her curves ripened beyond the contracted agreement. As Jackie went beyond Lewis' dream woman. Murmurring and mewling, Jackie's breasts grew from <b>C</b>-cup, racing past <b>D... E.... F....</b> and settling at a shoulder straining <b>G</b>-cup. Such a blessed woman would need a counter balance for that bust. Jackson's jeans looked painted on. Even though her clothes adjusted to her expanded dimensions, she was lusher than a sober Jackie would like, even if a drunk Jackson was still fantasizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squirmed in her seat, a plusher rump beneath her than she'd ever experienced before. Drowsing, she glimpsed Lewis through sleepy, heavy-lidded eyes. A smile spreading across her face, a vague recollection that things were all right now, settled into his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only as Jackie struggled closer to proper consciousness, that the details sprang into focus. Along with the odd feelings coming from her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes snapped wide, taking it all in once everything fell into horrific place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErupting from the seat, she stood there taking in the new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c5/b0/59/c5b059a6993c1062da1fb72e00b07521.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c5/b0/59/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jeans and top were familiar, if tailored differently.

But, he still was afraid he'd be tempted to sleep with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jackson slept, he was transforming. Drawing from his subconscious mind, to dress and act as Jackson would choose to. Jackie was doomed to become a reluctant male fantasy... Her own self image defined by a residual male regret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to cripple his chances for getting a job. Jackson was happy for Jackie to be attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewling in protest, she knew she'd have to tweak her look to please Lewis. She made it so that Jackie would be happy and comfortable wearing womens' clothes. Jackson wished for Jackie to be busty enough to please Lewis. But for herself, Jackson loved the idea of giving her a feature that would counter this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie was unaware of how this would affect her on waking. She just smiled softly to herself. Every piece of art, every attempt at perfection required her porcelain flaw. As Jackie drowsed she was unaware of the swelling of her ass. Far riper, far juicier, far too lush for anyone to bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe woke slowly, eyes blinking as the morning light streamed in through a gap in the curtains. Looking away from the blinding light, Jackie's eyes struggled to focus, their first view filled with her own cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe groaned softly to herself, remembering the deal. The price of a roof over her head. She was certain Lewis couldn't object to such a fantastic deep cleavage. She tried not to fantasise about getting a well-cushioned tit-wank. Now she'd be giving them instead. The image from Jackson's own wank-bank was too detailed as Jackie tried to dismiss it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer first time in a bikini was oddly normal. The freedom to dress as she chose, and be at ease in this body was coming back to haunt her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only as she rose to her feet that she felt the width of her hips. Another groan, knowing this was part of the price. But, as she got to her feet. She found she was more than a little broader in the beam. She was blessed with an ass that belonged on a horse. The drowsy thoughts of a porcelain flaw had given her an ass that'd be impossible to ignore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f8/5b/1a/f85b1ac9a1c53995e5a6014eced05b2a.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f8/5b/1a/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe comfort she'd wanted for her new body, felt too much. Surely an ass that magnificent deserved some type of reaction. Jackie certainly hated the drunk Jackson with a cold furious passion.</span></div></div>",
