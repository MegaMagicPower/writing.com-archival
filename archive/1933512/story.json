            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Thus she was back home in the states before she got to try to sate her excitement. She hadn't even unpacked before she locked herself in her room and opened the book, that's when it hit her how tough the language really was, this Old English was no joke and the handwriting didn't exactly help, so she called Mandy over and from her got that Amy was back from Salem as well.<br>\r\nTurned out that Salem was more of a tourist attraction than the place to find the real deal, they did have a few well dressed enthusiasts though, but that was about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them thus started transcribing the book that very night. Bethany flipping the pages and Amy trying to help her make out the handwriting, while Mandy wrote it down on the computer. Even if they didn't get every word and thought the grammar was funky they had no trouble determining that this book contained some freaky shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo days later Bethany had still not unpacked and the three of them had gathered in the school library, not that the school had started or anything, but they needed help translating some of the words and there were old English dictionaries here, not to be borrowed though, which sort of forced them to come here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether they managed to figure out that the beginning of the book was some kind of ritual, it looked interesting enough and a lot of the ingredients and items that would have been hard to come by back in the day were nothing hard to come by this day and age. So they figured why not try it out? <br>\r\nThus when they found something required they made note of it and once they had translated the whole ritual and come to the conclusion that it was supposed it unlock their witches' powers they were eager to try it out. What if it would work?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the things they could get at the supermarket and the trickier things the local New Age hippie could help them with. <br>\r\nThat just left engraving various symbols on the items required, it turned out Mandy was the most artistic of them, but she refused to do all three of the wooden sticks required, since there was to be one for each participant and judging by the book and the one Mandy had started on they looked pretty much like wands, so she was probably right, a witch should make her own wand and so they did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat left them with; Where to perform the ritual? <br>\r\nThey would need to be able to set it up in privacy and from the looks of it, it might take a couple of hours to perform.<br>\r\nIn the end they settled for Amy's walk in closet, it was larger than the other two's put together, so after removing and rearranging most of the stuff in it they had still not a lot of room, but enough they figured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandy being the one with most skill with the brush painted the various symbols and circles on the floor while Beth handled the burning of various substances and Amy led the whole thing and did the somewhat quiet chanting so that they wouldn't be overheard.<br>\r\nLuckily Mandy had remembered to make sure all fire alarms on the floor were disabled before they started because it was quite smoky inside the closet by the time the ritual was over and the girls waited for something to happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smoke didn't feel like fire smoke though, but it smelled and looked the part. Strangely it seemed to thicken and slowly concentrate to within the circles on the floor, then they all gasped as the outer circle started to shimmer slightly then the next and the next and then all the symbols started shimmering as well and then the smoke it self, that by now looked like a solid black arch, brightened until it shone in a dark blue light.<br>\r\nLooking down they saw that all the items they had placed out around the circles were gone except for their three wands, Amy managed to see the last of the hippie crystals melt away and flow like ink into the weave of circles and symbols and then their wands jerked and the engraved symbols they had carved into them shone for a few seconds before the wands went dull and still again. Now nothing seemed to change, the Arch inside the circles remained vaguely shimmering but nothing more. Mandy reached out and touched it, but her hand just went straight through, nothing seemed to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBethany picked up her wand and waved it at the portal with no more result, so she poked it with her wand and as the tip hit the blue surface the point of impact shone bright blue, like a summer sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake your wands girls.\u201d She grinned and stepped towards the arch, and unlike Mandy's arm that had just gone through it, she seemed to go into it in a flash of light and be gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls remaining watched nervously at each other and then at the dark blue shape in front of them. They took their wands in one hand and the other one's hand in the other, then with a nod they too walked into the arch and found themselves in a market stall selling cheap dresses of questionable quality. They saw Bethany waiting for them with a grin and behind them an, as far as they could tell, identical portal to the one they gone through in Amy's walk in closet, half inside the stall and half outside it, the tent fabric wall flopping through it without any noticeable impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the stall they could see a busy makeshift street packed on both sides with stalls and over head a bright blue summer sky with the sun riding high. It seemed that they had jumped straight into a market, people appeared to be dressed oddly enough, but there wasn't really a general style, nor a common nationality as far as they could tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's that?\u201d Amy wondered and pointed towards a man that looked like your normal helium balloon market vendor, but it would seem he wasn't selling balloons, but flying pigs of various sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that explains what the ritual meant by 'opening the door to the realm of possibility'.\u201d Bethany said with a huge grin on her face. \u201cWe did get our door, right?\u201d</span></div></div>",

She doesn't look too happy, perhaps the price was steep, but then as she walks away Mandy almost stumble over her own feet as she watches the girl shove the whole pig into her mouth and then slurp the string in like a piece of spaghetti.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy then she has made her way to the vendor, so with a couple of quick steps she manages to catch up with the girl and puts a hand on her shoulder to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me miss, could I listen to your tummy to see if I could hear the pig squeal in there?\u201d Mandy asks noticing that despite the relatively large pig that just went into it, the girls trim belly is completely flat, not counting abdominals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, my pleasure.\u201d The girl answers and her expression changes from surprised and bothered to giddy. Then Mandy find the girl's hands on her upper arms and the next moment she finds that the girl isn't just surprisingly strong, she also finds out what the piglet went through just seconds earlier, as the girl's mouth opens impossibly wide and before she manages to protest she's looking down the dark tunnel of the girl's throat. Lips closing around her shoulders and a greedy swallow dragging her into her waist, a second one quickly follows, pulling in her hips and rump and a third one along with gravity and suction from the girl sends the rest of Mandy down into the girl's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandy's friends had overheard the conversation and watched on, while they tried to make their way over in time, as their friend got eaten, but before they managed to even get her attention Mandy was simply gone, making no more imprint in the girl's frame than the piglet had and the girl being unaware of them resumed her stroll.<br>\r\nWith the girl obviously being a lot stronger than what one would expect of a girl the two students following her had quite a difficult task catching up to her as she navigated the throng of people crowding the streets while the two in pursuit were held up at every turn.<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes though Beth managed to reach out and grasp the girl's arm, something that made the girl turn and give her a very annoyed look.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMandy just wanted to listen to your stomach, not be inside it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know put her ear against it and listen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh... She should have phrased herself better then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo can you please throw her up then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKind of hard, she'd need to be in my stomach for that.\u201d She girl said pointing to just below her left pert breast. \u201cBut she's about here now.\u201d She added pointing to her belly well below her belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou digested her that quickly?!\u201d Beth said shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I was pretty hungry, but I could only afford a little piglet, so I didn't question my luck when your friend offered herself to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth and Amy just stared dumbstruck, they struggled to grasp the fact that this girl had just eaten Mandy like a cookie and digested her like cotton candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess we'll need to find a toilet then, I assume you want her back.\u201d The girl continued, taking little notice of the girls' states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut she'll just be your poop...\u201d Beth said realising that she was thankful the girl turned out to be fairly friendly seeing as she could have easily sent her and Amy to join Mandy as parts of her next bowel movement.<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, so you'll need to find a good healer, you don't want a quack, unless you want her brought back half pig, half girl, or just get the piglet back, seeing as she's well mixed with that piglet I ate just before her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...\u201d Amy and Beth managed as they realised that other impossible things were possible here, not just flying pigs and literal maneaters, but resurrection as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm...I almost forgot we'll need a container as well...\u201d The girl said brooding for all of two seconds. \u201cI think there's a vendor selling jars over here she said and grasped Beth's arm dragging the girl through the crowd.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't far, but once there Beth could see that there were no large jars on the table, only various relatively small ones ranging from simple plain ones without lids to exceedingly elaborate ones.<br>\r\n\u201cWon't we need a bigger container?\u201d She wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, just one to fit the solid waste, the rest is just water and not essential.\u201d The girl assured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, so what currency to you use here, I've only got dollars.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDollars?\u201d The girl looked like she'd never heard of it. \u201cPure metal coins, or just the metals themselves, so gold, silver and copper is typically it, unless you want to trade items and haggle. Tell you what, since it was a misunderstanding, I'll pay for the jar.\u201d The girl said and scrutinized the available containers and their prices. Beth noticing that the girl studied the plain and obviously cheaper ones, she even picked up a couple and looked inside, before putting it back. Then she placed a hand on her belly and closed her eyes, brows frowning in concentration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust making sure she's properly digested.\u201d The girl said and resumed what she was doing.<br>\r\nA couple of minutes later she stopped and prodded her lower belly then picked up a plain clay jar far smaller than the ones she'd looked at earlier and looked inside it, then called the vendor, before exchanging a few coins with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen before Beth could ask any-more questions she was once again dragged through the streets with Amy struggling to keep up with them falling ever further behind.<br>\r\nThen a couple of turns later the open market stalls gave way to stone walled buildings and at the corner of one of those the girl opened a thick wooden door and dragged Beth inside, had they not scaled a couple of steps in doing so Amy would have lost them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Beth found herself in what much looked like a public toilet, with lots of stalls that didn't quite offer full privacy, only it looked like a medieval fantasy game version of the same, with stone walls and think wooden doors to the stalls, the wash basins too being in solid stone and instead of faucets a continuous stream of water shot out through a small whole like a miniature waterfall and disappeared down the drain. <br>\r\nWhile she took it all in the girl had vanished into one of the stalls and soon returned with the small jar, lid now closed and fastened. She handed the jar to Beth before going over to the waterfall to wash her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two headed out of there Amy just reached the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo where can we find a good healer?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNearly all healers, good and bad can be found by the temples, worshipping one deity or another.\u201d The girl said before she jumped down the stairs and turned to face Beth and Amy one last time. \u201cGive her my thanks, she was very tasty and quite filling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the girl was lost in the crowd and Amy and Beth were left looking at one another and then looking at the very small jar that contained the remains of their friend, the whole jar was smaller than Beth's fist, it boggled the mind that the girl had reduced their friend to something that'd fit inside it.</span></div></div>",

But what would temples look like? She knew two things, the market was huge, the buildings straight across to the other side were almost lost in the haze rising from the market between her and them and looked tiny from this distance. She also realized that she could only make out parts of the edges of the market, not to mention that the temples didn't necessarily lie around the market at all, that was just what she'd initially assumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you see anything?\u201d Amy wondered as Beth stopped jumping. Bethany was the taller of them, so Amy didn't much fancy her chances of seeing anything if Beth hadn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot much, I think we'll have to ask around. At least I saw a few weird things that we can use for navigational purposes. I also realized that this market might not be the whole of it, what is there's a temple ground somewhere else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMight not be a bad thing.\u201d Amy answered. \u201cThe market is crowded and hopefully other streets won't be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue enough.\u201d Beth admitted before turning to a passing man. \u201cExcuse me sir...\u201d She said while managing to get his annoyed attention. \u201c...Could you tell me where to find a temple of healing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning he pointed across the market. \u201cTry the Hallowed Hill of the Grove of Regrowth. They are both that way.\u201d Before storming off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Beth called after him. \u201cDamn\u201d she added with emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou've got any idea how big this market is?\u201d Beth asked and Amy shook her head. \u201cAnd I didn't see any forest or even a hill in that direction. No doubt it's a looong way there. The question is should we trudge through this crowded market, that's probably a mile or more across, or hope that it's easier to go around it and try that instead?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With the direction they had gotten being anything but precise they figured that they should just make it across to the other side before asking for more specific directions.<br>\r\nLuckily they found that the dense crowd they had been stuck in was only an occasional occurrence, most of the time there were still quite a bit of people but one could easily flow with the tide one way or the other.<br>\r\nAnd at times when things stood still they could pass the time by paying more attention to the stalls around them. The market in many ways resembled that of your normal town square market, during some festival or other, with the difference of the variety of the wares. The obligatory toy weapons were there, but the range went all the way to real ones as well. Same thing with the obligatory vegetables and fruits ranging all the way to finished products and living animals, and many of varieties neither girl had seen before. Wicker baskets were there and so were top notch backpacks and what for the life of them they assumed were at least supposed to be magical bags and boxes, judging from their intricate d\u00e9cor. <br>\r\nAs they walked along plain plastic bracelets of florescent colours made way for ones made of noble metals engraved with works of art and then back again. Likewise every type of garment seemed to be available at one stall or another from funny hats to fancy hats, from underwear to overcoats and from t-shirts to formal wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they trudged along at times they could hear crowds cheering or gasping in awe, or even booing at times, though the former two seemed to be more common, so clearly there were market performers, games  and shows as well, though luckily none in their path. Only browsers and hagglers and content customers seemed to occupy the makeshift streets they choose as they zigzagged across the mostly cobbled ground towards the other side of the market, a track that took them over an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all that time it felt pretty weird to see the market-stalls give way to conventional buildings, these ones in stone as well like the ones they had left an hour ago, though these ones looked a bit more elaborate. And down the streets between then the throng of people thinned out significantly, so they continued down to a crossroad before stopping to ask anyone, quite eager to get away form the stifling heat of the market, not to mention the deafening choir of voices from the people there and some of their wares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they stood there enjoying the slight breeze blowing down one of the streets of the crossing an older man who'd also left the market came down the same way they had moments ago and approached their position, pulling a one-wheeled contraption behind him that seemed to house his purchased wares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me sir...\u201d Amy started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm no sir.\u201d The man objected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, pardon me then, me and my friend were wondering where we could find a good healer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well. The druids of the Grove are down that way.\u201d He said pointing down one of the roads. \u201cThey are at the edge of the city. Good healers amongst them, but they are not the most sociable lot. Don't count on them helping you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, but we heard of some Hallowed Hill, would our chances be better there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure enough, plenty of healers there as well and more forthcoming, no doubt, just be wary of the quacks who seem to crowd the place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe'll keep that in mind, so where can we find it, if you don't mind telling us?\u201d Beth joined in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's over there.\u201d The man said pointing with his whole arm. \u201cJust walk down this street and eventually you should be able to spot the temple of Hela's copper roof bristling in the sunlight between the houses as it lies atop the hill.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren't copper roofs green?\u201d Amy wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUsually yes, but this is a temple of healing we're talking about, so it's not the place for decay.\u201d The man smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you very much.\u201d Both girls said and turned to one another as the man went on his merry way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere were they to go?</span></div></div>",

The hill obviously weren't that high, but still fairly distinct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as they approached their destination they noticed how the people in the street changed from normal to either religious variants, or either sickly or injured. With the odd one looking fairly normal amongst them standing out from the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeems we're heading for the right place.\u201d Amy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but none look as bad as Mandy. She said and held up the clay jar.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm...About that, we haven't looked inside. What if it's empty?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it does look a bit small...though the girl seemed too helpful to trick us like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetter make sure right?\u201d Amy said and fiddled for her cellphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose we'd look really silly showing up with an empty jar, even if the kind of healing we're looking for still seems quite far fetched.\u201d Beth agreed and worked open the lid to have a look inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo both the girls surprise there was a brown lump in it, but it was too small to call a turd, being only somewhat larger than a golf-ball. <br>\r\nThen Amy surprised Beth by producing her phone and taking a couple of pictures of the jar and its contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do that for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI figured that if this works Mandy would like a picture of herself.\u201d Amy said realising that if it didn't work out that this would be the last pictures of her friend. \u201cA shame I forgot to take pictures of the girl that did this to her.\u201d She added, she'd hardly gotten a good look at the girl herself, having been to busy chasing her.<br>\r\n\u201cAl-right\u201d Beth nodded looking down at the remains of Mandy one last time. The smell wasn't that potent, but still there and distinct for the type of material it consisted of, so Beth put the lid back on and made sure to fasten it properly. \u201cLet's hope this works.\u201d She said and started walking towards the hill again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was soon apparent what the people had said about the quacks around the place, many were quite blatant, while others were smooth talkers selling potions and whatnot and some again horribly convincing, but they weren't even at the foot of the hill yet, so the girls figured that they should continue on.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Since the girls look neither sickly, nor injured the various healers and do gooders leave them alone, unaware of what the girls are looking for. Hence it's quite the easy track through the crowd of wailing people to the top of the hill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were a bit surprised to see the temple surrounded by a white stone wall and the gates under guard. In Shining white robes and curiass, helmet and halberd the same colour as the roof two guards step forward to block their path. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHalt!\u201d The two middle-aged men call out in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls do as commanded. And Beth noticing that beyond the gates hardly anyone walks the temple grounds, a stark contrast to the sickly crowd outside. \u201cWe're seeing the aid of the healers of Hela.\u201d Beth says remembering the name the old man had used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou do not look neither sickly nor injured.\u201d One of the guards state, looking them over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's our friend that needs help and we come here in her name.\u201d Beth continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe that as it may.\u201d The guard said and looked the two girls over, they looked quite fresh and clean unlike the crowd behind them, a bit sweaty from their journey here, but no more than the guards were from standing in the sun for a few hours, he couldn't dismiss them on those grounds. \u201cSearch them.\u201d He ordered the other guard who put his halberd aside and proceeded to frisk the girls, much to their displeasure as he didn't leave any part of their body unchecked. Then proceeded to check the contents of their purses, making both girls worry about their keys, which looked for all the world like wands, engraved in cryptic runes and all. But the guard didn't seem to care about those, though he paid a few other things more attention like their house keys and Amy's tiny can of hairspray. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't object to any of the contents though and put it all back before giving them an all clear and going back to his halberd and his post. A nod to the other guard was all that followed and the two stepped aside to let the girls pass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit bewildered the girls wearily pass the guards and enter the open expanse in front of the temple. Seeing as the clergy should be inside they ignore the people walking about the temple grounds and head up the wide, but not overly tall stairs that end in a second man-made level upon which the actual temple is built. A second much smaller but richly ornamented stair leads to the open brazen gates of the temple that could compete with any cathedral, except for in height as it stands only a a handful stories tall, barely cresting the tallest trees on the temple grounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walk inside they find a great hall with ivory pillars sprouting like a forest upwards and supporting a richly painted roof far above. Paintings hard to discern in the gloom. The pale white figures that smoothly flow across the floor in one way or another are more easy to make out. They aren't many but they seem to be well in majority. The girls had expected to find more people in here if this was a place of healing considering the vast hoard of people in need outside the gates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly the the white robed people are the followers of the deity in question, monks and nuns both seem wrong as there seem to be both sexes and the way their uniforms hug their figures clashes with the concept of celibacy one typically associate with the inhabitants of a cloister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walk further into the temple, slowly approaching the middle of this great hall, observing the coming and goings of the white figures, noticing amongst other things that they all appear young, no one looks to be older than thirty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey did come here with a task though, so whom should they approach with the subject?</span></div></div>",

Not a hard thing as none of them seems to be in any hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I help you miss?\u201d The man wonders, looking puzzled, possibly why she chose to approach him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were told this was the place to find a healer.\u201d Amy continued as she stepped up next to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed, what kind of healing is required? All the followers of Hela are familiar with the arts of her gifts, but some are more so than others.\u201d He inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat healing.\u201d Beth said, seeing his face change quite drastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...\u201d He said and motioned for the girls to follow him. \u201cIn that case I think you seek one of the Daughters of Hela.\u201d He started walking towards the back of the great hall. \u201cFollow me and say nothing unless spoken to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls fell silently in behind him and followed him through a door in the back into a series of corridors and up a couple of stairs only to once more head down a hallway before he turned around to face them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStay here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey did as told and watched him gently slide across the red carpeted floor towards a large wooden door that looked more brazen art than wood. There he stopped and gently placed his hands on either of the two halves of the large door. He didn't knock or say anything, he just stood there for a minute or so. Then softly, yet suddenly, the door swung open and in the portal stood a majestic woman towering at least a head over then man, who immediately fell to his knees, revealing more of the woman, who seemed as young as the rest of the white robed people they had seen, but her robes seemed to be stitched together in tasteful manners and decorated by brilliant copper threads, likewise her hair was hard placed in colour and decorated by items in such a way that it looked to be all made of their metal of choice, gleaming copper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft murmur passing between them was all the girls could distinguish before the man still kneeling slid backwards, got to his feet, bowed and disappeared down a sideway. The woman then stepped through the doorway into the hall and the doors closed on their own behind her. She motioned for the girls to follow her and then started her smooth walk down the opposite direction the man had went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't go far, with a smooth motion she opened a more normal sized door, though still tall enough that she had no trouble walking through it. As they caught up they found the door remained open while they entered, but closed on its own once they were inside. By then the woman had already seated herself in a plain yet both comfortable and expensive looking recliner.<br>\r\nA couple of meters in front of her lay a series of large pillows in a half circle and she motioned for the girls to take a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo young Brodas told me you came seeking the help of a great healer. Tell me about it.\u201d The woman said in a soft sultry voice that carried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur friend got eaten and digested in the market and we were told a good healer could help her.\u201d Beth answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh... well that might be so. Show me what remains.\u201d The woman said. And Beth fiddled with her purse, bringing the small jar out, but before she could get up to hand the jar to the woman the jar floated out of her hand and sailed through the air, landing softly between the Daughter's fingers. Likewise the lid came undone and removed itself on its own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas this friend of yours some pet creature of yours?\u201d The woman queried<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, she's a girl just like us, but the one that ate her had just eaten a flying piglet.\u201d Beth answered dutifully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see, then this predator did quite a number on your friend.\u201d The woman smirked, while the clay jar resealed itself.<br>\r\n\u201cHow do yo intend to pay for the service?\u201d The woman continued. An aspect the girls hadn't considered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we hadn't thought about that part...\u201d Amy stumbled. \u201c...I've got a golden necklace...\u201d She continued. \u201cIt's only eighteen carat, but twenty four is too soft for most jewellery.\u201d She said defensibly as she reached behind her neck to unclasp it, she'd gotten it for her birthday from a former boyfriend, so she didn't mind that much to part with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's good, but not enough.\u201d The woman continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI've got earrings that go with it.\u201d Amy continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing as that didn't look like enough Beth reluctantly joined in \u201cI've got silver earrings and my gold engagement-ring.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I don't think Mandy's gold belly piercing should be digested either, I doubt she minds parting with it, if you don't mind where it has been.\u201d Amy continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman had trouble not giggling at that, so with a somewhat warmer smile she agreed \u201cOkay, that will have to do.\u201d As she rose so did the mentioned jewellery as well. The lid of the jar only opening enough to let the small rod out. All of it floated to the woman's face before dropping into a bowl next to her chair that neither of the girls had noticed before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to an alter at the end of the room and stepping behind it, the girls turned and watched as the woman put the jar down in its center and the lid opened on its own once more.<br>\r\nRaising her hands the air crackled and heat pulsed from her location, then the air seemed to go dry while a mist formed around the priestess.<br>\r\nThat mist swirled around her and she seemed to manipulate it with her hands, slowly it condensed and as it did a darkness crept up and out of the jar and filled the mist, which then brightened until the girls had to shield their eyes. When they looked back Mandy was there kneeling naked on the altar looking like a child in front of the Daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe daughter didn't touch Mandy, but they could still see that it was her doing as their friend floated off the table over to them and landed on her feet before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease leave.\u201d The Daughter commanded. And at the same time Mandy seemed to wake up and finding out that she was naked. Her two friends rose up and reached an arm around her each as they led her out of the room while Mandy tried as best she could to cover herself.</span></div></div>",

They both give their sleeved short tops to Mandy and after some convincing Beth wiggles out of her pants and hand Mandy her panties as well before putting the pants on commando style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandy isn't too fond of accepting someone's used underwear but puts them on inside out while she wears Bethany's top on normally and ties Amy's larger top around her hips like a skirt of sorts. At least with the panties on she doesn't actually show anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus dressed they leave the temple.<br>\r\nThe guards recognise two of them seeing as it's the same guards and not that many have passed by as of late. They do lift an eyebrow each, but doesn't say anything and the girls pass by unhindered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside Mandy is faced with the less than pleasant crowd, that her two friends have already made their way through once. They know it ends and where too, so they head back the way they had come earlier until the sickly and grotesque are out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess not everyone gets help huh?\u201d Mandy says when they are through. \u201cHow did you do it?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGold.\u201d Was Amy's answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat seems to be the currency here, noble metals. We gave the priestess that healed you all we had, including your belly piercing.\u201d Bethany explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...\u201d Mandy said and looked at Bethany's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot your fault really, seriously, how were you to know that that girl would freaking eat you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, guess not, at any rate I don't recommend it. Getting digested is pretty painful, luckily she did it quickly.\u201d Mandy said trying to joke it away. \u201cI suppose we should be a bit careful in the future. And frankly I wouldn't mind heading back for some real clothes at least. Can I even get back? I mean that girl digested my wand too, which I assume was the key for the door.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think so\u201d Amy said. \u201cI mean we could bring our clothes and stuff with us, so why not a person?\u201d Then she added with a grin \u201cand if holding my hand won't do the trick I hear you are pretty delicious, so I wouldn't be against offering a ride.\u201d Amy said rubbing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaaaa... Not that funny.\u201d Mandy replied but couldn't help watching Amy's tummy while it was getting rubbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe girl told us to give you her thanks and tell you that you were tasty and pretty filling.\u201d Bethany said, explaining the reference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder...was I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTasty, probably, but filling? Considering you didn't make the slightest dent in her belly and the huge amount of waste you became, I'd say, not really.\u201d Bethany continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo can we go home now?\u201d Mandy reiterated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's a looong way back to the portal.\u201d Amy said. \u201cIt's on the other side of the market and it is biiig.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, so where are we going?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Amy had first stared down the way they had come earlier, but the market was just up ahead over here and this way they'd not cover the same part of it, not that they had browsed much on their way to the temple, but still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn't get far before Mandy saw what they meant about the market having everything and apparently in no real order. The fruit-stand was next to the longsword vendor, who in turn was next to the funny ball-cap salesman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandy was keeping her eyes out for some clothes, a skirt, or a pair of pants would be nice, while her two friends were looking more or less at everything, trying to see something interesting, so perhaps it wasn't any wonder that it was they who spotted the person on ridiculously long stilts. They had seen market and carnival stilt walkers before, but these stilts were much longer. She still walked with the same funny fake 'I'm almost losing my balance'-walk that is obligatory of the trade. For as she got closer they could tell that it was a she and she was dressed similarly to the girl that had eaten Mandy, but this one had purple clothes with black stripes going down her legs and her black hair was mostly covered by a huge hat full of black and purple feathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout missing a step she reached down and swapped the hats on the heads of two market goers, who looked about in confusion before trading their hats back to one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did she do that?\u201d Bethany wondered out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously? I only hear an unintelligible mumbling, but every time that we talk to someone I swear they are speaking English and you wonder how someone can reach down from a pair of stilts and swap the hats of two people below, that by all rights should be several meters out of reach?\u201d Amy  said while she kept her eyes on the performer, who now stood wobbling faking the need to sneeze, only to sneeze out a ball of flame and doing a back-flip over the row of market stalls, landing in another makeshift street and clearly landing on her feet, but a few steps later she was out of sight. \u201cGirl, I think you're trying to bring logic into an equation that just doesn't care for it.\u201d Amy added before she located Mandy and hurried up to her, Mandy having been too occupied with her search to notice the performer, or that her friends had stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Mandy finally comes across a market-stand that sells skirts, nothing fancy and certainly nothing she'd consider under normal circumstances, but desperate times...</span></div></div>",

As she'd been the main and only performing character in the last act the girls had failed to notice the other girls that were similarly dressed, all in the same red clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her back where she'd been moments before, the girl in the middle started. Likewise athletic she had a thick black hair that was pulled back into a ponytail. It looked good on her as she had the lines for it and the eyes to pull off the piercing dominating act that was required here.<br>\r\nStarting of with kicking a box open somewhat disdainfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside there were a thick rope and as she gently circled the box she retrieved the end of it and with a flick as if it had been a whip the wave travelled down the rope and as it did the rope unfurled, leaving the box to stretch ever outwards. When the wave reached the end there was no crackle though, instead the rope flopped down dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then the dark haired woman started stroking her end of the rope and the whole length of it seemed to come alive. It slithered to and fro around the circular clearing and soon started climbing up and around the other five performers that were in the clearing, the redhead amongst them. All of them looking bothered as it slithered past them and then around their legs and as the rope coiled around them more and more they started trying to push the coils away all failing miserably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they were all tied up like knots on the long rope struggling helplessly within the rope's coils and the girl in the middle put her end of the rope in her mouth, after which the rope started slithering down her throat.<br>\r\nAs the first girl started entering her mouth the rope started rising ever higher, so that the second and third girl were directly over the dark haired girl's mouth before the first girl had gone down it, leaving only the slightest bulge in the woman's throat. Her face was now turned skywards with her head tilted back, offering the straightest path to her stomach and the girls eased in one after the other, the second just gone as the rope had straightened itself completely above her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandy watched in fascination as the girl who had eaten her descended towards this other woman's mouth and the girl below her disappeared, then it was her turn and she made no more of a bulge than the three before her and as the last one vanished the hungry girl remaining sucked in the remaining rope with a slurping noise and as her throat cleared her belly didn't show any sign of her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a bow, receiving some applause, then she looked bothered and with a cough the rope flew from her mouth in a big lump and landed in the box with a loud impact that almost tipped it over, but it righted itself and settled with a thud that closed the lid, though not all coils were inside the box so it couldn't close fully.<br>\r\nContinuing with her bothered expression the girl then let out a dainty burp.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry must have been someone I ate.\u201d she giggled and got another more hearty round of applause and cheers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she did the rope wiggled back out of the box and picked up the donations bowl and started making its way around the circle with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls realise that they don't have any of their money to donate. </span></div></div>",

Diving underneath her garments in the process so that runs down her pants in front and wiggles up between her cheeks while at the same time circulating her two soft mounds beneath her tight top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's anything but unpleasant, so as her legs give way the rope holds her up, while it brings her back to its mistress, who brushes Amy's hair aside with a hand before giving the girl a kiss on the mouth.<br>\r\nThen Amy's head slips into the woman's mouth and the rope slithers in, dragging the rest of her with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy thought the rope felt good, but as the woman's giant tongue starts assaulting her she wishes the rope could just get out of the way, but with her clothes on it's not really the rope that\u2019s the biggest problem. The woman is gentle though, so as Amy quakes through a climax, her clothes are still whole and the woman keeps her inside her warm wet mouth until she's done.

Not that they went far, they'd all sort of figured out that once they left the market they should be a lot more likely to encounter citizens and thus people that should know where to find a bank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me sir...\u201d Bethany said as she stepped up to a gentleman that looked clean enough and clothed in such a way that she figured that he'd be wealthy enough to require the aid of a bank every now and then. She herself was starting to look a bit taken by the heat, but still appealing, so he didn't shy away even if he was surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes young lady?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you know where we could find a bank Good Sir?\u201d She said laying the politeness on thick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCertainly!\u201d he said, the edge of his mouth rising a bit in a semblance of a smile. \u201cSee there by the red building...\u201d he pointed waiting for her to nod. \u201cTake the street hither to the right, then halfway down on the right you should see a distinguished building. That, dear lady, would be the establishment you seek.\u201d He concluded with a bow and all three of them curtsied in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue enough, the bank was indeed well distinguished from the surrounding, by comparison, quite bland buildings and above the grand entrance they could read: 'Gold Hawk Holdings'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside wasn't that impressive though, the interior what you'd expect in a small town bank and there were half a dozen cashier-slots in the wall that cut across the room, separating the customer part from the bank interior. Only two were manned though, but there didn\u2019t seem to be anyone waiting in queue, so the girls walked up to closest of the bored looking cashiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I help you ladies?\u201d He offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, we'd like to exchange foreign currency for the local coinage.\u201d Amy said, taking her friends a bit by surprise, even though that was exactly what they wanted to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPut the money here please.\u201d He said and a box shot out, onto the small counter in front of his booth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBethany had already fished out her money while Amy was talking, so she put it all into the box, figuring that there was no need for their money here, she could get more when she got home, which was the only place she needed it. As they used coins here she figured that she could just as well get rid of the ones she had, so that there wouldn't be any mix-ups.<br>\r\nAnd before Amy could add her money the cashier had retracted the box and quickly sorted it out, Amy hadn't even opened her purse when the man pushed the box back out again and Bethany looked down happy that it had worked, inside she saw a pile of coins, silver and copper that she retrieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I want to make an exchange as well!\u201d Amy protested when the man pulled in the empty box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry madam, my mistake.\u201d He apologized and Amy dumped a fist full of bills into it and after seeing Bethany get rid of her coins she did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man handled her exchange just as quickly and Bethany raised both eyebrows as she saw the pile in the box when it came back out again. \u201cGirl, how much money do you carry around?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA bit.\u201d Was all the reply she got while Amy shoved fist after fist into her purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you also like to exchange your money my lady?\u201d The man queried, looking at Mandy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would, but they got eaten.\u201d She replied, to which he raised and eyebrow, retracted the box and went back to looking bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow with local currency the girls were a lot happier, now they weren't just at a weird and yet spectacular market, now they had the means to actually buy things.<br>\r\nWell they weren't exactly at the market...</span></div></div>",

Mandy too had some, but she wasn't that hungry to begin with. <br>\r\nAfterwards though they were all happier campers and ready to give the market a more serious browsing.</span></div></div>",

Some of it looks pretty stylish though, so it's not all bad weirdness. Though perhaps a bit much jewellery, so they sort of start ignoring those and look for other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis, ladies, is the latest in both board-gaming and home entertainment!\u201d The lady behind the counter assures, she was dressed like a female nerd out of some gamers-con and were one of those that had both a good enough costume and looks to be quite busy posing for people taking pictures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer elaborate costume had made both Mandy and Amy look, so when she addressed them they took notice since she didn't approach them in the bothersome 'Buy my shit'- kind of way most vendors used, but more 'Look at this! This is so awesome! You've got to see this!'- fashion, which turned out to grab the girls attention effectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey hadn't paid her stall any mind, so they didn't know what she was selling, but it was fairly obvious that it was games after just a quick glance, but as she'd been so up about something they couldn't help but wonder; What?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could see the girls' faces turning very sceptical, so she quickly cleared a spot at the center of her desk and pulled forth her show item. \u201cBear with me girls, you don't look like gamers, but trust me. This is cool!\u201d She said trying to keep the three of them from leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what is it?\u201d Mandy wondered looking at the large clear dome that sprouted from a metal frame with a flat bottom so it stood firmly on the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's called 'Stage Fight!' and it's sort of a gladiator game.\u201d Again she could see the sceptic looks in the girls faces. \u201cNo, no, I know what you think, it's not your thing and bla-bla. Just let me give you a demonstration!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay...\u201d Amy said while her two friends nodded somewhat reluctantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see the inside of the dome here is the arena and on each side here is a console.\u201d She pointed and they could see the one's closest to them. \u201cThey are all identical and for one player each. So each player makes a character and then joins the game. As they do the console locks until they leave the game. Characters are personal, so everyone that wants to play has to make a new character, the game remembers though, so you don't need to make a new character every time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, I need two players. What's your name?\u201d The saleswoman said as she started fiddling with the console.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMandy.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, so what kind of character do you want to be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, me?\u201d Mandy said, not really into the whole making crazy fantasy creature shit up on the fly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, that's fine I suppose. So human?\u201d She asked waiting for a nod, which made Mandy wonder; 'Wasn't that obvious?' before she continued \u201cFemale...young...some...\u201d it wasn't really questions, but she paused to eye Mandy over. \u201c...sixteen and a half palms tall...slim...\u201d she kept on pressing a bit with only a bit on humming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning the game a quarter of the way round she accessed the next terminal. \u201cThat should do it, remember Mandy that's your terminal. Now how about you?\u201d She said looking at Amy. \u201cWhat do you want your character to be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe same.\u201d Amy said thinking the clerk world get it and hurry on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want your character to look like Mandy and be identical to hers?\u201d She said with a bit of surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reply also shocked Amy in turn. \u201cThat's possible?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Amy realized it was a game and that she just meant the generic character she'd just made for Mandy. \u201cWhat I meant was I wanted a character like me, you know human and what not that you said.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, sure.\u201d The lady said this time only asking for her name, but not speaking out everything she did, instead just looking up a few times to evaluate Amy before she turned the gameboard around so that the girls could access their relative terminals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere, that should do it!\u201d she smiled \u201cReady to begin?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Then press the start button inside that big slot up next to the dome.\u201d The lady behind the counter explained as she tried to make out if they understood her seeing as she couldn't really see their terminals herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut both girls understood what she meant, they had to insert most of their hand to press the button, but as they did something happened. They found themselves standing in a dark metal hallway and slowly one end of it opened up like a big two door gate, opening in the middle and from the opening streamed light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a no brainier that they were supposed to go that way and leave the hallway, so they did, both stopping in the opening as they realized that the gate led out onto the now huge open field of the arena that was the floor of the dome and the light was shining down on them from outside the dome. Through its clear surface they could see a chocked Bethany and a grinning pretty nerd saleswoman looking down on them like enormous giants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's them?!\u201d they could hear Bethany ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, you play as your character. That's what makes the game so awesome.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, so what do you do? I don't think they know either.\u201d Beth asked, while also explaining the girls' predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou defeat your opponents of course, it's a gladiator game.\u201d She said as if it had been so obvious. She then took a closer look at the two girls inside looking confused. \u201cOh, right, I forgot to give you any special powers, you wanted to be bland...and seeing as you didn't carry any weapons I guess I forgot to give you that as well.\u201d The saleswoman said with an 'ops'-expression. \u201cI'm afraid this would make for a boring fight. Why don't one of you just kick the other to her butt and make her yield, so we can end this game?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked like she really wanted to give Mandy a serious kick, but Mandy wasn't that interested in fighting her friend. <br>\r\n\u201cStop Amy, I'll yield.\u201d She said sitting down and then laying herself back on the floor. \u201cNow you can sit on me and I can say I yield right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy did just that and looked up at the gigantic lady who just looked repulsed. \u201cNow what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe needs to tap out.\u201d She said with disgust while Mandy complied quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two in the arena found the dome going dark and then they found themselves standing and having the need to open their eyes, despite not remembering closing them. As they did, they found themselves standing next to their respective terminal again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sorry, it's my fault that was the most pathetic fight, ever. I guess I'm so used to seeing people throwing fireballs and having extra bodyparts and flying around in there and such, that I forgot that that doesn't happen unless the characters in there are capable of that and have the equipment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that's possible?\u201d Amy said, a bit more intrigued than her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, that and much more, but like I might have forgotten to say, all characters start out pretty wimpy, it's not until you level up a bit that things start to get really fun. I think you only got one experience point for that tragic win though, possibly you didn't get any at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if you don't want to fight your friends?\u201d Mandy wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then there are two things you can do, buy arena creatures.\u201d She said and held up a sphere that looked like something you'd pop out of a gum-ball machine. \u201cYou place this in a terminal and the creature enters when the game starts. There are a lot of different creatures, I have a few up, but there's a magazine here listing the ones I've got.\u201d She continued, fetching a pamphlet-sized magazine that looked to be hundreds of pages thick and slid it across the counter next to the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe other thing you can do, is find opponents that you want to beat good and proper.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo why did you put us against one another?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I wanted to show you. The awe as you step into the dome for the first time is quite something, isn't it?\u201d She smiled. \u201cI just sort of forgot that you couldn't do a whole lot once you were there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how much is the game?\u201d Amy wondered, it was cool, she couldn't disagree with that, even if she didn't get to see the flying and throwing balls of lightning bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe basic game is one large gold.\u201d She started, but was interrupted by Amy, who didn't see herself carry around this giant game on the market now anyhow, but still wanted to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow many silver is that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne hundred large, or five hundred small.\u201d The sales woman explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...\u201d Amy said, she'd gotten a bit of silver when doing her exchange, but nothing close to that. \u201c...and what's in the basic game?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust the game you see here, arena with four terminals. There are a few feature options that comes with it, like blocked view, so that onlookers can't see through the dome, blue sky setting and grass ground option I think. That's about it. The basic list of items and skills for characters is a bit more extensive than the word basic implies though, but for terrain options and other flashy stuff it really is basic. There are lots of add-ons though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny arena creatures?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNone, but creatures aren't necessarily so bad. They go from coppers a piece to as much as the game, but as you start out I think it's the cheap stuff you're interested in practising against anyhow. And after spending a solid gold on the game, a couple of silvers on creatures hardly make much of a difference, does it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot the cheapest of hobbies is it?\u201d Amy joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, afraid not, and at a large gold it's still a steal. And don't bother looking for a competitor, I'm the only one in town with a licence to sell it and trust me, I'm too much of a gamer to boost the prices too high, that'd mean I'd miss out on people to play against.\u201d She said grinning like mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it's not just a bit much to carry around the market, but a bit more than I've got money for at the moment as well.\u201d Amy said, she was quite intrigued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see.\u201d The shop-keep nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you will be here for a few days I assume?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will, I don't plan on leaving soon.\u201d The gamer girl smiled as she watched the three girls carry on.</span></div></div>",

I just didn't want to hear the price though, I prefer to dream that I could afford it.\u201d Mandy said with a soft dreamy smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh...\u201d Bethany answered, thinking that Mandy was probably right about that part, before realising that Amy wasn't with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping Mandy with a hand on her shoulder she made her aware of that fact and the two scanned the area, taking a couple of minutes to find their friend. She was a few stalls down, so she'd been hard to spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Bethany wondered as they stepped over to see what occupied the blonde, who looked like she was browsing this stand fairly thoroughly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust looking for a little treat.\u201d She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut we just ate?\u201d Beth said puzzled, having not quite paid the vendor's wares any attention yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh, but this is candy.\u201d Amy said as if that explained everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomewhat of an acquired taste.\u201d The oddly clad young woman behind the counter interjected as she noticed Mandy and Bethany turn their eyes to her wares.<br>\r\n\u201cIt's animated candy...\u201d She said stepping forward a bit so they could see her better. \u201cThese ones here are what we call wigglers, they just squirm a bit as you eat them and in the belly.\u201d She said motioning to the left end. \u201cAnd as you go over here they get feistier and tougher, giving you a bit more pleasant struggling and also lasting a bit longer.\u201d She continued with a pleasant salesman smile. \u201cThe scale increases on the shelves behind me until they actually put up a bit of a fight.\u201d She chuckled as she tapped a small clear container with a little creature inside, it was too dim that far back compared to the light outside the stall for them to make it out though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to the counter the lady went on; \u201cLike I said, a bit of an acquired taste, not everyone likes their snacks to disagree with them. And don't be fooled by the different sizes, the large wigglers are still just wigglers...\u201d She said tapping a large clear container with a manshaped candy inside. \u201c...and the small feisty ones are still feisty.\u201d she continued pointing with her thumb over her shoulders generally to the shelves behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo are you interested in something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy who had already looked through the assorted wares for a while looked to her friends for aid. She'd figured that this should be pretty interesting, and had the game they looked at still in the back of her head to some degree, so toyfighting with a piece of candy sounded rather fun to her. \u201cSo what do you think girls, should I go for some wiggler, or something a bit more lively?\u201d</span></div></div>",

The ones on the wigglerscale looked completely still, and as they moved onto the right the little creatures seemed to move about more and more, albeit in slow-motion and nothing fancy, just stepping back and forth, or scratching some bodypart or other. What struck them mostly was how detailed the creatures were, nearly all were humanoid in shape, but not necessarily human. There also seemed to be a vast majority of female creatures especially as they moved onto the right and most seemed to be a bit translucent, which was why at first they hadn't noticed the details and also what made them look so candylike. Well that and the colours, as nearly all creatures were one colour all over and some typical candy colour at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo with something that moves a bit.\u201d Mandy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, the ones that are completely still over there looks no fun at all.\u201d Beth agreed while Amy looked down where her friends were looking roughly in the middle of the stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, then I think this one looks good.\u201d She said pointing to a container with a purple lithe looking woman about as tall as her hand inside, expecting the clerk to either take it, or produce one like it from some hidden stash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe container is a seal, once you open it, they will start to move about properly.\u201d The woman explained as she picked up the chosen container to verify the price and then put it down on the counter. \u201cIf it wasn't for the seal calming them down, even the wigglers would eventually try to squirm their way out of the containers and well, I guess you understand how that would be a problem.\u201d She chucked while Amy produced her purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you bite them?\u201d Amy said, realising that it might be a bit hard to swallow something this big, even if it didn't struggle at all, she'd sort of forgotten the part about her not usually swallowing her food whole, but even if it was just struggling inside her mouth that'd have to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess, they are candy. But it would defeat the purpose, now wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d The vendor said, finding the question a bit odd. \u201cIf you bite off their limbs they won't be able to struggle with them, now will they?\u201d She explained her point of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you're right.\u201d Amy smiled, not wanting to bring up her particular problem in the conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat'll be a large silver.\u201d The woman said, looking a bit surprised when Amy paid her. It wasn't until she had handed the coin over that she realized that she was supposed to haggle the price. Judging by the saleswoman's expression she should have paid half as much at the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy just shrugged her shoulders as she left with her purchase in one hand. At least now she knew, and ten bucks for something like this wasn't that bad she thought, it wasn't like she could buy moving candy at home.</span></div></div>",

How long ago was that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne second...\u201d Amy said as she fished her phone out again and scrolled for the pictures she took of Mandy in the jar, finding them a bit weird and kept looking between them and Mandy. \u201c...Like five hours and change.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd we'd been here like an hour and a half, or two by then?\u201d Beth continued looking at Amy since Mandy wasn't really around at the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that means that even if we got here before noon, it'd be getting pretty late by now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long to the gate?\u201d Mandy wondered, seeing as Beth had somehow kept some track of where they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout an hour I suppose, but we'd have to actually find it once we get there too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, so I suppose the question is, do we want to see this city by night, or take that another time and head on home?\u201d Mandy asked, she'd gotten somewhat used to her odd garb, people hadn't been looking at her like she thought they would, in fact there were much stranger outfits around and certainly a lot more revealing ones.</span></div></div>",

Which would mean that we can't access the portal.\u201d Amy said, neglecting to mention that she was also a bit interested in studying her latest purchase in the comfort of her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I'll lead the way then huh?\u201d Bethany asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I think you might be the one that knows it best.\u201d Mandy agreed. \u201cNo need to hurry though, we might find something interesting on the way back, if we have time to browse.\u201d She added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Bethany didn't as she'd first considered. That is, head back to the edge of the market and follow it back to where she remembered those houses and then backtrack their steps to the stall they emerged from. Now she had to guess the general direction and cut across the market there. It should in theory be a shorter way, but, well one has to know where one is as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't get far though before Amy stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just figured we've seen jewellery all over the market all day, but we've never really looked at any and we did give ours up earlier. And I know we could look over on the end where we arrived, but I recall they all looked like normal jewellery, while most here look weird.\u201d Amy said. \u201cSo can we at least have a quick look here?\u201d She added pointing to the jewellery stand close by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess, it doesn't matter if we look here or later as long as we look, it should take as long.\u201d Bethany said a little grumpy, since she was reminded that she had given up her ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what's up with these cryptic things?\u201d Amy asked the lady in the stall, who leaned out to have a look. \u201cThey do anything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, not those, they are just pretty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you have items that do things?\u201d Amy continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure. Earrings over there, next to you, alter your hair.\u201d she answered and Amy looked at the assorted pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMind if I try a pair on?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm...\u201d The shopkeep said, clearly not that fond of costumers trying the merchandise before purchase. \u201c...All right, ONE pair.\u201d she agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked through the various items, there being no label on what they actually did, she just had to choose a pair she liked and then find out. So she found clean tasteful ones in silver and started putting them on, but as soon as she had one on Mandy's reaction stopped her. \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfro.\u201d Mandy giggled. \u201cPut the other one on, you look silly with a half afro.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bet, Amy said, looking around for a mirror, finding none before she remembered her phone and fetched it out, unlocking it before handing it to Mandy. \u201cHere take some pictures.\u201d Amy said, making the second earpiece ready, but waiting to put it on before Mandy had taken a couple of shots of her blonde half afro haircut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had soon returned the earrings and Mandy looked around, remembering that she had also lost her piercings, the one in her bellybutton being the only one that survived digestion, but ended up part of the price to undo the digestion. She wanted one though and found a set of rings and rods on a rack to the side.<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do these do?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, they also alter the hair, mostly the colour, but a place a little lower.\u201d The shopkeep hinted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandy looked down, smiling a bit, it'd be kind of funny, but then as she looked down she noticed that she didn't have a hole to put a rod in, it was as if she'd never been pierced. She put her hand to her ear. \u201cHmm... seems I healed a bit more than I thought...my piercings are gone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's interesting.\u201d Bethany said and had a look herself, Mandy really didn't have any holes, her ears were pristine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you have items that do more interesting things?\u201d Amy wondered, bringing the focus back to the wares at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure in the back.\u201d The saleswoman said.</span></div></div>",

Well she could always look out a nice garment, but she'd rather not look at clothes with someone standing behind her tapping their foot and asking her to hurry up. In that case she could just as well borrow something from Amy until she got home, even if she knew it'd fit bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Mandy found that she concentrated on just them it would seem, there were probably dozens of other vendors for every clothes salesman, but all she could seem to focus on were those few. Perhaps because they annoyed her so, she'd been looking for them all day and NOW they decide to show up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut neither of the other girls seemed to find anything interesting either, they did find the crowds thinning out though, even here as they started hearing the racket from some performers. The ones they had watched earlier, or some other group that had taken up roughly the same spot at least, Bethany thought, as she was fairly confident that they were walking the right way.</span></div></div>",

They made a couple of wrong choices, but it only meant that they'd taken a parallel street and not some huge mistake. So after a while they thought things looked kind of familiar, despite the different lighting. It was still bright, but the sun was certainly on the way down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, so how do we do this?\u201d Mandy wondered as they finally found the vendor they were looking for, as she was the one without a key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...\u201d Bethany started, trying to come up with a plan. \u201cHow about you hold onto Amy when she goes through and I'll stay behind if it doesn't work?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm... yeah, al-right.\u201d Mandy said and took Amy's hand, then as the two approached the portal she put her other on Amy's shoulder and held on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBethany watched as the two went in and saw the flash, then as it went away she noticed how the tent fabric of the stall was pushed out and then Mandy came back through the portal, walking through it as if it wasn't there.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt didn't work!

The offer didn't really appeal to me after the experience I got earlier.\u201d Mandy answered tongue, in cheek-ish, before she jumped onto her friend's back, causing her to take a couple of steps before finding her balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo are you ready?\u201d Bethany asked as she moved towards the portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess... Like I said I don't like the alternative.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could ask Amy to come back and get you, she did offer you to take that ride.\u201d Bethany giggled as she leaned forward a bit and stumbled into and through the portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you are!\u201d Amy shone up. \u201cI was getti...\u201d She cut herself off and her two friends looked at her wondering what was up, while Bethany let Mandy drop to the floor of Amy's walk-in closet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe portal...\u201d Amy said pointing. \u201c...look at it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...\u201d Both said as they turned around and saw that it had gone grey and dull. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's up with that?\u201d Bethany asked and poked it with her wand, but it just went straight through with no reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm glad you stayed behind and made sure I got through Beth.\u201d Mandy said as she saw what happened and when she turned back and saw the blonde she just couldn't help looking at her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Amy wondered, noticing the strange look she got from Mandy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust the alternative way of getting home we discussed.\u201d Mandy said cryptically, indicating 'we' were her and Bethany, who got the reference and couldn't stop herself from giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Amy protested. \u201cWhat's so funny?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing.\u201d Mandy said, but Bethany elaborated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did offer her a ride, not a piggyback.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...\u201d Amy said, realising that Mandy had looked at her gut and not her boobs, or some stain on her shirt. \u201cYou know the offer still stands.\u201d She joked, licking her lips. \u201cYou do look good enough to eat.\u201d She said giggling as well while grabbing Mandy's butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Mandy protested and shoved herself past the shorter girl and out of the small room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what are we going to do about that?\u201d She continued pointing at the now useless portal that didn't want to go away as the other two followed her into Amy's bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe should see what's up with that.\u201d Beth said, noticing that the time between the market and their world seemed to correlate pretty well, so it wasn't that late, just late enough for stores to close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr, we could wait with that and have a little fun with this.\u201d Amy said with a grin, holding up the clear cylinder with the trapped candy girl she had bought.</span></div></div>",

You do want to go back, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Mandy said not half as convincing as Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know it's not the most fun, but that does mean we have to study the book again.\u201d Beth said and the other two nodded their agreement as they went and fetched the laptop and book respectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had been so eager to try out the ritual once they had covered that part that they hadn't covered what came after, where it clearly said that the wands were keys and that they held two charges each and that it didn't matter how you handled them, if they went through the portal, even if another wand was used for that, they'd use up a charge. It took them a while to find how to recharge it though and it didn't help that they didn't have access to the dictionaries, even if they had covered quite a few Old English words by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned out that they would need to go to the hippie store again, apparently most of what they needed was there, they couldn't find anything about making a new key though, apart from closing the portal and opening up a new one, which apparently had two problems. It'd require all the items for the original ritual, which meant that they'd spend a lot of time engraving, carving and painting stuff, not to mention the significantly higher cost of the ritual compared to the one needed to recharge the wands. But there was also the issue of the world possibly moving differently, so that if they made a new portal they could end up in a completely different place and the market was pretty neat, not to mention fairly safe. They could otherwise end up in a forest full of wild beasts, or a top a mountain in the middle of nowhere. As it were now they could come safely into the city and then venture out from it if they would feel the need to do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they were busy they talked about a few other things as well, but most interesting was the point Bethany brought up:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know this is our secret and school project besides, however weird and little we might actually use of this research.\u201d Bethany had started out. \u201cBut I think we should consider bringing someone else in on it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know it's sort of your discovery.\u201d Mandy said, since it was true, she was just lucky, sort of, that she'd known Bethany to get this adventure. \u201cBut who, really?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was thinking maybe your sister?\u201d Bethany said looking at Amy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy sister?\u201d She asked dumbfounded. \u201cSeriously?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it was just a suggestion.\u201d Bethany defended herself, but Amy's sister who was two years older seemed like a decent choice to her, she'd have family ties to them at least and wouldn't look too weird coming into Amy's room, unlike say her own sister. \u201cWe should probably discuss what kind of people and who, maybe even if we should bring someone else along.\u201d She concluded.</span></div></div>",

You are the sneaky one keeping your head about.\u201d Mandy teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how about it?

Not the cheapest of toys, now was it?\u201d Amy said pondering. \u201cSo any suggestions on whom to bring? Other than my sister?\u201d She added, the last part as a quick save.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't get what'd be wrong with your sister. She's not that much older than us.\u201d Bethany said thinking of her own sister that was so much older that she hadn't lived at home when she first met these two, so they probably hadn't even seen her. \u201cAnd she wont look out of place coming into your room, like a few other people we might consider. I mean how many girls from school have you had over really?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMandy, you have any family you'd consider? Like your brothers?\u201d Amy asked, forcefully shifting the topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy brothers?\u201d Mandy said, sounding offended. \u201cThey are...\u201d She struggled for words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKinda cute?\u201d Amy offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously?!\u201d Mandy protested. \u201cThey both probably have lots of candid pictures of the both of you. They are dirty immature rats that just want to get inside your pants. Heck, sometimes I think they might even be ogling me.\u201d She elaborated, making it quite obvious that she considered them  out of the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the other two took in her outburst and tried to gather their wits again Mandy continued. \u201cI have one cousin though.\u201d She started, sounding calm again. \u201cBut while I trust her, I'm pretty sure she has friends too that she couldn't keep a thing like this from and I know nothing of whom she hangs with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat, is the problem isn't it?\u201d Bethany said. \u201cThat whoever we bring along, they are bound to have someone, like we have each other, that they'd want to bring in on it as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue, enough, so we probably want people where we also know the best friends. It's not like we want this spreading word of mouth until it isn't a secret, right?\u201d Amy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout that...\u201d Mandy pondered. \u201cSo what we want are people that can really keep a secret as well. Any suggestions?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI was thinking of Kendra.\u201d Bethany suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKendra?!\u201d Amy and Mandy said baffled. \u201cYou know her?\u201d Mandy wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe all know her. I mean, you've been to a single party she's not been to?\u201d Beth asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think not.\u201d Mandy said and Amy just blushed a little, she'd even had a private little party with Kendra of sorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what if she talks?\u201d Mandy objected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKendra? Seriously, you ever heard her do something like that? She doesn't talk, all the talk is about her!\u201d Bethany said defending her point. And Amy blushed a little more, it was true, she had thought everyone would know about her little adventure, but it seemed no one knew, Kendra hadn't said a peep to anyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKendra is a good choice.\u201d Amy said carefully, hoping that her voice wouldn't betray her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe is, I think.\u201d Bethany resumed. \u201cThere is one problem though, Viv.\u201d Vivian was Kendra's best friend and probably semi-lover, not that it stopped Kendra from trying to get the pants off of a lot of other people. \u201cI doubt she'll be fine with not bringing her along and right now that's one too many. Not that I think she'd be a problem if she could join.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I think you're right, never heard her being the one with gossip, she's more like the one that constantly brings Kendra out of the trouble she's gotten herself into. Maybe that'd include this though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I think we could convince Kendra to keep quiet until we find a solution, for bringing Viv along. Maybe she can even help with that, it's not like she thinks like we do.\u201d Bethany continued, indicating the reason why she thought Kendra would be a good choice. The place was one of possibilities, as the book put it, and Kendra was one to try things, that meant she'd done most things and people, though not that sluttish, she did have a reputation of screwing people, but not like she was jumping into bed with just anyone, no she had her cryptic reasons and in the end she always seemed to be back in Vivian's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut people aside, she had tried most things too, she had gotten a tattoo on her ankle, but then when it was clear to her that a thing in the small of the back was what was sexy that's what she got, but that was all the ink she wore. Likewise piercings, starting with the normal in the ears, then a belly left and a tongue piercing, which she didn't always use anymore and then a nipple, but just the one and finally one in the clit. But it was just for the thrill and sexual implications, she had no interest in the junk for its own sake, so no weird eyebrow piercings or the sort.<br>\r\nLikewise she'd be the girl that'd jump off the roof into the pool at a houseparty, or be one of the girls trying to out-beerbong the guys. Bethany even recalled one time she saw her play bikini-twister in the living-room at a party, where she was busy licking the chocolate off of her opponents that someone had dumped all over the girls and the gameboard. <br>\r\nBut she wasn't the kind that'd accept any dare, no she'd have to like the sound of it. Perhaps one could say that she didn't do anything to prove anything, she did it to try it, or because she had tried it and liked it, even if other people thought it was weird, revolting, scary or embarrassing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, should I call her over?\u201d Amy asked, before realising that perhaps the other two didn't have her number. \u201cI mean it is my place and it'd probably be nice to give her a heads-up, even if we can't actually go until tomorrow.\u201d She added quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot a bad idea, it'd be kind of weird asking her to bring money and then trying to lure her into your room and all.\u201d Mandy agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot to mention that this way, we can find out if she has any ideas for bringing Viv along, which I think will be more or less inevitable in the long run.\u201d Bethany said as she also agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what should I tell her?\u201d Amy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake something up, you're good at that.\u201d Bethany said, confident in Amy's bullshiting skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was faith well placed it would seem, for soon enough Kendra was knocking on the door, after having been told only, that she'd be let in on a secret, that she'd also sworn not to tell anyone, not even Vivian. Though that part was under quite the protests, Amy had even agreed to see if they could let her in on it later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn your bedroom?\u201d Kendra asked, ginning and shifting her eyes to Amy's swaying hips, she'd been a nice change to Vivian's trim hard body, even if she didn't have much of a clue as to what she was doing, that soft curvy and cute girl had been pleasant after all. So was this a re-run? She wondered as she stepped into the bedroom and found Amy's two best friends there as well, one was hardly wearing anything, her panties still showing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh... this kind of a secret.\u201d Kendra chuckled, she'd thought it was pretty late for Amy to call, dirty late... \u201cVivian doesn't need to know about this, and yes! I'm game!\u201d She said breaking into a huge smile, her full lips stretching around that white grin and she bore those big enticing eyes into both Mandy and Bethany, she'd no problem being sultry if she wanted to, but now she was more energetic and eager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKendra, though only a little taller than Mandy and Bethany had a bit thicker frame, wider hips and shoulders, in par with Amy, but not the chest, there she only sported a small pert set. The energetic girl, perhaps due to that nature had a healthy strong build, but only real visible muscletone was on her belly, no sixpack, but a fairly deep crevice ran from between her breasts and curved down her  middle into her bellybutton, the abdominals around it playing visibly as she moves. Despite her fairly wide hips she doesn't sport a large behind, but it is muscular, firm and very round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy blushed deep red, even more than the other two. \u201cNo, not that kind of a secret.\u201d She said, even if she herself wouldn't mind neither trying that, nor a second round, Kendra had probably given her the best sex she'd ever had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d Kendra said, a bit taken back by the change, she felt almost rejected, which was very unusual, but realised it was she who'd launched that idea, clearly the girls had something else in mind and had been, somewhat... shocked... by her forwardness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps it's just best to show her?\u201d Bethany said as she got up, getting approving nods from the other two, before motioning for Kendra to follow her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKendra was really wondering what was up when Beth led her to the closet. Had they killed someone? But then again, why would they then tell, her, about it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd seen and done some crazy shit but she wasn't ready for what she did see. Shimmering in the air, like some kind of ghost was this big grey thing that looked like an arch to a door, but you couldn't see through it, it was all just grey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's a portal.\u201d Bethany said and walked through it like it wasn't there. \u201cWe went through it today.\u201d She continued as she walked back again with no more reaction. \u201cThough, now our keys are out of charges and we can't recharge them until the stores open tomorrow so we can buy the things we need.\u201d she said apologizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight...\u201d Kendra said trying to grasp it all, but it really did sound very cool. \u201c...so what's on the other side?\u201d She asked as Bethany walked past her back into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis crazy market! Where you can buy a flying pig, like a balloon, but not like a helium balloon, but a real life flying pig! And there's just about everything available, the market is freaking huge and weird. We saw some street performer juggling people!\u201d Bethany went on, purposely leaving out the scary bits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...so...\u201d Kendra found this a bit much to take, with the gate there and all she did have to give them the benefit of the doubt though. \u201c...did you bring anything back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah...\u201d Bethany answered, but realised that she hadn't actually bought anything, even the huge sandwich she'd eaten Amy had paid for.</span></div></div>",

Luckily Amy spoke for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bought this weird candy.\u201d The blonde said and walked over to the desk and retrieved the clear container from a drawer. Holding it up and out to Kendra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKendra chuckled. \u201cPeople shaped candy. That is kind of weird.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, look closer.\u201d Amy ushered. \u201cIt's not just people shaped, it is animated candy!\u201d She said eager for a reaction from Kendra who looked closer and saw how the purple woman in the plastic looking jar actually moved about and looked back at her with a sullen face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...cooool...\u201d Kendra giggled. \u201cSo have you tried any of this candy?\u201d She asked Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually no. I brought it back so that I could enjoy it properly, but when we got back the gate broke down and we started looking for a way to fix it instead.\u201d Amy answered. \u201cSo you think I should open it?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell yeah!\u201d Was Kendra's excited reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAl-right.\u201d Amy smiled until she realised that the stopper was lodged in there good, but instead of standing there grunting she went over to the desk and put the jar down, so that it and the contents inside wouldn't be sent flying. There she pressed the jar against the surface while she slowly managed to ease the lid open until it with a small pop came loose so that she had it in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe peddler said it'd get more active once the...\u201d Amy started as everyone looked down at the creature, which went from placid to suddenly raving, hissing and as it tried to jump out of the jar Amy instinctively slammed her hand onto it, forcing the stopper back into place in one bang. \u201c...woah!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wanted something that'd squirm a bit in my mouth, so I didn't go for one the salewoman had called wiggler, because those didn't look like they were moving at all, but this bloody thing is freaking rabid!\u201d Amy exclaimed as she tried to calm down from that shock, doing so as she saw that the creature had gone back to the calm state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrisky I agree! You're sure it is candy?\u201d Kendra asked also quite taken by the sudden change in the creature, but at the same time intrigued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it's candy, apparently you're also supposed to swallow it whole, so that it struggles in your stomach.\u201d Amy explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeird...\u201d Kendra said.</span></div></div>",

She didn't think anyone would want to eat that. \u201c...I'm not...so, sure I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks...\u201d Kendra smiled and bent down to have a closer look at the candy. Then like Amy she eased the jar open and once she heard the pop she quickly grabbed the woman inside, shoving her into her mouth before the candy started getting feisty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bloody thing was big. You were supposed to swallow this whole? She wondered, but tried swallowing once, before realising she'd had bigger things in there before and to the other girls' surprise and embarrassment, she put two fingers into her mouth and pushed them into her throat without gagging and pushed the candy down in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking the fingers clean as she pulled them out and struggled for a bit, swallowing several times to get the candy down, Kendra finally smiled. \u201cMmm... quite tasty, not very sweet though, but luckily it became very slick once it was wet, so it went down easier than I dared to hope. Oh...\u201d She said looking down at her belly but nothing really showed, still she put both her hands on it as if to calm her git down. \u201cIt started struggling quite a bit in my throat, but now it's having a freaking riot in my stomach.\u201d Kendra giggled. *Urrrrp* \u201cSorry... Definitely someone I ate.\u201d She laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls just stood there looking on is disbelief, neither one could understand how anyone would want to put that raving thing in their mouth, it looked like it would claw through your jaw to get out and Kendra was having it in her stomach now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe's not going to give up is she?\u201d Kendra giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe tougher they got, the longer they'd last, the vendor told us.\u201d Amy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, so this tough little beast will be in here for quite a while?\u201d Kendra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno, but I do know that that was just a candy from the lower end of the scale, I dunno what you'd need to crack the upped end ones, a tank?\u201d Bethany said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLower end? Seriously?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, she's serious.\u201d Mandy confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I'm glad you were the one at the stand Amy, for I might have gone for the badest thing she had and...\u201d *urp* \u201c...I'm pretty sure that wouldn't have agreed with me one bit.\u201d Kendra said sincere and amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo why is it I can't tell Viv about this? You know she'd love it!\u201d Kendra stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...well we only have two keys to the gate and when Mandy tried holding onto Amy she didn't come through with her, so I had to give her a piggyback ride through. As we figured you could only take things along that you actually carry, since Mandy was the only thing Amy had left behind after going through.\u201d Bethany explained. \u201cSo until we figure something out we can only get four people through the gate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm... You don't look too heavy.\u201d Kenda said looking at Mandy and Bethany. \u201cI bet I can give you a double piggyback ride and if I can't Viv probably can, she's stronger than she looks.\u201d Kendra said offering Bethany her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay...\u201d Bethany said, a bit unsure as she jumped onto Kendra's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmy, you help Mandy get on, might need to use the chair...\u201d Kendra instructed as she adjusted her grip on Bethany's legs and got into position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandy climbed onto the chair and then onto Bethany's back and underneath it all Kendra started staggering forward, struggling with both balance and weight as well as the walk, as she had to bend so much forward to get the balance right. At the closet door she stopped and signalled for the girls to get off, there was little chance they'd make it through there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee? Not easy, but we only need to take a few steps, right?\u201d Kendra said with a grin hoping that this meant she could go home and tell Vivian, though she wouldn't actually tell her much, she'd tease and be cryptic until Viv would start to gruff and puff. \u201cThough I suppose tomorrow we'd set up inside the closet...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess so...\u201d Bethany said, looking at her two friends, to see if they had any objections, but they looked as unsure as herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat!\u201d Kendra squealed, giving Bethany a hug and a kiss on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how's the weather?\u201d Kendra said as she was so eager to tease Vivian that she started heading for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWarm and sunny. On the market even more so because of all the people.\u201d Amy said as it was clear that Kendra was going now and coming back in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...\u201d Bethany stopped her. \u201cThey don't take cards, so bring real money and we'll go to the bank the first thing and change it into their money.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKendra looked a bit confused, but this wasn't a gate down town, it was leading to somewhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, their money.\u201d Amy said as she went for her purse and fetched a few coins. \u201cSee weird metal coins, they call them large and small, come in coppers, silvers and gold.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see... thanks!\u201d Kendra said. \u201cSee ya all! I guess I'll call you in the morning then?\u201d She ended looking at Amy and receiving a nod before she closed the bedroom door and headed home.</span></div></div>",

That meant that she had to wait for the bank to open to get any money out and the rest had to wait for her. So when Kendra had called Amy had said which time they expected Mandy to be back and that they didn't have to show up until then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the mean time Bethany and Amy had got most things handled, taken out money for themselves, bought the ingredients for the wands and gotten the keys re-charged properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that it was just all down to waiting, so it was a nice change when Kendra and Vivian did come over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what is this about?\u201d Vivian questioned Amy and Bethany. \u201cShe won't tell me anything!\u201d She said giving Kendra a piercing glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKendra just giggled. She'd prepared for warm weather at least, both of them were wearing short skirts and short tight tops, and that's about it, so they showed most of their legs arms and bellies, making the other two girls a bit envious. <br>\r\nBethany had known that Kendra was in good shape and Amy had groped that body personally, but neither of them had really paid that much attention to Vivian, since with clothes on she usually looked pretty normal, as she didn't have that much curves, but she did have a very striking face with sharp features, piercing eyes and firm full lips and smooth blemish free skin. <br>\r\nWith the clothes more or less off, they could see that the rest of her body continued in the same way, sleek and trim on a fairly sturdy frame, What little fat she did have were there to make her skin smooth and to give her a decently sized pair of firm perky breasts. That she was the tallest of all of them just made her all the more intimidating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn't tell her?\u201d Bethany asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, more fun this way.\u201d Kendra said while Vivian frowned. \u201cAnd thanks for the treat.\u201d She added as she turned to Amy. \u201cMy stomach was in an uproar for hours after that, but I fell asleep eventually. I'm not sure, but I think it might have been a combination of getting used to it and it calming down.\u201d Kendra giggled and rubbed her stomach. \u201cEither way I'm still full. Kind of weird considering how small it was.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis just made Vivian even more annoyed. \u201cWhat's she talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bought this weird candy yesterday and when Kendra came over I'd sort of forgotten about it. So she asked me if I had tried one, which I hadn't and when we opened the packing it didn't seem so appealing to me, but Kendra wanted to try it. I'm not sure, but judging by what she's saying she found it pretty interesting at least.\u201d Amy said, avoiding the core of it all, much to Kendra's approval and Vivian's frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're nearly as hopeless as her.\u201d Vivian grunted. \u201cSo when are we going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny minute now. Mandy should be back soon.\u201d Bethany assured, thinking that perhaps the two newcomers were right about the garb. It wasn't nearly as warm here, while still warm, but she decided to lose a bit, so that she was only wearing jeans and a top, Amy followed suit, but started considering if she too should go for a skirt since she had her wardrobe close at hand. She didn't get to change, as there wasn't time, Mandy returned and everyone were just too eager to get going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo? All ready I hope?\u201d Kendra announced as she grabbed Mandy and the chair they'd used the day before and went into the closet, much to Vivian's surprise. Bethany knew what was up, so she followed, gave Kendra her key and jumped up on Mandy's back. This time it went much smoother than last night, even though Amy wasn't helping and Kendra thought it felt easier to carry them as well when she blundered through the gate, leaving just a bright blue flash of light behind that made Vivian wonder what the hell was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy eyed her for a bit, chuckling, before taking her hand and leading her to the closet, closing the door behind them as Vivian eyed the blue glowing gate with mouth and eyes wide open. She was brought out of it as Amy had climbed the chair and hung her arms around Vivian's neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHolding on, and you're giving me a ride. Here, take my key and walk into it. The others are on the other side.\u201d Amy said smirking, but Vivian did as she was told, clearly having little trouble carrying the smaller girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou weren't kidding.\u201d Kendra giggled. \u201cCome here Viv!\u201d She said as she reached into the stall and pulled Vivian out of it before she had even come to a stop, making Amy jump off her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around and around Kendra realized that she couldn't see any buildings. Normally when you were on a market with cobbled streets it meant you were in a square and then all kinds of buildings loomed over it all around, but here were only sky, bright blue sky and a sun still rising. \u201cHow big is it?\u201d She asked the other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm...\u201d Bethany started as she looked about as well, also realising that they couldn't see the closest buildings from here though the weren't that far off she knew. \u201c...we're fairly close to one of the edges now. I did get a bit of a look yesterday.\u201d She said thinking of when she stood on the stairs jumping. \u201cThen I could just barely see across and it took well over an hour when we weren\u2019t browsing. That was going in that direction.\u201d She pointed. \u201cI couldn't see the edges on the other sides though and actually we haven't been on that side at all. We spent all day on that side and even then we can't have covered very much of it, we didn't see the edge of it at least.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice!\u201d Kendra and Vivian grinned and Kendra picked up her phone. \u201cHmm...no signal. Not too surprising I guess.\u201d She said and snapped a couple of photos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Mandy asked since she hadn't been taking pictures of anyone, but rather of the street and stalls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust taking photo's so I know what the place looks like, I'm guessing we'll be going back using that gate, right?\u201d Kendra explained pointing at the gate in question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah... not a bad idea.\u201d Bethany said and did as Kendra had done. \u201cMight be we split up later, whether we want to or not. So I guess it'd be nice to be able to find your way here, no?\u201d She explained to the other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny time we should be back here? You know like last solution, or if we decide to split up, seeing as we can't call one another?\u201d Kendra asked clearly putting her phone on alarm mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think their time is relatively close to ours, it seemed that way yesterday and looks like it now as well, seeing as the sun looks to be on the rise.\u201d Bethany said. \u201cThe crowd started thinning out quite a bit by five I think, so an hour after that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good to me.\u201d Kendra grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, first thing first.\u201d Amy interrupted. \u201cAny market is useless without money to buy anything, so lest go to the bank, shall we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight this way, and the streets outside the market are much straighter and less crowded, so it might be the easiest way to find your way back.\u201d Bethany explained as she lead the way while all the girls made a pictorial map except Mandy, who'd had left her phone on Amy's desk inside a little clay jar. Or what was left of it anyway.</span></div></div>",

They didn't even have to say anything, all just gave one another a glance and went to seek it out, all except Kendra who was still feeling pretty full, so she started with the browsing while the girls took a break with muffins and soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at this!\u201d Kendra giggled as she returned in a brand new red top that went down to her belly button. On it in large white, bold letters the words: 'I seem to have misplaced my boyfriend' were spelled out in all caps, over the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let the girls read before giggling again and Vivian thought she was going to flash them, but underneath she had another skin-coloured top, not quite her skin colour, but close enough. It was slightly smaller than the red one so it hadn't shown and on it was an image high on her belly and slightly to the side, of a stomach cut-out, so one could see inside where a nearly naked man was struggling up one side of the stomach, trying to keep out of the pool depicted in the bottom and attached to it was a large speech-bubble reading: 'Please honey, don't dump me!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKendra seemed to think it was hilarious and Vivian just dismissed it all. \u201cYou don't even have a boyfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I do seem to keep misplacing them...\u201d She giggled. \u201c...You should be glad I don't misplace my girlfriends.\u201d Kendra teased, licking her lips and rubbing her belly. Amy thought Kendra gave her a wink, but then Vivian and Kendra were tongue-wrestling, not passionately, but quite playfully, even so, it kind of put aside any illusions of them just being friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you done snacking?\u201d Kendra asked as she broke the kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah...\u201d Was the general reply, sort of asking what was next.</span></div></div>",

She tried to shake it, but then the young lady who'd served them the muffins decided to bend over and pull a fresh plate out of the oven, giving Amy an eyeful of her plump behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe should get going too.\u201d Amy said, turning away from the makeshift snacks and coffee shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuestion is where...\u201d Mandy said. \u201c...I mean, we could go after them to the weird area, but then we wouldn't really be splitting up and like Beth said, we haven't been on the other side of the gate at all and frankly not a whole lot on the temple side of the market either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm...but we have been to the temple side even if not much and we have been in the weird section, right, so we should probably go back and try the other way?\u201d Bethany argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'd like to go to the weird section again, but you're right, we can go there either later, or some other day, maybe there'll be places just as weird over in the other direction.\u201d Amy agreed, so they just waited for Bethany to finish her soda and then they were off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't that far back to the area where the gate was and even though they took the market route they sort of hurried that part, but once they felt that they were past the gate they took on a much easier stroll, taking time to look at what the vendors were displaying at least, they knew fully well that going through each stand in this market would take weeks, maybe months, so that just wasn't an option.</span></div></div>",

Her dress was tight around the chest to emphasize her breasts, the dress itself stopped at her ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A witch!\" Amy said, slightly surprised. \"A real witch.\" Mandy and Bethany both turned around to face the short witch, this girl seemed to scream witch with her appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My names Maria, and of course I'm a witch. You're at the market, surely you have seen other witches in the last 48 hours that you girls have been here.\" Maria said while taking a step closer to the three girls. \"And I will say again this place is not safe for 'normal' humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean not safe?\" Amy responded, \"It's not like this place is full of thieves and muggers.\" Bethany folded her arms, \"What do you mean exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria simply sighed, \"Your friend over there experienced it first hand didn't she?

I am from the same realm you all are from, those two other girls that came through the portal with you...

I will show you what I mean by their apatite.\" Maria licked her finger and rubbed the spit around her forearm.

The girls could all see that a vine had wrapped itself around her foot, the vine begun to pull her into the bushes where it was to thick to see through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help!\" Amy screamed, Kendra was the closest one to Amy, reaching out for her hand to grab Amy's hand but being to slow. Amy got pulled into the bushes, with a loud \"Nooooo! Help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKendra, Mandy, Bethany and Vivian ran after Amy, They followed the rustling and the shouting from Amy, Bethany being the last one after them tripped over a root of a tree, her foot got caught in the trees roots, she scrambled to try and free her leg but she was stuck, by the time she turned to ask for help Mandy, Kendra and Vivian were gone still chasing after Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy finally stopped after being dragged her clothes were dirty, before she could try to untangle her feet she felt a wetness overcome her face and upper body, in an instant she was picked up off the ground and was now upside down. Her arms were pinned to her sides and she struggled from the wet confines she found herself in. On the outside Kytessa had swallowed Amy's body all the way to her thighs, her legs kicking wildly trying to break free. Kendra got there first followed by Mandy and then Vivian, they all watched as Amy's ankles slid passed Kytessa's lips, with an audible gulp they watched as their friend settled inside Kytessa's now slightly bulged belly. Amy's frantic thrashing couldn't be seen on the outside, nor did the girls outside see it, nor did they hear her screams as Kytessa's belly broke her down to a goopy soup and filled her intestines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let Amy go!\" Kendra shouted, Kytessa burped and giggled. \"Let her go? You want me to let her out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes let her out!\" The three girls said at the same time, Kytessa giggled again and turned around, Amy had already reached her final destination. Kytessa slightly bent over, the three girls watched and had a good view of Kytessa's butt. Kytessa grunted and reached back, she spread her ass cheeks apart as 'Amy' begun to appear in Kytessa's tight pucker. The first log slid out of Kytessa followed by a couple others. \"Hnnnng... There you go! I let 'Amy' out.\" The last of Amy fell onto the pile with a wet slap, their friend that they had known was reduced to a pile of Fairy shit. \"She wasn't that filling. I hope you three can help out with that!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kytessa turned on her heels and flew through the air, her wings fluttered once before opening her gaping maw. Kytessa was too quick, her body flew through the air much faster than the girls could run, Mandy saw her vision go black, \"Mpphh!!\" Mandys body jerked back with her head and upper body caught within Kytessa's overpowering mouth. Mandy's body jerked upwards as Kytessa gulped Mandy's body down to her kicking legs. Vivian kept her strides as Kendra turned around to see Mandy's feet disappear down Kytessa's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm..\" Kytessa rubbed her belly, the pot sized belly gave a wet gurgle as Mandy was forced into it. In moments the belly shrunk leaving her stomach nice and flat. \"Urp! excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKendra watching her friend become digested made her stumble, slipping on the soft soil she barreled into a tree with a thump. Kendra got on her back and forced her body backwards, her back came up to a tree. \"Oh my god... Don't eat me please...\" Kendra said with a raspy voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that bad, really!\" Kytessa said with a giggle, \"Think of it as a full bodied massage, it's wet and warm...And very soft!\" Kytessa begun her slow strides towards Kendra, \"And after such a wonderful ride you get to see the world with a great new insight, like Mandy! Speaking of which...\" Kytessa stopped a few feet from Kendra, squatting Kytessa gave a loud grunt. \"Out you go Mandy! Hnngg...\" Mandy slowly pushed her way out of Kytessa's wonderfully tight butt, Kendra watched as just like Amy her friend Mandy exited from Kytessa's ass. The first log of Mandy fell onto the ground followed by a longer log of shit before Kytessa let out on last grunt letting all of 'Mandy' out of her tight pucker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? Mandy gets to become fertilizer, just like you will be in a few moments.\" Kytessa said with a cute giggle, \"Don't you want to slide through this wonderful tush of mine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKendra scrambled to get to her feet before Kytessa pounced on her from behind, Kendra watched as her world went dark her head fully engulfed by Kytessa's wet mouth. Kendra felt her world turn upside down, her weight shifted as it slid quickly down Kytessa's gullet. Kendra was deposited in the stomach that held Mandy moments before and let out a scream before Kytessa's stomach reduced her to goopy soup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two left.\" Kytessa giggled and followed Vivian into the forest.</span></div></div>",

So she motioned for a nice bracelet. \u201cHow much for this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHalf a large gold.\u201d The vendor said without blinking, Amy had by now figured out roughly what their money was worth and she didn't have that much, so she tried another item. \u201cThree small gold and ten large silver.\u201d<br>\r\nThat was even more. So she pointed to a necklace that looked like silver. \u201cA large gold.\u201d She got for an answer, surprising her quite a bit as it hadn't looked nether as fancy, nor as expensive in regards to materials as the other two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have anything on sale?\u201d She tried, clearly these magic items weren't cheap and she sort of wondered what those afro-earrings would have costed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmpf...\u201d The vendor frowned, going over to one corner of the stall and picking down what looked like a metal bra of some sort, girlish gamer armour. \u201cThis I've had to reduce the tag on, it seems it doesn't fit just anyone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? So what does it do?\u201d Amy wondered, it looked quite sexy, though it was made for someone with large breasts, she hoped hers were large enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's a beginner's predator item.\u201d The vendor said with some disdain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt lets the wearer swallow larger meals.\u201d The female shopkeep went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs I said, a beginner piece, so if the girl, as this is a female item, couldn't swallow a person, then she could if she wore this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see.\u201d Amy said trying her best to hide her excitement. \u201cHow much?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThree small gold.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBah!\u201d Amy said without knowing what had gotten into her, \u201cI thought you said it was on sale?  One small gold.\u201d The item wasn't of any fancy metal either she realized, looked like brass she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, okay... Two small gold.\u201d The vendor countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor something that you said you couldn't even find someone that it'd fit?\u201d Amy said without thinking, her unconscious mind must have kicked her something the vendor had let on earlier that she hadn't really paid attention to herself. \u201cOne small gold and five large silver.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, one small gold and ten large silvers.\u201d The vendor agreed, sounding defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until that point Amy figured that she might not have that much money. Raiding her purse for it though revealed that she did, but now there weren't much left of the pile of money Bethany had been so impressed by. <br>\r\nShe got the item nicely wrapped and in a bag to carry it too, she had thought the girls had joined her in there but as she turned to leave found that they were outside waiting impatiently. So this was her little secret she realized with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFound something I see.\u201d Mandy said curious as to what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was on sale.\u201d Amy offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it's armour, it's very pretty and I guess I could just use it as a bra.\u201d Amy giggled. \u201cI'm almost all out of cash though, so I suppose we could head home now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to my world.\u201d Mandy sighed.</span></div></div>",

It might not have saved them any time though, for it turned out to be a little tricky, but eventually they found the stall they had emerged in when first stepping through the gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was still there, glowing a dark blue colour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I don't have a wand.\u201d Mandy said, realizing that she'd probably need one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold onto me.\u201d Amy offered and as the girl did they went through, but while Amy and her stuff vanished, Mandy had only walked through the gate as if it hadn't been there and re-emerged as she walked back through it again unaffected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that didn't work.\u201d Mandy said nervously, realising that she might end up stuck here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, why was that? Amy had a ton of stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, she seems to have carried all of it with her though.\u201d Mandy said as she looked around for anything Amy might have dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat could be it.\u201d Beth said as she walked up to her friend. \u201cJump on.\u201d she offered, indicating that she'd give Mandy a piggyback ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, I hope this works.\u201d Mandy said and the two went through the portal in a flash of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh...\u201d Mandy sighed in relief as she slid off of Bethany's back. \u201cI came through.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Amy wondered. \u201cI wondered what happened to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeems one can only bring things through that you carry.\u201d Beth said. \u201cThat's why you got all your stuff with you, but left Mandy behind, but when I gave her a ride she came through.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh...\u201d Amy said \u201cI was fearing that we'd need a new key...\u201d she said looking behind the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe gate, it's grey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeird...\u201d Bethany said. Turning around to give it a look. She poked it with her wand but it just went through like Mandy had with the gate on the other side, no reaction at all. \u201cWe've got to fix this...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I want to go back, this time with clothes AND money.\u201d Mandy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou had that.\u201d Amy said trying to joke, but with the gate screwed up it just didn't sound funny to her, she too wanted to go back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing to it I fear.\u201d Bethany said as she walked back into Amy's bedroom, \u201cIt's back to the book.\u201d she added picking the item in question out of its hiding spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two knew she was right, but still looked at one another and groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurned out that the wands, or keys, were just out of charges, also turned out that they weren't personal, so they found it a bit weird that there needed to be a person for each key in the ritual. Also the keys would lose a charge however it went through the gate, say even if another key was used to carry it through and they seemed to only be able to be charged with one or two charges, so they'd have to make sure they got two in them.<br>\r\nIt also became apparent that it was a lot less work and cheaper to recharge the wands than to redo the whole ritual so that Mandy could have a key, which looked like the only way to get another key. Plus it seemed that it wasn't certain that the gate would then end up in the same place. The market was kind of nifty. Whereas if they tried again they might end up in a village in the outback, or just plain in the outback, how much fun would that be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole piggyback thing did bring up the discussion that they could bring a fourth person along though, so they started discussing why and who.</span></div></div>",

It was actually quite the piece she realised now that she viewed it in a much better lighting.<br>\r\nNothing for it, she thought and turned it around to put the cups of it to her chest, only to find she couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell!?\u201d Mandy and Bethany heard from the bathroom, so they were quickly on their feet and through the door in moments. It wasn't like they hadn't seen Amy naked before, they did that every time after gym class.<br>\r\nEven so it was kind of weird to walk in on her with a naked chest and holding a metal bra up in front of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo put it on?\u201d Mandy said, as Amy just seemed to stand there doing nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can't!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean you can't?\u201d Mandy wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt won't let me.\u201d Amy said irritated. \u201cI think the damn thing is calling me fat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I try to put it on I can't there's something stopping me and I get the feeling I'm too thick around.\u201d Amy said as she let the garment drop down before handing it over to Bethany. \u201cHere! You two are skinny, perhaps it'll work for you.\u201d She said, clearly annoyed. Bethany knew that Amy had spent a lot of money on it so she could see why she wasn't happy about it, failing to notice that Amy had held back on why she had bought it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill she had to try, it was just weird with a garment that stopped someone from wearing it. Looking at it she realized it was quite the sexy piece, perhaps Amy had good taste?<br>\r\nPutting it down she looked at her friends who stood there watching, but made no move to leave, so feeling a bit awkward she removed her top and bra and let them take the place the metal bra had as she picked it up instead.<br>\r\nMoving to put it on she got what Amy had been saying, the damn thing just stopped in mid air and she got this feeling that her breasts were too small. \u201cDamn thing is telling me my tit's aren't big enough!\u201d She said and looked into it. Well she had seen that the cups were big from the beginning, but had thought that it was like a padded bra, but from behind there was no denying it wasn't the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTold me the same thing.\u201d Amy muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Beth said. \u201cThen why did you ask us to try it on?\u201d Insinuating that compared to her and Mandy Amy's tits were big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I hoped that I was just imagining things, besides it wasn't calling you fat as well was it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, just the tits.\u201d Bethany said as she let the garment fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wanna try.\u201d Mandy said and removed the top she'd gotten from Bethany earlier and grabbed the bra. \u201cSame thing.\u201d She said as she too failed to put it on. \u201cSo we're looking for someone skinny with giant tits?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like my sister.\u201d Bethany said absent-mindedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou've got a sister?\u201d Amy said, but Mandy looked just as surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, she was finishing up college when we met and she doesn't visit that often, so perhaps you haven't met her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess we've found our fourth girl then.\u201d Amy said, since she knew what the garment actually did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh, why is that?\u201d Bethany asked, both a little taken back why they'd want to bring her sister into this and why it was so obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell unless you know some other skinny girl with a huge rack.\u201d Amy continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that's the requirement huh?\u201d Mandy said holding up the piece of armour. \u201cWhoever wants to join has to wear this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrust me, you want to find someone who can.\u201d Amy said, still resenting the item for not letting her wear it.</span></div></div>",

And then there were those tits...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, Adelle!\u201d Bethany had said as her puzzled sister had opened her door to her small two room apartment, wondering why her little sister would want to bring two friends over out of the blue, she couldn't even remember the last time her sister had been to her place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what's this all about?\u201d Adelle finally asked when they had all gotten inside and handled the formalities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...\u201d Amy began, considering telling it from the start, but then realized that if the bra didn't work on Adelle they would have brought her in on their secret without really needing to. \u201c...long story short... we need you to try this on.\u201d She said and handed Adelle the bag containing the magic garment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d She answered, that really was the short version wasn't it? \u201cWhat's this?\u201d She wondered looking inside and finding the item that looked like something out of a nerd porn-magazine. \u201cYou want me to pose for something? I'm not doing it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSis, if you want to be prude, go change somewhere private and pull a shirt over it, we won't peek, I promise.\u201d Bethany said, Adelle finding that she sounded strangely sincere considering what she'd seen in the bag. So she got up and brought it with her into her bathroom, locking the door behind her, before giving the item a closer inspection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was really fine craftsmanship, albeit a bit kinky. That it was metal had surprised her, she had been certain that it'd turn out to be just pained plastic or something like that. But she did like her sister asked, she put it on, finding to her surprise that it was very comfortable, more so than any bra that she had, so she wouldn't mind keeping it. Girls with tits as big as her had that problem, of finding bras that were comfortable.<br>\r\nIt also looked really good on her, but she wasn't about to go flash her boobs to her sister, or anyone else, so she took her sisters resentful advice and put her shirts back on before she returned to the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, there.\u201d she said wondering what it had been all about if she wasn't supposed to show the kinky garment off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt worked!\u201d Amy hooted, getting a weird glance from Beth's sister and returning the gaze. Adelle looked possibly slimmer than her sister despite as Amy noticed, wearing two tops on top of the armour. The first one was smooth, tight and black, so she hadn't noticed it, because the one she wore over it was also black, form fitting, but stitched, so a bit thicker and had a loose pluffy neck, like a scarf. That skinny frame looked quite something with those big round tits, about half as big as her head each, so they didn't even fit on her front, but spilled out to the sides of her skinny body, which Amy found looked both sexy and somewhat weird at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really have it on?\u201d Bethany wondered as she reached out to check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Adelle protested, swatting her sisters hand away before it could reach her chest. \u201cYeah, I have it on! So what is this about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmy?\u201d Bethany asked, realising that she didn't really know herself, she only knew that it was magical and that they hadn't been able to put it on and then that Amy had said that they really wanted to find someone who could. Well now they had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou remember how we said that we could only go four through the gate? Well now Adelle could carry people, kind of like that redhead carried Mandy.\u201d Amy said with a smirk, seeing Adelle look just as confused as before while Bethany and Mandy raised their eyebrows in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean...?\u201d Bethany asked, but got interrupted by Amy nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's exactly what I mean.\u201d Amy said grinning. \u201cI don't think we want her to take it quite as far as that redhead did though.\u201d She added giving Mandy a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow are you going to explain this, or keep up this stupid inside joke?\u201d Adelle gruffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry sis, we... well we decided to do a paper on witchcraft together and stumbled upon a ritual that it turned out opened a portal to another world and went through it.\u201d Bethany explained sounding sincere, but Adelle wasn't convinced. \u201cThe place we emerged in was this bizarre market, where pigs really do fly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, that's enough.\u201d Adelle said, getting fed up with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo wait sis!\u201d Bethany continued. \u201cBefore we left Amy bought that piece of armour and when we got back we all tried to put it on but we couldn't.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt told me I was too fat.\u201d Amy gruffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, and that Mandy's and my tits were too small.\u201d Bethany resumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, what we found out, since Mandy lost her key along the way was that one can only take things with you through the gate that you carry. So in order to get Mandy home I had to give her a piggyback ride. Which was why we thought that we could only bring one other person with us to this place, but Amy hadn't told us what the magic of that armour was until just now.\u201d Beth concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what does it do?\u201d Adelle wondered finding the whole thing more than just a bit over the top, but her sister did seem sincere which just made the whole thing even weirder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt gives you the ability to swallow people whole.\u201d Amy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's some power, no wonder I thought it looked kinky.\u201d Adelle joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo seriously sis.\u201d Bethany said as she stepped up to her big sister who was actually a bit smaller than herself. \u201cTry to stuff my head down your throat.\u201d Bethany asked \u201cDon't swallow me though.\u201d she added with a precautionary plea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Adelle said raising an eyebrow, still finding it hard to believe how they could continue sounding so serious about this. \u201cOkay then.\u201d She said before reaching out and grabbing Beth by her shoulders so that she could sort of have control of the situation. Then she opened her mouth, wider than she realised herself and without thinking, rather than leaning forward, she brought Bethany to her, lifting the girl in the process and angling her in a way that felt natural.<br>\r\nThus she found herself with Bethany's head inside her mouth and realised that her sister was actually pretty delicious. She swallowed once and aided that swallow with her hands lifting her sister with surprising ease and shoving the girl in so far that her chest was inside her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then as she tasted her sister's chest that the mental image chocked her so much that she spat her sister back out. The taste though had been quite something, even if half of the skin had been covered by Bethany's top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Beth.\u201d Adelle said, licking her lips and swallowing the excess saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem sis.\u201d Bethany assured. \u201cBut now you believe us I hope?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess I do. But I still don't follow what it is that you want me to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm not really sure either, but I think the idea is that with your help we could bring more people with us.\u201d Bethany said as she stepped back up to her sister. \u201cYou'd have to carry us in there.\u201d she said putting a finger to her sister's stomach. \u201cI think you can control digestion as well, so you've got to try and keep us safe and then cough us back up.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean that you're afraid I'd end up digesting you? A whole person?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, now that you can swallow someone I have a feeling you could quite easily digest them as well, and sis. I do love you, but I'd rather you coughed me back up, like you just did, than pull down your pants when you felt it was time for me to come back out.\u201d Bethany said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should probably try it on something you eat tonight.\u201d Mandy said, getting the feeling that they were leaving. Which turned out to be a fairly accurate assessment of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Adelle.\u201d Bethany said as she headed for the door. \u201cI think you're going to call in sick tomorrow and then call me. You don't want to miss this, I assure you.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>None of the girls had slept that well that night, most kind of eager to get going and as such the three classmates had met up early enough that the stores hadn't even opened, So they made a last second check before heading out to get the things needed to recharge the wands. They also needed more money, which an ATM easily fixed for two of them, but Mandy had to stay behind and wait for the bank to open, her card had gotten digested like the rest of her things so she'd have to find her passport to even have an ID.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdelle had taken Mandy's advice and tried a few things out before she hit the sack and then again in the morning. It was weird, when she was wearing it, she could stretch her mouth and she was strong, not weird perhaps you'd need to be strong if you were going to carry people around in your stomach, but she didn't feel any different so it actually felt most weird when she took the garment off and she wasn't strong anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was the thing about digestion, it was strange, she'd eaten again that night even though she'd already had dinner, so she'd just had a small meal, but she could sort of vaguely sense it and then she'd tried digesting it and had felt everything in her system, her previous dinner and all hurry on south so that she had to dash for the bathroom.<br>\r\nAt breakfast she tried the same thing, but now it was just her breakfast that ended up down there, so there wasn't much to let out, but she understood what her sister meant about having to keep from digesting them, she was certain that it'd be no problem sending someone through her gut in a very short time. And looking at the tiny lump in the toilet, that was all that remained of her breakfast, before she flushed it away, it felt kind of weird to know that she could do that to a person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had procrastinated a bit after that, before she finally called in sick, faking a cough and then called her sister like she'd been asked to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have most of the stuff now.\u201d Bethany had explained, \u201cWe're really just waiting for you and Mandy to come over.\u201d she continued. \u201cRemember it's a market on the other side, so bring your purse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout that, do you know what Amy paid for this thing?\u201d Adelle wondered implying the piece of magic armour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo idea, a lot is all. I could ask her.\u201d Bethany answered getting the nudge from her sister to do so. \u201cOh... three hundred freaking bucks...\u201d Beth breathed into the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks...\u201d Adelle said, she wasn't surprised, the garment alone was quite the piece, that alone was probably worth it and considering what it did, that price was a steal. That didn't mean it wasn't a lot of money though. \u201cThey take cards over there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI doubt it, we had to go and change our dollars for their weird pure metal coins, luckily there's a bank not too far away from where the gate is and we'll be heading there first thing I think. And I don't recall seeing anything resembling an ATM, the place has got more of a medieval feel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, then I need to take out some cash first.\u201d Adelle said before she hung up, pondering things over for a minute, before getting ready to leave. She ended up dressed much the same as the girls had seen her, a pair of low cut tight jeans, she wasn't sure if her belly would be huge, it probably would with a person in there, so she took a pair that she thought wouldn't be in the way and a rather stylish backpack, since they had said that one could only bring things one carried, she wasn't about to carry anything she bought in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Adelle arrived Amy and Beth were the only ones home, so luckily they didn't need to sneak her inside, she found that the two of them had already charged the wands and double checked the rituals so that they felt confident that each key held two charges, they wouldn't want to end up just getting a one way ride, finding the junk on the other side would probably be tricky, but just in case Bethany had been her usual self and made a list of the ingredients just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow they only needed Mandy to show up and they could be on their way, in the meantime Adelle got to see the gate in question, that now that the wands were recharged glowed dark blue again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that's the gate huh?\u201d Adelle had said, more baffled than she let on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe one.\u201d Bethany answered. \u201cReady to go through?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, though I thought I was going to have a bit to carry?\u201d She said looking at her sister and then at the blonde friend. \u201cYou want to put on some swimwear Amy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! You're already wearing my bra, I'm keeping the key! So if you want someone to ride, ask your sister, or Mandy, who hasn't got a key herself.\u201d Amy protested, not that she wasn't finding the offer intriguing, but she wasn't about to jump down someone's throat just yet. Though she did recall that woman with the rope, which made a smile come to her face uninvited and she looked Adelle over again, that mouth, down her throat and past those big things to that tiny waist. Then she remembered what had happened to Mandy and her eyes drifted lower still, finally checking out that blue jeans covered tight little rump. No, she'd walk on her own two feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAl-right.\u201d Adelle giggled turning to her sister. \u201cSo I guess I'll be using your key then.\u201d She smiled before adding. \u201cDo you have clothes for it? I mean I'm pretty sure that whatever you wear will get pretty wet.\u201d She paused as she retrieved her backpack. \u201cI guess I could carry your change of clothes in this.\u201d She offered, not pausing for a second to think that since they were only four they could actually use the piggyback solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm...\u201d Bethany managed, she knew she had said all this yesterday and all, but now that she was actually facing a trip into her big sister's stomach things were kind of getting to her, last night she had only really wanted to show the concept, but what she had really meant was for someone else to actually ride in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo where's Mandy anyhow?\u201d Adelle wondered while she watched Amy ready her things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll...\u201d call her, Amy stopped herself from saying, remembering that the girl didn't have a phone any more. Luckily at that point she heard someone come in the front door. \u201c...that should be her.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady for a ride?\u201d Adelle asked with a grin as Mandy entered the room, quite eager to actually try this out.</span></div></div>",

She'd looked forward to going back, but back as in the market, not back as into some girl's gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou've got clothes for it? I'm guessing it's a bit wet in there, you could change back into normal things once we get there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay?\u201d Mandy said, trying to make out if this was how things were going, Bethany looked as confused as she felt and Amy started motioning for the two belly stuffers to get a move-on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose we should remove a few items...\u201d Bethany said and before long she and Mandy found themselves in just their underwear, while Amy folded their clothes up and put them into Adelle's backpack along with Bethany's and Mandy's handbags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess there's no point in stalling.\u201d Adelle grinned and grabbed her sister by her upper arms, pinning them to the girl's body while she quickly and with surprising ease brought the whole girl forward and her sister's head into her mouth. Bethany didn't even have time to protest, though once there she did flail her arms a bit, but as Adelle kept leaning forward, shoving Beth down her throat it wasn't too long before those arms were entirely inside and couldn't do much moving about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she was kind of lost in her sister's delicious flavour and the amazing feeling of having something this big and wiggling go down her throat, Adelle knew she couldn't really pause to savour it, so she stood up with no apparent problem and brought the remainder of her sister up over her, so that gravity forced the girl down her throat. Something that worked very well and her sister slid into her mouth and down her throat in one long smooth motion, only to curl up in her stomach as a strange big lump, riding high on her belly, though the swell of it almost reached down to the rim of her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour turn.\u201d Adelle announced and Mandy had only time to look shocked before she too was silenced and followed Bethany down into the busty girl's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm...bigger than I thought.\u201d Amy said as she eyed Adelle's belly that, unlike the women she'd seen eating at the market, sported quite the bulge. It had pushed her tight and luckily quite stretchy black tops up so that they crested against it, trapped between the bulge and her metal chest. It only protruded onto her front though, so the tops still clung to much of her sides and most of her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I'm expecting twins.\u201d Adelle joked as she walked towards the gate, finding that the weight of the girls didn't bother her as much as she'd thought, judging by the bulge she thought that she'd walk like a pregnant woman ready to pop, but it seemed to cause her no real problems. Not even bending down and picking up her backpack and Bethany's wand seemed hard, except for her blocked vision, but she was kind of used to that with her chest, it wasn't like the belly did much of a difference in that regard.<br>\r\nLuckily the girls seemed smaller once inside, she had feared that she'd be having a truly huge gut, but that didn't seem the case, rather she could have passed it off as a pregnancy, if it hadn't been so lumpy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo are you coming?\u201d She asked Amy who'd stood back watching the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, sure!\u201d She said, pausing only to make sure she hadn't forgotten anything before following the bloated little brunette into the closet and shutting the door behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how does this work?\u201d Adelle wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really sure, but we pointed the wand at it and walked into it, like this.\u201d Amy said and stepped out of the room in a flash of bright blue light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side she found Adelle appearing right behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, now about this.\u201d The girl said putting a hand on her bulging belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot here... come.\u201d Amy said and motioned for Adelle to follow, she'd decided that having her cough and sputter up things inside the vendor's marketstall might not be that good an idea when they needed to be able to access the portal it contained. So she led the girl down the street a bit until she found a less busy spot. \u201cHere... I think.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm... fine I guess...\u201d Adelle said, not sure standing in the open street would have been her first choice. \u201cGot any ideas how to get them out?\u201d</span></div></div>",

She still had a bit of money left, so looking around the bend she'd seen what she thought might help and went down and bought it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere.\u201d Amy said offering the end of a rope as she returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh... good thinking.\u201d Adelle smiled and started stuffing the end down her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI figured, that perhaps we just needed to tickle your throat...\u201d Amy said watching the rope go down without any reaction. \u201c...or we could hopefully pull them out of there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy stopped Adelle. \u201cI think that's enough.\u201d She said leaning down to the lumpy bulge in the girl's belly addressing its occupants. \u201cOkay girls, twist the rope around you if you can, get a good grip.\u201d <br>\r\nAmy then looked to Adelle. \u201cYou try to relax and walk backwards when I start to pull. Okay?\u201d She said and received a nod as she backed off a couple of steps to get a better angle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy wired the remainder of the rope a couple of times around her waist and let the rest fall to the ground, then reached her right arm out and circled it a few times, so that the rope was twisted around it as well, giving her a solid grip. \u201cReady?\u201d She asked before she started pulling, grunting as she did, feeling something give, but hardly had she started before she heard:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a moment...\u201d And felt something large on her butt and then she was rising through the air up and towards Adelle. \u201cThere ya g...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop!\u201d Amy shouted as she found her feet about level with Adelle's mouth, but it wasn't she who had stopped who ever was behind her, but Adelle with her quite obvious body language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry...\u201d The voice said as Amy found her feet planted onto the ground again. She turned around to look up... at the woman who had just removed her large hand from her bottom. \u201c...I thought you were escaping, you looked like you'd be something similar to a bound goblin in that.\u201d The giant grey woman said indicating the rope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy had a hard time determining what the woman was, but she was stocky which was just wrong for someone three meters tall and her whole frame, which wasn't covered by much, just rippled with muscles, but she didn't look anything like the typical bodybuilder. For one she didn't have pulsating veins all over and more importantly her muscles, while large, were also round and feminine, so she didn't have that angular and squarish frame, but quite curvy, but there was no denying that she looked stocky, she was just so thick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were just trying to get her sister and a friend out of her stomach.\u201d Amy said as she freed herself from the rope. \u201cIf you want to help you could pull gently on the rope.\u201d She added when she realised that the woman had just wanted to be helpful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's fine with you?\u201d The towering woman asked Adelle, who nodded her approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess pulled the rope in until she was holding it fairly close to Adelle's mouth, then slowly she lifted her arm up, causing the bulge to rise in Adelle's stomach and then as it continued Amy realised that Adelle was actually a couple of feet off the ground and the grey woman was just keeping her hand there, seemingly with little effort, while the two girls slowly rode up the throat until they, in a balled up lump with rope wired all around, sputtered from Adelle's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you!\u201d Amy said, glad that this quite intimidating lady seemed so friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't mention it.\u201d The giant woman smiled back and Amy could see that she didn't have human teeth, they were nice, white and all, but looked a bit pointier and she looked to have large canines, almost tusk-like.</span></div></div>",

I don't know which denomination is more degrading really.

Well we've only heard of that in stories and well, like you say it's usually not very flattering...

Unfortunately crime-rates are very low...\u201d She said trying to calm her stomach with her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I shouldn't keep you, but I'd still like your name. I'm Amy.\u201d Amy said as the giant woman turned to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm H\u00e9ula.\u201d The trollwoman answered and was gone with just a few long strides.</span></div></div>",

I guess, if it looked like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot much left of her then were there?\u201d Adelle said, looking down on her belly that had almost returned to normal proportions. \u201cThink there'll be as little left?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably not, the girl that ate Mandy was the performer that juggled people, so I think she knew what she was doing. No offence.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNone taken, but how do we do this then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe'll need to find a jar, then find a toilet, the one the girl used to release Mandy yesterday isn't far from here. Then I suppose we need money and then we can go to the other side of town where the healers are and hopefully get them healed.\u201d Amy said outlining the plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take them that long to find a jar-salesman. \u201cHow big do you think we need?\u201d Adelle asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow big do they feel? You know we only need the solid part, you can pee in the toilet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...\u201d Adelle said, then tried to feel around inside her belly before opting for a jar. \u201cI think this will do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had thought they felt like a normal turd and once she had caught them in the jar and had a look she found out that she had been right, just a normal looking turd, all that was left of her sister. And her friend, she corrected herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Amy had gotten the task of collecting Mandy's and Bethany's money, doubtless they'd want their money converted as well and probably wouldn't mind too much pitching in on the healing, unless they wanted to remain a turd of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a visit to the bank the two girls started the long walk through the market and to the hill on the other side, there they climbed it and Amy once more found herself facing two guards outside the temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's your business?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe seek the aid of a Daughter of Hela.\u201d Amy explained which got the guard's attention, so he stepped forward, lifted the lifted on the jar Adelle was carrying and had a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere's a woman down the side of the wall here that I hear is skilled enough to help you with that. A red house, the only red one along the wall.\u201d He said and stepped back to his place.</span></div></div>",

To say it was busier than the last time they were in here would be an understatement. Apparently there had been some kind of accident nearby that required quite a bit of medical expertise. Looks like some of the Novices and Acolytes were even mobilized for some of the lesser injuries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think happened,\" Amy asks. Adelle just shrugs looking around for anyone free. As they search, they hear the guard at the front greet someone. Someone important by the sound of it. Turning around they see a tall, statuesque woman, dressed similarly to the Daughters running around the temple, if less impressive. Noticing Amy and Adelle, she approaches. \"Is there something I may help you with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Amy starts, and holds up the small jar. The Priestess's eyes light up almost immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. So you have a friend you wish restored?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, yes. Two of them, actually.\" Amy says as Adelle looks a bit annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Priestess nods, \"Ah, yes. They can be restored quite easily, although it would seem that the Daughters are somewhat busy at the moment.\" She looks around the temple as she says this, almost conspiratorially, the girls think before she waves them into a side room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Daughters are currently busy with other matters that require their attention. However, if you like, I could do the restoration instead. That level of healing is not normally taught to Priestesses of my level, however I can assure you I have mastered it. I have already performed it on several pets thought long gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdelle pulls Amy back and leans into her ear, \"I'm not sure about her. Something seems a bit fishy to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she says she can do it. And I'm not sure these Acolytes are allowed to lie about stuff like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe not, but she said it's not something they learn at that level. What if she gets it wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy folds her arms over her chest and thinks. \"Well, it's either go with her, or we can wait who knows how long for one of the Daughters to become available. And what if someone who's been digested can't be restored after a certain amount of time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last remark seems to have touched a nerve with Adelle. After all, it is kind of her fault that they're in this situation. Not that she wanted to digest the two of them, of course. \"I know. But what if something goes wrong...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Priestess clears her throat and smiles. \"If you could please make your decision soon. If I'm not needed here, then I'll need to leave to help the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sighs and looks to Adelle. \"It's your call.\"</span></div></div>",

It would seem that the Daughters are still busy with whatever had happened, so perhaps the girls had made the correct choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching one Acolyte reset a broken arm, Amy turns to the priestess, \"What happened to all those people anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout slowing down, the Priestess replies, \"I am not certain. Judging by the injuries I would say there was some sort of trouble at one of the local farm. Perhaps a stampede?\" Whatever the answer is, she doesn't seem the least bit interested in such a thing, which is odd for a woman of her position. Maybe not everyone who joins the Daughters of Hela does so for the same reasons?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Priestess leads them through the temple and into a room similar to the one they used when they had Mandy revived. Once again, the door shuts of it's own accord as they enter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike the Daughter who performed the rite last time, this Priestess seems to be all business, holding out an arm for the jar, as well as a small bowl for their money. The girls are somewhat taken aback by this forwardness, but dump some of their silver into the bowl until the Priestess thinks it's enough, after which she takes the jar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles and drums her fingers on the jar for a moment, before heading over to the altar to perform the ritual. Watching the woman's behavior is causing Adelle to have some second thoughts about doing all of this, but it's rather out of her hands for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing the jar down on top of the altar, she pops it open, and raises her hands. It takes a moment, but soon, a familiar heat swirls around the room. Maybe this lady actually does know what she's doing after all? As the air dries out, Amy will notice small beads of sweat forming on the Priestess's forehead. Did that happene last time? She wonders as the mist begins to form around the Priestess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever as the Priestess begins to manipulate the swirling mist, something seems to go wrong. The mist builds and builds until it's almost a fog pouring into the room. If she notices that something isn't right, she doesn't show it as she continues the ritual, drawing up the darkened essence from the jar and mixing it with the thick fog spinning around her. Nothing seems to happen for a moment before, finally, a light begins to build within it, forcing the girls to once again shield their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they open their eyes, rather than the expected Mandy and Bethany on the altar in front of the Priestess, there's a strange girl sitting there holding her head. She groans loudly, as if she has a rather nasty hangover before turning around to face Amy and Adelle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore them is a strange girl of rather average height, long brown hair reaching to about her mid back. Slender, but with a somewhat ample chest, and strangely enough, heterochromatic eyes. \"Unnnngh. What happened?\" comes an unfamiliar and yet familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy gapes for a moment, but Adelle realizes what happens immediately. \"Wh-what the hell?! You mixed them together!\" She shouts at the top of her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Priestess suddenly looks nervously at the door and rushes over to the two girls as Manathy? Bethandy? weakly gets to her feet and tries to get her bearings. \"It's ok! Nothing's wrong!\" the Priestess says in a panic. \"That's exactly what the spell was supposed to do! You should have said if you wanted them to be separate!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls are taken aback at the woman's sheer unmitigated gall in refusing to admit her mistake. Especially when the results are... well, what happened! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What it was supposed to do?! We told you we wanted them both back to normal, not... this!\" Adelle screams as she wrenches the door back open. Grabbing Amy and Bethandy's wrist's she drags them out the door and back to the main part of the temple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Wait! Please don't tell anyone this happened.

Here was her chance she thought, she couldn't deny the woman who had fooled them's offer, but what was the money back when she had gotten some abomination instead of her sister back?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the woman who'd performed the ritual had been one of high status, clearly this other one was beyond that, so Adelle racked her brain for some way to address her, some title... oh she's right here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour Eminence...\u201d Adelle said hoping it was good enough, the woman looked surprised, not much, but the change on that stone face was shocking enough, but she didn't appear offended. \u201c...We came here seeking aid for my sister and her friend. Amy here insisted we seek the help of one of the Daughters.\u201d Adelle said finally realising that this towering beauty probably was one such daughter. \u201cBut when we arrived we met this woman who claimed that all Daughters were occupied and that she'd take care of the matter instead, the result wasn't quite...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSatisfactory?\u201d The Daughter finished for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo it wasn't.\u201d Adelle admitted, she sort of felt like she should be kneeling, but she only reached the woman to the hip, so it felt like she was kneeling already after the woman had stepped up and loomed over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis mongrel creature is the result I assume?\u201d The Daughter stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is.\u201d Adelle answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere's the vessel?\u201d The Daughter asked and was surprised again as the Priestess was the one carrying it and handing it to her. \u201cThey've paid?\u201d She asked the priestess, who looked ashamed and nodded. \u201cThey have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll deal with you later.\u201d She said in a calm manner that made Adelle feel that she was very glad not to be that woman. \u201cYou...two? Come with me.\u201d The Daughter continued addressing Bethmandy, before returning to the room they had just left. The creature as well as Adelle and Amy followed her inside, while the priestess took the opportunity to slink away and hide, at least that's what it looked like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHardly had the doors closed by themselves behind them before Mandbethy floated off the floor and into the air. The Daughter walked over to behind the altar and placed the jar down on it. She looked up unsurprised that the mixed girls were hurtling through the air towards her, instead she just opened her mouth and the girl continued into it and was gone as the Daughter's lips closed behind her. A casual swallow sent her down the towering woman's throat, leaving the Daughter free to look down at the self opening jar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs I thought...\u201d The Daughter said out loud, but it wasn't really meant for her audience, she just referred to her suspicion that there'd still be some remains left in the jar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ate them?!\u201d Adelle said astounded, shocked as much by the effortlessness of the action as by the action itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA necessity. Now be quiet.\u201d The Daughter said calmly, but in a way that offered no questioning. Amy got the feeling that this Daughter was either having a good day, or was nicer than the other one  they met last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn't notice how the Daughter, using her telekinesis spread her big cheeks beneath those tight robes and retrieved the tiny lump that she'd reduced the mongrel girl to, sending it to join the rest of the remains in the jar. Once it was there Amy recognised the ritual, this time it felt like it had the first time. The air in the room had already been quite dry after the priestess' failed ritual, so as the mists gathered around the Daughter Amy and Adelle felt how the air almost felt dusty and how their eyes and mouths dried up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily it wasn't long after that that they could see darkness creep up out of the jar and separate into two different parts of the mists, then the mists separated and congealed before the blinding light prevented them from seeing the finale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they opened their eyes again, that seemed to want to stick in the shut state from lack of moisture, they could see their two friends floating towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow steady them, they tend to be a bit disoriented after something like this.\u201d The Daughter said and left the room as Mandy and Bethany landed naked before the girls that had brought them here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn't seem to have woken up just yet and would have fallen had not Adelle and Amy grabbed them and held them upright for a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you'll have to go commando.\u201d Adelle smiled as she retrieved the girl's clothes from the backpack and handed them to the two newly healed girls, glad to see her sister back and seemingly fine.</span></div></div>",

Amy expected the woman to sprinkle the paint in the jar, so she didn't see what happened, but Adelle say how the woman turned to Amy and opened her mouth, then her tongue reached out, wrapped itself around Amy's body and then retracted, making Amy all but vanish. She saw how the woman swallowed the blonde girl down, but without the girl making any kind of bulge in her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she stared on stupefied as the woman started chanting and smoke started rising from the jar. It didn't take more than a couple of minutes for the smoke to cover the whole table and enough of the air above it to completely obscure the jar and then some. Then the smoke dropped as if it had been water thrown from a bucket, disappearing as it landed and on the table on either side of the jar were Mandy and Bethany, completely naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdelle saw the two girls stir, they looked up to see the woman light a tall candle in a holder that stood on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d The woman said as she leaned over and farted, making the candle burn a little fiercer for a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere's Amy?\u201d Mandy asked as she looked around the room and not fining the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe healer swallowed her.\u201d Adelle said motioning to the hippie woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you please throw her up now?\u201d Bethany asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho? Oh... the blonde... I thought... well, I used her to fuel the spell.\u201d The woman answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo can you heal her as well?\u201d Bethany continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry...I really used her up, just a bit of gas left, which was why I had to break wind. I'm afraid she's really gone.\u201d The woman said and the girls couldn't believe what they had heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the woman didn't look too sorry instead she ushered the two naked girls off of her table and then turned to Adelle. \u201cI healed them, now I want my payment.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I'd rather die alive than live dead. And just walking here, I saw dozens of people eating some fool that passed them by when they had a grumbly belly, I heard profanities, pleas and crying from those who would soon be meals. But mostly, I heard threats usher forth from throats traveling down throats. One in particular stuck with me; \"Once my family gets me back from the healers, I'll have a pitchfork up your cunt and a knife across your belly, so I can hang you by your intestines and watch you die slowly.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand this place has no lack for healers, two entire districts dedicated to two separate groups fully capable of complete resurrection.

We were worried about you, we thought she was going to make a meal of you as well!.\" Bethany said, a look of relief on her face as she walked towards her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I... Here, let me show you.\" With that, Adelle suckerpunched Bethany on her jaw. Bethany, not a particularly tough individual, was sent reeling from her sister's magic aided blow, she drunkenly stumbled backwards two steps before her knees gave out and she fell to the ground, barely clad ass first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you...?!\" Mandy shouted before Adelle stepped forward and grabbed her by the arm, pulling her closer to her assaulter. The blonde assailant easily overpowered the brunette and slammed her against the side of the building, knocking the air from her with an audible \"Uff.\" Adelle drew in close to Mandy's back, her breasts slightly \"smooshed\" into it, before Adelle grabbed hold of Mandy's makeshift dress, a tablecloth most likely pilfered from inside, and ripped it from her in one fast motion, completely exposing Mandy's average, but youthful body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdelle then, with a grunt, lifted her victim clear above her head, and opened her mouth. Adelle's mouth found easy purchase on her prey's writhing head, whose mouth screamed bloody murder for a time, before the large chested blonde began rhythmically pushing the unfortunate woman down half a decimeter at a gulp. Within 3 seconds, Adelle's lips passed over Mandy's, and within 6, they were over her neck, and after twenty seconds of sustained swallowing, Mandy felt lips on her chest. Adelle was even more pleased with the taste this time then when she had initially swallowed her, something about forcing the victim down just made it taste better to her. Her prey's head's outline appearing at mid-sternum, the gentle jiggle of her breasts each time she took more and more of Mandy inside her, the incomparable taste of this woman; Adelle knew she had chosen correctly in favoring this path over her old life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandy's suddenly stymied screams were not in any accordance to her, she tried in Adelle's mouth, but found no voice, her breath taken from her sustained blow. As Adelle's uvula dragged across her forehead, she began to flail wildly, but even when held in air solely by her assaulter, she could hardly move, and so she fell further and further into darkness, unable to save herself, or even rebel against the woman who would ingest her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandy's not particularly noteworthy breasts were swallowed next, before her bare midriff began disappearing at quicker and quicker rates as Adelle began to audibly pant from exhaustion or exhilaration or perhaps both. Mandy's head found its way into the end of the esophagus and into Adelle's pitch black stomach. Though the caustic air stung her eyes, Mandy was otherwise unaffected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdelle began now at her meal's hips, taking in her cheeks with great speed, before tilting her head back and allowing gravity to pull Mandy's body to its death. As more and more of her was engulfed, Mandy's head fell lower and lower into the stomach, before finally touching the bottom, leaving her to awkwardly support herself doing an almost headstand until she at last felt her feet fall from Adelle's throat. One minute and four seconds was what it took to ingest her companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdelle placed her left hand over her now almost 5 month pregnant looking belly and belched vehemently. \"Bloody hell,\" Adelle exclaimed, recalling another British nuance she had forced herself to forget, \"You were absolutely delicious Mandy.\" To which was replied with a scream. \"Aw, come on now, you've already done this before.\" She said, almost aware that the woman she had engulfed could not hear her in the slightest, before looking over to her groggy eyed sister, who now attempted to struggle to her feet. Adelle walked over and helped her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's... Mandy.\" Bethany muttered, near delirious. \"She, uhh...\" Adelle started. Looking at her sister, Adelle felt nothing but pity for the puerile state she was in. And yet she was here to digest her alive. With a sigh, Adelle threw another punch at her sister, knocking her utterly unconscious. \"I can't stop this now, and besides, it's not like she's gone forever, I can bring her to the temple, or if this training or whatever works, I can bring her back myself.\" Adelle thought to herself as she hoisted her younger and only sister to her feet. She stripped her of her improvised clothing, two curtains refashioned as a shirt and pants, and made ready to dine. As she opened her mouth, she saw the infant she once babysat descend into her, and nothing she told herself made her feel any better about it. Gulp by gulp, Adelle devoured her unconscious sister, before she sent her feet to her throat in one swallow, and into her stomach with the next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelching remarkably audibly once more, Adelle repeated the action she had done when she first digested these two by accident; she clutched her 9 month pregnant looking stomach and held herself in a ready position, and was notified to her success by Mandy's screams. As once the two had been surprised by the stomach and killed in a moment, Mandy's instincts took over and she did her best to keep her head above the pool of acid leaking from pores in the stomach lining, and when Adelle's body sought to crush her to pulp, Mandy did her best to lean with the pushes, so while unconscious Bethany inhaled the caustic liquid and died in moments, Mandy was alive as her skin sloughed off and her bones were snapped by Adelle's stomach's churning, and although it had only taken thirty seconds, Mandy had never felt such pain, nor had she ever screamed so loud. As her 9 months faded to 0 in the course of a minute, Adelle once more belched and flatuated as she walked back into the building. A pressure grew within Adelle as she ascended the staircase into the commons room, where her new mentor awaited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're ready, I'm ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman made a gesturing motion and stepped out of the way as Adelle pulled down her pants and panties, and released her two occupants into the pot. Looking down, she was surprised once more by how little waste digesting two adults produced, it was a single turd Adelle would have said had come from a steak she had eaten. She stood up and wiped herself with a rag offered by the woman, who walked over to inspect. She nodded approvingly before producing a dull silverish rod. When she held it to the flame, it violently began to combust, causing Adelle to recoil. The woman dropped the rod into the pot, and with surprising strength, grabbed her pupil and held her face over the pot. Adelle tried to move from the very intense flame and terrible smell, but she was unable to escape. After about two minutes, the flame died and the woman's grip released. Coughing, Adelle stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck was that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wish to consume utterly, but cannot, so I have given you the means to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about you psycho?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind your tone. And that was an Asatananium rod, in presence of flame, it begins to annihilate itself, as flame consumes air and wood, Asatananium consumes only itself, producing only heat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that have to with anything?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The heat turned the waste you made your friends into into a gas, a gas you breathed in. The gas was only composed of what remained of them; you have utterly metabolized these two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdelle looked into the pot, there was utterly nothing at the bottom save scorch marks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I can't have them resurrected or anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but do not be angry as this is what you asked for. Even if you had feelings for these two, it was your desire that killed them, nothing more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdelle chokes back tears at this realization, her sweet, innocent baby sister was now forever lost somewhere inside of her bloodstream, \"You are solely the fault for this.\" She hears in her mind. Looking up at the attractive thirty five year old, Adelle draws in a long breath before saying:</span></div></div>",

Now in the sunlight she can see a lot better and her friends lean in to have a look as well. <br>\r\nNot really thinking about it she tips the container in the process and looks as the creature inside stumbles into the lower, 'corner', if a cylinder could be said to have corners, without really falling over, leaning up against the side for balance as Amy corrects her mistake and righten the cylinder again, meaning that she has to lift it all the way to her face to have a good look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature looks like a woman, with scales in places and weird ears and hair. She wonders if there's some sort of muse fore it, but considering what looks like clothes that also seem to be part of her body Amy decides that it is probably mostly artistic liberties on account of who ever made, or designed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould I open it?\u201d Amy asks her friends. \u201cI'm not hungry or anything. She defends herself seeing the looks she got. \u201c...she doesn't look that filling anyway and I do wonder what it feels like and what flavour she is. It's a bit strange that a candy saleswoman spends so little time on her wares' flavours, don't you agree?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that was a bit odd.\u201d Mandy agrees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's your candy. Open it if you want, or save it. But I do think I want to watch, so tell me when you're gonna eat it.\u201d Bethany declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, then I'll eat it now.\u201d Amy said, giving the athletic feminine candy in the container one last look before she brought the item down to her middle, so she could get a bit of leverage on the lid, that looked, at least to her, like a stopper of some sort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt it starting to slide, then a weird popping noise and she was afraid that she'd drop the container and send the candy flying in the process, but managed to contain the whole thing, pressing the lid back against the cylinder without actually putting it back in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, take this.\u201d Amy said as she offered the lid to Bethany, who accepted it while she watched the blonde raise the cylinder to her face again, then raise her right hand even higher, so that she could reach in and grab the creature inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just as she did, the purple candy leaped out of her prison and onto Amy's hand, then sprinted along her arm and jumped onto her head.<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you little...hmmf\u201d Amy cursed, stopping herself from swearing and ending up just grunting instead as she felt the candy tangle in her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill holding the empty container in one hand she reached up with the other, trying to find and dislodge the thing from her hair, but she couldn't really see that far and the thing seemed to elude her, making her pull her own hair and not on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen as her fingers were tussled up in her own hair she felt something tight creeping over her ears and then with a jerk it went past her eyes, settling on her nose making everything a lot darker and...purple? <br>\r\nAnother jolt and she felt her hair entangled hand being trapped inside it as well, being pushed against her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't slow for one bit though and even though her shoulders and chest was a lot wider, they seemed to be enveloped all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandy and Beth looked on in horror as the damn candy had started enveloping Amy, they looked at each other for ideas, but while they did Amy quickly slipped inside before their eyes, shrinking as she went inside. So her normal sized legs were still standing as the purple blob quickly moved down them, claiming them as it went, until it reached the ground and the two girls could see that the creature was sitting on the cobbles with a basketball sized gut in front of it with a miniature Amy curled up inside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wet gurgle changed that though and they saw Amy turn into some kind of goop before their eyes and the bulge started shrinking. They knew it was too late now so all they could do was watch on in horror as the bulge became smaller and smaller, then as it was just her own size the creature got to her feet and started running at Mandy and Beth, who both turned tail.</span></div></div>",

They could just get the hell out of there, but people didn't seem to think there was any danger.

So she halted Amy for the time being and started scooting over to the supposed livelier ones, when another customer approached the stall with confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive me a bit of fun from the back.\u201d The woman said handing over a handful of silver coins to the vendor, who went into the back. She must be a regular Mandy thought noticing not just the familiarity to the place the woman seemed to have, but also that she didn't ask for prices nor for what she really wanted. <br>\r\nIt did grab Mandy's attention while her two friends also looked up at what she was up to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat they saw was a somewhat thick lady with long dirty blonde hair, not fat, but she did have a full body and a bit too little waist, with a bit of a hint to the start of a belly bellow her bellybutton, noticeable by her bright orange tube top dress leaving very little to the imagination.<br>\r\nHer thickness aside, her skin was nice and smooth, just looking a bit soft and the padding did give her thick legs, full hips and a plump behind. She wasn't that big on top though, ample enough with the dress showing enough skin for them to determine that it still looked good, but it couldn't be considered big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did notice them looking at her and gave them a smile while she waited for the clerk to return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike my dress?\u201d She asked, taking a turn to give the girls a good view of it, it did look quite nice on her, but would probably have looked even better if she'd had a slimmer waist and if the white thread flower vines that seemed to cover it hadn't been so hard to make out, since the pattern was actually pretty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Mandy said looking up at her, mostly since she was still crouching, not having gotten up from examining the wares, but the woman probably had an inch or two on her as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, new to these treats are you?\u201d The woman giggled, having noticed the tone in Mandy's voice and the looks she was getting, while she accepted a bag from the vendor with her items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I could give you a product demonstration.\u201d She said as she started walking. \u201cBut you need to keep up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls didn't need to consult each other, they were hurrying after her without even looking if the others were going to follow. Luckily the woman didn't walk that fast, she just strolled, even if she did seem to have a very determined heading, so she didn't stray the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they caught up with her, crowding around to get a look, the woman reached into the bag and retrieved a container. \u201cYeah this will do.\u201d she said after eyeing the very curvy feminine candy inside, it had unnatural amounts of assets and a trim waist besides, opening the container with a soft pop, pulling the stopper out as if it had just been lying atop the jar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then reached inside and grasped the tiny woman candy, holding it by its waist and the girls could see how the previously calm creature started flailing and kicking. \u201cYou want a closer look?\u201d the lady wondered holding the creature out.<br>\r\nThey all tried to get a closer look, the candy was pulling at her fingers to get loose and trying to bite her, but couldn't bend enough to reach her. Despite being the image of a well shaped woman the candy would have looked quite menacing if it hadn't been princess pink. That colour just ruined any intimidation levels it had going.</span></div></div>",

Neither girl had time to realise what had happened until their whole hands were inside the candywoman's mouth, but the creature didn't stop there, instead it seemed to inhale them, dragging in their arms and heads before they could even yelp. And as Bethany grabbed onto her friends Amy and Mandy had already been forced against one another and pulled in to their waists. Another suck and their bottoms vanished as well, along with their thighs, Bethany's arms, head and shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh..?\u201d Then The blonde woman holding the creature said as she watched as Bethany too vanished inside and slipped down the candy's throat, so that she along with her friends gave the creature a pregnant looking belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman didn't watch to see it form though, she just opened her mouth and popped the candy inside, letting it plummet down her throat and into her stomach right away. She usually savoured these treats, but she didn't want her snack digesting those three, so her stomach greeted her morsel with a wet gurgling and the girls found the creature quickly melting away around them, leaving them to suffer the same fate. \u201cThanks, I don't mind a bit of stuffing.\u201d The woman said patting her belly as she felt the contents of her stomach squirt into her intestines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the whole thing she hadn't stopped walking, nor slowed, or taken a wrong step. And in the same fashion she continued towards her goal, her full hips swaying and he meaty bottom chewing a bit as she headed down the street, plucking up another snack from her bag as she did. Popping it into her mouth and this time taking her time teasing and savouring it while the first one took care of her appetite. With it being a bit more filling than she had counted on she decided to save the remaining candies for later. <br>\r\nStrangely enough she didn't give the three girls, that had just gotten to ride along with her piece of candy through her digestive tract, a second thought.<br>\r\nAs they reached the end of that digestive tract though, they did meet up with previous candy treats that the woman had eaten earlier in the day, confirming their suspicion that she was a regular at the place.</span></div></div>",

At the outer rim three doors opened like in gladiator films and she could see her friends stepping out of them, but to her they were really tiny. They looked exactly like she remembered them though, so she wasn't sure what the vendor had meant about characters. Then she looked across the table to the side of the dome the vendor had been and from her gate emerged a much larger girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandy and Amy had looked at each other across the field, baffled at the place they found themselves, obviously they were inside the dome and outside it they could see a gigantic Beth looking down at them. Then they noticed that she seemed to be pointing at something and they turned in that direction.<br>\r\nThey saw that the nerdy girl had joined them as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three approached one another they could see she still had the same face, but that was about it. Sure she had had an elaborate costume before, but this she was wearing was more like an elaborate armour, gamer style of course so it showed a lot of skin and was tight in the places it didn't and to it were all these beautiful and flowing details. It looked pretty dark and grim though, she'd been pretty bright and energetic behind the counter, but now she had this long pitch black hair that together with her gear didn't exactly make her look giddy.<br>\r\nThey also recalled her being quite well shaped, but now she had the body of a goddess, a perfect statue of femininity and war made flesh. Also she seemed to have a few weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what really got their attention as they closed in on one another was her size. <br>\r\nAmy and Mandy looked at one another determining that they were relatively the same, Mandy was still a little taller and Amy a little thicker, but as they turned towards the saleswoman they realized that Mandy probably didn't stand as tall as her knee, even if she got out of those heeled black leather and metal boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm...I just remembered that you didn't get any special abilities or any other fancy stuff did you?\u201d The woman said looking down at the two small girls in front of her.<br>\r\n\u201cWell weapons are kind of boring anyway, but there are a few variants.\u201d She said and tossed a giant axe and a longsword away. Both clattering as they hit the floor to the side and behind her. It wasn't like either of them could wield either of them anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose I should demonstrate a few other fun things one can do instead...\u201d The woman said grinning as she made a flowing motion with her hand and they could feel heat on their faces. \u201c...like fireballs...\u201d she said flinging a large ball of flame across the arena. It struck the wall below the clear part of the dome and kept on burning there for some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr perhaps... well I can't fly, but I can jump pretty well.\u201d The woman said and to their surprise they watched how this giantess crouched a bit before pushing off and soared through the air landing a third of the width of the dome away, then pushing away a gain, doing a spectacular flip in the air before landing in another place after an equally long and high jump then jumping one more time and landing with a crash with her giant feet in front of Amy, who looked up in fear. Being glad that the woman had not landed on top of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose I should show what this game is also really about...\u201d The giant girl said, bending forwards and picking Amy up with her right hand. \u201c...defeating your opponents.\u201d she explained before Amy found darkness, warmth and wetness surrounding her and great pressure bearing down on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandy looked on in horror as the girl doing the demonstrations stuffed Amy into her mouth like it was nothing and swallowed without any effort, her friend making a small lump in the woman's throat and then she saw the giantess rub her toned stomach where Amy supposedly were, she could hear noises coming from it and it wasn't Amy she heard.<br>\r\nSo she turned and ran figuring that perhaps if she returned to the entrance she'd come from she could exit the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't get overly far though, even if the saleswoman had let her run for a little while.<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose I should also demonstrate telekinesis.\u201d She said and Mandy found herself feeling lighter and then that her feet were just treading air, that she wasn\u2019t actually getting anywhere. So she stopped and tried to look behind her. Finding herself turned around in the air and then floating towards the giant gladiator, who just stood there relaxed while she drifted closer and closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandy found that she rose higher and higher in the air and as she reached the dark haired girl, she was actually floating above her. <br>\r\nThe woman's eyes were on her the whole time though and as a result she was looking up as Mandy came to a halt directly above her. Then Mandy felt herself being turned upside down, so that she was face to face with the giantess. Then that pretty smile with perfect white teeth opened below her, but not to say anything, no it opened too wide and suddenly she wasn't floating any more, but free falling. The giantess caught her though, with her mouth, closing her lips around Mandy's waist, then with a swallow she dragged the small girl in to her knees and a second swallow sent the poor girl down her throat and into her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The giantess rubbed her stomach for a moment before retrieving her weapons, then she said something and Bethany saw the dome do dark. Then as she looked up she saw the saleswoman behind the counter again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuite cool huh?\u201d The woman said smiling back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah...\u201d Beth said nervously, she'd just seen her friends get eaten in there. So she turned to look around her to see if they too had come out, but couldn't see them. \u201cSo where's Amy and Mandy?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Mandy is about here...\u201d The saleswoman said pointing to her slender middle, just below her bellybutton. \u201c...and Amy is ready to come out of here.\u201d She said turning a bit to the side, so that Beth could see the side of her round bottom that was trapped inside a pair of skin tight decorated leather pants of some sort, before giving it a light pat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just stood there for a moment, the girl had really eaten her friends! \u201cI...I thought you said this was a game!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure it's a game, but any fun game has high stakes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, they didn't stand a chance in there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did say it was going to be a bit unfair if I joined in didn't I? But you didn't seem to mind, in fact it was you who asked me to join in.\u201d The saleswoman said starting to become a bit annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut... we didn't have a clue what it was all about!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo do you want the game or not?\u201d The clerk asked, clearly becoming a bit miffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just want my friends back!\u201d Beth said tears running down her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmf...\u201d The clerk answered looking down at her belly before crossing her arms over it, pushing up her breasts in the process. \u201cI can't do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth knew they had gotten Mandy back once before, she'd just have to find some way to do that again with the both of them. \u201cAt least poop them out in something I can bring to the healer.\u201d She sniffled. While getting a very strange look from the vendor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhm...\u201d She said looking around. \u201cI don't have anything. Go get a bucket or something and I'll see what I can do.\u201d The snivelling girl was starting to get to her and she really regretted that she didn't make that girl join them in the arena as well, but at least she got two meals and some experience out of it, though with new characters there wasn't really any experience to speak of. When this degradation was over she should at least be rid of the girl though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHardly had Mandy joined Amy at the end of the woman's digestive tract before Bethany was back with a large clay pot that should be able to hold a few liters.<br>\r\nThe woman accepted it reluctantly, then placed it on the ground beneath her. Looking around wearily she waited a few moments before undoing her pants, she then pulled them down as she crouched down behind the counter, Bethany only seeing her head as the girl grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long, Bethany couldn't hear her over the noise of the market, but the girl stood up and pulled her pants up as she did, then she fastened the pants before bending down and retrieving the bucket, which turned out to be two thirds full at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa!\u201d Bethany said, not quite expecting the weight as she, to the woman's displeasure, put the container down on her desk. \u201cYou peed in there!\u201d Beth complained as she produced the lid and were about to put it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course! I wasn't about to pee on the floor of my own market stall, do you think I'm stupid?\u201d The vendor retorted. \u201cNow be off with you!\u201d She said quite irritated, but somewhat relieved, now she didn't have to take care that business. She had sort of needed to go anyway, it wasn't like Mandy and Amy had been the only people, or girls, for that matter, wanting to come out her butt.</span></div></div>",

It makes you taste like candy.\u201d The vendor said and motioned for a row of string candies. \u201cWe have the flavours from here...\u201d She indicated pointing to a box reading: 'Salty Raspberries, \u201c...all the way to Vanilla Licorice over there.\u201d She finished pointing, indicating that they had the suit in some thirty odd flavours, but the sting candies came in at least twice that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds awesome.\u201d Amy said. \u201cHow much is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFive large silvers.\u201d The young clerk said. \u201cLike I said, a bit pricey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but that sounds so cool.\u201d Amy giggled. \u201cYou mind putting on a candy suit for me Mandy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, sure.\u201d Mandy couldn't help but giggle herself, Amy was like a kid in a candy store and the whole thing just seemed so silly. Besides, she was kind of intrigued how she would taste herself, figuring that she'd have no trouble licking her hands and lower arms at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what flavour do you want?\u201d The candy salesgirl wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDunno...\u201d Amy said looking at the available flavours and seeing one that she thought looked too weird. \u201cCan I have a sample of this one?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure...\u201d The girl said and quickly cut off a piece and handed it to Amy, who looked mighty surprised after she'd popped the dice-sized string candy into her mouth.<br>\r\n'Sweet Strawberry Licorice' had just sounded like something that shouldn't be mixed, even if good flavours on their own, but Amy found that at least this candymaker knew the secret to making it an astounding combo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's the flavour I want.\u201d Amy said fishing out five of her newly acquired large silver coins and handed it to the girl behind the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, let me help you.\u201d The vendorgirl said and grasped Mandy's two hands, putting a dark red jello-like mass in her left hand and keeping it firmly in place, while she manoeuvred the other one so that Mandy had one finger pointing out. \u201cYou shove a finger in here.\u201d She said and moved Mandy's hand for her. \u201cYou've got to press a bit.\u201d She added as she also applied a bit of force, making Mandy's finger plunge into the jellylike suit. \u201cThen the rest is automatic.\u201d She continued and Mandy felt the suit quickly spread over her skin, under her clothes and not over them as she had though, instead as the vendorgirl with a practised routine shifted her hands a couple of times, Mandy found herself sliding out of her clothes while still dangling from the vendor's grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDangling? <br>\r\nIt took her a second to realize that she'd shrunk and was indeed dangling from the girl's left hand fingers. She couldn't be more than four or five inches tall and her clothes had all slumped onto the ground in front of the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you go.\u201d The vendor girl said with a smile, not looking at her, Mandy noticed, but at Amy who had paid for the suit, as she reached out and offered the small candy girl to the blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how do you take it off?!\u201d Mandy shouted, getting the peddler's attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake it off?\u201d She said, not quite understanding the question. \u201cTake what off?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe suit!\u201d Mandy continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl just giggled at that and brought Mandy to her large pretty face. \u201cYou're not supposed to take the suit off, you're supposed to be eaten. You're just a delicious little candygirl now.\u201d She said licking her lips unconsciously. \u201cNow be a good little treat and wiggle nicely in her tummy.\u201d The girl continued and offered Mandy to Amy again, who felt obliged to let Mandy drop into her hands. \u201cI don't want people to say I sell bad candy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandy looked up at her giant friend who in turn looked down at her with huge eyes, not sure what she should say, so she remained silent. Mandy heard that Amy's stomach had a thing or two to say though, it sounded like. \u201cGive me!\u201d to her as she stared at it in horror, realizing that Amy would probably need a handful of girls like her to even take the edge off her hunger.</span></div></div>",

Would you like a wrapper for that?\" She vendor asks, assuming that Amy's keeping Mandy for later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn reaction, Amy peers down at Mandy for a bit of a moment, triggering the small candy girl to slink back, she really doesn't like the look she's being given. Eventually, Amy speaks up. \"So? How about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that Amy seems to be teasing her despite the situation really agitates Mandy somewhat. \"Are you serious? I'm stuck in here enough already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've thooought about you in binds once or twice already...\" Amy admits, and to Mandy's chagrin she's plucked out, and handed toward the vendor. \"...so sure, why not?\" She giggles, clearly thrilled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBethany just rolls her eyes. \"Let's not take it too far.\" She warns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping Mandy into the vendor's hand, Amy just giggles. \"Oh, come on, if it weren't for us she'd still be stuck in a jar. Think she owes us a little fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Mandy back on hand, the vendor slinks back into her stall, and lays out a wrapper on the counter, and then Mandy on top of it. With an expert's touch, she takes the ends of the paper-y plastic, and tightly folds and wraps it over Mandy, the candy's vision going dark as her head is obscured, once attaining a secure fit, the vendor then folds up the ends over Mandy's head and toes, rolls her onto her front, then folds the ends back, applying a little light glue to keep them secure. And ta-da, Mandy's now secure within a little red, form-fitting wrapper, the girl squirming a little within to no avail. With a smile, she passes her back to Amy, who views Mandy with a giggle before setting the bound girl inside of her purse once again. \"Don't let her get stale, now!\" She vendor warns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Mandy taken care of, Amy slings her purse back over her shoulder and motions for Bethany. \"Come on, let's find some real food.\" She suggests, and the two girls meander off, the last taken along for the ride.</span></div></div>",

Either way, she's now more occupied with grumbling about what she's being put through, the tight wrapping rendering any complaint muffled to the point of imperceptibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple more minutes of slowly trudging through the crowd, the the two full-sized girls manage to both catch a whiff of the familiar scent of cooking meat trailing off from a nearby stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You smell that?\" Bethany inquires, to which Amy nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's coming from that way.\" She points off in a direction, and sure enough, looking up, the two can spot a smoke trail drifting from someplace in that direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith enthusiasm, the two make their way over, wondering what kind of meat they would serve in this kind of world, it seemed almost farfetched to expect the chicken or beef popular in the western world they're from. And sure enough, upon reaching the stand, what they find is a stand selling some kind of shish kebab styled snack, with roasted meats and vegetables skewered on sticks. The types of veggies are entirely unfamiliar to the girls, but the smell is pretty good, so they spend some small silvers each to try a few. The tastes is unique, with some of the veggies bursting with flavor, while others are pretty bad, those are simple enough to discard, anyway. The meat is tough, but juicy, with a flavor neither can really identify, so they figure it's some kind of creature exclusive to this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, Mandy catches a whiff of what they're eating, and tosses and turns herself within the interior of Amy's purse, she may not be hungry, but it smells delicious, regardless. Why does she have to be left out, she wonders!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut soon enough, Amy and Bethany have finished satisfying their hunger, and thank the stall owner, at least that was one relatively mundane encounter, and the two decide to take their leave and explore elsewhere.</span></div></div>",

She figures that Bethany won't wander very far, or if things get late, she'll head back home, so she isn't very concerned about that. Now, she just wants to quickly do what she wanted to split up for, while the mood has still struck. Wandering into the crowd some more, she examines the various market stalls, none seem ideal for her purpose, at least at a glance, there's also that restroom that the girl who had eaten Mandy before lead her to, but that's hardly very private, and it's quite some distance until she leaves the market, so that's just an option to consider as a last resort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's only after a couple minutes that she just so happens to spot a clothing stall, but unlike some others, there appear to be some series of cloth drapes hung by a pole running off the side of the stall, odd at first glance, but it just so happens that she spots a woman appearing out of thin air from the cloth, brushing it aside with some folded up clothes bundled in her arms. It's then that she realizes that they must lead into private changing rooms, of a sort, as if they're obscuring a doorway that's not really there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to investigate, Amy draws closer to examine those drapes, spotting another woman take some clothes from the stall, and move into the drape, vanishing from sight, confirming Amy's suspicion. Approaching the stall, she then takes an acting show to peruse the wares, trying her best to act casual, although there's a bit of excitement that she's unable to hide, triggering a curious glance from the vendor. The clothes seem on par with what she's seen of all the people bustling about, some relatively normal, many exotic, some revealing, some modest, some extravagant, and some inscribed with what appear to be runes of some sort. She collects a few, herself, being sure to avoid any that look obviously magical, and have enough to expect quite a few minutes in the changing rooms and turns toward the vendor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, hi! I'd like to try these on, if I may? I assume those are changing rooms over there, right?\" She points her eyes to the hanging drapes, and the vendor simply nods back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further ado, she hurries over to the drapes, and attempts to brush past one, only for it to fail to yield altogether, like it's a firm board instead of cloth, she figures it might mean it's occupied, so she tries the next one over, which brushes aside, revealing a meager-sized, yet usable changing room behind. Unlike the market ground around, it's carpeted inside, with a mirror, a seat, some hanger hooks, the essentials, but it'll do. Entering, she sets the clothes aside, having no particular plans with them, no, she really just wanted some good privacy, and sets her purse onto the pile of clothes, and fishes out the still-bound Mandy from the pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandy, feeling herself picked up, begins to squirm a little, quite futilely, yet wiggles nonetheless until she finds herself set back down onto a harder, flat surface, she then hears some rustling of clothes, some giggling on Amy's part, which unnerves Mandy quite a bit, just what is that conniving girl up to? After another quiet moment, she's picked up again, and feels the glued ends of her wrapper being pulled open, and unrolled, light meeting her eyes once again as she finds herself in Amy's titanic hands, the girl sporting a worrying grin. Glancing about, she tries to assess what kind of room she's in until she looks down, but it's not the bundled up clothes below that get her attention, but rather Amy's waist, her own trousers and panties slid down and fallen around her ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy, please don't tell me you-\" With a giggle, Amy brings a finger up to her mouth and makes a \"shush\" gesture, then pinches Mandy's ankles, opens her mouth, and pops the candy girl into her mouth, pursing her lips tight to keep Mandy's feet secure whilst she slathers her miniature friend with her tongue. Plunged into the hot, moist, and dark space, Mandy can't help but feel a pleasant, tingling feeling course over her, which would overwhelm her if she weren't scared for her very life, afraid she might take a second digestive plunge this day! A moan emanates from the throat below, Amy giving her approval of the exotic flavor she's collecting from Mandy, tongue sliding and grinding against her smooth, tasty body. This lasts for a good fifteen seconds before Amy pulls Mandy back out, coated in her slick saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, what a flavor, time for the main course.\" She teases, and before Mandy has a chance to question her, she's brought down between Amy's spread thighs, face to face with the perverted girl's slit. \"You don't mean-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ssh, you know I paid good money for this, might as well indulge a little, hm? Now go on!\" Amy responds, giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an anxious sigh, Mandy reluctantly bends forward, rubbing her hands against the massive feminine lips, maybe if she goes along with, this it'll put Amy's mind off putting her back in her mouth, she hopes, anyway. Fidgeting in place a little, Amy's breath begins to accelerate as she lets Mandy do her thing, the inner lips growing quite a bit moist until she requests. \"Deeper, Mandy, go on now.\" She encourages, triggering Mandy to sigh once again, and press her arms into the slick vaginal passage, stroking and pushing them about, hoping that Amy's satisfied with this level of stimulation. As luck would have it, she isn't, and Amy decides to help things along by bringing a finger down south, pushing it against Mandy's candied buttocks with enough force to plunge the lubricated girl inside. Suddenly engulfed into the wet, tight, and quite hot folds, Mandy briefly squirms in a panic, believing herself to suffocate until she feels a distinct lack of need in her lungs, perhaps an effect of the candy suit? At least upon realizing it her wiggles subside mostly, but it seems Amy is still enjoying them, apparent by some pleasant groans and pants coming from up above. And that tinging sensation that she felt while in her mouth? It returns, slowly growing in intensity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandy spends a few minutes trapped within the confines of, writhing lightly about as her body is washed in this strange sensation, that is until she begins to distinctly lose feeling along her hands, she kind of pauses, curious as to what it is at first, but then the lack of feeling begins to spread down the rest of her arms, and begin going along her legs as well. Panicking, Mandy tries to push her way out, but the slick, undulating confines of Amy's privates makes things tough, but she makes some progress until she finds herself brushing back against Amy's fingers, which seem to have poked in to slide about, enhancing her pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Amy's pants intensify. \"Ohh, ooh, yes, wiggle like that!\" She encourages, a hand dove between her legs to help bring her along, fingers soon pressing back up against Mandy within, which she quickly uses to push her back deeper in, she keeps this pattern up for another minute, her arousal building up and up until she feels the impending orgasm build up, so she bites her lip to avoid screaming out whilst she convulses, pulling her fingers back as her nethers quake, sputtering out all manner of thick, sticky juices, the girl leaning back up against the wall to slump and enjoy the afterglow. After some time to collect herself, she pokes her fingers along her mons pubis, trying to find Mandy within, with no feeling of the girl, she leans forward to examine in front of her hips, perhaps she made her way out? It's then that she spots a good amount of thick, sticky, crimson-red fluid mixed with her own juices, somewhat soaked into the carpet... and she knows for a fact she's not on her period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh-oh, god.\" She mutters, realization setting in. Swiping up a little of the stuff with her finger to give it a taste, confirming the sweet, strawberry licorice flavor.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amy stares solemnly at the melted red candy for a good moment before taking some tissues from her purse to clean up the mess somewhat, she has her suspicion that the healers might not be able to handle it this time, as only some of it makes it onto the tissues, plenty more having stained into the carpet, and some absorbed into the inner walls of her nethers, turning them into a deeper shade of red, for now. But, the more she thinks over what she did, the less unappealing it seems to be, if it weren't for her, Mandy would have still been a turd, and she did pay for her now-melted candy state, in fact, she shudders, somewhat thrilled over how she had managed to essentially claim Mandy all for herself for one very, very pleasurable moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least you were <i>my</i> pussy-snack.\" She teases, sliding her clothes back into place, she'll miss Mandy... but won't be regretting this all too thrilling experience. After finishing cleaning as best she could, then picking up her things along with the clothes she had taken as an excuse to mess around in this changing room, Amy takes a deep breath, and makes her way back outside, trying to act as if she did nothing but try on all these outfits as she takes them back to the counter to return. Where she spots someone new, the vendor that allowed her into the changing room was a man before, while manning the counter is a girl, a late teens-looking one, in fact, a little bit shorter than Amy, but more proportional, that is to say, slimmer features, with short dark hair with a little pink hairclip within it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of these really... connected to me well.\" She forges a bit of an excuse. \"A shame, they all looked so nice at first glance.\" She speaks with a fake tone of disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk, however, looks at Amy with a penetrating glance, and forms a smirk. \"Oh, really? You sure sounded like you enjoyed yourself in there.\" She teases with a quick bob of her brows. Amy slinks back a little, fidgeting with some embarrassment, caught so easily? She was fairly sure she was quiet, and there didn't seem to be a way to look into those rooms from the inside. Before she could question the clerk, though, she lets out a giggle. \"Got something you might be interested in, though, give me a sec.\" She says, taking the returned clothes pile, then slinks off deeper into the stall, rummaging around in the back for a moment before returning with only one item, a pink pair of folded up panties, tanga style, to be specific. With what looks like runes embroidered along the waistline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" She inquires, wondering why such a thing would be recommended, and what it might do. The clerk just giggles, and unfolds the garment, revealing text on the front in bold, darker pink letters. \"Eat this!\" Printed boldly, with \"Before it eats you!\" just below it in finer text, along with an arrow just below pointing towards a sizable gap around where the cloth would cover the vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As it implies, just wearing it'll let one suck a whole person up there, it's a hot trend amongst lovers... or predators.\" The clerk explains, wearing quite the grin. Amy's blush grows quite deeper as a result, apparently this girl knew exactly what she did in there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-, I don't know about this...\" Amy stammers, a little taken back from the unexpected offer, and having been found out so easily!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't like the text? We have some without markings if you would prefer.\" The clerk offers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh, no! It's that- ah, hum...\" Amy pauses, trying to catch her breath and find the words, but... it's so very tempting. \"...How much is it?\" Amy inquires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twelve big silvers.\" The clerk responds. \"Cheap, considering most magic clothing.\" She informs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy pauses, that's going to do quite a number on the coinage she has now, would it be really worth it? Sensing the hesitation, the clerk speaks up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I could knock it down some if you'd come in back and... see a few demonstrations.\" The clerk offers, which takes Amy back some with the flirty tone, this is a little bit too forward, now! But the Clerk is quite cute... and she could use the discount.</span></div></div>",

Just before she brushes past a row of hung clothes, Amy can't help but spot the clerk's behind, which while her upper frame was quite slim, those hips were quite filled out, swaying with her steps. Giggling, Amy goes ahead and slings herself over the counter to go join the clerk, who she finds in a corner of the stall, hunched over with her rear jutted out, rummaging through an open box on the ground. She is so, so temped to reach over and give it a grope, but relents from doing something so brash, figuring if anything's going to happen, the clerk will make the first move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooow, where is it... hrm.\" The clerk mutters, before jolting back up, nothing in her hands from the back. But instead, she reaches back and gives her own rear a sharp pat. \"Ah! Now I remember! But first, let's let you give these a try, hm?\" She holds the pink panties in hand, stretching it out over her thumbs, then snaps it over at Amy playfully. \"Get it on and wait here, I'll grab a doofus for you.\" She chirps, and backs out of the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcited, Amy goes ahead and slips off her lower set of clothes once more, and before slipping on the magical garment, she slinks a finger down south, swiping up a lingering glob of Mandy hanging from her lower lips, and slurps it up, taking a moment to enjoy the flavoring before slipping the snug piece of clothing on, her hips and waist coming awash with a unique tingle momentarily once secure, then she waits. After a minute, she hears the voice of the clerk coming close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This'll be a good spot, hunk, the old man never really checks here.\" The clerk teases just before pushing through the hung coats once again, this time with some guy all melted in her arms, smooching along his neck. The guy looks pretty distracted by this as his hands slink south, gripping the clerk's protruding buttocks for a moment, that is until he spots Amy, and shoots her a confused look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's she?\" He inquires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just a customer.\" She responds, before suddenly pulling away from the guy, and pushing him down and towards Amy. \"On your knees, hunk.\" She then suddenly kicks at the back of his legs, pushing him down, his head quite close to Amy's hips, enough to make out the text on the worn panties, a sweat forming on his brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I think I'll be going now.\" He says, trying to pick himself up, but the clerk besets herself upon him, holding him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I like you right where you are.\" She giggles. \"C'mon now, he's all yours.\" She looks up at Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy doesn't need to be told twice, although she isn't sure on how to do this exactly, but she goes ahead and tries getting up onto her toe tips to get her vagina over the guy's face, and press on. After a second of grinding her lips against his nose, something gives way, and with a pop, her hips seem to give, nothing uncomfortable, quite the opposite to be exact, as the guy's head is slurped into Amy's greedy lower lips, the girl letting out a moan as he thrashes about. Letting go of his shoulders, the Clerk backs off, and watches as even without experience, Amy slides down past his shoulders, over his torso, beyond his hips... her gut bulges out with exactly how much one would expect from a person with another person inside of her, as the Clerk steps forward and gently sets Amy to lay down along with the guy, vaginal contractions quickly slurping in his flailing legs until his shoes vanish from sight into Amy with a loud, wet slurp. Throughout the experience, Amy was in heaven, she thought Mandy was good down there before, but that hardly compared to a whole person thrashing within her stretched pussy, it's too bad it happened so quickly, she didn't have much of a chance to get off, but his panicked squirms inside of her womb will definitely help that along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you think? Worth the cash?\" The clerk teases, kneeling down to stroke Amy's bulging gut, the poor guy fighting to the end within the prison of flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh, that was-oh! Ah! Somethi-oooh! Yes!\" She's definitely enjoying the sensations, and doesn't notice as the clerk stands back up, stands aside, and undoes her jeans, sliding them off, and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhmm, but now I've got something else to show you, something else, alright.\" The clerk says, drawing Amy's attention over, who notices her lack of pants and plain, blue-colored panties tucked tightly around her wide hips, until she turns around, eyes going wide when she spots the end clad over her rotund rear, a gap, much like the panties she's wearing, uncovering the gap of her cheeks, and around it in glitter, are the words. \"Exit, and entry.\" The word \"and\" double-underlined. \"A counterpart to what you have on now, here's a tryout!\" She giggles, and lets herself fall back, rear aimed for Amy's face. Amy tries to scoot out of the way, but the weight of the man trapped within her is a bit much for her to maneuver, so she soon finds herself with the plump-reared clerk sitting over her face, playfully wedging the doughy cheeks against her until... with a muffled shlurp, she finds her head plunged into the tight, heated passage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk giggles as she gives Amy her demonstration of her own panties, her anus greedily pulling the squirming girl inside, making very fast progress, even her rotund, boy-filled gut fails to slows the clerk's progress in giving Amy a tour through her lower intestine, and once that's through, the clerk reaches down, hooks her thumbs around the panties on Amy, and slides them down and off of her whilst her legs slide inside. A moment afterwards, Amy's feet slip through the gap into the clerk's body, and she effortlessly stands back up, flinging the pink panties back into the box. \"Ahhh... fun, no? Anyywayy, demonstration's over, time to get ya out, now.\" She giggles, patting her own, flat belly, and meanders over to a pot where she deposits both Amy and the boy both now in a mushy, brown kind of state more suited for being placed within such a thing, which she scoots out of the market stand. \"If you get back from the healers, stop on by and the panties'll be yours for only ninety!\" She informs, pulling back up her pants, then makes her way back to the counter.</span></div></div>",

Her reservations aside they decide to stay and hardly have they come to that decision when they feel hands on their shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy hardly notices when her friends support is replaced by others helping her, but she does notice during the clamour of the crowd that she's led away, just a few steps, but suddenly she's outside the circle along with her friends, having been guided to the back by the still somewhat damp performers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all look friendly and they haven't been rough to the girls or anything. I hope you don't mind helping out the redhead that ate Mandy giggles as their left hands are raised for them and on each thumb is placed a dark richly ornamented ring. Mandy's is even towards the tip of her thumb, but jagged towards the hand, Amy's is jagged in both directions and Bethany\u2019s is jagged towards the tip and even towards the hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that they have much time questioning anything, because the crowd goes relatively silent and Bethany is shoved through the crowd to see a woman in a tight red dress and fiery red hair that bristled and curled without actually moving more than naturally, she's wielding some kind of staff. She's not quite as trim as the other performers, but still athletic. The nearly two piece dress hugging her tight body and revealing all of her shapely legs and most of her trim stomach, the colour of it matching the other performers, but differing in cut and the way her chest bulged, this lady was well equipped up front, the dress didn't just outline those big round spheres but parted to reveal a dangerous amount of cleavage between them as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnce there was this cursed being...\u201d she said addressing the crowd narrator style while Bethany was stumbling towards her, having been given a helpful shove. The woman caught her in a fluent motion with a cloth she seemed to pick out of the air and with a flick and a puff of smoke the cloth that had enveloped Bethany was removed and in Bethany's place a hen had appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut this creature was not like other creatures...\u201d The woman continued as Amy was sent stumbling towards her like Beth had been just before. Likewise caught in the cloth another flick and puff revealed that Amy was a large scaly lizard larger than Bethany.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was not one, or two creatures...\u201d she said as Mandy stumbled towards her, likewise caught in the cloth, but unlike her friends the magician swirled the cloth around and then retrieved its contents with her hand, a bat with large leathery wings. \u201c...but three.\u201d She continued and held Mandy up for the crowd to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo \u201cOooh\u201d;s and \u201cAhhh\u201d;s and some applauce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThree creatures...\u201d The woman continued and stuffed Mandy back into the cloth, before she threw the edge of the cloth out, so that it covered Amy and Bethany and strangely caught them back up in it. Skilfully she gathered the edges until all three of them were trapped inside the bag the cloth made. Then she held the end of the bag with both hands and and pulled the lower one down so that the bag tightened onto its contents until it revealed a large tight lump at its bottom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...trapped in the same body...\u201d She said and threw the bag open making the girls tumble out of it onto the clearing, to the cheer of the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBehold the fearsome Cockatrice...\u201d The magician said motioning at the scaly creature with a fearsome chicken-like head, large leather wings, a lizard's tail and two thick chicken legs around one of which a dark ornamented ring in three parts clung. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe poked it in the side with her staff and unable to stop themselves the girls found themselves spewing out a jet of flame. It would have looked a lot more impressive seeing as it was as big as they were, if they hadn't been the size of a large chicken with a bit of extra neck and a long thick tail.<br>\r\nEven so the crowd went wild, not in the fearsome sense though, the flame hadn't been even remotely close to anyone.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWell any good story with a monster needs a hero...\u201d The magician continued and held a ball of thread as thick as yarn in one hand, it seemingly unrolling by itself and shaping itself into something in her other hand. It coiling and turning quickly forming limbs and frame for a doll it would seem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs she beautiful this heroine of ours?\u201d She asked the crowd who roared *YES!*. And the magician produced a cloth as she put the string away. It looked like a square, but as it wrapped itself around the doll it seemed to be a perfect fit, giving the doll its skin, but more over it seemed to turn into skin. Now she looked like she held a miniature pretty girl in her hand with a bit of strings for hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this hero buxom and curvy?\u201d She asked the crowd who once more roared their approval. And the girl in her hand grew wider around her hips and suddenly sported an impressive chest for her size and a likewise plump butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes she have long beautiful hair that flows behind her like a heroic cape?\u201d She wondered and as the crowd decided the stings turned into rich set of long straight golden hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs she strong?\u201d She queried and again the crowd roared yes and the soft beautiful girl in her hand tightened up significantly and grew impressive muscles, worthy of an Amanzon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes she have armour?\u201d The crowd said yes, but it wasn't that overwhelming, so the Magician produced a few shiny bits that wrapped themselves around the tiny girl, giving her a metal bikini bottom a pair of shiny kneecaps and a breastplate the size of a sportsbra that didn't leave anything to the imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes she have more armour?\u201d She wondered and got the response she wanted, a resounding *NO!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes she have a sword?\u201d Again a roaring *NO!*, which took the magician a bit by surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo she fights with her bare hands?\u201d *YES!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then! I think our heroine is ready.\u201d She said and put the tiny girl on the ground and as she did the girl seemed to spring to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls watched in confusion as the tiny girl charged towards them. That girl was supposed to be the hero right, and they the monster to be slain?<br>\r\nDoing nothing seemed like a bad idea, so Mandy managed to cough another ball of fire. The heroine leaped aside her long hair shimmering in the light of the fireball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur hero escapes the fiery fury of the fearsome beast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ball obscured their view of the hero, so as it cleared the air they saw her sprint and dive beneath them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's this, she's trying some trick?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot the place they wanted her and all three of them tried to spin around and found that even though they wanted sort of the same thing, three wills in one body was a troublesome thing. At least they didn't fall over, but they felt the hero leap up onto their back and then push away as she leaped forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur heroine shows no fear and leaps up onto the beast's back!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey turned their hear only to feel the tiny girl's hands lock onto the sides of their beak, forcing it to remain shut while she dangled in the air as their body height and neck was several times her own length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeems she's going head to head with the creature!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then they saw the little girl open her mouth and stick their beak into it, a quick shift of her grip to the back of their head shoved their whole head into her in the process, making things turn decidedly darker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, she's got it by its throat now.\u201d The magician narrated as the hero started sucking the long neck into her tiny body, it not making nearly the imprint one would expect. Then the neck soared out in all directionals as she reached the round plump body of the beast. But the hero just reached out and grabbed the base of the Cockatrice's wings and pulled the widening section into her and once her mouth was stretched as wide as the body of the beast she swallowed hard and dragged the round lump of a body into her throat and stomach, the wings folding up on their own as they avoided getting broken.<br>\r\nThen sitting down on her bottom the hero continued to swallow again and again, taking in a good portion of the tail each time, until her lips closed behind the creature and her throat returned to normal, leaving her with a round lumpy belly as wide as she was tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThus did our heroine defeat the fearsome Cockatrice.\u201d The lady in the red dressed continued and bowed, while the audience applauded and tossed coins into the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bowed several times before the crowd started settling down and by then the hero's stomach had lost its rough edges and started shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut the story doesn't end there.\u201d The magician continued silencing the last people still cheering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo while she sat there savouring her victory our heroine had neglected one thing...\u201d She continued as the hero's stomach kept shrinking and with a quick flamboyant swirl the magician turned around and with a crackle that sent the dust at her feet up into the air she changed. So as the dust fell back down again she stood there, no longer red, but black. As fiery as her hair had been it was now shimmering black as ink and no longer did it curl, but draped her pale shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe had forgotten the evil witch that had conjured the foul beast in the first place.\u201d She said stepping forward to the tiny girl busy digesting her meal on the ground and picked her up with her right index finger and thumb. Dangling the heroine who now only looked pregnant before her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFishing the heroine's legs out of the air with her tongue, before slowly dragging her in with it, until at last the hero's helplessly struggling arms were pulled inside, being replaced by the witch's tongue as she licked her lips and swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at her belly and grinned as she gave it a little rub before throwing her head back and let loose an evil laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she sobered up and her colours returned, her red dress and hair. Once again the narrator and not the witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd against this wicked witch the hero stood no chance. And that folks, is how the story ends.\u201d she said with a bow, and unnoticed by the audience she coughed up the ring as she did. Standing back up she smiled, feeling hero and fiend hurry on south.</span></div></div>",

Instead the cloth is gathered up around them in the blink of an eye by a fiery haired woman in a tight red dress, the same red as the performers and she shows almost as much skin in the middle making the dress nigh a two piece that ends just shy of her rump. <br>\r\nHolding the gathered up ends of the cloth in one hand and pulling them through her hand with the other, not a whole lot of cloth seems to be dragged through, but the bag containing the three girls quickly shrinks, until she appears to just be holding a large napkin folded into a bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole thing taking just a few seconds and with a couple of nimble steps the woman is gone again, having disappeared into a draped stall, that when one saw the inside was clearly set up for the performers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she put down the bag on a relatively small table the girls inside it found themselves in the gloom of the tent like stall and all around were various tools, toys and contraptions that the performers could use, or had used at some point in their shows. But what really caught their eyes was the gigantic woman standing next to the table, her lower belly pressed against its side and from there she loomed on over them impossibly high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked like she was about to say something when blinding light filled the room behind her while loud rustling filled the air, as someone pulled the fabrics aside and came inside.<br>\r\nThe towering woman turned her head a bit but didn't show any surprise as the other woman hurried around and stepped up to another edge of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls recognised this new towering giantess, it was the dark haired girl in a ponytail that had just swallowed the rest of the performers with the help of a rope. By the sound of her stomach though it hadn't been allowed to keep them.<br>\r\n\u201cTwo are mine.\u201d She said as a matter of factly, but still added \u201cIt was my show.\u201d as if she still had to rectify her claim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, then I choose this one.\u201d The woman in the dress said and with a smooth swift hand plucked Amy from the table before either of the girls had time to react, they then watched in horror as the woman put Amy's feet into her mouth. Then while Amy screamed futilely and barely loud enough for even Bethany and Mandy to hear her through the racket coming from outside, the woman slowly sucked the rest of Amy into her mouth, soaked her with her tongue for a few seconds, before with an audible swallow sending the blonde down her throat. The small bulge in it vanishing as Amy passed the woman's collarbones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandy and Beth didn't get to follow her journey further than that, as they were both picked up, one girl dangling from the fingers of each hand of the ropecharmer. She didn't put up any fancy show, she did that on stage, now she was just hungry. So she lifted Bethany over her tilted back head and dropped the girl straight down her open throat, so that Beth passed her pert breasts about the same time Amy was shoved down passed the large orbs of the girl in the dress, entering their respective stomachs at roughly the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it was Mandy's turn. She just recalled how she'd been through this before and it worked out okay because of her friends, this time she'd probably remain in the resulting form. And before she finished that line of thought she was being dropped in after Beth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding when she joined her screaming friend that the stomach had already started churning and filling up with juices. Luckily it was as bad as the redhead's had been, so the two of them melted away in mere moments and continued into the woman's intestines.<br>\r\nShe stood there rubbing her trim belly while she relished the feeling of the two girls inside her taking care of her hunger. But she had a job to do, so she turned to leave. \u201cThanks.\u201d She called back to the woman in the dress, before she exited the tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remaining woman realized that she couldn't stand there enjoying the blonde girl's futile struggles forever either, so she set her stomach upon its task, and as a result Amy didn't start digesting before her friends had already made their way to their predator's large intestine.<br>\r\nAnd unlike her friends she had to make the journey alone, not that it mattered perhaps, there wasn't much left in the end of either of them and once she reached the fiery haired woman's tight round bottom she wasn't alone, a few girls and boys were there awaiting the woman's next restroom visit. Amy squeezed in amongst them and did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Amy's demise the last key to their portal was also destroyed and a couple of dozen stalls away the door they had come through started to fade away. Likewise in Amy's walk in closet the arch, rings and symbols vanished, leaving not a trace that anything suspect had ever occurred there, except perhaps for the girls' hasty rearrangement of the closet's previous contents.</span></div></div>",

What the? Where's my clothes!?\" She calls out, reflexively pulling back to break out of her company's grasp, then slinking an arm around her chest, and the other covering her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy and Bethany turn around to catch Mandy again, but freeze in place when they both find the Daughter of Hela standing right behind her, just a second ago, she was at the far side of the chamber! Her appearance makes the two hesitate, but fortunately, her expression doesn't show anything negative. Looking at her friends freezing up, looking at something behind and above her, Mandy turns as well, letting out a surprised gasp to see the imposing figure so close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need clothes, do you?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-who are y-\" Mandy asks, still trying to grasp the situation, and is interrupted as both Amy and Bethany come up to her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's not too much trouble... but we don't have anything more to give.\" Amy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Daughter just nods. \"It won't be, please hold still.\" Amy and Bethany both prepare to take a step back to give the Daughter more space, but she reaches forward, laying a hand on one of each girls' shoulders, and firmly grasping them. Before either girl could think to resist, they both feel themselves go completely limp, muscles not budging one inch. Helpless to do anything but watch, they see the daughter close her eyes, and thick mist begins to flow from her hands, engulfing the girls and completely hiding them from vision. Mandy, utterly confused as to what's going on, takes a step back, right in time to see the mist compact into the large woman's hands, forming up closer, and closer, before suddenly dissipating, and in her left hand is now a black over lace bra, and in her right is a gold-colored thong. She hands both towards Mandy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what just happened?\" Mandy speaks, still confused, taking the pair of undies in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your friends brought you here for healing, and now, they'll be the clothes you requested.\" The woman answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Healing, but wh-...\" Mandy pauses, just now beginning to recall the final seconds of sliding down that girl's throat, and then her belly... she barely lasted for seconds. \"...oh. But my friends! What about them? I didn't want clothes like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Daughter opens her mouth to speak...</span></div></div>",

Next comes the somewhat frilly lace bra, which she quickly dons as well, fortunately, she fits better than Amy, who's a little bit on the tight side. With her bits covered at least, she turns and makes her way out, still embarrassed to be going about as she is, but at least she just needs to make it home an-, then it hits her. The three of them all needed their wands to make their way through... hers got digested, and Amy and Bethany's are now part of the underwear clad against her, and thus is unsure if she could get back through to home. And she didn't even make it five minutes before she was packed into some girl's colon before, how's she supposed to make it twelve hours with nothing to her name but her friends grinding against her privates?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, yes, grinding, something that's now come to Mandy's attention is the fact that her clothes seem to be shifting slightly around her, as if twitching on their own. It seems that the two girls are able to hold some manner of control over their new forms, much to Mandy's pleasure and embarrassment. \"Ah! Cool it you two! You'll be back later, I promise!\" She assures, unsure if the two can even hear her, but Bethany seems to stop after that, but Amy... continues to grind against her, causing a bit of moistness and a blush on Mandy's part. \"I said... cut it out! We can fool around in a much better time.\" She huffs, and tugs at the side of Amy, stretching her out somewhat until she stops as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her new skivvies under control, Mandy then starts in on her way out and... oh my, where is out? Mandy was busy with having been digested to take record of how her friends got here, but she does wander down the passage that she woke up to her friends carrying her towards, eventually reaching a chamber featuring a, fancy red carpet scheme, a massive, very ornate looking wooden door, and some other plain looking passageways leading out, what should she do?</span></div></div>",

And I know for a fact that you have nothing to bargain with. Now, please be gone until you do, we do not take well to loiterers.\" She commands, moving on to head back to the door she had been summoned through, each step putting a fair bit of sway in her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandy was fuming, quite maddened by the sudden loss of her friends, and with no prior knowledge of the respect this woman's presence seemed to demand, she tactlessly storms after her. \"Hey! You're really just going to walk away after what you pulled? You didn't give any warning about it!\" The woman stops, and turns toward Mandy, hands over her hips and carrying a none too pleasant looking expression on her face. She lets out a sigh, and with a gesture of her hands, Mandy is lifted off of the ground. The started girl dropping the undergarments from the shock, and beginning to flail about in the air. \"Hey, what the heck?\" Without giving response, the Daughter moves again, this time back to the altar she had used to bring Mandy back, the girl floating along behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that she had just gotten into a bad situation, Mandy tries a change in attitude. \"Okay, okay, I get the point! Let me down, please! I just want my friends back! I'm sorry!\" She tries to plead in her helpless state, but with a gesture of a hand, the woman sends Mandy onto the altar, a force holding her spread eagle on the surface. The woman steps up close, and pauses, looking down at Mandy, quite displeased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-look, I'm sorry that I... didn't listen. J-just let me go and I'll be on my way!\" Mandy tries one last time, but the Daughter ignores her, simply closing her eyes and laying her palms upon the altar. The same force holding Mandy still pressing against her jaw, forcibly keeping her mouth shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Hela, dear Hela, I bequeath unto you a gift. One with no respect nor appreciation. May you dole out whatever just fate your wisdom sees fit.\" The woman chants, and upon completion, Mandy lets out a muffled squeal as she feels herself... falling, falling into some manner of portal. Unable to rotate herself, Mandy watches as the portal gains more and more distance, then finally closes altogether. After another second, she feels a shadow coming over her, followed by the sight of the inner side of a set of titanic teeth as she falls backwards into a massive mouth, soon impacting onto a soft, slimy tongue and still unable to even move her neck about to look around, she slides back, and is soon claimed by a throat, carried down through a tight, fleshy tube into a roomier chamber, one which she freefalls in for a second before splashing into fluid which fizzles all around. The girl doesn't even last a split moment before her body is dissolved by the divine digestive drive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Mandy dealt with, the Daughter turns back to head back to where she came, coming across the mismatched undergarments where Mandy had dropped them. \"Hm, waste not, I suppose.\" Picking them up, she magically adjusts their size, then slips them on for herself, giggling somewhat as she feels them subtly shift on her body on their own. Once fitted, she then continues on, dooming Amy and Bethany to cling onto her curves for quite a long time to come.</span></div></div>",

Bethany looks up and takes a deep breath, taking in the air, free of the modern pollutions marring their own world, although filled with myriad scents of hay and animal odors, a unique kind of smell for the three, accustomed to cities. Amy takes her look of the crowd, examining how they hustle and bustle about, listening to the chattering coming from all ends of haggling and merriment, as she gazes, she spots Mandy moving on in direction of the pigs, and swiftly, she reaches on to stop her, grasping the neck of her shirt<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold it there!\" She calls, stopping her friend in her tracks. Mandy turns, agitated from being stopped, and waiting for a reason why, Bethany looking back, wondering much the same. \"Let's not go hurrying into the unknown, now. We should get back.\" Amy cautions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandy and Bethany cross their arms, silently staring at Amy like she's some kind of killjoy waiting for a good reason why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, we all want to go exploring, yes, but I mean, think about it. What if the portal expires? I sure don't want to be stuck on this end. We should go over the book some more to figure things out, and bring supplies, water, snacks, maybe some extra spending money.\" Amy reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know they'll even take our money?\" Mandy questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good note, I think we're fine sticking with what we have, money-wise, I mean.\" Bethany responds, looking up to gaze at the shining sun, then back down to the crowd. \"Wouldn't want to get thirsty in the middle of that.\" She adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three nod in agreement, and they all turn back toward the stall they came from, Amy staying behind the others to make sure nobody ends up wandering off, anyway. Wand in hand, Bethany is the first to reach the portal, passing through it, followed by Mandy, then after knowing her friends are through, Amy goes back through as well, all three girls finding themselves back in the familiar space of the closet. Though, Bethany, turned to watch Amy emerge, witnesses the arch forming the portal quickly shift into a dull gray. Curiously, she pokes her wand at it once more, producing no particular reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hrm.\" Bethany groans. \"Seems it's out of power, maybe?\" She hypothesizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandy is the next to speak up. \"But it's still there, we just need a little more stuff to recharge it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe.\" Bethany replies. \"I'll try looking through the book for more info. Amy, since this is your place, why don't you go pack the snacks and such-Oh my gosh!\" She suddenly outbursts, pointing towards Amy's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy recoils in surprise from the sudden call out, and Mandy is the next to notice the oddity, her eyes going wide. Confused, Amy turns to look back at the portal... nothing new there, then she feels something shift on her left shoulder? A bug? Maybe, judging by Bethany's call, it must be a big one, a scary thought! On reflex, she moves her hand over to try to swat the thing off, but amazingly, her hand is stopped, her head turning afterwards to finally see what's started the other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whooaaa, easy there! About time you all noticed!\" The cheerful, feminine voice of the tiny figure sitting on Amy's shoulder calls out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-a fairy?\" Amy responds out of surprise, getting her look at the dainty, unclothed, light-skinned figure, which is no taller than six inches with, at her proportions, a modest, lightweight figure, no bigger than a b-cup if she were the size of a normal person. The most striking of her appearance is the clear, dragonfly-like wings protruding from her back, idly and slowly fluttering, and her hair, short, but a very vibrant green. She's especially light for even her size, considering Amy hadn't even felt her until now, yet somehow she had managed to reach out and stop the swatting hand without much effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bingo!\" The fairy responds, crossing her legs and releasing Amy's hand, now that she's sure she isn't mistaken for some killer bug.</span></div></div>",

The fairy detects the awkward silence, and shakes her head. \"Bunch of quiet ones, are you? Never seen a fairy before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, actually. We just figured out about all this just recently.\" Bethany responds, prompting Kytessa to giggle for a long moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wow! You're a gang of newbie witches, I guess? Oh, man, are you all in for a kick.\" She responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, about that.\" Bethany responds. \"I figure you could tell us about your world a little, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKytessa giggles once more, sitting back up. \"I'll tell you as much as I'd care to ask about yours! It's all about discovery and possibility, It'd spoil all the fun if you all knew what's what! You all are gonna have to just dive in and discover, like I did, and I'm gonna do here!\" She makes some simple, wide gestures with her arms as she speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rather unhelpful response gets a quiet grumble out of Bethany, who opens her mouth to elaborate, but Amy beats her to the punch with her own question. \"So that's why you followed us? You want to explore our world like we were doing yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite, I just saw you hanging around and sensed you're quite in touch with nature. Plus you're kinda cute!\" Kytessa explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy blushes slightly as a result of the compliment. \"In touch with nature? I... can't say I agree, I never did much gardening or the sort.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKytessa's wings begin to flutter with more gusto, and she takes to the air, maneuvering in front of Amy's face. \"Pff, you don't have to. I'm a nature fairy!\" She points out, prodding at her hair, signifying the vibrant green of it. \"I sense these things, and you're prime material for being one with nature!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy reflexively takes a step back in reflex of Kytessa going right up in her face. \"Okay, okay, but just what do you mean, exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKytessa crosses her arms, fluttering in place. \"Think I'll show you, then!\" And without further warning, the fairy leans forward, and opens her mouth. It doesn't stop there, though, Amy's eyes going wide as she steps back once more, watching Kytessa's jaws stretch open more, and more, staring into the open abyss of the fairy's gullet. \"Hey, wai-\" She's cut off when Kytessa juts forward, and engulfs Amy's head, somehow swallowing the girl up with much haste, Amy's body sliding headfirst into Kytessa, whose belly only bulges out to grapefruit-size, albeit distorted into the vague shape of Amy's trapped, curled up form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBethany and Mandy both rush forward to assist their friend, but by the time they come within reach, Amy's toes vanish between Kytessa's lips, and the fairy quickly flutters up into the upper corner of the closet, maneuvering between them to keep out of reach of the other girls as they try reaching and leaping to catch her. \"Give me a moment, will you two?\" Kytessa protests, the fairy's swaying gut emitting wet growling noises as it over the course of a minute, begins to smooth out, and shrink away, Kytessa's belly soon settling into the size of an egg... until she lets out a belch, which makes it settle back to flatness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaand, we're done!\" She pleasantly calls out, turns to shake her cute 'lil rump at the two girls below, and squats into the air, grunting, and on cue, out comes the \"naturalized\" Amy, now in the form of...</span></div></div>",

The tiny woman's belly had still been bulging quite a bit, but her stomach was empty when Bethany arrived inside it, apart from a bit of trapped gasses. Mandy had already left for the green haired woman's intestines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKytessa looked around as her belly swelled out to what compared to her frame would qualify as immensely. She found a purchase and flew over to the metal bar crossing the length of the room along the wall, choosing a portion where the coat-hangers had been removed and seated herself upon it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere she sat while humming some tune and caressing her quickly shrinking gut. It wasn't long before she released a girlish burp and her belly turned completely flat once more. She shifted her seat in response, so that her bottom hung out a bit over the bar behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunting something started to emerge from her tight bottom again, this time it was Mandy, who looked indistinguishable from Amy. And hardly had Mandy left before Bethany slipped out after her and fell to the floor as well.<br>\r\nNow all three girls had been reduced to fairy droppings, a pretty potent form of fertilizer, perhaps not too surprising considering what went into the makings of the tiny lumps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy that had made them though looked a bit annoyed. \u201cAs good as that felt and all I thought you girls were supposed to be witches, however green.\u201d She complained out loud in general, it wasn't like the girls could hear her anymore. <br>\r\nKytessa felt cheated, she'd hoped to absorb some magical energies, but there'd hardly been any, the ones that she got, unbeknownst to her, had probably been from digesting the keys to the portal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks up in surprise as she finally notices the portal fading away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d She protests as she shoves herself off of the metal bar and takes to her wings again, but before she even reaches the portal it is gone. \u201cI didn't mean for THAT to happen!\u201d She says crossing her arms over her chest is frustration. \u201cNow this is just great...\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bethany and Mandy watch on as Kytessa continues to grunt, putting forth some seriously effort into Amy's exit from her body. They've both stopped their efforts of catching her, figuring that there was nothing more they could do for Amy by this point. But instead of the foul, brown mass once would expect to emerge from a creature's rear, a smooth, round, green lump emerges from the fairy's tiny anus, the matter soon dropping free, Kytessa quickly flutters down to catch it, then present it to the two girls below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ta-daaaa!\" She proudly announces, showing off Amy's new green, rounded form. About a centimeter and a half in diameter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what is it?\" Bethany bites the bullet, and asks. She can wrap her head around how her friend was just swallowed and apparently digested by this tiny figure, but this is too much!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Amy, silly!\" Kytessa chides, fluttering towards the closet's door. \"C'mon, let's go plant her!' Hoisting Amy against her with one arm, and hooking her other around the knob, she manages to turn it and push the door open by her own strength alone, and flutters around Amy's room briefly before escaping into the backyard through her window. Flabbergasted into silence, the two remaining girls pursue, although with a significant detour to make their way to the backdoor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the backyard, the two pause, since Kytessa took the window, the two have lost track of the fairy's path, and such a little thing is sure to be difficult to find in the backyard, let alone if she left the property altogether! \"I'll take the left half, you get the right.\" Mandy commands Bethany, who gives an acknowledging nod before the two begin their search, being especially thorough to check around all the plots of bare dirt. Fortunately, it takes a few moments before Bethany spots a glimmer of light coming from behind some bushes, and after making her way through them, she spots Kytessa, sat cross-legged, sprinkling some sparkling powder onto a small mound of dirt, which presumably houses Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing the rustling of the bushes, Kytessa turns toward Bethany and shakes her head in disappointment. \"Slowpokes, waiting 'til I get all the work done before showing up!\" She playfully chides, then makes a long, fluttering hop away from the dirt mound, then watch it attentively. Bethany takes a step back as well, making some distance between herself and Kytessa, she'd like to be able to react if she tries anything funny again, then calls Mandy over, who dashes to her friend's aid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You found her? Where is sh- oh!\" Mandy speaks, pointing toward the dirt mound, bringing Bethany's attention back to it, where she notices a small, green sprout had emerged from the ground, which grows with such haste to be easily noticeable. The girls watching in silence, the sprout quickly grows into a thick stalk which coils along the ground, which soon stops as a small growth forms on the end, its appearance growing reminiscent of a pea pod as time goes on. After a couple minutes have passed, the growing pod begins to bulge, and the girls can detect some kind of movement coming from within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy?\" Bethany speaks, leaning closer until Kytessa suddenly flutters into her face, hands over her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Don't think about interrupting Nature, now!\" She cautions, prompting Bethany to back off, and Kytessa returns to watching the growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, the growth seems to stop the wiggling bulge begins to take into a somewhat more humanoid shape, and confused, panicked groans can be heard from within. More than once Mandy and Bethany consider coming forward to peel open the pod, but neither want to incur Kytessa's wrath, and give her a reason to give them a tour through her digestive tract. A couple minutes pass with nothing new happening, until Kytessa breaks the silence with a cheerful announcement of \"Almost done!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, just after she speaks, the pod begins to change color, shifting yellow and beginning to wither, and just as it turns brown, the squirming figure within manages to break it open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy?\" Mandy calls out, spotting her friend emerging from the plant, but changed, definitely changed. For starters, her skin now looks much smoother and shiner than it had been before, and has taken upon a light green color, her hair, being blonde before, was now a deeper, bushier blue, with deep blue flowers budding from it. Crawling out from the pod, Amy takes one look at her own arms before her eyes go wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-green!?\" She cries out in panic and confusion. In her perspective, she was trapped inside of Kytessa's churning stomach before she had passed out, and when she came to, she found herself in a less heated, smooth, yet tight prison, and now that she had broken out of it, this is what she had discovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do to her?\" Bethany demands an explanation from Kytessa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKytessa doesn't answer, instead seeming to be too busy admiring Amy's new look, until a good ten seconds pass and she peeps out a simple. \"What did I say about discovery, now?\" Not even turning to face her, seemingly entranced by the transformed Amy.</span></div></div>",

(As in meet one character in one thread, then unless something has happened, they will be much the same in another, if come across.)<br>\r\nOnce all \"keys\" to a door is destroyed the door disappears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------<br>\r\nThere wasn't anything really special about them, three average high school girls, Mandy and Bethany of average height and Amy the shorter a little thicker and curvier blonde. Nothing unusual, Bethany might have the pale complexion and the dark hair from her British heritage, but not the accent. And Mandy though pretty enough didn't really stand out from any other East Coast-brunette her age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had struck it off almost from the fist day of high school, sure they got plenty of friends besides as well, some good too, but the three of them had always hung out. So by the end of their third year they were close enough to take almost all the same classes just to be together.<br>\r\nOne they had ended up choosing, for their senior year, was one that didn't sound like too much work, but that by the looks of things would give them plenty of time to work on it and at the same time, probably because of the time allocated to the project do wonders for their final scores if they could get a decent grade in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter asking the teachers they found out that they could work in groups, so the three of them could work together. They could also choose any subject they wanted to, since the subject wasn't the important part of the project, but the form.<br>\r\nThe task was to produce an article suitable for publication, the girls obviously didn't have a clue as to what kind of effort was put into a proper article and the research behind it, be it scientific, historical, or any other kind of themed article, you can write about a very nerdy or weird subject, but you need to be knowledgeable about it and present that knowledge in a believable way to be taken serious, especially by the people interested in the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey could all see themselves writing for some paper after school, not that they were writing for the school paper or anything, but a girl can dream, besides if they could manage a good article that'd probably be valued higher than school paper experience anyhow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the project set in their upcoming schedule the three started talking about what the heck they should write about and they went through hundreds of topics from serious to really immature, male penises and the nature of the female orgasm amongst them. <br>\r\nIt wasn't until they started talking about what they were going to do over the summer break and Amy mentioned that she was going to spend most of it with her family in some dead end of a forgotten road that neither of the other girls had heard of and she said that it was less than an hour from Salem, so she hoped that she would at least get to see a proper witch up there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds like a great subject!\u201d Mandy had exclaimed and the other two had agreed, they'd all keep an eye out for witch things over the summer and if it didn't seem like a good subject when they reunited next semester they could always choose a different topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBethany should like Amy spend most of her summer with her family, but on the other side of the World, in England, her dad being an Englishman, perhaps not so proper, but he liked to sing that he was 'a legal alien' often enough. <br>\r\nShe had feared that they'd be stuck at his brother's house all summer, but it turned out that they were road tripping a bit, mostly in Scotland viewing a few old castles and what not, but mostly whiskey breweries, Beth's mom had quite enough of that, so the road trip was cut a bit short much to her dad and uncle's disappointment. <br>\r\nAfter that they made made a few excursions, more planned, Beth's mom and uncle\u2019s wife having sought to that. At least Beth ended up visiting Stonehenge, which she thought was pretty witchy, but it was when they spent nearly a week in London visiting Madame Tussaud\u2019s Wax-museum and such that she found her way into weird shops and stores, an antique store in Old England really is old and worthy of the name antique, unlike the stores she'd been used to using the name. She bought a few things because she wanted some souvenirs and they looked cool.<br>\r\nThe experience made her contemplate the fact that things here really were old, the castles she'd seen in Scotland were as old and older than the US is today when the US was new and Stonehenge was much older still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo while her mother and uncle's wife went shopping and her dad and uncle went pubbing, she looked for old book stores and not, figuring that maybe she could find something on witches here. True enough there were plenty of books on the subject, but nothing really old or interesting, she still ended up buying a couple since they looked like serious attempts on covering the history of witchcraft and what not, but there were nothing about actual spells or such which was what she really wanted. <br>\r\nThe day after they had passed the London library on their way to see Big Ben and figured that if there were anyone what'd store very old books for a very long time it'd be libraries, so she told her party to go on without her only to find that this library was for members only, sure anyone could become a member, but the library wasn't that old and occult books just didn't seem like their style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'London library' had sounded pretty official though so if it wasn't, what the heck was the city library called and where was it? <br>\r\nWith her cellphone's aid it wasn't that hard to figure out, nor find and they seemed more the genuine deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a hunch she'd gone directly to the nerdiest looking librarian she could find and asked for help, figuring that the books she really wanted was probably in storage.<br>\r\nThat turned out to be a good move, generally the day to day business for a librarian is little more than cleaning up after people, returning books and magazines to their proper place on one shelf or another, but what some of them were more interested in was that search for knowledge and the dusty mysteries of old times past.<br>\r\nSo this gentleman in his late thirties turned out to be just one of those, any reason to get to go down in the old vaults was a good reason, not that the vaults here were that old, but their contents were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd led her to a computer terminal and gone through the obligatory searches that he was supposed to do, and at first he had thought that she just wanted the latest twilight book or what not, but got ever the more intrigued when she told him to stop being silly.<br>\r\nSeveral searches later and going through the lists of resulting hits those had generated, the two of them hadn't found a single book that sounded interesting that wasn't published in the nineteen hundreds, which wasn't what she was looking for, much to the librarian's satisfaction.<br>\r\nSo he disappeared down a set of stairs and returned soon enough with a cart loaded with old books. She thought she could even see a light shimmer of sweat on his forehead. Perhaps he'd thought she might tire and go away while he was gone, or was he that exited?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way it turned out to be the old index books, listing stuff from before the age of computers, sure enough most that was in them was in the system nowadays, but not all of it, which was his point and opportunity to nerd it out librarian style.<br>\r\nThis was a bit more time consuming than she had first realized, so she feared she was taking up too much of his time, but he assured her that wasn't the case at all. The hits he managed to gather from these books sounded a lot more promising, luckily the books also contained a shorter description of the items and that way they could dismiss them without going to retrieve the items in question. After a couple of hours though she thought it prudent to ask if he wanted something to eat, he had trouble with a young pretty lady buying him lunch but couldn't very well say no either and they had like four different places at the library serving food so at least she got his staff discount. And during their break he got to know about her school project and managed to figure out what she was really looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus as they got back he scratched most of the items of interest on the list they had made so far and an hour later it still wasn't as big as it had been, but there were at least a few things on it so he let her come down to the vaults, not that she was allowed inside, but there was a table for her to sit at outside and he brought her book after book to flip through while he went in search of the next one.  She found it kind of weird to sit in a dark space with no windows paging old dusty books while wearing gloves, but at the same time she got part of the air that he obviously liked about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe books he found were really quite interesting, one about witch hunting that seemed to contain first hand stories from real witch hunters. Another of a clergyman on the witch burnings when they happened. Unfortunately they were all books she couldn't borrow, she could sit here and flip through them but that was about it, and she hadn't brought her notebook, not even pen and paper so the best she could do was take notes on her phone and hope that her school or local library could borrow them for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was one book that when he came with it to her he smiled a lot. \u201cYou might like this one...\u201d He said \u201c... It was just listed as a manuscript, no title, and under occult. Apparently it was given to the library after someone died and it's never been borrowed since the library acquired it in eighteen forty nine. Never even been brought forward for someone to read from as far as I can tell. And clearly it's a lot older than the eighteen hundreds.\u201d He said with satisfaction and placed it gently down in front of her. \u201cHave a look.\u201d He added and opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could see that it was handwritten and full of symbols, even scrutinizing the text she had trouble reading it, there was nothing wrong with the handwriting, but it was very elaborate and the language was anything but modern. The symbols and weird drawings that showed up on every other page let her believe that this might be a real life spell book.<br>\r\nThis, this was exactly what she had hoped to find, there was just one thing, she was leaving England in a few days and this was probably not one of the books she could borrow anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe librarian had calmed her though, usually you can't borrow books that old, but oddly enough this book wasn't on any no borrow list. It could have to do with no one paying it any attention for over a century and a half, which was also the reason he figured that she could have it for a year, until she came back next year to visit her family. There was a bit of paperwork, with her not even being a British citizen and all, but he helped her with that, if no one had shown any interest in the book the last hundred and sixty years, why would they do so now all of a sudden?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd given her a case to carry and keep it in and a pair of gloves to use while handling it. With that she'd been off and really eager to explore its mysteries, but while she was in England she just couldn't, both because her family kept her busy enough and because she feared that her pesky cousins might ruin the book if they found her reading it.</td>",
