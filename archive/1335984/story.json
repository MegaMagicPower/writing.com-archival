Witch Tim had found after tripping clumsily over a root and getting soaked.<br>\r\n     \"Guys.....are you sure we should be here....\" The brown-haired teen said, attempting to unstick his dripping sweater from his medium sized pot belly. \"I mean...they say a witch lives here.\"<br>\r\n     \"Well my chubby friend, that is exactly why we're here.\" The tall, pale, zit-faced goth boy replied, patting Tim's bulging stomatch. \"We need her to give us amazing bods.\"<br>\r\n      \"What ever happened to hard work and exercise Tony?\" a scrawny blonde boy said climbing over a large log.<br>\r\n       \"You see Marcus,\" Tony replied flipping his long black hair out of his eyes. \"You attempted excercise and you went from my shirt size,\" he said patting his small paunch, which looked very large suffocated under Tony's tight black wifebeater,\"to a size zero.\" Tony took a quick jab at Marus' ribcage, causing him to stumble backwards.<br>\r\n        \"Cut it out!\" Marcus yelled.<br>\r\n       \"Hey ladies!\" Tim yelled back at the two boys, \"Quit kissing and get up here!\"<br>\r\n        \"Why?\"Marcus screamed, still angery for the skinny joke. \"We're here.\" he said, pointing to a small hut, perched in two trees.<br>\r\n        The threesome walked up to the small rope ladder that hung down from almost the doorstep. One by one they climbed it, each making sure the one behind him was following. When they reached the doorstep, it was Tony that knocked.<br>\r\n         Upon the opening of the door, all three were sprayed with water! A|n old woman holding pot was screaming, \"I TOLD YOU DAMN PEOPLE I'LL HAVE THE RENT WHEN I HAVE IT!!! Ohh...I'm sorry...\" That was all she could say after seeing the frightened figures of three saturated teens standing at her doorway.<br>\r\n      \"So....uhh...how old are all of you?\" she said after hustling all the boys in and sitting them all down by the fire. \"Fourteen.\" Each replied.<br>\r\n      \"You all must be freezing!\" she stated. \"Take off those wet shirts, I'll find you something dry to wear.\"<br>\r\n      \"Thank you,\" Tony replied \"but were fine real...ARE YOU A WITCH?\" Marcus interjected. The other boys simply stared at him, but the old woman. Her eyes turned red, and the door to the small hut slammed shut on it's own. The crickets that were chirping outside suddenly silenced, as if knowing to say nothing more.<br>\r\n       \"Why would you say that?\" She said, slowly making her way toward Marcus, who was sitting on large aligator skinned couch. \"What are you?\" she said suddenly in front of him, grasping his bony arm. \"A hunter? A werewolf? An insurance salesman?\"<br>\r\n       \"We're just three kids that want better bods!\" Tim blurted out, trying to save their lives! It worked apparently, he thought, because the woman released Marcus and stood up.<br>\r\n       Sprirals of red smoke surrounded her and after the smoke cleared left in the old woman's place was a chubby green girl, around the age of seventeen wearing a tight black leather one piece, she looked up, a black witches hat on her head, long, silky green hair spilling out the back of her cap.<br>\r\n       \"Now,\" she said smiling, \"let's........</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Now,\" she says, \"let's fix you up, shall we?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then waves her hands and says an incantation that none of the boys understands. When she stops, they are suddenly surrounded by a billowing black and purple fog, impairing all of their vision. I causes them all to start coughing and doubling over, none aware of the effects the fog was taking on their bodies. When the fog disappeared, they hacked up a couple more coughs and then were able to stand up straight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of them noticed anything different about each other. In fact, they were standing in Marcus's bedroom, his weights stacked evenly on the rack next to his bed. His sports gear stowed away in his closet. It seemed perfectly ordinary tot hem and the outside world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the witch who performed the spell knew the difference. She knew they came from pudgy and scrawny to lean and brawny. She also was the only one who knew that this wouldn't last forever. At some point, who knows when, these current popular jocks would be lost to a \"college body\" per say, or in simple terms, a weight gain that is inevitable.</span></div></div>",
