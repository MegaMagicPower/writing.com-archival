The Revived Sith Empire continues to push at the very boundaries of the truce they have held with the Great Republic for 40 galactic years now. Thousands of governments, militaries, individuals and even corporations have begun to offer their allegiances to both sides of this cold conflict in anticipation of something far more devastating. The future however, remains shrouded in mystery and uncertainty...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rise with the Sun, and step out of your home to bathe in it.

Pain means nothing to you, for you are a Sith. In front of you, beyond the reach of the sunlight stands the Forbidden Temple. It stands solitary and far from the Valley of the Dark Lords in the wastes of Korriban, having been constructed shamefully by false Sith who hoped to use it as both a fortress and a strong hiding place against true Sith. They were exterminated without any honour; it was more similar to pest control. 'Good riddance' you think to yourself as you replay the information you had recently learned from a holocron in your head.<br>\r\n\"Thek\", a distant yet harsh voice calls from behind you.<br>\r\nYou turn and watch as you are approached by a man clad entirely in a dark robe which covers all of him except for his shoes and the lower half of his face, which appears to be of a lighter complexion.<br>\r\nAs he draws nearer to you, you recognise him as you Master, Darth Gall. Your response is appropriate, and you kneel before him as a sign of both respect and submission to his greater wisdom and power.<br>\r\n\"Acolyte\", he begins once he is closer, \"this shall be your next trial\".<br>\r\n\"What would you have me do?\", you ask confidently, head bowing low to the ground and yet feeling deserving of some greater challenge. <br>\r\nYou are the most powerful of the acolytes, regardless of whether that is seen by your masters or the other acolytes. They are blind fools who do not recognise your true power.<br>\r\n\"Inside of here is a false Sith acolyte. Much like you, he was powerful and ruthless, maybe moreso than you. But he has fallen from glory and has accepted the false teachings of those who built this disgrace of a temple. Now he cowers inside. You are to end his pitiful existence, and bring me his lightsaber and his head as proof\", he states, almost goadingly at times. Does he doubt your power?<br>\r\n\"It will be done... Master\", you state almost hesitantly, though hesitantly out of anger, not fear or worry.<br>\r\nHow dare he suggest that there is an  acolyte greater than you?! Does he not understand your power. You turn your eyes to face him and catch a glimpse of your Master leaving, returning to the Sith Academy. You climb to your feet and march toward the entrance of the Forbidden Temple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark door of temple stands proudly tall, taller than yourself, and unscathed. From what you had studied from the holocron earlier, this very door stood impenetrable to any attempt made to breach it when the true Sith purged the false Sith from it decades earlier. None of those Sith had been as powerful as you are now however. You may only be permitted to wield a training saber at current, but your control over the force is greater than and more powerful than anyone has ever seen or known. You stand before the entrance and reach your hands towards opposite corners of the door. Your hands clench, and almost immediately you feel the force streaming from you and into the door. Your hands clench more and more and you begin to bring them closer together as the door rattles and squeaks in response to your power. However, as you clench your hands into a full fist, and ultimately bring your hands to the point of being on top of one another, you see that the door remains unmoved and appears as though you had not even attempted to open it. This would not stop you however. The seeming failure grows your sense of anger, but it does not stop your desire to accomplish your new challenge, to prove that this so called 'Sith' is not greater than you.<br>\r\n\"Through anger I gain strength\", you state to yourself, closing your eyes and recalling the words of Master Gall.<br>\r\n\"Through anger I gain strength, through anger I gain strength\".<br>\r\nYou re-position yourself in front of the door and throw your open-palmed hands by your side. As you stand there, you once again feel the flow of the force, although, this time, the feeling is greater, more powerful, more violent. You flash your eyes open as you try to throw your hands up, casting the force through the door. You feel the weight of the door instantly as your hands struggle upward, but the struggle causes your anger to grow which, in turn, grows your power. The door begins to rise as you raise your hands, but abruptly stops. The door reaches knee height and you find that you cannot lift it any further and that your hands will not raise any higher due to the weight of the door. For a moment you consider finding a second or even a third acolyte who could help you lift, but you shut that heinous thought down before it was given any more room to breathe, 'You are better than this Jayden Thek! You are a Sith!', you thought to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will you do? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You feel the pain building in your arms and in your legs the longer you hold the door merely a few feet off the ground. With  a struggle, you take one step toward the door, followed by a second, and then a third. Finally, you reach the opening, struggling to keep the door up but still muttering to yourself, \"through anger I gain strength\".<br>\r\nYou fall to your knees before the door, but you don't dare to let your head fall in case someone thinks you are showing respect to this worthless building and brands you as a traitor to the Sith. You are so close to the door, you could reach out your hand and touch it if you so chose, but you don't, you maintain your focus, you edge ever closer to the door. You try to push the door slightly harder and the door pushes back against you, forcing you slightly deeper into the sands of Korriban. The pain continues to grow in your arms and legs which feel weaker and weaker against the relentless weight of the door. You channel that pain into anger however, and that anger into strength, and your strength renews you, allowing you to push ever so slightly harder until you drop to the ground a roll , followed immediately by a 'CRASH'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are in darkness. Your eyes dart in every direction as you sit up from where you laid. The dark is everywhere, and no light seems to exist here. You draw your training saber from your back and activate it, hearing it whir to life as you do. It emits a soft glow which lights some of your immediate vicinity, but not by much, and you still cannot tell where you are. You step forward, slowly, carefully, all the time anticipating some form of trap, explosive, ambush, or even creature. Your master neglected to inform you of the dark, but a true Sith lets nothing impede him. As you step lightly, you feel your foot prod against something just hard enough that you push it away, but lightly enough that it doesn't go far from you. The sound it makes as it skids across the ground is too metallic to be a rock. A weapon maybe. You walk in the direction of the object and direct your training saber at it to maximise the light it receives. From the faint glow of your saber, the object looks reflective, emitting small amounts of light back at you. You kneel in front of it and rest your hand on it. Whatever it is feels cool to the touch. You clasp your hand around it and lift it in front of you. Your heart begins to race as you realise what it is. You have waited years for this moment and it has finally arrived. You activate the object in your hand and watch with a proud smirk stretching across your face as a red blade extends from the upward facing end and illuminates the entire room with a deep red hue. Your first lightsaber...<br>\r\n\"Now, I am Sith\", you announce to yourself, pride and passion filling you as your voice echoes through the room, and possibly even through the temple. As you glance around the room, you find evidence of a battle, as ancient as it may have been. All around you lay the decomposing bodies of fallen Sith, soldiers, and traitors, and the broken down components of what were once droids. You stand amongst them as though you were the sole survivor, and you begin to consider if your future victories will bear any resemblance to this, as you return your training saber to your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLining the walls of the hall you find yourself in, you see statues not too dissimilar from those in the Valley of the Dark Lords, only smaller in scale. These statues hold the same pose as those from the Valley also, standing tall with their head hunched over and facing directly downwards. <br>\r\n\"How dare they create such a mockery!\", you mutter to yourself, feeling that anger building once again.<br>\r\nYou toward your nearest statue and raise your new-found lightsaber. It hums brilliantly as you wait for just a moment, breathing heavily and angrily as you state up at the abomination. In one swift motion, you raise your lightsaber with both hands and slash it across the legs of the statue, crippling in, breaking it at its ankles. You step back and watch the traitorous stonework collapse, falling forward and shattering into dozens of pieces as it impacts on the floor. The fall is over in a matter of seconds but leaves a noise which echoes through all of the halls and corridors of the otherwise silent temple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your name?\", a calm voice calls from the dark, seemingly from all directions.<br>\r\nYou turn and raise your lightsaber, ready to defend yourself, ready to kill. <br>\r\n\"Tell me what your name is\", the voice comes again.<br>\r\n\"Where are you?\", you ask, calling out to the voice through your frustrations.<br>\r\n\"I'm here\", the voice responds unhelpfully, only adding to your frustration further.<br>\r\nYou look in all directions, determined to catch some glimpse of him.<br>\r\n\"You are a traitor!\", you call out into the darkness.<br>\r\n\"Is that what they said?\", you hear the voice ask, immediately followed by the sound of footsteps.<br>\r\n\"SHOW YOURSELF!\", you demand.<br>\r\n\"I told you, I'm here\", the voice responds, his tone as calm as it was at the start.<br>\r\nYou turn and see a man, standing amongst the dead, though he appears very much alive. His sudden appearance briefly startles you, but you refuse to show it.<br>\r\n\"You're here to kill me\", he states.<br>\r\nYou slowly begin to step toward him, lightsaber still raised.<br>\r\n\"It's a shame. I hoped you were different\", he continues.<br>\r\n\"Different?\", you query.<br>\r\n\"I hoped you weren't just going to be another mindless slave of this new false Sith Order who does his master's bidding as eagerly as a kath hound on spice\", he replies. <br>\r\n\"I am no slave!\", you announce, anger continue to build, pushing you to the limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you proceed from here?</span></div></div>",

You pull your lightsaber above your head and swing it down upon him. You don't dare to close your eyes as you long to watch the life drain from his but you are shocked, stopped. Your lightsaber should have cleaved through him but it hasn't. Instead it has halted, directly above his head. Looking around you find that the man has drawn his own lightsaber and used it to block yours. Almost for a moment, you stop and gaze at his blade which is red as the blood of a rancor. You channel your anger and the force through your arms for strength but find no avail. Quickly, you withdraw your blade from its blocked position and lunge instead for the man's centre mass which he seemingly deflects with ease. You stumble for a moment but regain your posture and composure.<br>\r\n\"Finally, a real challenge\", you state through disorganised breaths. <br>\r\nYou charge once more at the man's mid-section but jump to the side as he turns to defend himself once more and swing for his left arm. The man turns and perfectly repositions himself to deflect your incoming attack and then begins a counter offensive. He brings his lightsaber around at your neck-level but you beat away his attack. You aren't given much respite however as he return again with a second attack toward your left arm and a third aimed toward your shoulder. You are able to block each attack, but every block causes you to stumble somewhat. You begin to wonder if he is truly more powerful than yourself. You step heavily towards him with your lightsaber position ready to prevent any further attack but also impale his chest at the same time. As you reach him, he steps out of the way and beats the back of your head with his hilt, causing you to stumble, but not fall. You turn once more, madly swinging your lightsaber back towards him. He raises his lightsaber in a defensive pose and the two blades collide sending sparks shooting across the room. The two of your glare deep into eachother's eyes as you feel the rage in your boiling over. You watch as he removes one of his hand from his hilt, but is still able to provide the same blocking force he had otherwise had. He opens his hand and points his palm towards the lower half of your body. Immediately you feel something pushing against your legs so powerfully that they slide out from underneath, causing you to fall flat on your stomach and face. You raise your head and look up. The man steps above you and raises his lightsaber above his head. You look down and notice your lightsaber laying on the ground just ahead of you.<br>\r\n\"You are not true Sith\", that man states as you...</span></div></div>",

You look down and just barely see the red-tinted ground rapidly approach you. The instant you feel your feet touch the ground, you bend your knees (softening the landing), and swing around, plunging the blade of the lightsaber into the back of the man. He grunts in pain and stands almost motionless as you holding the lightsaber in that position, not daring to deactivate it in case he gains an advantage in the dark. What are you talking about? You're Sith, of course he wouldn't gain an advantage over you! You withdraw the blade from the man's body, and walk around to his frontside so that you may face him. <br>\r\n\"You are strong, but you are not Sith\", the man states first, seemingly struggling through the pain of his injury at times as he spoke.<br>\r\n\"I am Sith\", you respond, slowly, with an angry confidence, feeling pleasure at know that those are the last words he will ever hear.<br>\r\nThe man opens his mouth to speak again but you don't give him the chance. You raise your lightsaber with one hand, and swipe its red blade powerfully across his neck, severing his head. Before his body begins to wobble, you use your free hand and launch your force at it, sending the lifeless corpse flying across the room and into a far wall. You pick the man's head up from the floor, but do not give it the honour of looking at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel proud knowing that you have defeated a traitor in battle.

It gives off a light metallic groan, before tumbling out of its place in the doorframe, and down to the ground. As it impacts on the ground, a great deal of sand is thrown up, masking all of your immediate surroundings from your eyesight. Looking through the sands however, you see a figure standing, waiting.

Your 'home' wasn't part of a small enclave or one apartment out of hundreds in a Coruscant hi-rise residential building. No, your home was your ship. It was all you had, and you were proud of it for what it was, even if it was, at this point, held together mostly by the adhesive substances you had retrieved from some disarmed and disassembled grenades. You turn and look back at your ship from the outside; it is almost cuboidal in shape were it not for the cube-shaped cockpit which proudly protrudes from the central front of your ship's main cuboidal body. The top half of the cockpit's casing is almost entirely glasseous whilst the bottom half is more metallic in nature and sports a dark grey colouring. The top bottom half of the main body of your ship is the same colour of grey whilst the top half of the body is more of a red colour, maybe only slightly darker than a red blaster bolt. Your ship is sitting upon four light grey metallic stands with each consist of a thin leg attached to a wide, flat, and rounded base. Finally, a steep path is extended from the underbelly of your ship to the ground just behind where you stand, making your ship look like the face of an excited creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your attention back to the sun above. Well, it's not exactly a sun. It's not actually a sun at all. Kessel is known for many things, and one of those things is the spice mines in its northern hemisphere. The dust from galactic centuries worth of mining operations on the planet's surface have lead to a greyish and dirty mask covering the north of the planet. It wouldn't surprise you if none of the workers had even seen the sun during their time on this rock. It's their life though, and not your problem. Oh, so the sun above that's not actually a sun, that's the spotlight t from a descending ship. Through the dust-infested Sky you watch it descend, barely being able to see the outline of the ship, but clearly seeing the warm glow from the spotlight as it moves ever closer, grows ever larger, and becomes ever warmer, the whole time being trained on you. The ship's approach doesn't startle you, though you do keep a slender  hand resting against your holstered blaster (it wouldn't be the first time one of your business deals went down badly). Before long the ship comes into view and you can that it is bulkier (and frankly uglier) than yours with distasteful green and black discolouring marking most of its exterior. The spotlight flicks off, and is followed moments later by a 'clunkimg' sound, the sound of the ship landing. A series of whirring and beeping noises follow as the ship lowers its own ramp to the ground. You rest a hand against your hip in anticipation, waiting for the occupant of the ship to make the first move. Silence falls for a moment before...<br>\r\n\"Is that the Raven, my ship?\", a somewhat joyful yet husky voice calls from the belly of the other ship.<br>\r\n\"Who said it was yours?\", you respond jokingly, your tone seemingly sweet and calm.<br>\r\n\"Well who knows, it might be one day\", the voice says as someone begins to step into your view. <br>\r\nYou see the person's feet first, then their legs, their chest (they are clad in combat overalls), their arms, and finally, their face. The man steps towards you and smiles.<br>\r\n\"Fay, there's my girl. What are you doing over there?\", he asks rhetorically, throwing his arms wide. <br>\r\nYou haven't seen him since you picked up your last shipment from Kessel, and it feels like years ago. You almost break into a run as you stride towards him. Three steps away, two steps, one step, and you throw your arms around him as he wraps his arms around you. <br>\r\n\"It's been so long Fay\", he begins, \"you should come back to visit more often, not just to pick up more of my spice\".<br>\r\n\"You always say that, but you're right...\", you calmly, slightly chirpily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is that man by the way?</span></div></div>",

I have a buyer who's willing to pay 3.5 million credits for our spice\".<br>\r\nYour eyes go wide at the thought of 3.5 million credits. It would be the biggest payout you've ever had in your time smuggling spice.

The door is grey with blackened scratch and scorch marks (from past boardings) and leads to the engineering room, the engines, and the cargo hold. You turn to face the front of the ship and look around. The wall to your left hand side is similar to the door in appearance in that it is greyed and covered with an irregular pattern of black scratches and scorch marks, a pattern which is consistent on all of the ship's inner walls. This wall holds one door of an almost identical appearance to the one at the back of the ship. This door, however, acts as the entrance to your ship's living quarters. The wall to your right hand side holds two doors which lead to smaller rooms. The door closest to you leads to the crew quarters, the dormitories, whilst the door slightly farther away leads to the medical room. In the far wall of the ship, there sits one final door. You stride towards this door knowing that it leads you to the cockpit. It slides open as you approach, the metal barrier shifting to the left until it has sunk completely into the wall. You look around the cockpit of your ship. Two seats at the front for a pilot and co-pilot which are surrounded by dozens of buttons, switches and control handles. Slightly behind these two seats are two more seats, each with a screen directly infront of them. The two screens are the targeting computers for your ship's weaponry incase the automated laser cannons failed, or your decided that you were a better shot than the automated system (which you are pretty sure you are!). On the wall behind the left hand side chair is another screen, your galaxy navigator. It contains information on every known planet in the galaxy right down to their galactic coordinates. You quickly set about plotting the coordinates to Tatooine whilst your mind is still on that thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fay!\", you hear your father's voice call out to you.

It's in that moment when you realise why you recognised the accent. It's so common, so widespread, but you've only ever heard it on your travels whilst smuggling, never here on Kessel! <br>\r\n\"It's good to see you again General Hux\", your uncle says with a smile, almost bowing as he releases you.<br>\r\nGeneral Hux, the man standing infront of you, an accent that could only be from Dromund Kaas, an outfit which signifies the Revived Sith Empire.

Prove your worth to us, and we will consider this alliance that you so desperately seek\".<br>\r\n\"We've been looking forward to this. We won't let you down, will we Fay?\", your uncle replies desperately, quickly, and ultimately ending with a question directed at you.<br>\r\nBoth your uncle's and General Hux's eyes turn to you, almost judgingly. You face towards your uncle whose expression is clearly an expectant one; you know that he's expecting you to agree with him. Your gaze briefly shifts to the General, whose cold hard stare is also expecting you to agree, though his eyes are more intimidating... So too are the soldiers by his side.<br>\r\nYou literally step back as you consider, but you don't have long to decide on your response.

Are you ready to leave?\", she finally asks.<br>\r\n\"Yes Master\", you reply as you watch her turn and begin to walk down the steps of the Academy.<br>\r\nYou immediately follow her and begin to walk along a trail which leads into the forests just to the south of the Academy. Occasionally, you can spot more rocky formations through the trees in the distance as you walk, but for the most part your line of sight is quite limited. Having Master Fin'ta with you is a relief however; you feel safe with her, you feel calm and collected. Even in silence you feel comfortable with her. She has been your Master for the last 7 years! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to look around yourself as you walk, at the trees, the plants, the occasional wildlife that you notice but that runs away from or ignores you.

You take every step as lightly as you can so as to avoid snapping a twig or making some other unfortunate and accidentall noise.

You feel the concern, the worry. What is it? Why does she sense a disturbance in the force?<br>\r\n\"What is it, Master?\", you ask, not being entirely sure that you want to know the answer.<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure. We should have a closer look\", she replies.<br>\r\nMaster Fin'ta immediately steps away from you, towards the path in the outer rock wall that leads up to the mouth of the cave. Before following, you stand for a moment and examine your immediate surroundings: the trees behind you, the plains around, the rocks ahead. Everything seems so calm and peaceful, tranquil even... But it kind of feels wrong to you aswell. You try to clear your mind of these thoughts, and instead look to begin to short climb to the mouth of the cave to join your Master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mouth of the cave you find Master Fin'ta. She stands with a hand resting against her forehead, and her other hand outstretched towards the cave itself. You remain silent for a moment as you realise she's searching the cave with the force, trying to find the source of the disturbance. It was something she would often do when she sensed a problem, a trap, or a disturbance. It's also something that she has encouraged you to look to do whenever possible. You look into the cave from the entrance as the two of you stand there. The light from outside doesn't seem to delve very deep into the cave, and is quickly overwhelmed by the dark. What little you can see appears to be rocky and uneven. You can already tell that the ground will likely be difficult to manoeuvre, especially in the dark.<br>\r\n\"I sense a presence\", Master Fin'ta finally states whilst still seemingly fully invested in her search.<br>\r\n\"A presence? What do you mean?\", you ask her. <br>\r\n\"I can't tell. The force is shrouded in this place. We should be careful\", Master Fin'ta finishes before beginning to step into the cave.<br>\r\nYou follow after her, slower however, less keen to enter into what could be pitch blackness. You can almost feel every stone in the ground beneath you as it pushes against the soles of your feet. The constant darkening around you only seems to amplify this feeling as your other senses grow stronger and stronger in the absence of light. Your Master moves on ahead of you, so far ahead that you briefly lose sight of her. You rest your hand against an adjacent wall which is somewhat uncomfortable, but also slightly comforting as it provides you some stability as you walk.<br>\r\n\"Master?\", you query in a hushed voice, not wanting to risk being heard by anything else that may be present in the cave.<br>\r\nNo response comes.<br>\r\n'Master??\", you ask into the darkness once again.<br>\r\nA moment passes before you hear, \"I'm just up ahead of you, Ord\".<br>\r\nYour Master's calm voice is just extra reassurance to you at this time.<br>\r\n\"Do you know where we are?\", you query, suddenly considering that you do not know the route.<br>\r\n\"The force has guided us this far, it will guide us out again\", your Master responds, again calmly. <br>\r\nYou take each step carefully, lightly, slowly, not wanting to create noise. You want to catch up with your Master, but it would surely make you more likely to give yourself away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carefully step through the dark of the caves, training largely in your Master, and learning to trust more in the force also. It feels lie you could have easily been in the caves for 10 minutes or an hour. You're completely unaware of time. In the last few minutes you've been able to catch up to your Master and have gotten so close that you can hear her soft footsteps directly ahead of you. Suddenly they stop. You can't explain it, your Master's footsteps just stop. Your first thought is panic, but you compose yourself.<br>\r\n\"The force is with me\", you quietly mumble to yourself to help reset your mind frame.<br>\r\n\"Master?\", you query the darkness ahead, hoping for a response.<br>\r\n\"It's hear\", her voice responds, both relieving and worrying you at the same time.<br>\r\n\"The disturbance?\", you ask.<br>\r\n\"Yes. Though I still can't tell what it is. I can see a light though\", she states as you hear her footsteps begin to draw away from you once again.<br>\r\nThis time around, you waste no time in following behind her, not wanting to risk losing her again. As you walk, individual beams of light grow stronger, more apparent, and clearer. The walls of the cave begin to light up more and more, revealing their rocky make up, their uneven surfaces. You can even see your Master more and more and everything around you becomes brighter and clearer. Now you can make out a cavern just ahead, just past Master Fin'ta; it looks like it must be the source of the light. Both of you slow as you approach the edge of the cavern, treading lightly so as to not give anything away. You get closer and closer, and then you're there. Master Fin'ta positions herself to your right hand side, and the two of you peer in. The cavern is clearly larger than the space the two of you had been travelling in. It has six pillars which are spread sporadically across it and with a burning fire hanging from each one. In one corner of the rocky cavern is a large collections of crystals. Just then you spot them, huddled infront of the crystals. You point them out to Master Fin'ta and she just stares as if in shock. You look back at the figures up ahead by the crystals; they look like...</span></div></div>",

You can't make out their race or their faces, but you can quite clearly see the robes they were, the robes of a Jedi apprentice. Both of you remain stood where you are, and carefully watch the figures. You quickly agree that there are only two of them present, and they are sat by the crystals, rather tan bowing to them or trying to claim them.<br>\r\n\"Master Fin'ta\", you begin, \"was this the disturbance you senses?\", feeling slightly confused.<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure\", your Master responds, slowly, offering her concentration to the student who are unaware of your presence.<br>\r\nThe two of you continue to stand and watch them as they seemingly just talk. Your mind wanders as you do and you consider your future as a Jedi: saving planets, fighting the Sith, ultimately having peace in the galaxy, training your own Padawan, visiting worlds across the stars... You had always wanted to see Naboo...<br>\r\nThen you notice something, something off, something wrong, incorrect, against the Code. Your eyes and attention divert back to the students to be sure, to avoid trickery. You don't even dare look to your Master in case you lose sight of it, if them. The two students, they slowly begin to lean into eachother, and lock the lower part of their  faces together for a moment. <br>\r\n\"What are they doing??\", you ask rhetorically.<br>\r\n\"They're breaking the Code\", your Master states as she darts into the cavern and calls them out.<br>\r\n\"Padawans!\", she demands.<br>\r\nYou follow behind her more slowly, and watch as the two padawans turn in fear, in shock. As you move closer, you can see their faces more clearly. A relatively tall Human female with long blonde hair and a pretty face, and a blue male Twi'lek with headtails stretching down to his back. Both of them look frightened, startled, though you can't tell if they look at all regretful.<br>\r\n\"Padawans?\", you Master demands, clearly unhappy with her discovery.<br>\r\n\"Thi-this isn't w-what it looks like\", the Twi'lek stutters in near-perfect basic.<br>\r\nYou continue to step closer to the three of them to the point where the two padawans now notice you.<br>\r\n\"We were here to study the crystals Master Fin'ta\", the Hunan exclaims.<br>\r\n\"Not only have you too had a secret relationship and prioritised it over your training, but now you lie to me\", your Master states, disappointment clear throughout her tone.<br>\r\nThe Human looks towards you with apologetic eyes. It almost feels as though she wants you to step in for them, even though you know it would be wrong.<br>\r\n\"You will return to your Masters and explain your actions, and then meditate on them. I do not want you travelling together however. Ord, escort ... , and then return here.

Even the sky disgusts you, and the air is somewhat difficult to breathe. No, this is not truly home for you. Home is back on Ord Mantell, or at least, it would be if the civil war hasn't yet flattened it. the building behind is simply a place that the Hutts use to accommodate their guests for long periods of time. Your mind shifts quickly, not wanting to dwell for too long on the nostalgic thought of 'home'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at what you almost wish truly was the sun. You are however, all too aware that it is just not possible to see the local sun through Nal Hutta's dense and grim atmosphere. The light itself, the one that a tired fool could mistake for being a sun, is artificial by design, a powerful spotlight built in to the side of a Hutt Palace. The palace itself was large and cylindrical by design, with large flat cones making up its top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, you begin to grow impatient of waiting outside. You were told weeks ago that the Hutts had a contract for you, a person of interest who needed killing. It isn't your forte, assassination, but it's a job you can get done right if the credits are right. Once you reached Nal Hutta (weeks ago) you requested an audience with the Hutts to discuss the terms of your contract, but they still have not responded to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of your eye you notice something, someone. You tilt your head slightly and recognise him as being a Zabrak man. You want to ignore him, but a gut feeling inside of you says otherwise. He walks in your direction without hesitation as you continue to discreetly watch him. Another two beings enter into your line of sight from the far side of the Hutt palace, a Human and a Transdoshan.  A sense of twitching anticipation grows in you as you rest your hand against your holstered blaster. You could reach for the rifle strapped to your back, but if something is about to happen, resting your hand against your blaster is more discreet, it doesn't give away that you're expecting an ambush, giving you the upper hand. From the corner of your eye, you catch the Zabrak doing something, you're not sure what. You turn to face him just as...</span></div></div>",

You watch an orange bolt of energy discharge from your blaster and strike the Zabrak in the chest, leaving a burnt mark. The Zabrak crumbles to the ground, still clutching on to his weapon with dead fingers. Your attention immediately turns to the Human and the Transdoshan who emerged from the far side of the palace who have also drawn their weapons. You remove a wall-shield generator from your belt and throw it to the ground just as the pair begin to fire in your direction. Less than a second after the shield goes up, the first bolts strike against it, briefly turning it purple with each hit as the red of the blaster bolts mixes with the blue of the shield. The Human and Transdoshan, whilst still firing, begin to spread apart from eachother, trying to go around your shield, to surround you. In only a few moments, you will once again be in the line of fire. You return your blaster to its sidearm and take hold of the blaster rifle strapped to your back. It isn't by any means 'standard issue', the number of modifications you've made to it have taken your rifle well beyond that point. You notice that the pair of thugs are getting ever closer to having a direct shot on you, though they have stopped firing for now. You charge your rifle and make a decision. You roll to the right side of the shield, catching the Human off guard, line him up with your rifle's scope, and release three quick-fire red bolts into him, striking him in the chest, stomach, and left leg. The whole routine takes two seconds, but you don't have time to watch the now dead Human lose his balance and fall. You turn your attention to the Transdoshan who saw you put down his partner and had resumed firing at you. As the first of his blaster bolts blazes past you jump to the side, grab a thermal detonator from your belt, and throw it at him in a high arching cycle which would bring it down on top of him from above. He sees the grenade and turns his attention upward to shoot it out of the sky before it can reach him. Whilst his attention is elsewhere, you line up a shot, and discharge three red blaster bolts into his chest and stomach. Each bolt makes the Transdoshan take a step back, and ultimately, the third bolt causes him to drop to his knees, and then to the ground. You return your rifle to its place on your back, and stand with a further sense of frustration building inside of you.<br>\r\n'This was the Hutts', you think to yourself as you finally decide to confront them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the Hutt palace seemed to be a wide open space with people of all species and many backgrounds congregating there. You stride past slaves, guards, smugglers, bounty hunters, even the occasional Imperial soldier (but what they were doing there is beyond you). You pass all of them and reach a set of great double doors. This is the entrance to the Hutt's lounge. What was his name? Tree, Tri, Tro, Truuvo! Truuvo is his name. Standing at either side of the doors are two Gamorrean guards who look at you and grunt to eachother. You stare back at them coldly, and without saying anything in response. They grunt to eachother once more before one of them motions with its head that you can go in. You push the doors open and find yourself faced with a wide curving path which is populated with still more people.<br>\r\n'How did they all get in?', you find yourself questioning in your mind. <br>\r\nYou walk the curved path, ignoring the people, the gamblers, the drinkers, and the guards as you walk until you see the Hutt in all its disgusting majesty. It's holding a small creature that you can't make out from this distance, and drops it into its mouth. Don't they ever chew?<br>\r\nYou haven't forgotten about the thugs who just tried to kill you, and you almost feel certain that Truuvo had something to do with it.

Near to the entrance, you catch sight of the Transdoshan and Human from earlier, but you pay them little attention. on the far side of the hall is a closed doorway with a Gamorrean guard standing on either side of it. <br>\r\n\"That's where he's been hiding\", you mutter to yourself, just quietly enough so that no one around you hears. You push into the crowds, past person after person, alien after alien, until you reach the other side. The Gamorreans look momentarily in your direction before grunting and turning away.<br>\r\n\"I demand an audience\", you exclaim, barely thinking through your statement before you make it.<br>\r\nThe Gamorreans don't move.<br>\r\n\"I said I demand an audience with the Hutt\", you state again.<br>\r\nOne of the Gamorreans grunts once again and begins taking steps towards you, drawing an energy staff from behind its back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't have long to react, but your mind floods with responses.

Opening your eyes makes very little difference to closing them however. It's dark where you are. You're definitely indoors now though; it doesn't smell as bad as the outdoors of Nal Hutta does. You bring your hand to your side and push, forcing your body to rise away from the cold, damp ground. You manage to bring yourself to your knees as you begin to take in your surroundings. You can see walls, though only barely. They are somewhat damp and give off a slight glisten in response to some form of light source somewhere. Wait... Light source?? You throw your eyes in several directions until you finally find the source; an opening sealed by a metal grid. The gaps between the metal bars are far too small for you to push yourself through them. You look down and examine the ground beneath your knees. It's roughness, that had come from its stoney consistency. Your eyes look back to the walls. The floor reflects light in the same manner as they do, so perhaps they are made of the same material?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ho ho ho\", a sinister and booming laugh cuts through the room. <br>\r\nYou recognise it as a Hutt laugh, anyone would probably recognise it. You look back to the opening and find the Hutt sliming its way to the bars, Gamorreans either side of it.<br>\r\n\"What is this?!\", you demand, rising to your feet as you speak.<br>\r\n\"Your trial\", the Hutt replies in Huttese.<br>\r\n\"My what?\", you question in response.<br>\r\n\"Hadaman, you attacked my guards but didn't have it in you to finish the fight. I need to know that you're reliable\", the Hutt states in Huttese, almost laughing several times as it speaks.<br>\r\nHis response angers you, and you reach down to your side to withdraw your blaster from its holster. Your hand reaches the holster and finds it... empty?! You grasp at the air above and inside your holster a few times to be sure that it was missing. You reach for the rifle on your back instead and find that missing also as you almost claw at your own back. This only angers you more, and you direct your anger to the Hutt infront of you.<br>\r\n\"What have you done with my weapons??\", you demand, making it clear that you wanted an apology.<br>\r\nA noise behind you distracts you from the Hutt. You turn and see a second doorway behind you, darker, less noticeable than the first. The metal grid infront of it slides upwards as a dark figure steps towards you from within. <br>\r\n\"Good luck\", you hear in Huttese from behind as the silhouette of ... continues to draw closer and closer to you.</span></div></div>",

The hand is immediately followed by a sniffing which comes in pairs, a sniffing like the sound of an engine just starting into life.

The creature steps entirely through the doorway and releases a shriek just before it charges toward the grid-covered doorway behind which the Hutt and the Gamorreans are standing.

It could be worse though, the other sun could also be glaring down on you, speeding up the process of burning you. <br>\r\n\"It's a softer day today\", you hear a kind woman's voice behind you.<br>\r\nYou turn to see your mother slowly walking up beside you from your home... Your home. Is it really your home? It's where you live, but not by choice. It's all you've known since you were young. As much as you may try every now and then, you can't remember living anywhere else, being anywhere else before this. Maybe you were always a slave? Maybe there was no 'before this' for you? Your mother didn't like to talk about it and so would often shy away from such conversations with you. She's a pleasant woman however, coming on for 39 galactic years old, though she looks older. Your mother sports the same deep black hair as you, though she does have more grey hairs showing than you do. She always puts you first, always goes out of your way to care for you. Actually, the only flaw you can see in her, is that she doesn't seem to have any hope, not anymore anyway. <br>\r\n\"It won't last long\", you finally reply to your mother as the wind picks up and you are lightly buffeted by sand, \"the other sun will be up again soon\".<br>\r\n\"It's almost like living on a normal planet\", she says, lightly chuckling to herself.<br>\r\nThat comment annoys you, but work hard inside to not show it. You've heard stories about other planets from passing pilots during your days in the cantina. They say that not every world is an endless barren wasteland of sand. Some are covered in snow and ice, some entirely in water, there are planets which are just covered in small green plants called 'grasses' or something along those lines. It all sounded ridiculous to you, even moreso when they suggested that there are planets where water falls from the sky! But it doesn't stop you from hoping, and from living in hope. Those all sound like 'normal planets', your mother's definition doesn't, but you're not going to call her out on it. <br>\r\n\"I need to get back to the moisture farm soon\", she continues.<br>\r\n\"That's 6 days in a row mother! He can't make you do that!\", you exclaim, full of protest.<br>\r\n\"Beek has told me to do it, so I have to do it. Be careful what you say, he can take the cantina work away from you whenever he likes\", she retorts, a sense of defeat present in her voice.<br>\r\nYou throw your arms in the air and march in a small circle, ultimately coming back to your mother.<br>\r\nYou rest your hands on her shoulders as you speak, \"let's just leave Jaysa. There's better work in Anchorhead and Mos Eisley\" (you couldn't believe you were saying that, but you did believe that Jaysa was worse than the settlements of Anchorhead and Mos Eisley). <br>\r\n\"No, Beek owns us, we work for him, and we get some kind of life\", she continues to hit back, defending your owner.<br>\r\n\"We're slaves mum! What kind of life can we possibly be getting?!\", you retort, a sense of frustration growing in you and becoming vocalised.<br>\r\nAlmost immediately after you finish speaking, you clench your fist and, close your eyes, and rest your knuckles against your lips. All of the frustration you had been feeling against your mother was now being redirected at yourself because of your outburst. You look up at your mother and see that she is taken aback about what you had said.<br>\r\n\"Mum, I'm sorry...\", you begin.<br>\r\n\"No, it's fine. It's fine. I'm going out to the moisture farm. I'll see you later\", she says hesitantly, before turning and walking away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many thoughts race through your mind as you stand there reflecting on the conversation you've just had with your mother who you can still see walking away from you. She's all you really have in this world, and you don't want to damage that relationship, however, this is all your owner Beek's fault (that soulless Ithorian), maybe you could go and 'speak' to him? You do also have your next shift at the cantina coming up and you would have to leave NOW to keep from being late again. Your alternative is to stay at home. The slave accommodation isn't much, but it protects you from the elements most of the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat are you going to do?</span></div></div>",

The cantina is on the far side of the Jaysa settlement, so you decide to get going quickly. Briefly, you return to the slave accommodation, your 'home' and slide the door shut. You don't lock it however, you can't lock it. Beek doesn't care that much about his slaves or their possessions. As you finally manage to pull the door completely closed, you begin to make your way to the cantina, where you work daily as a waitress. You hate it there, the waitressing, the poor treatment from customers, the smell, the hours, the pay, and Beek. You try not to think too much about him as you walk through the sand-laden streets, watching sand fly into the just ahead of you as your shoes (more like feet wrappings) flick them up from the ground. Each group of sand particles gets picked up by the wind and carried away once it reaches shoulder-height. You walk with your back to the sun and can't help but occasionally wince as you feel it beating down on you, on the back of your exposed neck.<br>\r\n'Every day on Tatooine feels like a choice between sunburn and hyperthermia', you think to yourself. <br>\r\nDespite this, you trudge on through the sands and the unforgiving sunlight, being sure to deviate your journey slightly off route whenever the opportunity for shade arises, even if only briefly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, you have spent your journey surrounded by slaves, by slave accommodation. This isn't by choice, all of the slaves are made to live in relatively close proximity to one another, though the slaves seem to be the only people on this backwater planet who show you any sign of compassion; the only people in Jaysa who you would consider to be your friends are slaves in fact. Everyone else just seems to look down on you because some life form somewhere, in the galaxy, was able to put a small monetary value to your mother's life, possibly even your own. You tilt your head slightly as you near the end of the slave sector. You catch a quick glimpse of Boieun, a guy who you more or less grew up with when you were younger, on the doorstep of his accommodation and getting started on his daily water ration. He was one of your closest friends at one time, but not so much anymore, not since Beek put the both of you to work in different parts of the settlement: you were made to waitress at the cantina for Jaysa's very worst, and Boieun was made to clear up bantha poodoo which is equally degrading, maybe even moreso. He catches you looking in his direction and offers you a quick smile and wave which sends a sudden lightness through your stomach. You throw up an arm and wave it back at him just before he turns and steps back into his accommodation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue on and pass by the end of the slave sector quickly. <br>\r\n'This is where the abuse begins', you think to yourself as you walk.<br>\r\n\"Hey! Clean my shoes! They're all sandy!\", a slightly metallic voice behind you calls, being followed by an uproar of laughter. <br>\r\nYou know it's directed at you, there are no other slaves on the street, but you ignore it and press on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of your journey consists of more or less the same experience, just by different people. The unfortunate truth of it is that it's just something you've come to expect now. As far back as you can remember, people have treated you in the same way. As you continue to walk, you briefly catch sight of a bald man in black battle armour striding past you, but you don't think anything of it. It's quite a normal to see mercenaries in and around Jaysa; the settlement is popular with slave owners and those kinds of people have enemies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see the cantina up ahead of you: a single-floored building with a flat roof loads of domes protruding from the walls. That is where you work, where you really don't want to be today. You continue towards it and listen as the music from inside seems to grow louder and louder, and the voices inside grow louder until finally, you reach the door. You push through the door to the cantina and cant help but pull a look of surprise across your face. The cantina is...</span></div></div>",

Your shift at the cantina is starting soon, very soon, and you would have to leave now to have any chance of being there on time. Beek responds badly to lateness, always. The longer you stand there and consider leaving however, the later you will be if you go to work. You feel the sun beating down on you as you stand there, continuing to decide on what to do. <br>\r\n\"No\", you suddenly hear yourself say, almost catching yourself off guard.<br>\r\nYour body responds by taking steps towards your accommodation, trudging your feet through the thick layers of sand beneath you. You say your 'body responds'; you're the one who makes your body respond in that way, you're the one who's deciding that you're my going to go to work today, despite what Beek will likely think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue stepping towards your accommodation, watching it gradually get closer and closer to you until you reach the door. You rest one hand against its metal shape and, with your other hand, push a button just to the side of the frame which cause motion from the door. You feel your hand move as the door itself shifts leftward, being sucked into the wall of your accommodation. Inside, there isn't much: two beds, some cooking utensils, and some cleaning utensils. Beek may have given his slaves accommodation, but even then he didn't treat them well. The door's of the accommodation blocks didn't even have locks on them! He doesn't care whether your possessions are stolen or not. It's unfortunate, but it's the only way you've ever known life to be. You hear the door slide closed behind you as you look around the room. Each of the four walls, whilst coloured white, are lumpy and appear weathered distorted where sand has brushed in. Even the ground your stand on seems to be mostly sand now. The two beds in the room are identical in appearance. Both are built into the wall, both are made of an old metal and slightly rusting structure, both have a softer brown area contained within the metal frame. You walk over to your bed, and sit on the edge of it. You swing your feet over to the end of it, and lay down. Wanting to only rest your eyes for a moment, you close them and quickly lose all sense of consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud thumping noise brings you out of your trance-like sleep and frightens you to the point where you fall off of your bed. You land on the ground and sit back up again, rubbing your head, and watching particles of sand fall from your individual strands of hair. You stand to your feet and begin to step towards the door, but hesitate for a moment, considering who could be on the other side. The thumping continues as you step carefully towards the door. You take a deep breath, before pressing a button on the side, sliding the door away to reveal ... on the other side.</span></div></div>",

Billions of planets are being caught up in the middle as factions from across the stars are pledging allegiances and breaking alliances just to gain some small sense of power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven now as war looms and the force grows ever more troubled, neither side seems willing to stop their preparations for conflict out of fear of falling behind their adversaries in this galactic arms race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn these trying and difficult days, maybe it will prove to be the smallest and most insignificant of individuals, rather than the Sith Emperor or Jedi Grand Master, who ultimately finds a way to bring balance to the Galaxy, and to the force...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI do not own Star Wars in any way as it is owned by the Disney Corporation. Now that's out of the way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey guys! Worddude here, but you can call me Word. This is set to be my first interactive story and I'm hoping to get it updated daily because I am so very excited about writing this! I don't want to be the only one writing this though, please feel free to contribute, I will do my best to read every chapter that you guys add!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople often put in rules, I would ask that we keep it 13+, and we keep it Star Wars. There is no Earth, there is no Star Trek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust one last thing from me, I'm basing this about 1,500 years before canon Star Wars (canon Star Wars being the 8 movies and the animated tv shows), and I have no idea what that area of Star Wars history was like, so feel free to invent new characters and factions, I know I will be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that's all out of the way, I hope you guys enjoy reading this...</td>",
