            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Haah...~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bored sigh escaped Elizabeth's lips. Two weeks had passed insofar and their guest had not had any heed to fuse Personas or even access the compendium. According to her master, Igor, who always sat vigilantly in anticipation of those who would visit, their esteemed guests was on vacation with friends. Elizabeth's mind wandered as she considered what sort of heed friends had on one's life, on how a person acted. She longed for something grander, for a friend or similar close companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed ever since she had explored more of the mortal world, her mind had taken to whimsical and dreamy thoughts of what sort of experiences the Elevator Attendant could have. The varied lifestyle options, all the different people she could meet, the activities she could partake in...and the cuisine! Even in just a modest strip mall, the choices meals could be found if one knew where to look! Just the mere thought caused Elizabeth's mouth to salivate inside as her eyes shifted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgor still sat vigilantly. She was nervous, didn't know how to break her query to her master, when by chance a golden butterfly appeared. It floated in front of Igor's face, just above his comically long nose as he stared deeply at the supernatural insect with his bugged, bloodshot eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I see.\" Igor muttered just as the butterfly vanished into thin air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to Elizabeth, shifting only slightly in his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am afraid that there is business to be done. As good a time as any while the mood is so lax. Elizabeth, be sure to look after the Velvet Room while I am gone.\" Igor stated in his usual tranquil voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth was perplexed. Igor leaving the Velvet Room was no simple or common occasion of any kind. However, she found no reason to object as Igor got up and walked through one of the doors to the side of the Velvet Room. Elizabeth paused as he vanished. She realized that with him gone she could easily slip out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" Elizabeth looked ahead, faltering a bit. \"Well...if everyone else seems to be taking a break, then why can't I? Hm hm hm...Perhaps I could always subject Theodore to look after the Velvet Room in my place while I enjoy myself.\" Elizabeth laughed quietly to herself, a laugh that seemed even more quiet in the emptiness of the room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;Iwaotodai Strip Mall...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth enjoyed the feeling of the sun shining on her face and against her body, shielding her eyes a bit due to the usual dim lighting of the Velvet Room. The Strip mall offered an impressive variety of delicacies she could sample and her eager stomach cried out for her to place food as her utmost priority. Elizabeth cast her gaze around the strip mall, scanning the establishments dotted around and wondering what was the best place to go first. Her stomach growled audibly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh...it seems there's so many options that I cannot help but falter.\" Elizabeth muttered to herself as she placed a gloved hand on her abdomen. Her stomach felt as if there was a hole burning inside from her egregious her hunger pangs were. \"Well...I could just try them all at once...no, no that would not work. Oh, I'm sure if I wait long enough the answer as to where I should dine first will come...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*GGRRRRWWWWLLL~!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I would hope.\" Elizabeth felt a large drop of sweat flow down the back of her head as she muttered to herself again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Wild Duck Burger was a quite busy restaurant, and one of the most successful chains of fast food within the entire Tatsumi Port Island area, being close enough to Gekkoukan High School to enable its students to enjoy the extensive menu they had. Of course, it didn't help that the special there was known as a test of courage to anyone who dared to try it, the gigantic Mystery Burger of which the only description was 'Not for the faint of heart.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA monstrous meat patty, easily ten pounds if not more, stuffed between thick slices of hearty tomato, lettuce, onions and bacon, topped with secret sauce and overflowing with ketchup, mustard and mayonnaise between two mustard cooked buns. Not only that, but the beef patty itself was rumored to have been wrapped in bacon, then deep fried and coated with even MORE beef before cooking yet again. A true test of courage to see who could even fathom eating this holy grail of all fast foods, the rumor was that among the high school girls that it was the most fattening thing on the planet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Elizabeth was hungry. Very hungry. Much hungrier than she had ever been with Minako, who had kept her decently fed while they had...dated. This Mystery Burger sounded like just the thing she needed to quell her ravenous gut. \"Then Wild Duck Burger it is...I remember clearly that the food is cheap and quickly made. Perhaps that Mystery Burger would be able to satisfy my hunger. All the rumors about it seem to indicate that it is...quite filling.\" The silver-haired elevator attendant entered the restaurant, her strange attire occasionally drawing glances, but with enough people having seen her before, they go back to their usual ways and delve into so-called deep conversations. Luckily, today wasn't nearly as busy in the Wild Duck Burger, as it was about noon on a weekday. This would give her enough time to satisfy her hunger, if of course this Mystery burger didn't do it first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStriding up to the counter, she takes out her customary giant bag of yen coins and bills, looking up at the attendant behind the counter. The boy was listless, bored, and as he saw Elizabeth come up, he simply sighed, her presence giving him more work to do that piled up on whatever little he wanted to do anyway. Scratching the back of his head, he placed his hands upon the order tablet, tried to put on a smile and change his attitude a little. \"Welcome to Wild Duck Burger! What will you be having today, Miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator attendant smiled before pushing the set amount of money for her desired meal forward. \"I would like one Mystery Burger please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis jaw dropped. Thankfully, he managed to catch it before she saw it. Really, this thin beauty was gonna try that massive calorie monster?! She looked strange enough, but she was rather cute, but after one of those burgers....he shuddered. He'd seen some of his fellow high school girls gain anywhere from twenty to fifty pounds with that burger alone. 'So long to her figure, I guess. What a waste.' \"Okay...that'll be ten thousand yen. You sure you want this, Miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, please. That is exactly what I desire, and what will fill my needs for now,\" she answered back matter-of-factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O...okay...It'll be out in about ten minutes. Take a seat and we'll bring it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n= = = = = = = = = = <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gargantuan burger known as the Mystery Burger of the Wild Duck Burger restaurant chain was wheeled out on a cart to a special seat, made for the staff to simply wheel the cart out and let the customer have at it. It was a majesty of cooking to Elizabeth, while others saw a terror, the glistening grease like the water of life to her starving gut. AT this point, it felt like it was trying to eat itself to find something to quell its pangs, the elevator attendant's calm composure being the only thing preventing her from tearing into the burger with her gloved hands. It smelled like heaven to her, and only served to whet her appetite further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go ma'am...one Mystery Burger.\" He gulped, shaking his head before walking away. \"Enjoy your lunch.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh yes I will, Elizabeth thought, before turning to the monstrosity in front of her. Picking up a fork and knife, she proceeded to cut a slice out of the side, a good chunk out of the burger, lifting it with a delicate hand. She licked her lips with anticipation, the smell overwhelming her and her famished gut demanding that she devour that massive hunk of burger that instant to satisfy her cravings. So, the attendant complied, her teeth sinking into the very tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would happen next would be nothing short of a caged glutton unleashing her full potential upon the massive mountain of a hamburger served to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes widened for a split second, something twinkling in her eyes as some...inhibition snapped, allowing the beast within to take over. The delicate bites turned into full-on chomps, the first slice of the burger disappearing within a matter of seconds into her hungry maw, a wide smile of delight on her face as she licked her lips free of the first droplets of the magnificent, ambrosia-like grease. The double bacon burger patty, the sauces, all of the toppings soaked in the juices and sauces slathered over the top, it was all  an addicting mix of the greatest things she had ever tasted while in the human realm, and something so much more. The gnawing hunger in her gut was quelled, replaced instead by a desire to consume the entire thing, a feat no one had been able to accomplish to date. Her body too, felt the effects of just that first slice, plumping up gently and giving her a nice, juicy figure that was straining her clothes oh so slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth was given pause, as she allowed a small chuckle to escape her lips. She knew full well what this was, this emotion, this lust for food welling up inside of her. She knew full well these gluttonous urges were awakening inside her and yet... 'I see no reason not to...indulge just a bit. After all, it's...only one meal and I see no potential harm.' Elizabeth mused just before she took another hungry, greedy bite out of her burger, a few splotches of sauce staining her lips. Licking her lips, she began her fast food feast with gusto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo more slices. That last bite had been the straw for her lovely manners. No, instead, she bit right into the monstrous beast before her, gulping down thick chunks of succulent meat, filling up her belly with more of the wondrous meal, her lust for food driving her over the edge now into a full-on glutton. Before, she was simply a connoisseur of the restaurants that dotted Tatsumi Port Island; now, it was nothing more than ultimate pleasure. The bites disappeared into her gullet, soft moans of pleasure coming from Elizabeth as she devoured the burger. The effect it started having on her body was immediate, and simply added to her drive to gorge on the meat patty, her body quickly rounding out with every bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer rear and  thighs were the first hit by the wave of calories that swept through her...abnormal metabolism, quickly and visibly plumping up with soft fat and cellulite, her leggings stretching and her skirt starting to ride up over a fattening derriere and expose plush cheeks blowing up with blubber. They plumped, like rising dough, filling out into thick, sexy thighs and hearty cheeks that could make J-Lo jealous, her boots starting to tighten around her thickening calves. Next, was her tummy, which rose from the flat, trim surface it was and bubbled out with fat, swelling outi nto a full-on, cuddly fat gut as it filled up and out, pressing against her dress and straining it to the limit already, her growing form trapped within it. Her breasts were the next to go, plumping up with blubber and blowing out into D or E-cup beauties, pressing against the blue dress she had on and causing to fit snugly against her fat body, no space to grow any further now within its confines. Even her arms plumped up, adding a small layer of fat across the top, with her face gaining a developing second chin to accompany her softening first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was...the end of the first Mystery Burger. The first one anyone had finished at the restaurant. The happily bloated Elizabeth smirked as she licked her lips of the ambrosia grease, patting her swollen gut as she looked on at the stunned looks of the rest of the restaurant goers,now 200+ pounds and shoved into a dress several sizes too small. \"Now then....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was a dead silence all through Wild Duck Burger. The kind of silence you see in an old movie when someone just recently got shot and the shock had yet to fully sink in to everyone. That very same emotion hung over everyone's heads, lingering all throughout the restaurant. Even small children who knew nothing of the situation still seemed to grasp the gravity of what had happened. The fact this woman was even able to stuff roughly ten pounds of meat inside of her now rather chubby body was one thing, a rather miraculous thing given how rich and greasy the massive patty was, but another? Was she even human?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and perhaps I should have some sides too.\" Elizabeth happily chirped, rubbing her plump belly with her gloved hands as her usual serene smile made its way on her face. \"Some...what were they called again? Sweet potato fries I believe and a...large cola to drink with it all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man was practically shuddering, his hand shaking as he held out his notepad, making the pen poke at the paper and dot it with ink. This was no woman sitting in front of him, this was a beast. A pure, gluttonous beast! She had just packed away that monster of a burger and even as he relayed the order to the cooks, she was just sitting there,happily humming to herself as she rapped her fingers against her belly like she was pretending to play on a piano.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth's fries came first, but she almost seemed to inhale those as she asked for seconds, thirds, fourths...it wasn't until her thirteenth helping of fries and two more refills on her cola that her second mystery burger finally came. Holding back an oncoming rush of saliva, Elizabeth's smile widened on her cherubic face as she didn't bother cutting it up again. Instead, in what seemed to be a fit of serial escalation, the gluttonous elevator attendant picked the burger up in her gloved hands, slowly and carefully as grease sopped from the massive form and opened her mouth wide!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*CHOMP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike that a third of the monster burger that spawned so much infamy had already filled Elizabeth's mouth, puffing up her cheeks like a squirrel with a mouth full of sunflower seeds as a bit of grease and sauce dribbled from her mouth. With a loud, audible gulp the mass of condiment slathered meat and light, toasty bun fell down the Velvet Blue garbed girl's esophagus and into her belly, additional fat pouring out onto her once so lithe form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*MUNCH!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*GULP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo more bites. That was it. Another burger, but this time defeated in only three bites. With a nonplussed and content look on her face, again not fully understanding the weight of what she had done, Elizabeth merely took to wiping her mouth, gently dabbing at her lips with a napkin and wiping her gloves off thoroughly before greedily guzzling down her remaining fill of cola, politely excusing herself with a partially blushed face due to the resulting belch from the carbonated liquid entering her body so quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more, the almost vengeful calorie-riddled monster took its tole on Elizabeth's form as the fat piled on even quicker thanks to her gluttonous intake. The skirt of her one-piece dress only rose higher and seemed to strain to cover up her full, flared hips and her massive rear, which was squeezed into the chair in a somewhat uncomfortable manner which was only balanced out by the rump's size and softness, the black, thigh-high stockings she wore covering less of her \"absolute territory\" as the thick, fat legs Elizabeth now bore, which almost looked like small tree trunks of cellulite, pulled them now along with her thigh-high heel boots which were thankfully made of some supernatural elastic as they spread out to contain Elizabeth's fatter legs and plump feet. Her breasts had ballooned out in front of her, the round fat spheres almost looking like literal balloons in fact due to their size as they rested atop her belly, the fat mass sitting atop Elizabeth's lap in an almost proud manner as if a testament to her gluttonous conquest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...May I have another?\" Elizabeth asked calmly as she unfastened one of the buttons on her dress, letting more of her bulk flow out, showing the underside of her creamy belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so another mystery burger met the same fat, not too long after. And another. And another...and lots of sides...and about twenty liters worth of cola...the whole time, Elizabeth tore through her meal like a lion finishing off a freshly killed zebra and moaned in a manner that made cautious parents cover their children's ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut finally Elizabeth felt the roaring hunger inside of her quelled! She sighed as she leaned back in her chair, all 666lbs of her wobbling in a comical manner as her round, adorable and double chinned face had a rather sizable double chin which was fairly close to her head-size breasts, the fat somehow making them perky and round instead of saggy like they were inflated. Her butt made the chair creak and groan, the metal legs bending in an unnatural manner before the sorry piece of furniture gave out under her, making Elizabeth cry out in shock as her massive bottom hit the floor, her blubbery bulk quivering from the impact. Her belly jostled, making her breasts only jiggle more as two more buttons, which left only her chest covered, came undone and a large uncomfortable belch passed Elizabeth's plumper lips as she rubbed her cuddly, thicker hands and fat, puffy arms against her blubbery belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome people were horrified at the display Elizabeth put on, even leaving Wild Duck altogether and promising to never eat here again. Others had put bets on how long Elizabeth would last and some were even closet fat admirers who watched Elizabeth with glee and even took.. *Ahem* bathroom breaks, claiming they were only going so they didn't throw up on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-aahh...are you finished, ma'am?\" The young man asked, quivering in place. He wanted something to make this job less boring, yes he would admit to thinking that. He would never, however, have asked for something as terrifying as this. Elizabeth stood up, readjusting her blue cap as her new height and girth made her a rather imposing figure to the young man in spite of her almost uncannily cute face and gentle voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am fine, but I appreciate the concern. Now, I believe there is the matter of my tab...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-n-nevermind that, you can, uh, just forget it! I-I mean it's...on the house, uh, really! No charge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth was partially confused, tilting her head to the side a bit as she stopped in the middle of reaching for her bloated coin purse. She had never gotten a free meal before. It was strange for this to happen. Weren't these establishments meant to be profitable? Oh, but if she turned down this young man's generosity, in the face of such a fact, that would be rather rude, wouldn't it? With her usual affable smile, Elizabeth tried her best to bow in spite of her new, much more adipose figure, which was a sign of courtesy last she checked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Thank you very much for this meal! I hope to see what you have in store next time! Oh, maybe an Extra Large Mystery Burger that could quell even someone like me.\" Elizabeth mused, dreaming of such a thing being possible as she imagined a massive patty the width of an actual cow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, sure now, uh, please...leave...\" The young man urged, fearing Elizabeth ever showing her face here and hoping if she did she would be too fat to even set one foot inside!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContently waddling her way out the double doors, Elizabeth pat her impressive belly, allowing a content sigh to escape her lips as her massive belly rippled and wobbled slightly as she closed her eyes and walked into the summer sunlight. Realizing she needed a more...conservative outfit, she decided to make a \"pit stop\" as she had heard it addressed as to the Velvet Room for a more appropriate sized version of her uniform. After she had taken care of that, however...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Satisfied with the new adjustments to her elevator uniform, the blubbery Elizabeth stepped out of the Velvet Room, using her own vast powers to adjust the size of the gateway ever so slightly so that she could escape the confines of the Velvet room easily. Now standing in the middle of Paulownia Mall, she rubs her obese belly, a smile on her face. \"Well, that was oh-so-satisfying...mmmm, human food hasn't lost its charm since I arrived last. If anything, it has only gotten tastier. Now then...what to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silver-haired elevator attendant looked up at the clock nonchalantly, despite the awkward stares she got from the crowd due to her rather hefty size, thinking of what else she could do while Igor was gone. Watching the clock strike one, it dawned upon her that her special guest, Minako Arisato, was still attending the function known as 'school.' Smiling widely, she nodded to herself, starting to waddle out of the mall. 'That's right! Perhaps I should dip by and give Minako a little surprise...after all, she hasn't seen me outside of the Velvet Room on my own...nor seen me at this size yet. I think this will be a pleasant experience for her~'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long however before her mighty gut rumbled again as she stepped outside of the entrance to Paulownia Mall, causing the faintest bit of a blush to rise to her cheeks, the quivering mass in front of her wobbling for a good long minute until it calmed down. Placing a plump hand on its surface, she could still feel it gurgling underneath her inches of soft blubber, demanding more food already despite the impossible feast she had earlier. Looking about, she noticed a rather small food cart standing by near the entrance to the mall, being tended to by a frail-looking man. The smell of whatever's in the cart hits her nose, causing her to lick her lips as whatever it is causes her tastebuds to tingle in anticipation. Waddling over to the stand, she towers over the frail man in size, her thick, hefty bulk easily enough to swallow him whole. Looking at the interior of the cart which seems to be filled with bacon-wrapped hotdogs, Elizabeth glances down at him before bringing out her hefty coin purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man stares up at her bulging figure and all of its thick, hearty glory, already feeling smaller than he actually is at this behemoth of a woman before him. Throat swollen shut in awe and fear, all he can do is point towards the sigh, which displays one of the bacon-wrapped pork links as a meager amount of 250 yen apiece. What he forgets, however, is that he never took the sticker tag off for the entire cart, having bought it just recently in order to make small income off this little side job. Elizabeth, seeing the sticker price for the entire cart, licks her lips and pats her grumbling gut gently, pouring a damn good hunk of change out onto the small collecting pan that the man had for his business. \"I'll take the whole thing, good sir. I have...quite the appetite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the mass amount of coin that litters his collection plate, more than enough to pay off the debt and then give him some extra, he quickly takes the plate, pouring all the money in a bag before giving a nervous smile. \"Thank you very much, ma'am! Enjoy your bacon-wrapped hotdogs! I have...er...a deposit to make! Just leave the cart here and I'll pick it up later!\" He takes off faster than a crackhead after his fix, scooting away from the obese elevator attendant as she shrugs, starting to tug the large cart along. Running it alongside her mammoth hips, she reaches into the depths of the holding bin, pulling out a foil-wrapped hotdog and unsheathing it from its shiny, crinkled prison before shoving the bacon-wrapped treat full-on into her mouth, chewing it once or twice before swallowing it nearly whole, her body bulging out gently with even more luscious fat and causing her to sigh contentedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was definitely going to be an interesting trip to the human world today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n= = = = = = = = = = = = = =<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSix different food carts later, and an hour and a half trip to Gekkoukan High School with around 45 minutes or so until the bell, the even MORE massive Elizabeth passes through the front gates, her hips barely small enough to pass through the two pillars. Her gargantuan belly wobbled slightly with every single movement, sending a quake up to her enormous, beachball-sized breasts which bounced against her thick, soft third chin and jostled her chipmunk-like cheeks. Now stuffed into her elevator attendant outfit once again, with her bulging, pale moons barely covered by it and exposing her dark hose, covering her thick, pillar-like legs and couch-crushing hips, she squeezes a blubbery roll gently, sighing in contentment as she leaves the chain of food carts behind at the entrance, huffing a little as her arms are a little harder to bend than before. At a little over a half ton, with her engorged gut so full of fat nearly resting on the ground, she waddles quite quickly for a girl of her prodigious size, licking her plump lips of the excess sauce which coated it from her massive snack. Entering the school building, she drums upon the surface of her hefty tummy with fat fingers, clad in her blue gloves, still feeling the dull ache of hunger drone on inside of her meaty middle. \"Mmmmm, it seems I arrived here a bit too early. She won't be out of class for some time. And yet....I'm still hungry...I really shouldn't have passed up that last cart. I think I would've had enough time to indulge in its contents before the day ended.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking that she might be able to keep her monstrous appetite under control, the obese elevator attendant stood about in the main level, near the student store, trying to keep her mind off of eating and making it as dead set on meeting Minako as she possibly could. Still, the occasionally loud grumble of her greedy gut caused her to squirm in place despite her calm and collected demeanor, her thick hands kneading her bulging belly rolls in an attempt to silence her cravings. Eventually, she gave in, her newfound appetite a little too much for her to handle. \"There must be something I can snack on at least before she gets here. Something...\" Turning to the student store, she notices the racks of breads and buns and small drinks, a lightbulb turning on somewhere inside the darkened halls of the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will do.\"</span></div></div>",

While the red-eyes brunette had always been bubbly and cheery to a nigh infectious degree, she just plain felt like crap after heading to Tartarus for a long grind and it was only worse that recently, Mitsuru sprung the idea to send her to take extracurricular courses she had already aced her past two exams so what as the point!? Junpei, she could understand full well! As fun as a friend he was, she had to admit his grades were pretty lackluster even if he was getting pretty good at fighting Shadows and she couldn't have agreed more with his protests when Mitsuru suddenly broke the news. At least the extracurricular classes she had with Mr. Edogawa were interesting because they had such an odd connection to Personas, Tarot Arcana and Shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing to herself, Minako felt herself drift as her head became heavy and her eyelids felt like they were made of lead. She could see Kenji with his head planted right atop his desk and Junpei was pretending to take notes while he scribbled cheesy looking drawings of some of the Shadows they encountered as well as some of the Personas she used. She could see Jack Frost, Saki Mitama, what looked like Nekomata...was that supposed to be Hermes on the border? It looked a bit disjointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Ah, Arisato! Could you tell us why Samurai carry their trademark Katana?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red-eyed brunette almost jumped visibly from suddenly hearing her name called, a jolt of energy coursing through her body from a sort of fight-or-flight response any student, especially High School, knew all too well. Standing up slowly from her seat as she swept her bangs to hide the black circles under her eyes, Minako tried to keep her posture straight as she stared directly at Mr. Ono, clearing her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-because, the samurai merely carried their Katana around as badges of honor, not actual weapons. In fact, even with how carefully crafted a masterwork Katana is and how glorified they are in pop culture, in reality one would break after three strikes at most due to the thin metal of the blade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Except for those ones I find in Tartarus sometimes, especially those weird short swords no one uses, not even Mitsuru-senpai. Ah, at least they make for good cash-ins.</i> Minako though as she gave her answer, recovering after stumbling into it at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Ono was practically beaming at Minako's astute answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, oh yes that's correct! Very well said! Katana, as wonderful as they are, were not meant to be weapons of the samurai. In fact, samurai were trained to be jacks of all trades, able to use almost any weapon and master multiple arts of the body and mind. Some used spears, nagatinae, bows and arrows...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako sat down, sighing as she felt satisfaction in giving the correct answer. The confidence replacing the passing anxiety helped her feel as if she were a tad smarter, Junpei even looking up from his \"notes\" to give her one of his goofy grins and a thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==========<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;After School<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako stretched her arms, yawning a bit. She wished she'd had Mr. Ekoda at the end of the period so she could sleep through another one of his lectures. Classic Literature wasn't bad, but she couldn't imagine too many western teachers going off about Shakespeare the same way that man went off about the Monogatari. She considered who to hang out with for her next Social Link, see who she could spend time with. It was Monday so maybe Maiko was around at the shrine as usual. Sighing, she walked down the stairs to the first floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, Minako felt all fatigue leave her in an instant, replaced by shock and awe at the sight in front of her. Something that seemed to pale the threat of an impending Shadow on each full moon in comparison, in terms of emotional shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could only look on in some unique fascination as she looked on at the massive blob in front of her that was now Elizabeth, the nigh on 1,200lbs attendant gorging herself, guzzling down different flavors of milk and juice while mowing down different kinds of bread slathered in generous helping of bean jam. Minako looked on, hoping to God (who she sometimes wondered would also be a Persona available in the future) that there was at least one piece of melon bread left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Elizabeth?\" Minako spoke up shyly, finding it hard to draw her eyes away from the almost perfect shape of Elizabeth's massive backside, along with the thick hips on the blubbery pillars of her legs that could no longer be covered by her stockings and the flared, ample hips that gave her backside such an amorous shape that Arisato could feel her heart pound and her face heat up just looking at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth turned around, loaves of bread heaped and hoarded within the uncannily puffy masses of her arms which still somehow served her well, despite being a bit harder to bend as the masses and all the bread pressed against the upper part of her bulbous belly which was starting to reach the ground and her impeccably titanic and round, perky breasts which wobbled in such a manner even characters in a Gainax Anime would find just a slight absurd. Her face was so puffy it was almost impeccably adorable alongside her golden eyes with her massive fat cheeks as her neck lost a good amount of definition and she only had her three chins, not far from four, to help define where it could have been. Elizabeth gave her usual small smile, crumbs of many sizes dotted around her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Minako! Very nice to see you! I suppose you deserve some explanation correct? Well...I must admit ever since I sampled the cuisine of this world, I found myself only craving more. As you can see, I have apparently fallen victim to the bewitching force of gastronomy with what I admittedly find a very favorable bi-product. This sensation of being so lusciously large, the impeccable figure I have achieved and this uncannily pleasurable sensation I suddenly feel whenever I consume food...truly a wonder, isn't it?\" Elizabeth beamed, smiling widely (well, wide for her)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako could feel herself swooning at the sight of Elizabeth's full display of gluttony and corpulence as she stared onwards. She had to admit, she found some odd guilty pleasure in watching Elizabeth glut herself during one of their previous dates at the strip mall, an urge to just feed her as much as her stomach could hold shy of exploding, but she thought it was just a strange thought, something another Shadow could have planted in her. But seeing how massive Elizabeth was, her wide body just shy of being too large to fit inside the school and being tall enough she could probably touch the ceiling if she reached up all the way with one of her bulky, slightly stubby arms...she felt herself squirm inside, resisting an uncanny urge to throw herself onto Elizabeth, latch against her belly in a hug and just never let go, using her as a bed, feeding her and fattening her and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wh-what's up with me?! D-don't tell me I'm one of those fat fetishists like on the Internet...</i> Minako blushed as she tried to look away. Even so, she didn't deny the burning passion in her heart. Fat or thin, Elizabeth was Elizabeth. She wanted to whisper in her ear, call her \"Her Velvet Blue Butterfly\" and just be close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth seemed to detect the passion stirring in the air from Minako, both of them ignoring the woman at the counter asking for payment for all the bread. Elizabeth looked down from her quivering, tender bust and her rolling, downy-soft belly at her...her beloved. She leaned down a bit with a blushed face, making her cheeks look a bit like ripe tomatoes as she bashfully knocked her dimpled knees inwards while she tried to reach out to her. But what to say? The social awkward Attendant's mind raced as she tried to think of the most appropriate thing to suggest that would aid in the passion lingering in the air, even as the school store clerk was bugging the two of them for payment.</span></div></div>",

With every quake and shake, her enormous, thick legs clad in the black hose caused her entire body to start wobbling, the motion starting to knock the massive elevator operator off balance. Unused to the sheer amount of blubber on her frame, at least dynamically, Elizabeth lost her footing, stumbling in her strained boots and starting to keel over. \"Oh~!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wave of fat before Minako fell upon her in slow motion, allowing her to gaze upon each and every inch of soft, supple flesh pouring forth behind Elizabeth's tight-fitting uniform, her bulging bosom perfectly outlined atop her cascading belly rolls, which spread across the floor to make up her bulky tummy. Her massive rump, two pale, vast orbs clad in hose, bobbled up through the air, wobbling erratically as Elizabeth fell forward, her barrel-sized thighs not too far behind. Plush, pillowy arms stuck out to the redhead as the vast blonde fell forward, golden eyes locking with Minako's own, the SEES member reaching out to the cushy girl as she toppled over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth's pudgy lips locked with Minako's as the three-quarter ton elevator attendant impacted against the redhead's frame, smothering it in plush, warm fat from her bulging breasts and fat tummy, both of their eyes widening in surprise as that fateful connection is made. Even as the student was buried underneath the avalanche of the attendant's massive body, their lips never left each other, Minako's face cushioned and cradled by Elizabeth's bulky tire chin and plump, chipmunky cheeks. Electricity flowed from the massive mound of flesh into the thin girl smushed underneath her, their bodies overcome with some sort of heavenly ecstasy that they could both describe as magical. Their faces were beet red as they looked into each other's eyes, the feeling of their bodies mingling fueling the unimaginable tension, Minako's arms digging deep into inches upon inches of soft, meaty flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey closed their eyes as dozens of bread pouches fell from the sky to the floor, Minako and Elizabeth moaning in delight as the kiss went on for what seemed like an eternity. Their bodies grew hotter, Minako grasping at soft, thick folds and rolls from her fleshy prison, trying to bring herself as close as she possibly could to the elevator attendant's massive body and sink evermore into the field of fat around her. The two, now silently confessed lovers, broke apart after a few minutes, Elizabeth's face tinged deep, bright pink compared to her normally pale skin, she and Minako looking around at the student body around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe SEES member was satisfied, on a high that no other could compare to. And yet....something was off. There just wasn't enough. She had seen the ravenous, bulging, growing mass of Elizabeth as she devoured packages of melon bread and the drinks that made the school store their home. She wanted more. She wanted so much more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Elizabeth enjoyed this...then Minako was going to get what she wanted. She giggled a little, looking on at Elizabeth's shyness as the massive attendant looked down at her, squishing her tire chin cutely into the bulging plain of her bosom. \"w-what? Is something the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmm....nope. I'm just enjoying the view. School's almost out soooo...what do you say we...'hang out?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surely, yes!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Minako smiled as she reached out, grasping one of Elizabeth's gloved, fatty hands in her own slim fingers, which she delicately rubbed against the surface of Elizabeth's digits. The elevator attendant looked at Minako with genuine curiosity, her puffy cheeks slightly reddened by a blush gracing their surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't really think of any better place to kick this off then where we first met, to be honest.\" Minako stated with a smile as she leaned against Elizabeth's fatty side, her cheek pushed up against her graciously soft blubber. \"Let's go to Paulownia Mall, where we first started teaching you about the human world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth smiled gently as she looked down past her cascading fat body as the young woman gently hugged one of Elizabeth's thick, pillar-like arms as she closed her eyes and smiled, a gentle sigh of happiness escaping her lips. However, there was the matter of fact that, as she stood currently, Elizabeth was unable to leave thanks to extra 500 or so pounds she had packed on from eating so much bread and a number of tarts from the school store. As she currently was, she actually had to hunch over a bit just so her head wasn't uncomfortably pressed up against the school's ceiling. It was then Elizabeth remembered her own powers as she smiled with a bit more of her eccentric vigor gracing her pale face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then. If that is what you desire, then I shall make it so.\" Elizabeth cooed as she, with a sudden playful grin creasing her chipmunk-like fatty face, pulled Minako into her vast bulk with her immense arms, the Persona-used gasping in surprised as she felt herself sink into Elizabeth's bulk once more, her face smothered between the attendant's immense, quivering bosom as she was pulled back into a velvet blue elevator door that seemed to just rise up from the ground. The door closed behind the pair, disappearing as they fell in all the way. Thankfully, no one had seen them, save for a single delinquent who decided against drinking on school grounds, thanks to the sight he had beheld.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reddish-brown haired girl cried out in shock, her red eyes opened wide as she suddenly felt herself stop, like she was riding an elevator that had come to a bit of a surprising halt. She looked around, observing as her surroundings had changed to that of the back alley in Paulownia Mall, where she usually went to fuse Personae in the Velvet Room outside of Tartarus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have arrived at our destination.\" Elizabeth said cheerily as she let go of Minako, allowing the somewhat ruffled school girl a short fall to the floor as she landed on her feet. Minako sighed as she shook her head, then turned to face Elizabeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Please warn me next time you do that.\" Minako pleaded. While she loved Elizabeth dearly, sometimes her eagerness and whimsical energy was more than enough to take her aback. Then again, it seemed to be one of the more charming things about her, especially given the look of joy that so often graced her face because of such wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...I apologize.\" Elizabeth clasped her hands as she folded them in front of herself, the sides of her puffy arms pressing against her bulging breasts, squishing them together in somewhat of a heart shape, her soft, creamy cleavage bulging out of the top of her tightly fitting uniform, causing Minako to nervously search for some tissues nearby so she could stop the blood pouring from her nostrils, instead opting to just pinch her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, it's fine...let's just get you something to eat for now.\" Minako replied, her voice a bit nasally thanks to her nostrils being held together. \"Let's just stop by Chagal Cafe. They added some pastries to their menu, so we could probably nab ourselves some coffee and donuts if you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth's eyes lit up as she stared down at Minako. It seemed that this was to be expected at any mention of food and if that was the case, Minako wondered if she would start getting cavities from how sweet Elizabeth was behaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be wonderful! And I have always wanted to try this 'coffee' I hear humans so fervently mention. I hear it is a marvelous brew that brings humans the vigor they lack for daily tasks and is frequently used for this purpose during mornings, to aid in breaking one's fast. Such a wondrous must posses truly amazing qualities!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako stifled some amused chuckling as she gently grasped the immense attendant's hand, leading her over to Chagal Cafe, the pink sign making it stand out among other establishments. Elizabeth just barely managed to squeeze her thick frame into the establishment. She had required Minako's help pushing her in, causing her immensity to wobble to and fro in such a manner that Minako had to stuff nearby napkins up her nose to keep herself from bleeding onto the floor. Slowly, Elizabeth shuffled with her wide gait towards one of the tables, placed by a bench embedded in a lower area of the establishment. A sigh escaped Elizabeth's adorably plump lips as she planted her immensity on the bench, spreading out as her thick, fatty legs oozed over, her thighs squishing against the soft padding like they were made of marshmallow and her immense hips taking up a grand portion of space. While her inhuman stamina allowed her to gracefully carry her bulk as if she were her normal weight, the velvet clad woman had to admit it was nice to not be on her fatty feet so long as relaxed peacefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako was more than happy enough to take a seat on Elizabeth's oversized beanbag of a belly, feeling herself sink comfortably within the mass of corpulence as she watched a waitress walk over timidly, her hand shaking as she held up a pencil to a notepad while staring on at the couple and their starkly contrasting figures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have one of the special coffees here and...my date here will have as many donuts, bagels, tarts and whatever you can spare until she's filled to the brim.\" Minako chirped, gently learning forwards to give Elizabeth a loving eskimo kiss, pressing the tip of her nose against Elizabeth's gently as she wrapped her arms around her beloved's immensity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress sighed as she felt herself smile a bit, whistling as she put down the order. It didn't take too long as the coffee was brought to them. Minako simply asked for the cafe's special coffee while Elizabeth's, of course, was laden with excess amounts of cream and sugar, leaving her coffee a very pale, light brown as she gulped the hot beverage down. Whole trays of pastries were brought to Elizabeth's attention as well as a multitude of paninis and grilled sandwiches, which were almost inhaled as the massive woman turned them into more delicate pounds within seconds, powdery donuts, warm danishes, deliciously toasty grilled ham and cheese sandwiches...all of these vanished within the confines of Elizabeth's person, the only trace being her growing form as she stuffed herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako sighed as she enjoyed observing this display of gluttony firsthand, feeling her heart pound faster as her body temperature rose. It also helped that, just for a bit of extra measure, the red-eyed girl was partaking in Chagal Cafe's famous pheromone coffee, said to help make whoever drinks it even more charming. It seemed to working as not only did people look at her every time she had it, but Elizabeth herself seemed to be stealing glances at her, taking breaks as the immense attendant, her weight measuring over a whole ton by now as her immense arms were pushed up by the sides of her belly, her thick hips stretching the skirt of her dress to its limit, reducing it to a sort of fancy tube top by this point as her thick stockings began to tear at the sides as they struggled to contain the massive Greek Pillars that served as Elizabeth's legs, her thighs refusing to remain shackled by the elegant black hose while her trembling, gargantuan bosom was kept under barely sensible cover by her outstretched uniform, which was in danger already of bursting at the seams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako felt her own excitement rise within her as she leaned against Elizabeth's ballooning form as she lounged against Elizabeth's fatty, trembling belly, which spilled onto the floor as she climbed her way up and looked within Elizabeth's yellow eyes. This actually caused the gluttonous attendant to stop her feast as she halted, holding a Boston cream donut just inches from her fatty jowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Is there something you wish to ask of me?\" Elizabeth asked innocently, powdered sugar and cream staining her lips.</span></div></div>",
