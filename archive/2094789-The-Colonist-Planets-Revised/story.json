Automated drones explored a bit of these planets to determine various factors that may be known or unknown. Including to determine if there were any natives on the planet or what you would know as alien life forms. The drones searched for water, and food sources. When they came back they had five different planets that you could choose from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The first of which was a planet that was named by your people as \"Crimson Gaia\". This planet was the largest of the five to be found. The planet according to the drone reports had told you that it had ten continents on it. However only one of them was fully explored by the drones, oddly enough it was the only drone to come back.  Crimson Gaia was also described to have many plants and wildlife with various shades of red.  Gravity upon this planets was five times greater than that of earth, as well as the planet itself being five times bigger. As far as any signs of alien life forms or natives. It had been conclude undetermined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The second planet the drones have reported however was quite different from the previous planet and was only three times bigger than the earth. this planet also had  three times the gravity of the planet.  The planet's wildlife on this planet were not red, but instead purple. This planet was known to have actually less continents than earth but however they were much bigger all four of them. There were also signs of alien or native life, but none were  seen by the drones.  The drones weather conditions report that living on this planet would be especially hard during the winter season, fortunately there were several thermal induced caves people could live in during that period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The Third planet was the most earth like and was given the name Second Earth. Like it's name suggest this was the most earth like of the planets and it even had a similar gravity and number of continents.  While the number of continents were the same there shape was different.  This planet has the highest chance of meeting alien or native life forms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The fourth planet was slightly smaller than that of earth, and had slightly less gravity, but not much to make much of a difference. It had three large continents and was much more bluish than that of our earth.  The three continents did indeed seem to connect to each other. However the rest of the planet as the drones had described this one was a Tropical paradise. Since all the continents were close to the equator of this planet making it quite warm and pleasant. This planet however showed no signs of native life forms at all. However it would be a paradise for people to live in as long as your not the type that likes large exploration's that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The final and fifth planet to choose from was the smallest and lightest gravity of all the planet's. This planet only had zero continent's instead it had many various islands, some larger and some smaller but none bigger. Similar to the previous planet however was that the weather here was also tropical, at least in some islands. Other islands had different types of weather. In fact the weather seemed quite unstable at times.  Fortunately though it was nothing to severe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    After you viewed all five option you finally knew which planet you were going to pick as the one that you decided to live out the rest of your life on. For that reason you decided to choose the....</span></div></div>",

You're reasons for doing so were you felt like you needed a planet that could really challenge you and this was the one that would really challenge you. As you boarded the shuttle you saw the other people that had chosen this planet as well. They seemed about excited about it as you were. The trip to arrive in the planet would take a year. However during that year you would get to know your fellow Colonist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   You noticed form each colonist going to this planet that five of them were male, and the remaining five were female. Which would give you plenty of time to get to know the other nine colonist with you. The second thing you noticed is they all seemed to vary in age.

Despite that even the youngest of the colonist who were with you on the trip were valuable as you recognized both of them as child prodigies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       The plane was as red as Mars, but unlike Mars it had shown signs of life. The trees and grass had various shade of red with them as well as the bark of the trees themselves being orange rather than the light brown and green that you were used to on Earth. The wind and the air was fresh and the continents were quite large meaning that there would be quite a bit of exploration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Since there would be a lot of exploration however it means that while the first few night's many of the colonist would get to know each other. The rest of the days you all would be too far from each other to do so. The transport landing area was pretty much inside the one continent that the drone's had picked when they searched for signs of life. However you remember that only one of the drone's came back, despite them sending at least ten on the planet., which meant something happened to the other drone's and none of you had any idea where they could be.  This is a rather large planet full of life after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    All the Colonist gather and wave at the transport as it leaves the planet. Leaving the ten of you with only your wits and limited equipment to explore the planet. Thankfully some of that included hover cycles. Hover cycles were one of the few vehicles on  your world developed years ago that were still pollution free. It came at a time when the people on earth still cared about their planet. As they began to search more and more for other planet's to live on however, it seemed that Earth got even lazier in caring for their own planet. None of the colonist wanted that when they were chosen to inhabit this planet.  The colonist instead picked environment friendly vehicles that would aid in there exploration.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       Now that all of that is out of the way the meeting can begin. \" Listen up, there's a lot to explore and we might not get to know each other so allow me to introduce myself. My name is Greg and I come from Earth. For the first few weeks we should take a look at our guidebooks as it has all the drone's reporting and tells us what we can eat and can not.\"  Greg told us, it was good advice even though we brought food from home we all knew that there was expected to be another transport in six months with more food. However it would be best not to rely on it for there are a number of things that could happen that could change that fact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Everyone was eager to explore, however for the first few days we would be getting to know each other and learning each others Specialty for each one of the colonist had a different field of study with.

You knew this planet would be the right pick for you as there were many places to explore and discover, and you like the challenge of a heavier gravity. You looked around and saw that the oldest of the Colonist arriving upon this planet. Out of the ten that chose this planet the oldest person was around twenty six years of age. Fortunately you weren't the youngest as there were two nine years of age one a boy and the other a girl who also came.  You ship had finally landed and you all had finished your training to get used to the new gravity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The training to deal with this type of gravity came quite handy and helped all of you each a bit. During the trip you managed to get to know your fellow Colonists. The first of which was a twenty five year old man, who went by the name of Christopher. Christopher had brown hair, blue eyes and was about six feet even. His build was even more impressive as he was also quite strong.  Christopher also knew several types of martial arts. As soon as you got off the ship he immediately took charge, and not a single person dared to ignore him. It became obvious to you that he would be the leader of the colonists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The second oldest was a woman who was twenty four  years old. She had red hair, blue eyes and her height was about five feet and six inches tall. The most noticeable thing you noticed about her however was that she had a ring on her finger and often hanged out a lot witch Chris. Her Name was Sarah and she had claimed to be Christopher's  wife even though they have yet to be married. Despite both of them acting like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The two youngest of the colonist were the two nine years old you noticed earlier. They're names were James and Jennifer. As it turned out these two happened to be close friends. They also mentioned that they both have siblings who were also on this planet as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The next person was at least to your mind the most beautiful woman you had ever seen, you felt like you had to talk to her, she was about your age  had blond hair, blue eyes.  You were wanting to talk to her, but you felt pressure in your heart as if kept beating and beating. The beating of your heart got faster and faster. You had began to approach her.....</span></div></div>",

Thankfully you weren't hurt but you saw that the foot print was rather large in fact. Larger than any footprint you had seen before and you haven't exactly seen that many. Fortunately the woman around your age that you were trying to reach came to you as you began to get up after falling into the footprint. \" Are you alright?\" She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" Yes, I am fine just fell into a footprint.\" You said. Realizing what you said you looked carefully at the foot print and realized that whatever made it was quite big. Then again everything on this planet was big to you and the other Colonist.  Upon further examination of the footprint you began to realize that this footprint didn't look like it belonged to an animal. Mainly due to the fact that the footprint was a humanoid shape.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" The footprint appears to be humanoid shape and heading west of hear, if I had to say this might be one of the signs of intelligent life we've been looking for.\" The woman said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Um.. What is your name?' You gather your courage to say as the woman is completely entranced by the footprint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Sheila is my name. Judging by this footprint the humanoid who made it had to be at least thirty feet tall, but that would be impossible on our planet. \" Sheila said, while still focusing on the footprint. It was just one footprint but she suspected that there might be more further West as that was the direction the footprint was indicating.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Hey, want to go further and west and see if we can find what made this footprint?\" Sheila asked me.  She had obviously made up her mind to go West even if you decided not to. However if you went back to the temporary base you could grab a vehicle and get there faster than you would have on foot. On the other had if you really didn't know if the humanoid making this footprint was friendly or not so it might just be best to wait at the base and hope for the best. It was the safest option you had. Eventually after thinking on it a bit you decided too...</span></div></div>",

Can't I just stay on my own?\" I asked.  The Captain fortunately was quick to respond and answer my question thoroughly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \" There are only a total of ten people who would be staying here, one of them is you. A lot of room went into various supplies and the ship so we could only carry so much at this time. As far as the ship goes, if everything on the home planet goes well a supply ship for more homes should be available in another six months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    With his explanation the others who would be staying on the same planet had also arrived and stepped on to the planet. While that was happening I was meeting with the woman who I would be staying with.  Her age was only a few years from mine, but the moment I came into her view she went and smiled at me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" You are Cassie? Correct Nice to meet you! My name is Amber, I know it's rough but I'll be your roommate for while you are staying her okay?\" Amber asked me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Amber was nice enough for now and despite that was also eager to get to the planet just as I was. The two of us were the last to leave the ship. As far as the Captain went he came and went back to earth. During our trip we had training to deal with the heavy gravity, I can't imagine how thankful I am for that training now. Getting off the ship and on to the planet we saw it for the first time. I know the planet was named Crimson Gaia, but this was the first time I was able to see why. The leaves and grass were red, not a deep red but an occasionally light red with various shades of pink blending in.  The planet looked quite beautiful and the climate was quite warm, if not a bit dusty from time to time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The first thing me and Amber did is....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>We go out to find a meeting is about to start. It looks like we got our home set up just in time. I look at Amber and see that she has red hair, blue eyes she's slightly taller than me but only about an inch of two. Her outfit however was much different than what I was wearing though. I am not sure why I didn't notice it sooner, but Amber is wearing a white lab coat and black pants. along with sneakers for shoe's I am confident the reason she wore sneaker's was more for comfort than to look pretty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" What kind of job did you when you were on Earth?\" I asked curiously now that I was paying more attention to her attire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" I am a biologist, I study life.\" Amber quickly replied.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Learning Amber was a biologist was interesting to me. As far as myself goes I had studied life before in my limited age group, but mostly just for school. I hated school on Earth it was such a pain and never much fun. There were always test and more tests. The problem was that they tested us with everything giving us very little time to ourselves or even asking us what we wanted to do.  Instead we just got tested for every little thing, It was rather annoying and I am glad I don't have to go to school here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      We go to the gathering and listen as the other fellow colonists speak. I look and examine each and every one of them. One was a guy with blond hair, blue eyes, and very tall and muscular. I haven't hear his name yet but from the look of his uniform he was in the Military. The second one I notice was also wearing a military uniform, however her uniform was quite different from the guys. She could have been in a different Military altogether for all I know. Either way both of them looked real intense sitting next to each other and I wasn't going to have any of that so I decided to sit next to the two other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The girls didn't bother me as much and one of the was almost old as Amber, and the other was almost as young as me. Apparently they got paired to sleep with each other as well. I go over and introduce myself to the two girls I am sitting next to. I didn't want to be rude to people I do not know.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The girl that was sitting to me on my right she was the closest of my age. When I introduced myself she told me her name was Sequoya. It was a real pretty name but kind of hard to pronounce, she even told me about how her ancestors were natives to America. Her tanned skin and  black hair certainly made her look the part.  If Sequoya's story is true than I can't imagine how hard it must have been for her to leave everything she knew behind. On the other hand all of us are in the same boat. Mainly because we all left everything we knew behind as well. It might not be much of a problem for others though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       As for the girl sitting to me on my left when I introduced myself she was the one who annoyed me the most. For some reason she always treats me like a child. I am not a child anymore and I can handle myself, but this girl she doesn't seem to listen every time I explain it to her.  Her name is Mina,  I don't know much about her though. So far she and the Military girl are the only people I seem to have a problem with.  Amber, Sequoya, The Military girl and Mina as well as myself are the only girl's on this planet. Well as far as we know that is, there could be more but there's a lot to search for on this planet before finding any signs of native life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Knowing almost half of the Colonist we being to proceed with the meeting. The meeting is led by the Military girl who called herself Sergeant Bask. She quickly pretty much told us the basics of why we are here. We knew much of that stuff already and then suggested that we get to know each and every one of the people here. She insists that it's because we will have to depend on each other for survival.  After hearing her words I decided to...</span></div></div>",

At least then I could finally get some privacy and maybe there would be a time when I would eventually need them for something. As far as Myself goes however I wouldn't necessarily need to though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       I approach the remaining five colonist and carefully examine each and ever one of them. The oldest of the group  had a muscular build, brown hair and was at least six feet and five inches tall. He wore a casual white shirt, and jeans with sneakers. His hands looked quite big. He most likely was into fixing and building machine's if I had to guess.  The second guy next to him was a bit different he was shorter in stature, but still around six feet tall. He wore a white lab coat, and white sacks. Must be hard on him all that white he is wearing really made him stand out. I suspected that he was a doctor of some kind. I didn't know what kind of doctor he was, however if I have a health issue he'd probably the one to go to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      The next of the remaining colonist was closer to my age but still younger than me. Much to my surprise he was the guy in the military uniform I have seen before. He was still very tall and muscular, perhaps even taller than the other guy. He still intimidates me though even now. I even question why they continue to wear the military uniform even though they aren't part of the military any more since they live on this planet.  I may be young but  there is something off about that guy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The next two of the Colonist were the youngest of the bunch. They were also the closest to my age, so I figured they would be the one's I would introduce myself to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Hello my name is Cassie. who are you?\" I asked.  Apparently one of them was very shy and was quick to run away from me as soon as I introduced myself to him. At least that's what I thought for all I know he could have had some weird crush on me. As far as the one that remained he did indeed introduce himself and like me he was the youngest of the group but only older than me by a year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Hi Cassie, My name is Sean. Sorry about Thomas, I know he ran away when you introduced yourself but don't hold it against him okay?\"  Sean asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Okay I wont, I am just trying to get something over with so we can get on with what's real important anyways.\" I told Sean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Eager to explore the Planet then?\" Sean asks me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Quite, and so far all we have done is get to know each other a bit, I could use a bit of exploration.\" I told Sean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Then perhaps I can help, I  have been looking at some of the drone's report and I think I know where we can find some truly interesting discoveries.\" Sean told me. I was intrigued by his response but wasn't sure what the interesting discoveries were or how it would affect us, however exploration of this planet is one of the biggest reasons I cam here after all.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \" Where are these so called discoveries?\" I asked. Sean look at me and then smiled as he began his response to my question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" There's one  west a couple of miles away from the camp, and another South of us but to get to that one we would have to travel on the hover cycles provided for us. Otherwise it would take too long.\" Sean said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    I now had two destinations to pick out one that was West it was walking distance so we could be there and back before nightfall. On the other hand there was also another discovery south of here as well, at least according to what he saw from the drone reports. Neither of us knew what possibility would be there though.  On the downside we would definitely be noticed if we went that far alone and the people who are older than us would no doubt not let the two of us go alone to this place. I wasn't sure which way to go but eventually I decided to go...</span></div></div>",

We could tell it's a pathway because despite the tree's being around it there were no branches on the path and it looked like there was some kind of maintenance done towards this path. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Wow! I didn't expect this.\" Sean said as he looked at the pathway in amazement. We both knew what finding this path meant though. It was the one of the first signs of intelligent life on the planet. However I  have yet to meet any other than a bit of the wildlife. As expected of this planet however, just like everything else it was five time's bigger than  you expected. I got  excited about this prospect of  continue to explore until  I  found more signs of intelligent life. Unfortunately I also knew that for now it would probably be best to report this back to the base camp where your home with Amber is.

After a few hours of walking back it didn't take long but eventually we reached back towards the camp where Amber was waiting. She was perhaps the only who didn't really go out into the field and explore that much. As there was plenty of vegetation around the base for her to examine and most of the ones who went further than that were looking for more than just vegetation. From what we understood one group went out to observe wildlife in the area. Another just went out to map the region, they packed a rather big supply and headed for the closest yet highest grounds they could find. As for the rest they just stayed here and mostly cooked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Hello Amber, We came back we find some thing you might be interested in as well as a few things other people might be interested in as well.\" I told Amber as we handed over the water sample and the various vegetation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Thank you, this should help me quite a bit.

Well that includes many plants except a few exceptions but depending on the color can determine what the plant is capable of.  So far most plants brought back to me were various shades of red except for this one.\" Amber then showed us a plant that wasn't actually red on the planet but instead was rather green. In fact it looked like a regular plant that you could find on Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Is this plant from earth?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Amber shakes her head. \" No It isn't, but you should be cautious of plants that aren't shades of red as they are the ones that have the possibility of being poisonous.  I wouldn't recommend eating anything on the planet at least until  we find out what is edible. Fortunately we have our food supply from the ship, but that will only last about a year.\"   After discussing the plant life with Amber we had to wait for some of the other groups to come back to tell about the path that we had seen.

But together we are a community and we will make our own rules.\"  The colonist had cheered that statement you had said. What you said however was true. Without out any parents it would be up to the remaining to make the rules. You also had noticed that the transport that left the ten of you here was already gone. Almost as if the people of your own world thought the rest of you were unimportant to them. In some ways it kind of felt like you were abandoned by your own world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \" All though we can make our own rules, none of us wants to suffer, so please don't do anything to make other's suffer.\" You told them. They weren't as interested in that speech as they were your first words which got everyones attention. \" For now though let's introduce ourselves to each other, I am sure many of you don't know each other so we should at least get each other's name first. We will go from youngest to oldest.\"   The fist to stand and introduce himself was a boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Hi, My name is Max and I am ten years old.\"  Max said to the group. He was definitely one of the four of the youngest ones that you saw earlier.  He was wearing a blue shirt and blue jeans with white socks and sneakers. His clothes were very plain for a ten year old. At least when compared to you at that age.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     After Max introduced himself, a girl stood up and began to introduce herself. \" Hello you can call me Mary I am also ten years old. I am also what the adults would call a child genius cause I could solve equations those idiots could not.\" Mary said confidently as she began to sit back down. She was also one of the youngest in the group you saw, she wore a slim pair of glasses, her hair was brown and was in a French braid. From what you could tell from her response she was very intelligent and often considered herself to be better than her elders who weren't as smart as her. Resulting in a somewhat bratty attitude. She wore a pink dress with white socks and Mary Jane's she even wore pink gloves as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"  My name is Peter I am also ten but unlike the other's I am the coolest ten year old around.\"  The  third of the youngest group introduced himself. He was quite confident that he was the coolest person around and even wore shades to prove it. His attitude of thinking he was cool was a bit annoying to you, but for now you tolerated it. He was after all only ten. His leather jacket and black shirt with his blue jeans, white socks and flip flops made up the entirety of what he wore.  The next person to introduce herself was the last of the four that were the youngest in your group of Colonist.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \" Hi, My name is Kiki, I am not very talkative but when I have something to say it's usually important, I am also ten years old and I have never had any parents all my life. So I am what you call an orphan but I hope we can get along.\"  Kiki said as she introduced herself. So far two boys and two girls had introduced themselves but Kiki out of the four seemed to be the humblest and honest out of the four.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \" That was a fine introduction Kiki. My name is Hans and I've been a friend of Kiki's for a long time. But anyone who even dares to try and hurt her will have to go through me. My parents name me Hans because they liked those ancient Star Wars movies, least until they abandoned me when I was four. I  have been Kiki's friend ever since I am eleven years old.\" Hans told us. You were quickly learning that each of these people had their own problems on Earth some of which were quite saddening to you. As you weren't one with that problem you had a family of your own after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \" Hello to you all. I am about eleven years old as well. You can call me Betty I don't have much to say like the other's as my life is now here, not on Earth.\" Betty said. As soon as she introduced herself her words affected the people who were saddened by Kiki's story and cheered them right up. It was almost like she was saying forgot about earth, we are a family now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Greetings I am twelve years old. My name is Antoine, but I prefer being called Tony.\"  Tony said and ten sat right back down. He didn't mention anything specific about himself just that his name was Antoine but he preferred to be called Tony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \" Well Since almost everyone has gone and introduced themselves it would be rude of me not to introduce myself. My name is Melody I am also twelve years old. Guess there's only two more people to introduce themselves now that everyone else has gotten it out of the way.\" Melody said as she sat back down.

You were the oldest of all the colonist being Thirteen and there was only one other person who was older than you. Fortunately with everyone else introduced you decided to introduce yourself before the last of the boys would. \" Hi My name is Kayla and I am thirteen years old, I have red hair and blue eyes. as for my height I am about four feet and nine inches tall.\" You tell the group your name.  With your introduction out of the way the final boy got up and began to introduce himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Hello, Call me Zack, as you can suspect like Kayla I am also thirteen years old. I am about five feet and nine inches tall. So I am at least one foot taller than Kayla. Now that should be all the introductions. SO what will we do now?\" Zack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Zack had a point with the introductions out of the way. You knew the colonist would be able to do what we came here to do in the first place.  Which meant exploring this purple planet and all of it's wonders.  \" I am glad I got to know  Max, Mary, Peter, Kiki, Hans, Betty, Antoine or Tony which he prefers, Melody and Zack. All nine of my fellow Colonist. First I think we should check our supplies out and see what the transport left us. It  may have already left but it should have left some food for us all. \" You tell the Colonist. Partially because after that introduction you were hungry and wanting a good meal, however the transport took off rather quick and there is quite the potential that it may have forgotten to leave stuff behind. As you go and check the landing spot for the transport you quickly discovered....</span></div></div>",

This meant that there would be much more difficulties for you ahead. As you all just arrived on the planet on knew very little about it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" What do we do now we don't have any food?\" You asked the rest of the group. You were worried but fortunately some of the others had a few ideas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Don't worry Kayla, we may be the same age, but I do have an idea, will just have to hunt for our food. Kind of like the did back in the old days of Earth.\" Zack said.  You really didn't like the idea of hurting animals but you also knew everyone had to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Yeah! like fishing, but how are we suppose to catch anything?\"  Hans asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" You don't have to worry about that. I am sure we have equipment for that. Our planet may have forgotten our food, but they haven't forgotten our equipment.\" Melody replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Guess we have no choice, but what if we don't like to hunt we can forage for food.\" Betty suggested.  We all now at least have had some sort of plan to acquire food. Fortunately if we had the equipment to hunt, that means we have the equipment to cook it as well. Which saves us time. However for the food search we would have to be splitting up. One group for the hunt and another foraging. Even though none of us were adults we were still highly capable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" So I guess this means five of us will go hunting and five of us will go foraging then?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" That seems the case, in that case how about Max, Mary, Peter and Kiki will go foraging and the older kids will go hunting. Hunting may be too dangerous for the younger ones right now, especially since we don't know what's there.\" Zack said taking charge. You admittedly thought his decision was a good one as it kept the younger colonist safe. However  You didn't want anything to happen to them and now had to choose would you hunt with the Older Kids, or watch the younger ones as they forage in the forest.

These four were the youngest of the colonists but despite that you were sure that they weren't just sent here cause they were young. After all seeing them looking to find edible food seems like a more reasonable thing to do at this moment. Especially since you hardly knew anything of the creatures on this planet to begin with.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Zack, I will go with the young ones and find us some food. I believe I will be most useful there.\" you tell Zack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" If you say so, Come on group let's go fishing.\" Zack said. From his words you could easily tell that he didn't have a plan to bring you along on his fishing trip with the others anyways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       The five of you went and looked into the forest, However being a planet of purple it was quite different from what you used to see on earth. That even included the sky, which always had an orange tint to it during the day.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Stop!\" Mary yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" What is it Mary?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" I apologize for yelling but you were about to step on that plant, and I don't think that would be a good idea.\" Mary replied back. You were curious about what Mary had thought of and how she could assume that plant could be dangerous despite only being here only for a day. As you look at the plant however  you began to realize that this plant didn't have purple leaves like many of the others. In fact it oddly enough had green leaves on it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Mary, you told me to stop because the leaves on this particular plant were green correct?\" you asked. Mary simply nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" That's right it was an unusual color for this planet, and even though there are several other plants here with purple leaves, we should be careful because for all we know any plant we touch could be potentially poisonous.\"  Mary replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" That's Mary for you, her degree in Biology certainly can be helpful.\" Max said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Mary has a degree in Biology? But she's only ten years old? How did she get a degree in Biology?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" By being really smart. I am well aware that most of us aren't even considered adults on earth, despite that all of us have greater talents. Like Max who's good at inventing all sorts of gadgets.\"  Mary replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" You two have been quiet? Do either of you have any talents I should know about that could be useful?\" You asked Peter and Kiki the other two besides yourself that were in your group.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \" Well since you asked, I am quite capable when it comes to learning a different language.\" Peter said.  At first it thought all of you just being young seemed like an incident but you began to ponder that perhaps it wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"  I haven't exactly figured out what kind of talent I have yet.\" Kiki said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" That's okay I'm sure you will find it soon enough. As for myself well I do have experience in leading, and I can cook and sew. Other than that I don't think I have all that much to offer.\" You told the group after they answered your questions about the talents they have.  Now that you know a bit about your group who went into the forest to find food you begin to ponder about what will happen next?</span></div></div>",

The first of which was trying to decide how they are going to hunt and what they are going to hunt and other members of his group weren't exactly keen on leaving some of the younger ones. Especially Hans who was Kiki's friend since childhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Zack, we should be with the others, not doing various jobs separately. I am worried about Kiki, she could be in danger for all I know.\" Hans said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Don't worry she will be fine, Kayla will be watching over them so nothing bad will happen. Besides do you think that this is a normal group of people under thirteen?\" Zack asked  Hans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" What do you mean by that?\" Hans returned Zack's question with another question. However it wasn't Zack who answered the question but rather Betty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" What he means is that each one of us has a unique talent, two have leadership skills to keep the Colonist together, Another two are child prodigies. As for the rest I really haven't figured that out but I am sure they have their own unique abilities as well.\" Betty replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" It is as she said, however she forgot to mention that two are linguistic experts despite their age. Myself included.\" Tony said. Hans was  beginning to realize what each member offered but had yet to learn of anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" For now let's focus on our task at hand, Hunting but first we will need to get what supplies we can. Luckily while Earth left us without food they didn't leave us without supplies.\" Melody said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \" Right, but what is it we are going to hunt and how they didn't give us any guns?\" Hans asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" First we will try fishing at first, We don't know enough about the animals on the land to hunt them yet, but maybe we can do a bit of spear fishing and hopefully we will catch something.\"  Zack said. The rest of group nodded that for now spear fishing would be their best bet. However Hans still had something on his mind as his group began to head towards what they believed was the closest river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Something on your mind Hans?\" Melody asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" I just think that perhaps Earth, left us with no food on purpose.\" Hans replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Why would they do that?\" Melody asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" Maybe they just wanted to see that we can survive, I don't know it isn't like we can just take a look back on them.\" Hans said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Maybe or maybe not, but I know Max is a genius and I am confident that he can built something that can help us find out.\" Melody told Hans reassuringly.  Zack's group then began to continue their fishing unfortunately for them,  their success was somewhat limited as only one member of the group had managed to catch anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Noticing it was getting late Zack told the group to head back to the landing spot. As that would be where they would be sleeping for the night. Fortunately You and you're group were much more successful at finding food then they were at catching dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" All ten of us are back in this spot again.\" You said as you were preparing a fire with a cauldron and a pot. You were at the moment the only one who was able to cook and the ingredients weren't exactly something you were used to. Fortunately however you had gotten back earlier and found some ingredients and food enough to make a stew out of.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \" We didn't have much catching fish, we decided to hold off hunting the other animals until we learn more about them. However we did catch one.\" Zack said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" It's a good thing we split into groups otherwise we might have come back with nothing.\"  You told him. As the sun went down the horizon you began to notice the large orange sky began to change color as it went from orange to more of a dark blue. It wasn't like the blue you would see in the sky on earth, but  with this dark blue sky you could see the stars from it.  You then begin preparations for the fish after it was tested by Max, and Mary to determine it was safe. Fortunately the fish was safe to eat and all the group began to eat the first dish completely made of food from this planet. Which was mainly fish stew, it wasn't an exciting dish but one that was simple enough to make. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Everyone ate the food you made despite not liking some of the ingredients. It was not time for you all to rest. Thankfully the camp is divided as all the girls will be sharing one of the high tech tents, it gives each person their own room and bathroom thankfully. It would be the same with the tent on the guys side as well. Then the final tent that was set up was the kitchen tent, this wasn't set up earlier so you couldn't exactly of made anything but fish stew at the time. For now it was time for you to get some sleep as you were worn out from all the traveling and all of you went to sleep.</span></div></div>",

She began from the oldest. and had noticed that both Lily and Tony were here so thankfully no one from her age group was missing.  Then she went and looked around for the next age group. Which was your group and you were all present. It was when Melody looked at the youngest group that she noticed in particular. Max, Mary and Peter were missing. Yet the only one to return from foraging in the forest was Kiki. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \" I see we have three people missing here. Can you explain why you return alone Kiki?\" Melody asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" I can, but they wont like it.\" Kiki replied and began to tell Melody what happened. \" we were foraging berries like you said we would me and Mary were pretty happy about it. Peter and Max on the other hand thought it was a girls job and they shouldn't have to do it. They were even upset that a girl was the leader of our group. Then they decided to try and make their own camp in a cave. Unfortunately Mary didn't want to go in the cave because she saw signs and traces of a predatory beast living in there. Then they told us we were just cowards, that was when Mary decided to tell me to return to camp. She made it sound like she was sticking with Max and Peter, but I am not sure if that's the case. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Melody had received quite a bit of information of Kiki. Enough to know that three of the people she was looking after are in great danger. Fortunately she was quick in deciding a resolution. \" Alright Kiki, thank you for your information. I need you to lead us to the others and find a way to get to that cave immediately. Listen up none of us are having dinner until everyone is accounted for, so we are going to follow Kiki and find the three missing members of our crew. Then I am going to have a stern chat with each of them. Be sure and ready a weapon  before heading out, we don't know what were facing after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \" Melody, there is one more thing Mary told me, she was quite fascinated with the forest due to the problems she was having with her electronic equipment in there. It was almost as if the forest had a current of it's own. She once told me.\" Kiki said. Melody nodded and understood what that meant and then we all grabbed various weapons in hopes of saving the youngest from themselves. As you all began to reach the forest with a weapon in hand you had yet to speak so far, as Melody was the leader and from what you saw of her, she was doing a great job so far. Fortunately their trail was easy to follow and we managed to reach the cave, all seven of you, armed with what people would call primitive weapons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Mary fortunately left a rather easy trail for your group to follow. With some kind of berry that had appeared to glow in the dark forest. You were impressed by Melody's leadership but it was obvious from her fact that she was slightly irritated by Max and Peter's actions.  Once you arrive at the cave, the three came running back towards you screaming. Apparently they had angered the creature within the cave. Unfortunately animals can be highly territorial and you could tell that this was definitely one of those type of animals. You just had to hope the fight goes well. As you saw it emerge  from it's cave it looked like a bear, yet at the same time not any type of bear you would ever see upon earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \" Help us!\" Max, Mary and Peter screamed running as fast as they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" That's exactly why were here, to help each other.

I have a name and so do you. Don't you?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Why, Yes indeed I do peasant!.\" He said continuing to ignore me plea to not be called a peasant. \" For I am King Anthony of this land.  I shall make sure my kingdom is a beautiful and prosperous one, so do let me know of any of your complaints and I shall try to amend him.\" After that little speech you decided to get as far away from him as possible just to resist the urge to punch him. He was aggravating, self-assertive and constantly belittling you. As you walk further away from him you ran into two more people. One was a woman who was dressed normally and another a young man both of them had seemed to be arguing about something. Curiously you check it out to see if you could help, you soon come to regret that decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"  You woman!  How dare you bring such wicked objects to a place worthy of my great science!\" the man yelled. The woman had her own argument however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \" These objects will help me attune to the magical energies of this planet, or at least I hope they will. I will not be powerless while I am here with one of your kind, it was because of us working together that we were able to get this far in the first place!\"  It was then that you decided to interrupt and begin to ask a question.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Science and Magic, What exactly are you two arguing about?\"  you asked interrupting there argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" You're the guy that got punched by the person who declared himself King of this place. Allow me to introduce myself my name is Clover. This may be hard for  you to believe but I am what many would call a witch.\" Clover said as she introduced herself. You looked to her in slight disbelief and thought of her to be just some crazy woman but apparently she could easily tell from your look that you disbelieved her statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \" I would prove it to you, but I am not yet in tone with the magical energies this planet has.\" Clover said. it was shortly after the guy came and introduced himself to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" More like you just don't want to embarrass yourself I Edward, a man of science believe that  you're just useless here! My Monstrous Advanced Dynamic Science, will amaze you when the time comes! However that is not what you came here for,  you came to try to settle our debate correct?\" Edward asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Yes, I think an outside opinion might help and it would be good if we could at least try to get along.\" You explained to both of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Very well, I put it in the most simplest way possible I believe we should head for a way that maintains the planet instead of destroying it. Magic will help with that.\" Clover said summarizing her statement so you could understand it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" I disagree with that! Magic is not the answer my M.A.D. Science  will be of better use then any of her skills. At least with the Science you will be able to understand it! So who do you think is right?\" Edward asks you.  After hearing these two people you carefully thought out your decision and decided too.</span></div></div>",

At least ten of you did, the other's took to the other worlds and began colonizing their. As the ten of you got out of the ship you were amazed to see how similar this plant was to home. Blue skies, a nice bright sun and several trees and fauna that looked all too similar. Of course you couldn't begin to explore, but others didn't want to at the moment instead they just wanted to rest. You however were eager to explore and wanted to find a few people who were feeling the same. It is a new world you will be living on after all. Just in case though some of the food supplies you have that were stored on the spaceship were left behind, just in case you needed it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   You go and take a deep breath of fresh air and for some reason from what you could tell just by breathing the air on this planet it is much more fresh, than that of your planet's. Of course you quickly realized this was probably due to the industries earth had built up years ago, that had damaged the environment. Still it was a very refreshing breath. You look around and go to a girl who looks to be about sixteen years of age and began to speak to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hello, Who are you again?  You asked. She looks at you at first and then laughs just before speaking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" My name is Sarah, you look like you have a big question on your mind. So hurry up and speak it.\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Well I'm just so eager to explore, but I don't want to do it alone, so I was wondering if you would like to come?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" You do know it would be a lot easier for you to explore if you wait for camp to be set up right? I know the camp is only temporary but it at least gives us some shelter. \" Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" I know, but I just rather be out there now.\" You told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" That is why the quicker you help set up camp the quicker we all can be out there.\" Sarah told you sternly suggesting you should set up camp first before trying to ask anyone to explore. She then continued to speak. \" When you finished that you'll have your team of five people who will go out there and explore with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" What are you the boss of this expedition?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" As a matter fact I am.\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" But I am older than you and you are only sixteen years old.\" You pointed out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" True, but I was the one appointed to lead you guys back home, if you don't believe take a look at this.\" Sarah went out and pulled a document out of her pocket.  You looked at the document and read about every inch of it that you could. Only to learn that indeed Sarah was the leader of the team and was responsible for you all. However despite her age she took her responsibility very seriously and while she had indeed told you to set up camp first she didn't exactly deny you an exploration team either. Which meant that she wanted camp set before anything.  With no other options you began to set up camp along with the others, Sarah does indeed help out with the set up and with everyone getting the campsite set up. It wasn't too long before everything was set up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You were sure now that it would be time for you and your group to set out and explore, however Sarah came and brought to you three people.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"  I will be going with you to explore and these are the other three that will be going with us. There names are Naomi, Richard, and Frederick. Each one of them has a unique talent that will help us as we explore the planet.

You didn't want to interrupt the other colonist so you continued looking and observing everything Second Earth had to offer. Many of the colonist that arrived you had their own agenda as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" You know we can help you do what you are doing right?\" A man asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" I know, but I prefer doing this myself, besides we don't know anything about the natives of this planet, especially whether they would be hostile or friendly towards us.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Sure, but you really should come with us, we are the only people who will be at this planet for a long while, and there should not be any harm in hanging out with the rest of the Colonists.\" The man told you insisting that you go and get to know the rest of the colonist.

I am about twenty two years and a bit, well kind of shy...I am five feet and six inches tall and I..I have brown hair and green eyes, can I get off this stage now?\" Gus asked looking at Amy nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Shortly after Gus exited another person came up to the temporary stage set up by Amy. \" Hi, I like hope you all have a good ay on this vacation of mine, but don't you dare to think you are even more important than me!

Instead they were waiting for the flight to be over. Carol had still yet to realize that this was a permanent trip, but you knew she would eventually realize it. You took a small gander in her room once and notice it was filled with many expensive and valuable stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    From the look of her room you could tell she was form a wealthy family. While the planet itself did say they would send supplies every six months. You also were accepting of a hard truth. War was about to erupt on the earth once more, however it didn't appear that there would be a winner this time. Especially since you had a friend who tried to warn the people still on earth that a huge meteor was heading towards Earth. They just laughed and dismissed it, they were sure that no matter what would happen they would survive it, just like all the other times they had been warned of impending doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The transport begin to land and you can feel the touch of the ground it was hard to believe that it only took you a year to land. Before the landing you took a picture of the planet that many on Earth were calling the second Earth. It was a beautiful planet with green grass and trees were plentiful. The oxygen was quite pure and you couldn't smell any of that polluted air that was on your home. For the first time in a long time you knew what your ancestors were talking about when they said the words \"Fresh air\".    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The picture you took gave you a simple design of how the layout of the continents looked. Many of them looked similar but had some slight alterations to them. The rest of the group was also amazed at how fresh the air was. As you suspected as soon as you were off the transport Amy began to take charge and leading the rest of the Colonists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Listen up, this planet is where we are going to spend the rest of our lives, so we only have each other to depend on.  After all this is a one way trip and there isn't any way we are going back. We are here to stay.\" Amy told the colonists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Most of the colonist understood, well everyone except Carol but she would get it eventually. You began to set up what Amy called a temporary base and store what supplies you had left. Much to your surprise none of the machinery used in the area had very minimum pollution. You were happy about this as it meant that for the most part all your fellow Colonist cared about this planet, and didn't want to ruin it with pollution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   It wasn't long after the camp was set up that you were called by Amy.. \" Brando, I need your help with something. Can you come here for a bit?\" She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Sure, what do you need help with?\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" I need you to help fix some machines back here, these machines are mostly used to detect native or alien's on the planet.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" I can do that, but here we are the aliens and if there are others on the planet they are the natives we are the aliens.\" You told her.  You begin to work on the machines and fix them as these machines would help you study and learn about this planet's creature's and inhabitants.

Naturally however you weren't expecting what came next during that night as you slept in your tent.  However your sleep was short lived as you begin hearing strange noises coming from outside. You didn't exactly understand them, but it sounded like a language you have never heard before. You get up and take a look outside your tent only to be knocked unconscious immediately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   It was then the Native's on this planet grabbed you and took you somewhere but you didn't know where. Nor did you know what happened to any of the other colonists. The next time you awoke you were in what appeared to be a cage and surrounded by the natives of this planet. It was the first time you got a look at any of them, but as you looked you can see that there skin was similar to yours but a lot tanner. Perhaps it was because of the exposure to the sun they had.  You looked around and saw that none of the other colonist were captured and the only one they caught unfortunately was you. One of the girls had approached you and said something to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Unfortunately you could not understand what she had said to you. As you looked from your cage you began to watch and listen to the locals of the planet hoping you could understand each other. Unfortunately it would take time for you to learn there language instead you decided to try and ask them in  your tongue to see if they could understand you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Hello, why did you lock me up?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         At first it didn't seem that they understood, but eventually one of the woman had came over and began drawing pictures on the ground. You tried your best to interpret each picture. The first is they saw the Metal from the sky bring you here. That had to be the transport landing.  Then the picture shows you setting up your base near the ocean which was true as you all wanted to explore the planet as thoroughly as possible. However the next picture showed that some kind of monster frequently attack that area and the base would have been gone. The other colonist apparently had already left the area while you were still asleep.  As the girl drew the next drawing it was showing that of your being kidnapped and dragged towards where you are today.  From what you understood the natives had saved you from death, but still haven't explained why they had locked you up.  The girl drew another picture this time, it was kind of odd but eventually you were able to make it out. Apparently saving the life of another on the planet to the natives is the equivalent to.... </span></div></div>",

You weren't much for the exploration of a planet either. You just wanted to be some place that had none of the rules of earth. Many of which you felt that were a burden. That is the reason you chose this planet because this planet you felt that hear you could make the rules. Of course there were some rules that were understandable to you. Still you'd rather set your own, than follow others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   As for the other colonist that had traveled with you towards this planet they seemed to be...</span></div></div>",

Learning the name of the woman who was ordering was interesting enough for you to get up and do some basic stuff and set up the campsite. While it was true there were only three continents on this planet and they were relatively close to each other. It was also true that the continents themselves were only explored by drones so far and no one else has actually visit the planet in depth.

Three thousand years ago a plan had begun to allow people to inhabit other planets. This was mostly because Earth's population had become so overpopulated that even getting oxygen would become a problem. Fortunately the plan had succeeded and introduced the first Space Colonies, which significantly reduced the Earth's population. Unfortunately this would once again become a problem in the future, so the people of that time dedicated there lives towards finding other planet's people could live on. After all even though the space colonies had succeeded in reducing the population. The resources to build such Space Colonies would eventually dwindle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     It took humanity two thousand years for them to find suitable planet's to live on. After planets were found it took another thousand years for them to be available to travel to the new planets within a one years time.  Now with the technology to quickly travel to the planet as well as the technology to adjust to the gravity of each and various planet. Fifty people were chosen to be the first to inhabit. The people chosen were varied however there were five planet's for them to choose from each with a different and unique environment. It was quickly decided that there would be ten people on each planet.  Which will you choose?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><div align=\"center\"><u><b>Rules<br>\r\n</b></u></div></font>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   First off welcome to this version of another story called Colonist planet. I gave a bit of backstory on this one. Unlike the first Colonist Planet story this story will focus on  you and the other nine colonist with you as you try and survive.  The other change is that there are five other planets to choose from.  As well as reduced number of colonists this is so it makes it easier to make interactions between you and the other characters. So now let's get to the rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Colonists are allowed to die and so are you.<br>\r\n2. Ending story however is not allowed until all fifty colonist are dead.<br>\r\n3.  Try at least a paragraph for your additions.<br>\r\n4. Have as much fun as you can with this set up.<br>\r\n5.  Natives to the planet you chosen are allowed.<br>\r\n6. Natives however can not be based off any anime, comics, manga, or cartoon races. So no aliens from Ben 10, Star wars, Star trek, or any other show you know that has aliens. <br>\r\n7. Natives however can be mythological or covered in fur, with a animal like appearance.<br>\r\n8. No underage sexual interactions, and any type of activity of this sort, the person must have a good relationship with their partner.<br>\r\n Optional Rule: Just so you know if you decide to make your own character a witch or something similar to it, you are allowed to. However keep in mind this is an entirely different planet and there spells may not work out as they would think they would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     That's it for the rules, and remember this story is for fun, so try and have as much fun with this idea as you can. ((Since this interactive is new for a limited time, I will be offering 250gp's per every good addition. I want to make this more popular than my most popular interactive Mirror of Reality. Because of this, I will be notified on site each time someone make an addition to this interactive.))<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
