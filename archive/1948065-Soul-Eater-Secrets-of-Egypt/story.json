Death was so suspicious, he decided to modify the Powerpuff Girls. He added Growth X, Invisible X, and Shrinkage X, but not Antidote X. He added this to bath water and winked at the Professor. The Professor winked back. Kid hid. The Professor called to the girls, \"Bathtime!\". That was when the water turned blue, just so the girls don't get suspicious.</span></div></div>",
