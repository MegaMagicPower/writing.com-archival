You fucking dumped me!\u201d shouted Jennifer as rushed towards him and slapped his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHay, baby...I really didn't need that\u201d said Matthew as he smiled at her as he rubbed his sore bits. \u201cFuck you!\u201d screamed Jennifer as she stormed out of the mansion. \u201cOh well\u201d was all Matthew said as he walked his way back to the kitchen and took out a can of beer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was walking back into his living room, he heard the door opening. \u201cCome back for more?\u201d laughed Matthew as he put the can down and headed towards the front door.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d asked Matthew as he saw the person that was the front door. \u201cWell hello to you to, brother!\u201d said Hazel, Matthew's little sister. \u201cOh, I'm sorry, its just\u201d said Matthew as he walked towards and hugged her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHad another bad night with the ladies?\u201d asked Hazel as the two of them let go of each other. \u201cThat's it...\u201d said Matthew as he pointed at his sister like he was drunk. \u201cBest go to bed Matt\u201d said Hazel as she put her hands on her hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, okay. You know best sis\u201d said Matthew as he walked towards his bedroom. With that Hazel locked the front door and headed towards her room to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, there was a bump in the night which woke Matthew up. Making his way out of bed, trying to keep his head straight from the hangover, he made his way towards the location of the noise which was the living room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he made it there, to his surprise he saw a woman with long blond hair, wears glasses along with a business suit. The woman was sitting on a sofa with an open folder in hand. \u201cWha...who are you? What you doing in my house?\u201d asked Matthew as looked at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh Matthew, nice of you show up\u201d said the woman as she looked up from her folder. \u201cShow up...wha?\u201d was all Matthew could say. \u201cI take it that you didn't get the letter\u201d said the woman as she pointed to an unopened letter that was laying on a table in the living room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, if you have read the letter then you would have known that you are being sued\u201d said the woman as she looked at Matthew picking the letter up and read it. After reading, he looked at the woman and said, \u201cBeing sued for broken hearts?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman took her glasses off and said, \u201cNo Matthew, not broken hearts, hurt women\u201d \u201cWomen?\u201d was all Matthew could ask. \u201cYes, I just couldn't stand seeing how over the years you womanised every woman and then just dump them once you had your way with them\u201d answered the woman as she closed the folder and stood up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou suing me just for my womanising ways? On what ground is that allowed?\u201d asked Matthew. \u201cOn the ground that the gods walk\u201d answered the woman as she walked towards him. \u201cGods walk?What are you on about?\u201d asked Matthew as he just couldn't get his head around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see you have distrust in my statement, perhaps this will enlighten your judgement\u201d said the woman as she dropped the folder and glasses onto the floor. Matthew looked at her in horror as he noticed that the lights in the room was getting darker. <br>\r\nThe woman suddenly sprung out two long pure white wings, her whole body was being to glow the same pure white making it impossible to see her face. Matthew dropped onto his kneels as he looked at her speechless.       <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBelieve me now mortal?\u201d asked the woman as her voice echoed the sound of other woman at the time. \u201cYes...yes! Please don't hurt me!\u201d said Matthew as he had his hands together like he was praying. \u201cAs much as I wish, we gods are not allowed to harm humans but we are allowed to do mentally\u201d answered the woman as she placed her hand onto Matthew's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat we want isn't money but rather something else. The moment you wake and from that moment onwards for every woman that you hurt signs the contract of the suing, you will lose something that's imported to you\u201d was the last thing the woman said before Matthew passed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Matthew opened his eyes and found himself back in his bed. He looked over at his clock and saw that it reads that it was twelve o'clock. Next to  the clock he saw that there was a sticky note. He sat up and read it which reads, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Best enjoy the things you are going to lose. I be watching you, Naomi Bolton'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking nothing of it, Matthew got out of bed but he noticed that something is off. He looked down at the clothes he is wearing and saw that they were loose. Thinking about the note, Matthew rushed to the wall with a pencil in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe drew a marker on the wall and took a tape measure to see how tall he is. To his surprise, he stood 5'8 where he once stood at 5'11. \u201cThree inches...I lost three inches\u201d said Matthew as he still don't believe what he is seeing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Seeing the mark on the wall, Matthew tries to keep his mind away from it and feels that he should keep busy from the fact that he is three inches shorter. He got changed, made his way out of the mansion before anyone saw him with the fear that they would notice that he's smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew made his way inside his car and drove off towards the place where he would be working. Matthew makes a living as a photographer, he's very good at it that people would pay him huge sum of money. He mainly get hired for fashion magazines. In fact the place he was heading towards to was a building that belongs to a fashion magazine called 'Goddess'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew was able to get there in under an hour. He entered the building with his camera in hand and went to his boss' office whom was a woman that goes by the name of Melody Jones. She is one of three owners of 'Goddess', Matthew have never seen the other two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody was busy as her desk looking through paper work that involves with the new issue of the magazine. Matthew knocked on the open door of the office, this caused Melody to look up from her work and saw him. \u201cWhy hello Snappy\u201d she said as Matthew walked in and sat down one one of the many chairs in the office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnappy is a nickname that Melody seem to have given Matthew, he doesn't really understood as to why she calls him that but after a while he gotten use to it. \u201cWhat do you need me to do today?\u201d asked Matthew as he placed his camera on the desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody picked up his camera and answered, \u201cNot a lot today, just need you take some of your best work at some of the new brand of swim wear\u201d Matthew looked at her as if he knew that there was something else. \u201cOh very well, there's a new girl coming in for the shots of the swim wear\u201d she said as if she knew what he was thinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow was that really hard to say?\u201d laughed Matthew as he knew why she didn't tell him. \u201cKnowing you, you will most likely hurt that girl like you did with Jennifer last night\u201d said Melody as she handed him his camera. Just then, he didn't know why, his mind flew back to the night before. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d asked Melody as she noticed that Matthew was just spacing out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew shook his head and said, \u201cyes, yes...I'm fine\u201d answered Matthew as he smiled at as he left her office. With that Matthew headed off towards the photo shoot. As he entered the room, he saw three tall young women wearing the new brand of swim wear sitting down by a table with cups of tea. Matthew know two of the women but he doesn't know the third, must be the new girl he thought as he walked towards them.                   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked towards them as he got close, he saw that the three of them stood up and noticed to his horror was that he was shorter by an inch. \u201cHello boss\u201d said the red hair model that goes by the name of Paula. \u201cHello Paula, hi Gina\u201d said Matthew as he looked at Paula and then looked at an Asian model that goes by the name of Gina. Gina waved back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErm, hello...my name is Janet...nice to meet you\u201d said the third model with long blond hair as she took a bow. \u201cHi Janet, nice to meet you too\u201d said Matthew as he shook her hand. \u201cSo what is the plan today?\u201d asked Paula as she put her hands on her hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew noticed that she and Gina were looking at him differently as if there was something wrong. \u201cIs something the matter?\u201d asked Matthew. \u201cWell\u201d said Paula as she walked up real close to him, \u201cNever noticed that I was this tall wearing these heels\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh...are they brand new?\u201d asked Matthew as he already knew the answer. \u201cNo\u201d answered Paula bluntly. Matthew felt a little red as he tries to change the subject, \u201cOkay ladies...lets begin\u201d</span></div></div>",

After a few shots, Matthew stopped and said, \u201cHay new girl, can you strike me a pose\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErm...okay\u201d said Janet as she rested onto her left leg while she put her hands onto her hips. \u201cGood, good, now pretend that you are a tiger\u201d said Matthew after he took a few shots. \u201cWhat?\u201d asked Janet as she was confused. \u201cJust stick your hands out like claws with your mouth open as if you are about to roar\u201d answered Matthew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet did all that which gave Matthew grate shots. \u201cGrate ladies, why don't you all take a break while I get a new film\u201d said Matthew as he saw that he was out of film. With that the three ladies went off to their break while Matthew went off towards the storage room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was heading there, he heard a familiar voice behind him. He looked back and saw a woman with long blond hair, dressed in a business suit and wears glasses. \u201cYo...you\u201d said Matthew as he stopped and looked at her. \u201cYou? You...is that all you can say to me? At least you can say my name\u201d said the woman as she walked right up close to Matthew and saw that they were almost the same height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaomi...your name is Naomi Bolton\u201d said Matthew as he took a step back. \u201cGranted that its not my real name of course but its very hard to say my real name in human tong\u201d said Naomi as she smiled at him as she walked real close. \u201cI see that its working nicely\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this what you ment? For every woman I shall lose three inches?\u201d asked Matthew. \u201cPretty much, oh by the way\u201d said Naomi as a piece of paper appered in left hand in a puff of pink smoke and hung in front of his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew looked at the paper and saw that it was written in a language that he couldn't read but saw two names written in English. Matthew doesn't know the first name but remembers the second as it was Jennifer, the girl from last night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts the contract you silly mortal\u201d said Naomi as she flicked Matthew's forehead. \u201cWhy...why are you showing me this?\u201d asked Matthew as Naomi made the contract disappeared  in the same colour of smoke. \u201cJust showing you that you are due to lose another in a few minutes, well I took enough of your time, see you later\u201d said Naomi as she walked past him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew looked at where Naomi was and saw that she vanished, no sign of her anywhere. \u201cDue to lose another...oh god no\u201d said Matthew as he knew what was to come. He began to run towards the storage room and began to search for a new set of film. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw some on the top shelf and began to reach for it when he felt something. He didn't know why but he felt as if he was in an earthquake. He fell onto ground and covered his face as if he really was in an earthquake. When the feeling went away, Matthew moved his hands away and saw that everything was still the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up and saw that everything was different, everything was higher up then he remembered just a moment ago. \u201cNo...no....no!\u201d shouted Matthew as he knew what just happened. He looked up and saw that the top shelf was out of his reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Matthew could find something to climb on to reach the top shelf, there was a knock on the door. \u201cErm, is everything alright in there?\u201d asked a voice behind the door. Matthew froze as he didn't want whomever it was on the other side to see him smaller. \u201cI'm...I'm fine\u201d Matthew spoke out. \u201cOh that's alright, me and the others are ready for the next shoots\u201d spoke the voice again which Matthew can now tell was Janet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay...I be there in a minute\u201d spoke Matthew as just waited. He heard the sound of footsteps walking away. \u201cWhat am I going to do\u201d said Matthew to himself as he shook his head as he found a box tall enough for him to climb on to reach the top self. </span></div></div>",

Matthew looked at the person and saw that it was Naomi. Beginning to panic, Matthew saw that she was heading towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry but can ask someone else\" said Matthew as he was still looking at Naomi. \"What?\" was all teh woman said as she saw Matthew dashed out of the building. She saw Naomi walking pass her. \"What a strange dressed man\" said the woman as she shook her head and asked someone else into finding Rinslet's Office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew was running like made, holding his trousers up to keep them from falling all the way to his car. He took his keys out, looked back and saw that Naomi was slowly walking towards. This scared him as he unlocked his car, got in and drove away. People looked at him wondering what was going on. Matthew looked out the window and saw that Naomi was just standing in the car park looking at him with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at the road when he heard a woman say next to him, \"Oh please, do you really think you can runway from a goddess?\" Matthew looked at him and screamed a little when he saw that it was Naomi. \"How did you get here\" screamed Matthew as he looked back at the road. \"Oh please little man, do I need to remind you that I'm a goddess? I can do anything that humans cannot\" laughed Naomi as she rubbed Matthew's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you want? You going to show me that contract again showing another woman signed it huh!\" snapped Matthew still looking at the road. Just then he felt Naomi slapped the back of head and said, \"Don't and I mean don't you ever talk to me like that again. I can make each size loss faster if you that\" \"Sorry, sorry\" said Matthew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what are you doing here?\" asked Matthew softly. Matthew noticed that she didn't answer, he looked at where she was meant to be and saw nothing but an empty seat. Matthew pulled over when it was safe to do so, kept his hands on the wheel and just sat there not knowing what to do. His mobile ran and he just let it ring. Thinking long and hard, Matthew started the car and drove back onto the road and headed towards,     </span></div></div>",
