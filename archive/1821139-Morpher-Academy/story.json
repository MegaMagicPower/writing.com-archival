            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dylan was a fourth year, senior level mage at Morpher Academy. His true, or prime, appearance was that of a lean young man with brown hair, light freckles on his cheeks, and amber eyes. He showed himself to be a capable students, having excelled in his studies the last three years. However, he had specific skills in the discipline of merging. Selecting what he wanted to specialize in was a simple choice. Before the beginning of the semester, Dylan had selected all of his classes, creating his perfect schedule. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral of his classes he shared with his best friend, Tristan, a pimply kid with blonde hair. He was built a bit stocker. Dylan had known Tristan for several years before they started at Morpher Academy as freshman. Tristan had chosen body modification as his focus. Their two disciplines complemented each other's well, and as such, often worked together on their class assignments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, they were finishing the school day in their morphing philosophy class. One of the most boring classes academy, but a requirement for graduation. However, today's discussion and lecture had been about a particularly interesting subject of individualism and dualism. The professor, Mrs. Stratton, was speaking about the theory of how individuals who merge, either partially or fully, begin to develop a dualistic type nature if they remain a such for long periods of time. She showed images and examples of conjoined twins and ettins, individuals who had been born physically joined to another person at birth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the entirety of the lecture, Dylan's interest was captured. As he specialized in merging, this philosophical theory engaging. He listened to every word and took scrupulous notes, the only time he had in that class. The bell rang, signaling the end of the school week. \"We have to try this dude.\" Dylan said to his friend as he began packing his supplies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what?\" Tristan shook himself awake, having napped through the lecture. He wiped the drool from his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The di... di... dicephalus ones.\" Dylan replied, finally remembering what type of conjoined twinning he was thinking of from the lecture. \"That would be so cool to try out. I can't believe I hadn't thought of that before.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Tristan repeated as he followed his friend's example and packed his text book away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's hurry and get to the dorm room so we can practice. I'll even let you do the alterations to our body.\" Dylan slung his backpack over one shoulder and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Our body?\" Tristan followed in his wake, hurrying to keep up with his excited friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dorm rooms were split up between boys and girls, but they were also divided by year. Each year had a separate, almost endlessly long hall with multiple room. Each room was small and had two beds. Dylan and Tristan were of course in the fourth year hall and shared one of the rooms. Inside, the two young men were seat on Tristan's bed, arms wrapped around each other. Several hastily drawn images of two-headed versions of them were scattered about the room. It always helped to have a clearer version of the morph you were attempting. For Dylan, sketching had been the best way to accomplish this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I let you talk me into this.\" Tristan grumbled. He used his free, left hand to scratch an itch on his nose. \"This has to be one of your stupidest ideas yet, and thats saying something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm trying to concentrate.\" Dylan said with his eyes still closed. He took a moment to peek at his friend. \"Besides on the scale of stupid ideas, your last one was a 10. So embarrassing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTristan's face turned bright red as he remembered the incident with growing muscles where they should not have been grown. \"Whatever, just hurry up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan nodded absently, and focused on the images he'd drawn. This would prove to be one of his most complex fusions he had undertaken. Per his friend's request, he would have to physically join them together but keep forms from blending at the same time, as Tristan did not want to look like twins. This meant that Dylan would have to focus on keeping their appearances from mixing, which naturally happened with fusions. He would also have to safely merge several of their organs, which was not as difficult as it sounded, but still a challenge. Thankfully, he would not have to worry about their clothes. The issues school robes were enchanted to transform as the student's bodies transformed. Dylan took a deep breathe to stead himself, before tapping into his power to start the morph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, their shoulders and sides were pressed tightly together. The arms each had wrapped around the other melted through their school robes and into each other's shoulders. The sides of their bodies no longer pressed together as they had began to blend, closing the space between their necks. Dylan's left leg and Tristan's right leg quickly combined into a single awkward looking appendage. Though, it soon vanished, being absorbed by the boys' joining bodies. Only two feet, one of each of yours, were resting on the bedroom floor now. Next, Dylan focused on shifting their organs in their and combined them with their counterparts. Blood vessels and muscles weaved together. Finally, the transformation ended with their two heads being supported by a single set of shoulders. The robes that each of them had been wearing also combined and adjusted to accommodate their new form. </span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Welcome to Morpher Academy, a private school for the young and created!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEstablished in 1484, this school does something a little different.  For you see, instead of teaching students math, English, history, science, social studies, and the like, this school teaches students in morphing their bodies into anyone and anything.  There are separate classes that has different types of transformations including\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorphing into Animals<br>\r\nMorphing into Inanimate Objects<br>\r\nMorphing into Other People<br>\r\nBody Modifications (Expansions, Alteration, and Size)<br>\r\nMelting<br>\r\nMerging<br>\r\nDetaching (or Separating)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a freshman, all these transformation will start basic.  But once they advance each year, they will learn the combination of two or more types of changes.  They could even merge with more then one person in class when they advance in the semester.  All students will be separated in their dorms based on gender.  They can only be together in classes, cafeteria, and daily clubs and activities.  The students need to follow a few rules of the campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRule 1: No sex is allowed in the campus.<br>\r\nRule 2: No nudity in public.  You can use your clothes to morph, melt, and merge with you.<br>\r\nRule 3: Never use any technique that you will be stuck on and never return to your self.  This will be problematic if you merge with another person and cannot unmerge.  If you cannot change back, head to the principles office and she will repair the damage.<br>\r\nRule 4: Never merge with the other person with the opposite sex.  The end result will be a combination of the she male and that would be disturbing.  Try merging with the same sex.  Just don\u2019t think of it as anything gay or lesbian like, it\u2019s just how it works.<br>\r\nRule 5: Never ever morph, melt, modify, merge, or detach your body outside the school.  The world doesn\u2019t know of the school or what it does.  If any of the students change in a public area, there would be a panic.  Any student doing that in front of public will be expelled from the academy and will be stuck in the change forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen students go through with seven years in schoolwork, they will be graduated as a professional shifter.  From there, they would change in their own home and come out of public in that form.  Just remember to not change in public.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there you have it.  The introduction to the school.  You will get your books and class schedule once you enter the school.  Thank you for reading our introductory paper.  Have a nice day.</td>",
