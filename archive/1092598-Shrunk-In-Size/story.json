The salad cream is covering you and it is sticky so you can't see much but your determined to avoid becoming Lauren's lunch. <br>\r\nLauren, meanwhile took a huge bite of the sandwich and a big chunk of it collapsed from under you!<br>\r\nYou can only scramble to keep your grip on the crumbling block of the sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lose your grip for a minute and dangle from one arm while the blond's mouth chews it's whopping mouthful nearby. Her big, dimpled cheeks stretching and bulging out while the fillings mixed with salad cream spurts out her lips and her jaw moves up and down and the lettuce within is shredded into pieces with a series of horrible bone-crunching sounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swing around and claw furiously at the sandwich to get up, and you try not to look at the crumbs and gooey drops raining down below you and littering the hard table and plate below. If you fall you'll land splat on the grey worktop below, or you might fall among Lauren's breasts jiggling under her shirt below you and you would surely be crushed to death. Either way, you can't afford to let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yell out in pain and, after a monumental effort, you climb back up and dive back under the hot muggy bread and try to dig yourself away from the massive chewing mouth threatening to grind you up. You squirming body wriggles it's way deeper and deeper inside, but before you know it Lauren has licked her plump greasy lips and is eager for another big bite. She opens her mouth real wide and inhales real loudly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything goes dark as the Lauren's chubby cheeks and mouth wrap around you again. Two rows of sparkling-white teeth with bits of bread and lettuce stuck between them suddenly clamp down from above and below you, and the sandwich begins to grow tighter. You feel a rush of hot breath and trickling saliva as Lauren's lapping red tongue presses against the sandwich and the teeth effortlessly tear through each layer with a sticky ripping sound. You feel like you're about to be sucked into a giant whale's maw at sea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure increases. Oozing bits of salad cream are squirted out from the sandwich and drip down the side of Lauren's lips where they drop. Her sharp teeth are almost upon you when you feel yourself being carried away by the goo all around you and are suddenly slide out... </span></div></div>",

Her perfect teeth are anchored in her pink healthy gums and her pink tongue is rolling around awaiting your arrival.<br>\r\nHer mouth is so inviting but you know that once you are inside it then you will certainly be heading for her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you hear Lauren giggling evilly. Stuck in the grip of her huge fingers, you wonder how long she will dangle you over her mouth before dropping you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed an age, you feel Lauren's grip loosen and her fingers release on your legs, you take one last look at her beautiful face and blonde hair and begin to plummet down into the cavernous maw and watch her smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou land on her pink salivating tongue and notice the excess amount of saliva in her mouth.<br>\r\nAll light is immediately distinguished as her mouth closes and your being swished from side to side like a jawbreaker all around her mouth from being slammed against the back of her teeth to being pleasantly squished against the inside of her cheek. theres nothing you can really do except try to minimize the damage of Lauren's unintentional abuse in her mouth and hope that she would spit you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren is now rubbing your body against the roof of her mouth and although your slightly enjoying this relaxing situation you know what will eventually become of you if you dont get out of here soon and theres no way you want to find out whats down at the bottom of that long dark tunnel at the back of Lauren's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can hear Lauren giggling again and then light floods into her mouth and she spits you into her hand.<br>\r\nCovered in her saliva, now in her palm you look up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you are tasty aren't you. You feel great inside my mouth. Part of me wants to send you to my tummy, but another side of me wants to play with you as your a little sweetie.\" she said running her index finger down your little body.<br>\r\n\"I'd better clean you up, all that saliva must be hurting you.\" Lauren said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took you into the bathroom and put the plug in. \"Don't want to loose you down the sink do we.\" she laughed<br>\r\nturning on the taps and filling the sink with water.<br>\r\nShe dropped you into the sink and washed her saliva off your body, then got a towel and dried you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren took you into her bedroom, she lay down belly down on her bed and put you on her sheets. You looked around her room. The walls were blue and there was several cabinets with trophies in from the events Lauren had won with her horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Jaime, explore me!\" she said<br>\r\nYou nervously walked over to her side and grabbed onto her shirt. You hoisted yourself up<br>\r\nLauren turned over onto her back and you were thrown onto her stomach<br>\r\n\"Well, come on, climb the rest of me until you get to my neck.\" Lauren said <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing that stood between you and her neck right now was her boobs, having been among them when you fell out of her sandwich they look just as huge. You walked over her stomach which was growling as you moved over to her breasts and looked them over, pretty horny. You grabbed onto the bottom of one and climbed up it. \"Oooh, that feels good\" she said. You climbed all the way to the top and stepped your shoes harder than normal to get the feel of her boob through her shirt and bra. You slid down her boob and then began to scale up to her neck. When you were about half way up a ripple hit you and you nearly lost your balance. She had swallowed and a bulge had gone down her neck. <br>\r\nShe smiled and picked you up, putting you in front of her face. <br>\r\n\"What are you going to do with me now?\" you ask nervously<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.\" Lauren said \"Your too paranoid about me.\" she said<br>\r\n\"But you put me in a sandwich and were going to eat me, why shouldn't I be paranoid?\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets take a bath, You probably need a proper wash after being in my sandwich.\" She giggled and picked you up. She carried you to the bathroom and opened her palm. You were kissing her hand and she smiled. \"Aww, you are so cute\" she said putting you down on the shelf. She started the water. \"I'm gonna go get changed into my bathing suit\" she said. You were mad that she wouldn't go in without any clothes. <br>\r\nLauren returned a few minutes later and  walked back in the bathroom with a blue bikini on. The bath was nearly full so she stopped it and then picked you up. She stepped into the tub and slowly sat down. Eventually laying down with her head, boobs and part of her stomach out of the water. She let you down on her stomach again and stared at you with a kind face. \"You look scared, she said, I won't ever hurt you. <br>\r\n\"Lets play a game\" she said. \"Hmm, what should we play?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She took you out and put you on her desk and then opened a see through box. \"This will be your home for a while until this evening when I come back from a friends house.\" Charlotte said smiling evilly showing her small brace latticed teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No! Let me go you monster!' you say trying to summon up enough strength to resist being imprisoned in the box but it was to no avail. Charlotte closed the box sealing you in.

Tiffany was on Star and Lauren was on Monty. <br>\r\nThe two girls rode off down the fields towards the woods. They chatted as they rode and spent over 5 hours on the horses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually your remains were digested by Lauren\u2019s stomach acids and were absorbed into her bloodstream.<br>\r\nLauren thought to herself as she rode<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve never enjoyed a sandwich as the one I had for lunch today.\u201d She said licking her lips<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Lauren got back from riding she put Monty &amp; Star back in their stables and mucked them out, changed their bedding and gave them some fresh food. She then headed back to the house.<br>\r\nAs she entered the back door her mother was in the kitchen.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that little boy you had for lunch love?\u201d she asked<br>\r\n\u201cHe was delicious, very tasty, he went down beautifully!\u201d Lauren replied <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you liked him.\u201d Said her mother<br>\r\n\u201cWould you like me to bring some others home with me, bear in mind I can\u2019t do it to often as someone might start asking questions as to where there sons or daughters are. It wouldn\u2019t look good if they asked and I said Oh sorry my daughter ate them alive.\u201d She laughed<br>\r\n\u201cQuite. Yes that would be good. Probably just stick to bringing boys home. I don\u2019t know whether I would want to eat a girl!\u201d Lauren said<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll see what I can get. Probably leave it about 6 months and then I\u2019ll try and get another one for you. <br>\r\n\u201cThanks Mum.\u201d Lauren said as she went upstairs to her room and changed out of her riding gear and into casual clothes. She put on a blue top and her jeans and went back downstairs and into the kitchen<br>\r\nShe gave her mother a hand to make tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Lauren was ready to go to bed she had a shower and got into her nightdress. She snuggled down in bed and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood night dear?\u201d her mother said as she passed Lauren\u2019s room.<br>\r\n\u201cNight Mum!\u201d Lauren replied<br>\r\n\u201cThat was a great day, maybe I\u2019ll have some more boys for lunch sometime, if they are as delicious as Jaime was.\u201d She said to herself<br>\r\nLauren closed her eyes and fell asleep dreaming of her next little snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHE END<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was a text message waiting to be read. She pressed the button to read her message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Loz, you alright if me Marion &amp; Eloise come over this evening, we'd like some help on that work that Mr. Sanderson gave us to do.

By the way what are we having for tea this evening?\" Lauren asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was planning on doing chicken salad and some veg. I'll do plenty of salad for your friends. Does that sound OK?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that sounds great. We will see who you end up inside little man. By the way what's your name?\" Lauren asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jaime.\" you reply<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Jaime, you might be seeing this from the inside when we eat tea later.\" Lauren giggled as she displayed her belly to you and it gurgled once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you later Mum, I am off to see Josh.\" Lauren said as she went out of the kitchen<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK dear I'll prepare dinner and it will be ready when you get back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at Lauren's mother and begin to plead for mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't let your daughter or her friends eat me, she is so pretty and beutiful that I would rather be her boyfriend than end up inside her.\" you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Jaime but she insists you go into the bowl of salad for her and her friends to share this evening. If I could help you I would but I don't want to upset Lauren.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seems to think on this for a little bit and chuckles to herself. Then she gently picks you up and carries you over to the sink and drops you just above it .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eeeek, as you slide along the cold porcelain. You come to a halt near the garbage disposal. You shiver as you think of what might have happened if you hadn't been able to stop. <br>\r\nOverhead, you can hear Lauren's mom giggle evilly, \"careful there.... wouldn't want to get to the sewers before you're all nicely digested inside Lauren or her friends stomachs, would you?\"<br>\r\nShe smirks, as she clangs a pot down overhead, and starts to fill it. It seems to take forever, as torrents of water cascade from the faucet. Then, she finally shuts it off and peels some potatoes. She smirks at you, as she puts them in the pan, and sets it on the stove. She ignores you completely as she cooks up food for her daughter's meals.<br>\r\nAs she is doing that, you start to desperately, but carefully, try to get out of this cold sink. You keep trying to scale the sides, but find that they are far too slippery to be able to get up. After a while, you simply get up, and sigh as you lean into one of the corners of the sink, relaxing, and waiting for her to finish cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren's mother puts the salad she has just chopped into a large bowl. She puts in tomatoes, cucumber, lettuce, grated cheese and then mixes in some salad cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another bowl she puts the chopped vegetables: carrots, potatoes, peas and some sweetcorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you see Lauren's mother above the drainer. She is holding the pan which is full of potatoes.<br>\r\nThen a torrent of scolding hot water cascades down into the drainer. All you can do is try and avoid it as you watch the torrent go right through the drainer and splash around in the sink.<br>\r\nIn pain as some of the water splashed over your head, you look up and see Lauren's mother smirking at you.<br>\r\n \"Oh sorry , I almost got you there didn't I? Well, don't worry sweety, it's not that hot anymore...\" She laughs. With that she reaches down into the drainer and picks you up between her fingers.<br>\r\nShe rests you on the worktop and then smiles at you.<br>\r\n\"I think my daughter is quite cruel to think of doing this to you but as this isn't the first time she has done this to someone then I do approve.\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean she has done this before.\" you say shocked \"How many times?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think she has eaten 5 other people, and Natalie (her sister) has eaten 3.\" she says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does Lauren eat them with?\" you ask thinking about what her mother had said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's eaten them with her tea, I've put them in sandwiches for her or she has made them, she's had them in a bowl of dip at her birthday.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Natalie, how does she eat hers?\" you ask shuddering with fear<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Natalie is quite gentle, she would rather not chew her victims, so she has swallowed them whole with liquid. She did eat 1 person for her birthday. I made her a cake and he was the clown on the cake. She quite enjoyed him actually. Anyway its time for you to go into the salad so that your all ready for my daughter and her friends when they return.\" she said smiling at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dangles you above the bowl of salad and grins. <br>\r\nYou look down and see the full bowl of salad below you and you are now very scared.<br>\r\n\"Happy landings!\" Lauren's mother said as she realeased her grip on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaime fell through the air and landed with a gentle thud among the bowl of salad. He knew there was no way out of the bowl, the sides were too steep. He would just have tosit and wait until Lauren and her friends arrived and hope that he wouldn't get eaten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this is it, I'm destined to become food fo one of 4 girls and I can't do anything about it!\" Jaime said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just sat there and waited<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 hours later<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She lowered her hand and gently picked you up.<br>\r\n'Well it seems that you didn't have the chance to be eaten by me or my friends with our tea. So I will give you a choice. Either I shall eat you now wrapped in a lettuce leaf and covered with salad cream and tomato or take you upstairs with me, introduce you to my friends and see what they want to do with you.' Lauren said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Do they eat people aswell?' you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No they don't but I no that both Eloise and Marion are not one to turn down food and Chantelle &amp; Sophie will eat anything. So its worth a chance to see isn't it.<br>\r\nAnyway from what you saw of my friends if I gave you a choice to pick one which would you want to be eaten by?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'They all looked beautiful, which was Chantelle?' Jaime asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The dark skinned one.' Lauren replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I thought she looked nice and she had a nice smile aswell, Marion looked lovely and she had a lovely smile, Sophie was a cute baby faced girl and Eloise was really cute and had a lovely figure but if I had to choose from the four I think it might be'''.Marion.' you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What about me?'

I don't know whether what has happened to me is reversible but I'm sure we can try.\" you reply<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right lets start then. Marion said as she carefully picked you up and put you down on the desk beside Lauren's bed.<br>\r\nThe three girls sat on the bed. You were quite nervous with three huge girls very close to you, but as Marion had assured you she wouldn't hurt you then you did feel a bit calmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the assingment on?\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Development Study on Medicine through Time\" Lauren replied. We've got some good stuff, references and things down but we are struggling with how to pull things together.\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren puts the piece of paper with the assignment breif on the desk and you walk over it and read it. At your size it takes you a long time to read it but with you being quite good at assignments you have a few ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelaying your ideas to the girls who scribble them down eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 1 hour of ideas being thrown about the girls begin to add to their assignments and by 8pm (2 hours after they had finished tea) they had got a good amount of material down on paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jaime you have been a great help tonight. We've got on really well.\" Eloise said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jaime. I want to apologise for my tone at you earlier. I thought that flipping the coin the girls were going to be silly with you, but you really are a top lad and I hope what you have helped us with tonight ensures we get some good marks in this assignment.\" Chantelle said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I suppose we better head home. We're back at school tomorrow and its Maths first thing.\" Eloise said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah having to sit through an hour with Mr. Lint at the start of the day.\" Lauren said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about I come to school with you and help you during your lessons. I can skip between you all if you sit close together and shout the answers, providing I know them to you. No one would ever suspect me at the size I am.\" you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've suddenly got very brave.\" Lauren said \"Do you think you will be safe at school at your size, you could easily get lost or worse killed by someones foot and squashed.\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should be OK, as long as I stay with you or your freinds. Just don't let me out of your sight.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK then. We'll do that.\" Lauren said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right Lauren, see you in the morning.\" Eloise said as she gathered up her assignment and bag.

Chantelle, Eloise &amp; Marion went out the front door.<br>\r\n\"Bye Mrs. Thompson, thanks again for the tea.\" Eloise shouted.<br>\r\n\"No problem girls. see you again.\" Mrs. Thompson replied from the living room.<br>\r\n\"Bye Loz.\" Marion said<br>\r\n\"Yep see ya.\" Lauren replied as she closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren went and sat in the living room with her mother for a while.<br>\r\n\"Did you get a load done on your assignment?\" her mother asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes plenty. We've got a good assignment that will hopefully warrant a very good grade.\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do with Jaime, did he end up in your tummy?\" she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No he helped us with our assignment. He is a very bright kid and has loads of knowledge. Aren't you Jaime?\" Lauren said to your on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Lauren!\" you reply<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren's sister Charlotte came into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mum where's Roddy's coat. I can't find it in the stable.\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's folded up in the out house on the shelf.\" her mother said \"Are you off riding?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Natalie's helping us do some jumps.\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful then.\" her mother said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do, cheers.\" Charlotte replied skipping out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren's mother waited until the back door had closed. \"You'll have to be careful Charlotte doesn't find Jaime. She would kill him straight away for sure. She was in the kitchen earlier while you four were upstairs and I was baking. She had brought back a full jar of little people. She put them on the counter and got out a bowl. She tipped them into it and then got two hotdog buns, three tomatoes and some cheese slices. She sliced the tomatoes and grated the cheese then put 4 people in the bun and ate it in seconds. She then made two peanut butter and lettuce sandwiches and put the rest of the people in it and wrapped it in foil. No doubt she is going to eat them later when she is out riding with your sister.\" Lauren's mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your right mother. No little person is safe from Charlotte. She will eat anything and anyone she can catch.\" Lauren said \"It's just a good job that she isn't allowed to eat any of us, because I am sure she would.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lauren, I'm tired. Can I sleep in your room with you tonight.?\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure Jaime. I'll find somewhere comfy and safe for you.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mum, I'm going for a shower and I'll sit in bed and read for a while.\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK dear.\" her mother replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on then Jaime, let's take you upstairs.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nOnce in Lauren's room, she shut the door and stood by her bed.<br>\r\n\"Now Jaime, are you going to be a good little boy and look away while I undress and put my dressing gown on before I go for a shower.\" she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly Lauren.\" you reply<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boy. You must have been brought up well.\" she said running her finger down your back gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around as Lauren strips off her clothes, part of you is quite excited that you are in a room where a beautiful young girl is changing. You realise you have to have a peek and open one eye and turn around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren is in her underwear and looks even more beautiful. She then strips right down to bear flesh and grabs her dressing gown putting it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns to see you on the shelf.<br>\r\n\"I hope you weren't looking Jaime.\" she said sternly.<br>\r\n\"Of course not.\" you lied<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren goes out of her room and into the bathroom to have a shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n20 minutes later she returns and sits down on her bed to dry her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's better. I feel much fresher now. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren then went over to a cupbaord and took out a small box. She put it on the bed. Removing the lid, you could see the box had little people in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing with those Lauren?\" you ask guessing what she might do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always have a little snack before going to bed. I sleep better with something in my tummy.\" she said. With that she took a handful of people out of the box and held them in her hand. She then tossed one of them into the air and caught them in her mouth and swallowed them whole. She did the same with the others and licked her lips.<br>\r\n\"Sorry I have to eat people infront of you Jaime, but its a fetish I have and I crave them and it doesn't matter what I do to try and stop myself I have to eat them.\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's OK, as long as you don't eat me when your mother tried to feed me to you or Natalie earlier. You said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jaime, I'm sure my mother was joking. Besides you have helped me a lot tonight and to send you to my tummy would be cruel. I've loads of people to do that to in my treat boxes and in the cupboard downstairs.\" Lauren said<br>\r\nas she climber into bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long Lauren was happily reading a book in bed. You had snuggled down on the shelf against a soft toy which made a nice bed.<br>\r\nLauren looked at her clock and put down her book. She yawned and her stomach gurgled digesting the people she had swallowed earlier. She turned over and put her head on the pillow and shortly fell fast asleep. </span></div></div>",

There is something I want you to do. My parents are away this week doing a lecture down in Birmingham so myself, Lauren &amp; Charlotte have the house to ourselves. Now remember I said Charlotte will eat anything if she wants well, me and Lauren are the same. We are going to return you to normal size and you are then to go and shrink and capture a load of people and bring them back here for us. We are going to have a little party this week. Lauren is inviting 3 of her friends, I am inviting 5 of mine and Charlotte will probably bring some along. Now let me tell you if you refuse to comply with what I have just asked you to do then you will go back inside a sandwich and this time I won't release you. Understand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking that it would not be a good idea to try and reason with Natalie, you decide to agree with her request.<br>\r\n\"OK Natalie, I will comply.\" you reply worringly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good I am glad you agreed.\" Natalie said as she picked up a small item from the worktop that looked like a tv remote with a big can on the back.<br>\r\n\"Now I am going to put you on the floor and return you to size.\" she said lifting you up from the worktop and placing you gently on the kitchen floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bolt of blue light then hit you and within seconds you were your normal size again.<br>\r\n\"That's much better, I was frightened at that size. It's nice to see you at your normal size instead of being a giantess to me.\" you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway Jaime, there's no time to chat. You have your task, here's a rucksack with 15 boxes in, go out and shrink as many people as you can, capture them and put them in the boxes. It doesn't matter what age they are but if possibly try and get a variety. Then once all the boxes are full, by that I mean you should have collected about 200 then return here and I will give you your next instruction. Plus you can meet my friends, Lauren's and Charlotte plus her friends.\" Natalie said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not too long after the doorbell rang, \"Could you get that?\" Natalie asked.

You can only stare in horror as the girls go through the kitchen like a buffet line and prepare the shrunken people in any food item available. You saw some girls eat shrunken people sandwiches, while others ate shrunken people hamburgers, shrunken people hot dogs, shrunken people on pizza, in tacos, in sub sandwiches, and more.

Surrounding you are huge feet of the 15 females that are busy devouring the people you caught for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spot the winerack and decide that that is a good ladder in order to climb to higher ground. It will be safer than the floor.<br>\r\nYou quickly dart across the kitchen floor avoiding the huge feet and reach the winerack. As you begin climbing it you realise that it maybe was higher than you thought.<br>\r\nAfter 15 minutes you eventually reach the worktop and haul yourself up. You are stood by the microwave. To your left is the cooker and to your right the bread bin.<br>\r\nYou can see several food items at the end of the worktop and across the other side are the boxes which the shrunken people you caught are in.<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t think there are many left though the way those girls are devouring them.\u201d You say to yourself as you see Lauren grab a handful of people, put them on a slice of pizza and gobble them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump as you see Charlotte stood a short distance away. You see her take out a large bun from the bread bin and put it down on the worktop. She lays 3 slices of tomato on it and then a slice of cheese and then turns around. She grabs a handful of shrunken people and grins at them. She then lays each one down on their back on top of the slice of cheese.<br>\r\n\u201cThose people must be terrified right now.\u201d You say as you watch Charlotte pick up a bottle of salad cream and squirt some on the bun. She then picks it up and lifts it to her mouth.<br>\r\nIn horror you turn away as Charlotte takes a large bite and there is a faint scream. You close your eyes and think of those little people who are now being chewed to pieces inside Charlotte\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls were also licking their lips.<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think we should have a break for a moment?\u201d said a blond girl<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i58.tinypic.com/av5vdw.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i58.tinypic.com/av5vdw.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I think that is a good idea, let the first wave get digested and we can resume later, besides my tummy is getting quite full.\u201d The redhead said as she held a terrified little boy in her hand and then raised him to her mouth and opened it, dropped him in and swallowed him whole.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i59.tinypic.com/13ygvop.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i59.tinypic.com/13ygvop.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow many have we eaten so far, and how many are there left?\u201d Lauren asked<br>\r\n\u201cWell Jaime captured about 200, and looking at the boxes there are still 5 of the 15 boxes he went out with full. So I reckon there\u2019s still about 70 or so left to eat.\u201d Natalie replied<br>\r\n\u201cOK, we\u2019ll go and let our stomachs digest the ones we have eaten so far and we\u2019ll finish the rest later.

You walk across the worktop and attract her attention.<br>\r\n\u201cGood little boy, you certainly know that I am in charge over you. Now I suppose I better introduce you to everybody. Myself, Charlotte and Lauren you already know, but the others you don\u2019t. My friends will introduce themselves first, then Lauren\u2019s and then Charlotte\u2019s. OK.

On Sunday we are all going out for the day to a riding school and having a day out. The people you caught for us will be split into three boxes breakfast, lunch and evening snack. On the morning us girls will be eating the ones in the breakfast box with our cereal, toast etc.<br>\r\nThen once we have had breakfast we shall be making sandwiches and the ones in the lunch boxes will be put in the sandwiches for us to eat when we are out riding.

I know that several of the girls would like to eat you. Kirsty, Jodie and Rachel all think you are so cute they could just eat you up alive. Megan, Gemma &amp; Ashleigh  but I don't know yet. It will depend on whether we are going to need you again to capture more people for us to eat. If we need then we won't be eating you, but you'll have to wait and see.<br>\r\nAnyway we do need you to capture a few more people before we go out riding as we only have 70 people left and we will need another 20 to make an even split for three meals worth. So tomorrow you are going to go out and capture another 20 people for us. OK.\" she said sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following day Natalie gives you the stuff again and you go out and capture another 20 people for her.

They were all beautiful and all had lovely white smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the shrunken people obeyed Natalie and then watched as the girls all came towards them. Some tried to run but they were easily caught by the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of the girls went to prepare their breakfasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirsty had picked a boy and a girl and brought them up to her face and smiled at them. <br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img389.imageshack.us/my.php?image=friendsmile3io0.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://img389.imageshack.us/my.php?image...</a><br>\r\nThe two shrunken people nearly died with fear as they saw her huge white teeth complete with silver braces between her lucious pink lips.<br>\r\nKirsty giggled<br>\r\n\"Enjoy that view, well you look so tasty I can't wait to eat you for breakfast.\" she said licking her lips hungrily<br>\r\nKirsty then got two slices of bread and put them in the toaster on a light setting. She then grinned at her two shrunken victims and got two slices of cheese. She lay them down on the worktop and then lay one shrunken person on each slice. She folded the slice over them and then waited for her bread to toast. Suddenly it popped up and she put the two slices on a plate. Kirsty buttered them and then picked up the slice of cheese the girl was wrapped in and lay it on the slice of toast. <br>\r\n\"Your girlfriend looks so tasty, if she is your girlfriend.\" Kirsty said as she raised the slice of toast to her lips and opened her mouth slightly.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img147.imageshack.us/my.php?image=friendsmile2ad6.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://img147.imageshack.us/my.php?image...</a><br>\r\nThe terrified little girl wrapped in cheese was screaming in terror as she saw Kirsty's huge mouth millimetres infront of her. It slowly opened wider and then the little girl felt the slice of toast move closer. Kirsty's huge teeth were now above the girl and suddenly they came down and sliced right through the toast just infront of her feet. Kirsty's teeth pulled the mouthful of toast she had bitten off into her mouth and she chewed slowly making sure the terrified little girl wrapped in cheese could see everything.<br>\r\nKirsty swallowed her first mouthful and then took another large bite, this time she bit right through the little girls body and her sharp white teeth sliced her in half like a hot knife through butter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take Kirsty long to finish her first slice of toast and she licked her lips.<br>\r\n\"mmm she was tasty, let's hope you are just as nice.\" she said picking the slice of toast with the boy on and lifting it to her lips.<br>\r\nThe boy took one look at Kirsty's huge teeth and began to scream knowing that he stood no chance against them.<br>\r\nKirsty opened her mouth and took a large bite and chewed slowly.<br>\r\nWith two further mouthfuls the slice of toast and the little boy was gone.<br>\r\nKirsty rubbed her tummy and smiled.<br>\r\n\"mmm that was a good breakfast, I can't wait till lunch when two more will join you in my tummy.\" she said rubbing her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeria had picked two boys, she was smiling at them and grabbed a large white bowl. She then poured some mueseli into it and some banana slices then picked up the two boys. She dangled them above the bowl and dropped them. <br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img389.imageshack.us/my.php?image=mueslicerealnn8.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://img389.imageshack.us/my.php?image...</a><br>\r\nThey landed among the Banana muesli with dried fruit and as she watched they immediately tried to climb out, but the sides were too high.<br>\r\nKeira smiled and laughed as she got a carton of milk and poured some into the bowl. The two little boys were nearly drowned as the white liquid covered them and brought them to the top of the bowl. Keira then sprinkled some sugar on her cereal and grabbed a spoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got a spoonful of cereal and lifted it to her lips, her mouth opened and she put the spoonful inside and closed her mouth pulling the spoon out. Then there was a loud crunching noise as she chewed up the cereal. She swallowed her first mouthful and then lowered the spoon into the bowl for another spoonful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne little boy was swimming frantically to escape the spoon as it swept through the cereal but to no avail, the spoon picked him up and he found himself being raised into the air. He was trapped among a full spoonful of mueseli &amp; banana slices. Then he saw Keira's young face looking at him. The little boy thought she was gorgeous. She was wearing a pink top and her long brown hair flowed down to her shoulders.<br>\r\nShe drew back her lips displaying her perfect young white teeth and then opened her mouth wide enough to put the spoon between her lips.<br>\r\nBefore he could react the little boy found himself inside Keira's mouth and before he could scream, the mouth had closed and he was chewed up by the pretty young girl. He didn't stand a chance.<br>\r\nKeira smiled to herself as she chewed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving just watched Keira devour the other boy, the one still in the bowl of cereal began to panic, Keira looked down and saw him and lowered the spoon towards him. She picked him up with another spoonful and raised him to her lips.<br>\r\nJust like the other boy into her mouth he went and was chewed up to pieces in seconds.<br>\r\nKeria licked her lips and finished the rest of her cereal.<br>\r\n\"That was a lovely start to the day. I hope the lunch ones are as nice as they were.\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren was also having toast for breakfast. She had got a jar of orange marmalade and spread a layer on each slice. She then smiled down at her two shrunken people she was going to eat. She had picked two girls who were sisters.<br>\r\nLauren was licking her lips hungrily and her belly began to gurgle.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img186.imageshack.us/my.php?image=marmaladetoastkt8.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://img186.imageshack.us/my.php?image...</a><br>\r\nShe lay one of the girls down on a slice of toast and twisted her into the marmalade. Holding the other shrunken girl in her left hand she picked up the slice of toast with her right hand and raised it to her lips.<br>\r\nThe girl on the slice of toast was trying to escape but the marmalade was too thick and her feet were stuck. She began to scream and Lauren's mouth began to open and she took a large bite of the toast dragging some of it into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Lauren's hand the other girl watched hardly believing her eyes as Lauren devoured the slice of toast with the girls sister on in minutes.<br>\r\n\"mmm she was tasty. Now for you to join her inside me.\" Lauren said as she lay the other girl on another slice of toast. <br>\r\nWithin 2 minutes Lauren had eaten her aswell and was licking her fingers.<br>\r\n\"If lunch is just as tasty, I cannot wait.\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all 15 girls had finished their breakfasts and each girl had eaten 2 people then Natalie spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we all finished our breakfast girls?\" she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so. That was a nice breakfast, those people are really delicious.\" Rachel said running her tongue over her teeth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we are making some sandwiches for our lunches are we putting the next lot of shrunken people in them before we go or are we putting them among our lunch when we are out? Lucy asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which would you prefer?\" Natalie asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it might be more fun to put them in while we are out rather than now. Plus they could try and escape if we put them in sandwiches now.\" Lucy said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it is always nicer to have your victims among your food prior to eating them as they plead so much. I've only had one try to escape.

One had tried to escape but had only reached the top of the bag. He didn't last long as he was the appetiser prior to the sandwich itself.\" Kirsty said recalling the moment in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK we'll put it to the vote. Whichever gets the highest decides when they go in our lunches.\" Natalie said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls put up their hands for which option they wanted and Matalie counted up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen do the shrunken people go into the girls lunches?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just put Jaime somewhere and lets go.

I\u2019d like to eat you but you\u2019ve provided us with all these people for our diet that you are far too useful to end up in my tummy.\u201d She said licking her lips<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie put you inside her purse and zipped it closed, then put the purse in her handbag and exited the kitchen carrying the lunch box, she put it into her rucksack. She closed the door behind her and locked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 15 girls all walked the short distance to the riding stables and all got changed into their riding gear. Natalie, Lauren &amp; Charlotte had their own horses but also kept another 20 in the stables. The other girls chose their horses and saddled up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all trotted down the road and headed up to the forests which was a usual location for them to go riding as there was very little traffic up there and it was nice and quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile riding the girls all chatted about various things including their lunchtime snack which they were all looking forward to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in Natalie\u2019s purse you could hear most of the conversation that was going on. You were scared and glad that you were not among the people in the lunchbox. You looked at your watch 10:30am. \u201cIn about an hour and a half those people will be being put into these girls sandwiches and eaten for their lunch. And I am not sure it I am going to be part of one of them yet.\u201d You say to yourself.<br>\r\nWhen they were deep in the forest, Natalie looked at her watch and sighed.<br>\r\n\u201c11:30am, shall we stop for lunch now and find somewhere to sit and start preparing.\u201d She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDefinitely. I am so hungry my tummy is making noises\u201d Rachel said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMine too, its rumbling every time I think about lunch.\u201d Said Keira<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep let\u2019s stop now, look there\u2019s a big patch of grass there. We can tie the horses up and we can sit on that patch under the trees.\u201d Said Kirsty<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all got off their horses and tethered them up, then Natalie took off her rucksack and laid it on the grass. She took out the box of sandwiches and the box of little people and put them next to each other.<br>\r\n\u201cRight lets start.\u201d She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie took out the foil wrapped sandwiches each with the girls names on and laid them out on the grass. The girls all picked up their foil wrapped sandwiches and unwrapped them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the lunchbox all the little people were beginning to get scared as they knew they didn\u2019t have long before they would be eaten by these 15 girls.<br>\r\nNatalie removed the lid from the box they were in and grinned down at them.<br>\r\n\u201cYou all look delicious, its time for you to become lunch for us.\u201d She said licking her lips hungrily<br>\r\n\u201cRight girls grab your people and lets eat.\u201d She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte went first. She grabbed 2 people and brought them up to her face, drew back her lips and displayed her young perfect braced teeth.<br>\r\nShe then took the top half of her sandwich off and held the two people above her sandwich fillings.<br>\r\nCharlotte had made a ham, tomato &amp; cheese sandwich. She licked her lips and then laid her two little people on top of the slices of cheese. She then put the top piece of bread back on and lifted her sandwich into the air.<br>\r\nThe two people in Charlotte\u2019s sandwich were squashed into her fillings as Charlotte picked up her lunch and they screamed loudly.<br>\r\nCharlotte opened her mouth wide and took a huge bite of her sandwich and chewed slowly. She grinned to herself as she ate.<br>\r\nShe swallowed her first mouthful and took another bite. Her perfect white teeth sliced one of the little people in half and in seconds they were reduced to mush by her molars.<br>\r\nWithin a further two minutes Charlotte had finished her sandwich and was licking her lips.<br>\r\n\u201cMmm that was a tasty sandwich. Those two people were delicious.\u201d She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy went next, she grabbed two little people from the lunch box and her sandwich.<br>\r\nShe had made 2 large buns and filled it with cucumber, lettuce and grated cheese and then covered everything with salad cream.<br>\r\nLucy took the lettuce leaf and folded it around one of her little victims and then put it back on the bun.<br>\r\n\u201cRight I\u2019ll be eating you both separately so you can watch as I devour your fellow first.\u201d She said as she lifted the first bun to her lips and took a large bite.<br>\r\nBeing held in Lucy\u2019s other hand the little boy could see Lucy eating her sandwich and watched her take large bites, he was terrified knowing that he would be going between her lips with her next sandwich. He tried to struggle free but Lucy\u2019s grip was far too strong.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little guy in Lucy\u2019s other hand was watching her devour her sandwich and again tried to escape. Lucy put the last bit of her sandwich between her lips and chewed, and swallowed it then licked her lips.<br>\r\n\u201cNow for your turn.\u201d She said lifting the little boy to her lips and opening her mouth wide to show the little boy where he was going. The little boy screamed as loud as he could and pleaded with Lucy, but Lucy ignored him and put him in her other sandwich.<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t stand a chance as within two minutes Lucy had eaten her other sandwich and was licking her lips.<br>\r\n\u201cThey were delicious, really nice.\u201d She said as she opened a can of Fanta and washed her sandwiches down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirsty was next. She had made a large Coleslaw and Tomato bun and also a Chicken Salad Wrap.<br>\r\nKirsty grabbed two people from the lunchbox and raised them to her face. She smiled at them and licked her lips.<br>\r\n\u201cYou two look really tasty. One of you will be going inside the bun and the second will be wrapped in the wrap. I shall be eating the wrap first, now which one of you shall I eat first.\u201d She said showing her white teeth to the little people.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img504.imageshack.us/my.php?image=friendsmile3xd0.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://img504.imageshack.us/my.php?image...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two people in Kirsty\u2019s hand were so terrified as Kirsty grabbed one of them which turned out to be the blond boy.<br>\r\nKirsty unwrapped her Chicken Salad Wrap and lay the boy on his back among the fillings of chopped tomatoes, lettuce, sliced cucumbers and chicken chunks. She then began to fold the wrap back up again.<br>\r\n\u201cOh Natalie, by the way did we bring any sauces with us?\u201d she asked<br>\r\n\u201cYep, I put some in just incase.\u201d Natalie said half way through her sandwich. \u201cI bought salad cream, mayonnaise, ketchup, brown sauce and mustard.\u201d She said \u201cThey are in my rucksack.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCheers.\u201d Said Kirsty grabbing a bottle of salad cream from Natalie\u2019s rucksack.<br>\r\nShe flipped the top up and squirted a generous amount over her fillings and the little boy. She then folded the wrap up again and lifted it into the air.<br>\r\nThe little boy in the wrap was screaming as loud as he could knowing her was about to be eaten alive for lunch by a huge hungry young girl, but Kirsty couldn\u2019t care less. She opened her mouth wide and put half the wrap into her mouth and bit down slicing it in half. She chewed it and grinned. \u201cmmm this is scrumptious.\u201d She said as she chewed.<br>\r\nThe other person heard a wet gulp as Kirsty swallowed her first mouthful and he saw a bulge descend down her neck and into her body. Kirsty then put the rest of the wrap between her lips and chewed it up. The little boy was ground up and chewed to pieces in seconds as Kirsty\u2019s powerful teeth ripped him to pieces.<br>\r\nKirsty licked her lips and then turned to the other person who was a little girl with pigtails. She looked to be about 9 years old. She was shaking with terror at what she had just seen.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry little girl, it won\u2019t be long before your in my tummy.\u201d Kirsty said giggling evilly.<br>\r\nKirsty then lay the little girl among her coleslaw and tomato sandwich and pressed the top down.<br>\r\nThe little girl didn\u2019t even have chance to scream as in three minutes the sandwich was all gone.<br>\r\nKirsty ran her long pink tongue over her lips and laughed.<br>\r\n\u201cThat was the best meal I have had yet, I\u2019ve never felt someone move so much inside my mouth.\u201d She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie having finished her sandwiches took you out of her purse and stood you on a flat stone. You watched as the rest of the girls got their little people and put them among their sandwiches and ate them in minutes.<br>\r\nStephanie was the last girl to have her sandwich. She had made a banana sandwich and looked down at the last two people in the lunchbox.<br>\r\n\u201cWell you\u2019re the last two people to be eaten and very soon you\u2019ll be in here.\u201d She said pointing at her tummy. \u201cJust think the rest of the people you were with are now being digested in the other girls stomachs and mine will be doing the same to you very shortly.<br>\r\nStephanie lay the two people in her banana sandwich and placed the top on it and it wasn\u2019t long before she had eaten it all.<br>\r\nStephanie licked her lips and rubbed her tummy.<br>\r\n\u201cThat was a very tasty lunch.\u201d She said<br>\r\n\u201cWell we\u2019ve all eaten our sandwiches and the 30 little people, now there is only Jaime left. What shall we do with him?\u201d Gemma asked as she drunk some of her lemonade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t really think we should eat Jaime, he has been really useful in providing all those scrumptious people for us, why should we eat him. He might prove useful again.\u201d Megan replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agree, he is very useful but I could still eat plenty and Jaime looks so delicious, let\u2019s eat him aswell.\u201d Jodie said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK then, do we want to eat Jaime or will he be useful to us again?\u201d Natalie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shivered at the thought as the girls pondered Natalie's question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After a few seconds there was a sickening crunching sound as the little man was chewed up and swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte eating her appetiser: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://youtu.be/IflvrGJr02M\" target=\"_blank\">http://youtu.be/IflvrGJr02M</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"mmm, little men taste so good.\" she said licking her lips. \"Right now for the main course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got a cutting board and a small knife and then grabbed the girl that was in the bowl with you and got some more marg and cut a slice dropping into the pan. It sizzled as it melted, then Charlotte lay the girl down on the chopping board and picked up the knife. The girl was screaming thinking that Charlotte was going to slice her up. \"Don't worry I am not going to slice you up, my teeth will do that. No I am going to remove your clothes unless you want to take them off instead.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl calmed down a bit and obeyed. She stripped off her clothes until she was totally naked. \"Perfect, that is much better as I hate cotton.\" Charlotte said. She picked the girl up and dropped her into the pan, instantly the girl screamed as the hot pan burnt her, Charlotte flipped her over with the knife and flash fried her body but making sure that she was still alive, then got a pair of tongs and picked her up and put her back in the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl was shaking and screaming in pain and swearing at Charlotte. Charlotte meanwhile got a bread bun, some lettuce, tomatoes and some cheese slices and began chopping the tomatoes on the chopping board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to try to speak to the girl in the bowl with you but she is not interested in talking to you she is just crying and screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte finishes making her bun and appears above the bowl again. \"Time for the final filling.\" she said picking the girl up. She kicked and screamed as she was picked up but Charlotte's grip was too strong and there was no way she was going to escape. She was laid down on top of a lettuce leaf with cheese &amp; tomato slices below her, Charlotte then got the top bun and sealed her in. She then picked up the bun and raised it to her lips, opening her mouth she takes a large bite and chews while giggling evilly. After three further bites the bun is gone. Charlotte licks her lips and her fingers and then looks down at you in the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your next Jaime, and it is dessert time for you.\" she said. \"Now fruit salad or ice cream brownie and chocolate sauce.\" Charlotte said out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She then came for Jaime. \"Come on Jaime time for dessert.\" she said picked you from the bowl and then dangling you above her dessert bowl. As you are held high above the bowl of ice cream and brownie, you think about the people this girl has already devoured either with the bun, her appetiser which she chewed up while you watched plus many others that evening and you are now going to have the same fate as part of her dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlotte's belly growled and she lowered you towards the bowl and released the grip on your body. You tumbled and landed on the brownie with a hard thud. Charlotte grinned watching you land and then got a spoon and getting some chocolate sauce drenched you in it. \"That's better, you look the part now.\" she said giggling evilly. The evil young girl then preceeded to devour the brownie, chocolate sauce very quickly and within minutes there was very little left of your landscape. Charlotte lowered her spoon and scooped up the last bit of brownie, some ice cream, chocolate sauce and you from her plate and lifted it into the air holding it infront of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Jaime you are finally going to end up in someone's belly and it is mine. So long.

Your face slams into the tongue of her shoe.  The bus has pulled up a students are getting on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJodie walks to the back of the bus a gets a window seat.  Luckily, another girl sits down next to her.  She has shorts and some flip flops on.  The girls have a conversation on the ride home, but you are too busy checking them out to listen in.  Jodie gets off the bus eventually, and says goodbye to her friend.  You are about to throw up from the walking.  You really want this ride to end.  Jodie's foot slams against the concrete as she gets off the bus.  She walks with a fast pace up to her house.  You want to jump off the shoe, but you are not sure if it is safe.

After a few seconds there is a wet gulp and a bulge descends down her neck and disappears into her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then takes several more bites every now and then making \"mmm\" noises and licking her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around and find that all that surrounds you is a small slice of toast topped with slices of ham.

He was very nice with that snack.

It's heel is beginning to lift off the ground. Your eyes follow the shin and thigh all the way upward to the sight of a giant girl in mid-step, her foot hurtling toward you! You shriek and stumble over yourself trying to run in the opposite direction. You get to your feet and run for your life, and in a millesecond the girl's heel has landed mere inches behind you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe impact of the crash knocks you down! You roll onto your back, looking up at a sole descending straight down at you! Knowing you'll never run out of the way in time, you grimace through the pain and roll between the nearest two suction cups...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel like a bomb went off inside your head as the rest of the foot grounds itself right next to your head. The flesh of the foot pushes down on the suction floor, and a blast of air erupts from under it and over your body, bringing you back to senses. You give your head a little tug--it's stuck. The foot landed so close to you a bit of your hair has gotten stuck underneath. You carefully pry yourself loose and back away. Catching your breath, you can only gawk at the massive thing that almost killed you. The foot isn't moving anymore. It's toes toes flex and wiggle in a playful way that belies it's potential danger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you stare at it petrified for a second or two, the appendage once again lifts off of the floor with a sticky sound and lifts into the air away from you. You look above you to see that all the girls are now dressed in swimsuits and are heading in the same direction, out of the locker room towards the pool. Your relief is short lived, though, as you turn to your left to see countless pairs of legs stomping their way towards you! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the girls got changed into their swimming costumes, they are heading for the showers! There's no way you'll be able to escape the oncoming herd of piston-like legs, thrashing toes, and deadly soles falling from the sky and smacking the ground one after another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey advance on you like an army. You wince and cover your head just before they're upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the girls takes a step past you with her left foot. It lands an inch or so away from you. She then shifts her weight and swoops her right foot off the ground and toward you. You peek through your hands a see a big and middle toe part from each other and swoop in on you like a pincer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA girls leg brushes past you and you see a locker key dangling down from her leg. With a millisecond window you grab it as your determined to get to the pool and find Laura again. You feel safe with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump and clamp onto the dangling locker key. Having got a secure hold, you climb up it and perch on the top of the band. You hold on tight as the girl walks towards the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continues walking and </span></div></div>",

You have been together for 4 years.<br>\r\nWhen you got chatting with her you found that you both shared similar interests and liked similar music.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you are sat in Holly\u2019s stomach you hear a faint and muffled cry from your left. Seconds later there is another one this time from your right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello is there any one in here?\u201d you call puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a faint answer but no words just a murmur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInvestigating you climb around the stomach and after a while come across a young teenage girl laying on the stomach floor. She is missing her left arm and most of her body is covered in scratches. She is crying and whincing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see I'm not the only one in this girls\u2019 stomach\" you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looks up but then looks down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy names Jennifer.\u201d The girl replied still crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened to you? I mean how did you end up in this stomach?\u201d you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHolly\u2019s not a nice girl, she has one hell of a short fuse and she wasn\u2019t happy that I had spent last night with her boyfriend, so she shrunk me and ate me as part of her lunch.\u201d Jennifer replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that why your covered in scratches and your arm is missing?\u201d you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dYep, she sliced my arm in half and then chewed it up before tossing the rest of me into her mouth and chewing again. But this time her teeth only grazed me rather than cutting me in two which I\u2019m quite glad about. At least I am still partly alive.\u201d She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dDo you know a way out?\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's already too late for me, I am unable to move as I am so weak, plus I\u2019ve been in here since 3pm and I\u2019ve lost quite a lot of blood from my arm so I don\u2019t think I could get very far.. You might get lucky but I did not find a way out other than the normal way through the intestines!\" Jennifer said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201d I don\u2019t think I fancy that option, but I will show you one thing that I found when I first entered, <br>\r\nFollow me\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow Jennifer as she drags herself along. She leads you to the far side of Holly\u2019s stomach and points to a pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go take a closer look.\" Jennifer says crying again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look closer and notice that she has led you to quite a big pile of scattered bones stripped clean of everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are looking at what remains of people this girl has sent to her belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dSome of that pile is my boyfriend who Holly devoured and left in a worse state than me. She chopped him to bits and there was very little left of him when she had finished chewing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you are crazy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I? You will find out for yourself soon enough. It won\u2019t be long before this girls stomach acids start digesting you.\u201d Jennifer said as she began to loose consciousness. \u201cNice meeting you\u2026..\u201d her voice tailed off<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJenny, Jenny!\u201d you call shaking her violently. But you receive no reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere was that other cry coming from?\u201d you ask yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough you hear another muffled cry this time from behind you. Turning round you slide down a pile of part digested food and at the bottom is a young boy. He is intact, unlike Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d he asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Martin, what\u2019s yours?\u201d you reply<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Steven. You\u2019ve been eaten too then?\u201d he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, I was swallowed with the remains of a glass of something.\u201d You say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen did you end up in here?\u201d you ask Steven<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was swallowed whole about an hour ago. This girl had kept me and a few others in her purse and when she went to the loo, she took me out, opened her mouth wide and down the hatch I went in seconds. She is lethal!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They teased that she was way out of your league but you didn't want to give up and got chatting with her and found you both had a lot in common. You took her for a meal at a nice restaurant and also to see a film and eventually you asked her if she would go out with you. She agreed straight away and the last two and a half years have been great.<br>\r\nJo has a lovely smile which was one of the things you noticed when you first met her and she also had a stunning slim figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning two letters come for you. One is a credit card bill and the other is from Jo. <br>\r\nEagerly you open the letter and read it. She has sent you an invitation to her 21st birthday party which she is holding at her house. Their is a letter in the envelope aswell. Reading the letter you notice she is in France at the moment visiting some friends but she will be back prior to her party.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nOver the next few weeks you make the decision that you are going to propose to Jo at her party and head out into your local town to buy her a ring.<br>\r\nAfter visiting many jewellers you find a beautiful ring and decide that is the one for her. It is 9 carret gold with a diamond in with purple colours. Looking at the price you see it is \u00a3275. <br>\r\n\"Jo is definetly worth that if not more.\" you say to yourself as you go into the jewellers and pay for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the end of the month nears and the days roll by Jo's birthday party is getting closer and you start to feel nervous.<br>\r\n\"It will go fine I'm sure.\" you mother says one evening as you have been chatting about things releating to proposing to Jo.<br>\r\n\"I hope so.\" you reply<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen finally it is the day of Jo's birthday.<br>\r\nYou made sure you wore your best clothes and looked your best.<br>\r\nYour father got his Porsche from the garage,you got into the car with your father and he drove you down the road and off towards a village about 30 minutes away.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nJo lived in quite a big house as he parents were quite rich. Her parents own a top riding school and also are trainers for several top horses. Jo herself owns three horses and has also started appearing in major TV shows.  <br>\r\nThe car turned off the main road down a long gravel drive lined with trees which led to a huge house at the end.<br>\r\nYour dad stopped the car and you got out.<br>\r\n\"I'll pick you up on Sunday afternoon unless I hear from you before. Good luck with the proposal!\" said your father as you headed for the front door. You waved to your father as he drove off down the drive.<br>\r\nA big oak door stood infront of you. It had a big gold handle in it and a bell-pull next to it. You tugged on the bell-pull. A ding-a-ling came from inside and the door opened.<br>\r\nJo's mother (Karen) was stood in the doorway.<br>\r\n\"Hi Richard come on in, Jo's just got out the shower, she'll be down in a minute.\" <br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" you reply<br>\r\n\"Help yourself to drinks, their in the lounge.\" Karen said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went into the lounge and acknowledged other people who were there. Some of the people you hadn't seen since you were at school and you caught up and relived old times.<br>\r\nThen Jo came into the room, she looked gorgeous wearing a long red dress, her hair was tied back and she had a silver pair of shoes on. <br>\r\nHer eyes sparkled as she spotted her boyfriend.<br>\r\nRichard turned and saw his girlfriend.<br>\r\n\"Wow, Jo you look stunning.\" you say as you glide over to her and she throws her arms around you and gives you a long passionate kiss.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
