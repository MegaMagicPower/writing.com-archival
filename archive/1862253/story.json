Phil and Rita (Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell's characters) have settled down in Punxsutawney and had a kid together, Ryan, who is now a seventeen-year-old senior at Punxsutawney High. No matter how much his parents try to convince him otherwise, he hates living in this small \"hick\" town in Western Pennsylvania. The last straw comes today, when he is reminded of how crazy the town gets for something as stupid as an ugly rodent. So he convinces his best friend Kurt to run away to New York with him, \"borrowing\" his dad's credit card and buying two one-way bus tickets to New York. However, when a freak blizzard hits the entire state, very similar to the one that hit twenty years ago to the day, Ryan finds himself stuck for yet another Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney. When he goes through the same day yet again, something starts to change that may either help change his mind on his hometown or help him escape it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) There's nothing that sixteen-year-old Lucas is more proud of than his thirteen-year-old kid brother Jordan, who is an all-star Little League pitcher and has led his team to the regional championship game today, where the winner will advance to the Little League World Series. Having played Little League himself a few years ago (and still playing baseball in high school), Lucas has taught Jordan everything he knows about the game, and even serves as the team's third base coach. Jordan and his team face a huge challenge, and though they may not succeed the first day, as Lucas starts to repeat this day over and over again, something seems to be happening to Jordan and his team that may give them an edge, or at the very least make things pretty interesting!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) The first day of middle school is always rough, but especially when your family has just moved to another country. For twelve-year-old Rakin, who's father just moved their entire family from Dubai to the United States with less than a week's notice, that means making all new friends, hoping his English is good enough and his accent is hidden enough to avoid getting made fun of (or worse), and (on top of all that) dealing with being one of the shortest boys in the class. Needless to say, the first day is miserable. However, when he starts having to repeat that first day, he also finds his body changing in some pretty fantastic ways, that may make coping with this situation a lot easier (or perhaps not). </span></div></div>",

He got up, and headed to Jordan's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you up, Mr. Star Player?\" Lucas popped his head into his brother's room, but surprisingly, he wasn't there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading downstairs, he grinned a bit, seeing Jordan already quite awake as their mother made them a nice, filling breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel today, little guy?\" Lucas chuckled a bit, and while Jordan had finally hit his teenage years, it was hard to want to stop treating him like a kid after all. But considering how much he'd already grown, Lucas might have to change lest he soon be the 'little brother'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan gave Lucas a light punch in the arm, \"Well, this not-so-little 'guy' is feeling pumped for the game today, that's how I feel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling was mutual for the whole family really, Lucas didn't want to admit it, but he did feel a little jealousy at his brother's success, even compared to himself. He'd never managed a chance at the LLWS the entire time he played when he was younger, but that was the past, this was now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey finished breakfast, the two of them got ready, and soon enough, there they stood at the baseball park, practicing first, since they were home team, plus the other team hadn't arrived yet. That soon changed though, and everyone on the field was shocked at seeing this other team, who'd pretty much beaten every team they went against hard and fast, with skill unseen before in just boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut while they were boys, they sounded, acted, and such like boys would, their bodies were a good deal larger. Beneath those uniforms stood muscle, strong and hard muscles from head to toe for every member of the team. Even Lucas felt a bit doubtful at seeing the other team, wondering if even his own high school team could stand up to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet despite this shock, morale was high, a surprise like that wasn't gonna change anything for Jordan and his teammates. They felt good, they had teamwork, they had many games together, they were NOT gonna lose so easily just because the other team was bigger and such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game began, and while all those things were true, the other team was no pushover. The entire game was long, grueling, and difficult. Jordan and his teammates were not totally outclassed, but the other boys were certainly a big step above them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the third inning, the other team's pitcher threw a fast ball so quick, the umpire had to take a few moments to realize that the whistling in his ears was from the ball slamming into the catcher's glove, and he finally realized he had to say, 'STRIKE!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the bottom of the seventh inning, Jordan's team, their first-baseman took a bad step trying to catch a runner, twisting his ankle quite badly, and leaving them down by one person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately though, despite their truly best efforts, Jordan's team did lose, at a score of 15 to 9. Needless to say, feelings were down, bodies were sore after such a long game, but regardless, Lucas couldn't have been prouder of his brother for all their efforts, he just hoped that whoever that team had to go against was as tough or tougher than Jordan's team was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, as he finally settled into bed, Lucas slowly began to drift into a quiet sleep, and in the morning, he hit his alarm clock, right at 6 A.M. But something felt...off to him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Of course something was off!  Why on Earth was he waking up at six A.M. on a Sunday?!?  In his excitement over Jordan's game yesterday morning he must've forgotten to switch off the alarm for today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh of exasperation Lucas closed his eyes again and drew his blankets more tightly around him.  He'd get in a few more hours sleep before getting up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr that was what he intended to do anyway, but before he could drop off someone banged hard on his door.  \"Come on, bro, rise and shine!\" Jordan's voice sang out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the heck?!?  He wouldn't expect his brother to be in a good mood today, much less up for playing practical jokes.  For that matter, why was he even up at all?  He enjoyed sleeping in on Sundays as much as Lucas did!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go away!\" he shouted irritably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No can do, Lucas. Mom made us both a big breakfast and if you don't get down here soon you won't have time to eat it.  She says we gotta leave by 6:30 at the latest for the game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGame?  Did he mean another baseball game? But the season was over!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan opened his door and stepped across the threshold, his facial expression conveying both excitement and impatience.  He was wearing his Little League uniform, but all the grass stains and dirt smudges it had picked up from the game yesterday were gone.  Huh.  Mom must have washed it last night, but why was Jordan wearing it now?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we don't get there soon we won't get a parking space anywhere near the field and I'm not going to walk to it today!  I need to be in top shape for this game!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jordan, you already played the championship game yesterday, remember?  You lost.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we didn't!\" Jordan insisted, looking at Lucas as if his older brother had suddenly grown an extra head.  \"We won the championship last week.  This is our reward, the game against the New York Yankees!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAT?!?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow fully awake the teenager sat bolt upright in bed, staring at his younger sibling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jordan, stop kidding around,\" he ordered uneasily.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not!  This is what we've been working toward all season, ever since they announced it.  Now come on!\"<br>\r\nJordan turned and disappeared from the doorway and a few seconds later Lucas heard his brother thundering down the stairs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow seriously worried about his brother's sanity Lucas threw on some clothes and headed for Mom's room.  If Jordan really was cracking up over the loss yesterday, she'd know what to do.  Except she wasn't sleeping in her bed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore and more confused Lucas headed down stairs, only to find Jordan eagerly digging in to a plate heaped high with eggs, sausage and bacon, while Mom sat at the table finishing up the newspaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are!  Hurry up and eat, Lucas.  We have to leave in ten minutes.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To go where?\" Lucas asked in utter bewilderment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To your brother's game, of course!\" Mom responded, looking genuinely shocked.          <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling numb Lucas sank into his chair, his plate already sitting at his place and prepared for him.  Was Mom humoring Jordan?  That had to be it!  When she had realized her son had become delusional she had decided to humor him until they could get him in for treatment.  In which case it was his job to play along until they could get Jordan the help he needed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same breakfast which had tasted so good yesterday might as well have been soggy cardboard for all Lucas noticed now.  His mind was consumed with his brother's plight.  Poor Jordan!  Jord had always been fiercely competitive, but Lucas never would have dreamed that this would lead to insanity!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey finished up breakfast and headed out to the car.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shotgun!\" Jordan shouted, leaping into the front seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't good.  When Mom drove toward the hospital instead of the ball park who knew what Jordan might do?  He could try to grab the wheel and get them all killed!  Better to have him in back where Lucas could try to restrain him if he started to get violent.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Jordan, why don't you sit in back with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucas, this is your brother's special day.  Let him sit up front if he wants to,\" Mom admonished him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas reluctantly got in back, making sure to slide in behind the passenger seat.  Jordan was brimming over with excitement now, talking a mile a minute about what it would be like to take on the pros, and it was so sad that Lucas could barely keep from crying.  He didn't know how his mother was able to put on such a brave and convincing face, but he had to hand it to her; she was handling this crisis a lot better than he was.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas readied himself when they reached the turn which would show they were going to the hospital instead of  the baseball diamond, but Mom didn't make it!  Instead she continued straight ahead.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Mom, I think you missed a turn,\" Lucas tried to point out subtly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucas, are you still asleep, or have you really forgotten the way to the ball field?\" his Mom asked in an amused tone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was she doing?  And how would Jordan react when they got to the baseball diamond and it was deserted?  Would his delusion break down?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept it WASN'T deserted!  In fact there were more people milling around the field than Lucas had ever seen there before in his life!  At the direction of the police officer who was controlling traffic they turned into the parking lot, managing to get one of the last spaces left.  Lucas spotted no less than four T.V. news vans parked there and as Jordan ran ahead to the dugout he spotted the crews setting up their cameras on the edge of the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas slowly shifted his gaze to the other dugout and saw exactly what he had feared: the New York Yankees!  There were Dave Phelps, Adam Warren, Chris Stewart, Derek Jeter, Mark Teixiera and Chris Stewart!  One of the best pro teams in the sport was here to take on his brother's Little League team!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan wasn't the crazy one; HE was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas didn't know what he might have done next if Coach Hamilton hadn't called him over.  He'd just finished his pep talk to the team and now he smiled at his teenage Assistant Coach.  \"Lucas!  So the big day is finally here!  Are you up for it?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, Coach,\" he stuttered, lying through his teeth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, this team is the best one I've ever had the privilege of coaching.  I'm glad this is the year the Yankees decided to make this offer.  These kids deserve it.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas nodded mechanically and the Coach slapped him on the shoulder.  \"Get out to your position, Lucas.  After all, we're here to win!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raised his voice to a shout on the last four words and Jordan and the others kids cheered in response.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHead spinning Lucas took his place in the third base coaching box.  Fortunately he had very little to do; by the seventh inning only two of the boys had made it to third base.  Against the New York Yankees even the best Little League team in the country didn't stand a ghost of a chance, though the pros were quite obviously taking it easy on the children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat changed after Jordan's eight inning at bat.  After one ball and two strikes,  Jordan manages to blast David Robertson's fastball over the fences for a home run, brining the score up to 4-14, Yankee's favor.  Lucas caught a sour look on Robertson's face as Jordan races around the bases, yelling and pumping his fists in the air.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's the last time Jordan's team scores, or even manages to get on base.  The game ends with a score of 4-24.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards Mom drove them to Pizza Palace for a celebratory lunch with the rest of the team.  Most of the players are laughing and happy, but Jordan just picks at his pizza with a sour expression on his face.  Considering he was pretty much the star of this game Lucas is surprised to see him looking so gloomy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course the older teen had problems of his own.  Lucas would have staked his life on the fact that Jordan's team lost the championship game yesterday!  And he certainly didn't remember the announcement at the beginning of the season that this year's Little League world champions would get to face the New York Yankees in a game for charity!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet they had.  All he had to do was get online with his cell phone to confirm that.  It had been on the internet for months, at the Yankee's website and on the news sites Lucas frequented.  How he possibly have forgotten it?  What was wrong with him?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, in spite of his concern for himself, Lucas managed to find time for his brother.  Slipping into the vacated chair beside Jordan he asked him, \"Why are you looking down, champ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I'm not a champ!\" Jordan snaps back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I though you won the championship,\" Lucas asks hesitantly, afraid of again finding that reality doesn't match up with his memories.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we lost this one!\" Jordan insists bitterly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe actually wanted to win against the New York Yankees!  Now that's Jordan through and through!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day passed quickly and Lucas turned in early, still wrestling with himself over whether or not to tell Mom about the mental lapse he seems to have had.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it just a one-time thing?  In that case he'd be better off keeping quiet.  If this wasn't a one-off, though, then he needed serious mental help, and fast!  Unable to reach a decision Lucas finallly drifted off.  His last errant thought was that things would undoubtedly look clearer in the morning.          </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lucas lay in bed for a few minutes longer than yesterday, his eyes closed as he tried to figure out just what felt different. For one thing, he hadn't remembered setting the alarm for 6 AM last night, as there wasn't any reason to. Maybe he had just forgot to turn it off the night before. But something else seemed ... peculiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he got out of bed and stretched. He heard rustling from downstairs, and the muffled sounds of both his mom's and his brother's voices. That was another odd thing, Lucas thought, with Jordan waking up this early on a Sunday. He must have had some trouble sleeping after yesterday's loss. Lucas sighed, figuring he best go downstairs and comfort him like a big brother should.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked downstairs, however, he was ran into by Jordan, who was running upstairs with an excited grin on his face.\u00a0\u201dThere you are, Lucas! I was just coming up to get you. Mom made us both a big breakfast to get ready for the game!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dGame?\u201d Lucas asked, a \u00a0puzzled look on his face.\u00a0\u201dBut, Jordan, you lost yesterday. That's the end of the season.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dHuh?\u201d Jordan scrunched up his nose and tilted his head to the side.\u00a0\u201dWhat are you talking about? Our last game was a week ago, and besides, we've won out last six! That's why we're playing for the regional championship today, remember?\u201d\u00a0Lucas stared at Jordan blankly, but his brother didn't wait for a response, turning back around and heading downstairs.\u00a0\u201dC'mon, the eggs are getting cold!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head, Lucas slowly made his way downstairs. In the kitchen, his mom was sitting at the table, reading the paper.\u00a0\u201dThere you are, sleepyhead,\u201d she said, smiling warmly.\u00a0\u201dYou weren't going to oversleep today and be late for Jordan's big game, were you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dNo-- I mean, the game has already happened,\u201d Lucas said, starting to feel a bit uneasy.\u00a0\u201dHis team lost by six runs yesterday. The other team was just so much bigger and stronger. Right?\u201d He tried to say this last part with some confidence, but he wasn't sure of anything right now, and it showed in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan looked up at Lucas, then back at his mom, and his excitement was starting to dip a little. Sensing this, his mom said,\u00a0\u201dOh, don't be ridiculous, Lucas. Jordan and the boys will have no problem winning today. No matter how big the other players are.\u201d \u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, she turned to Jordan, saying, \u201dHoney, would you do me a favor and refill my coffee mug? The pot\u2019s on the counter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dSure, mom!\u201d he said, and leaped up to grab the cup and run towards the kitchen.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Jordan had left, his mother leaned forwards towards Lucas, speaking in a low but firm tone. \u201dListen, Lucas. It's understandable that you\u2019re feeling a little jealous that Jordan\u2019s team has made it this far. But that doesn't give you the right to try to mess with his head like this.\u201d\u00a0Lucas started to protest, but was immediately cut off.\u00a0\u201dI don't want to hear any more about it, okay?\u201d she asked as Jordan came back in, carefully carrying a coffee mug filled to the brim.\u00a0\u201dThanks, hon,\u201d she said, taking the cup from Jordan and sipping it, trying to keep it from spilling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the breakfast went by in an awkward silence, and when Lucas had finished, he went upstairs to check the date on his cell phone. Somehow, some way, it seemed to be showing that it was still Saturday. Running to the family's computer, he looked at the date there, and it read the same. Pulling up the website for the atomic clock, he verified that it was still somehow Saturday.\u00a0\u201dBut that\u2019s impossible!\u201d he cried out aloud.\u00a0\u201dHow could it be the same day over again?\" He started thinking that yesterday had been just a dream\u00a0-- but he had remembered it so vividly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore too long, he found himself at the ballpark again, and sure enough, the rest of Jordan\u2019s team was practicing, just like yesterday. Or at least, just how Lucas had remembered yesterday happening, but he wasn't so sure anymore. Something weird was definitely going on, that's for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the other team arrived, however, that's when Lucas realized just how weird things were. The players looked to be the same players from yesterday, the same faces and names on the uniforms-- except they were, somehow, even bigger! Where as yesterday, the tallest player on the team was just at six feet tall, today, the shortest player easily surpassed that, and the biggest stood well over seven feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dWhat the hell?\u201d Lucas exclaimed, pointing and gawking.\u00a0\u201dHow in the world are any of those boys under fourteen years old?!\u201d They did still have boyish faces and horsed around like twelve and thirteen year olds would, but they had bodies bigger than any adult he had ever seen. Even besides their incredible height, the boys were each ripped with bulging muscles that seemed to cause their uniforms to nearly burst off of their chest and arms. Their feet, too were huge-- Lucas guessed that they all had to have over size twenty shoes. \u00a0<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nLooking back at Jordan and his teammates, though, Lucas quickly realized that no one else seemed to be fazed or even surprised by the incredibly imposing hulks before them.\u00a0\u201dOf course they are,\u201d Jordan answer his brother.\u00a0\u201dWhat are you so surprised for, anyway? We've been watching tape on them for the last week. And we know just how to beat them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, that claim seemed to be way off the mark. It was clear even during batting practice that Jordan's team faced nearly impossible odds, as every member of the opposing team hit a home run on nearly every ball that was tossed at them. This carried over to the start of the game, as the first four batters each hit a home run on the first pitch of their at-bats, and by the end of the top of the first, the score was already 14-0. Jordan did his best to mix up curves and change-ups along with his fastball, but no matter what pitch he through, the batter would almost always be able to hit it.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings went from bad to worse once the home team stepped up to the plate. The first pitch whizzed by the lead off batter, knocking him back with its sheer force. Lucas\u00a0glanced over at a radar gun that a parent of the opposing team had brought to measure their pitch speed, and though he couldn't quite make all the numbers out, he swore he saw that it was triple digits. These pitches would be difficult for a major leaguer to hit, much less a twelve year old. Appropriately enough, as Lucas looked into the stands behind the cheering parents, there appeared to be several men that were watching the pitcher and jotting down notes - scouts, Lucas quickly realized.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHOOSH! WHOOSH! Two more strikes without so much as a prayer of a swing, and the batter was out. The boy up to bat second was a carbon copy of the first, being sent down after three blazing fastballs. Jordan was the third batter, and he too had two quick strikes before finally being able to make contact, if barely, sending the ninth pitch of the inning foul off the first base line. The tenth pitch, however, got him swinging, and the inning was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second and the third were more of the same, the opposing team scoring seven and twelve runs respectively, making it 33-0. With two outs in the bottom of the third, though, the home team got their first base runner, as one of those 100 mph+ fastballs ran a bit too far inside and hit the batter in the thigh.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy screamed in pain, collapsing to the ground right after being hit.\u00a0The head coach, his teammates, and parents, immediately ran out to see if he was injured, and Lucas cringed as he heard the boy\u2019s whimpering, painful even from where he stood in the third base coaching box. That feeling immediately changed to anger and disgust, though, when he overheard the opposing coach mutter to himself in the dugout behind him, saying, \u201dThere goes the perfect game.\u201d Lucas wanted to turn around and scream at him, berate him for being so blithe and uncaring about a boy with a possibly devastating\u00a0injury, but he somehow found the restraint to hold back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy finally came to his feet, shaking and wobbly, but managing to muster up a smile. A pinch runner came in for him at first, and the base runner became a moot point as the next batter went down on strikes.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By the time the visitors finished batting in the top of the fourth, the score was 45-0 and the umpires were ready to call it on the mercy rule. Jordan\u2019s coach were ready to give in to this even before the bottom of the inning, but Jordan begged for one last chance to get a hit, which they decided to allow. As Jordan stepped up to the plate, the previous batter having also struck out, Lucas could tell that he had a fierce determination in his eyes, one that seemed different from any emotion he had ever seen before from his brother. As the first pitch came, Jordan stepped back, bracing for a huge swing, before--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ball sailed high and fast, traveling in a long arc down the third base line. Lucas whirled around, watching as the ball sailed... just outside the yellow foul pole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dDammit,\u201d Lucas muttered to himself, but as he turned back around, he looked over at the opposing pitcher, nothing a sudden unease that seemed to come over him. Jordan had clearly gotten to him with that last foul ball, and, being the only batter who had made contact with his pitches, twice now, he knew that Jordan would require more than just the usual four-seamer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile seemed to spread across Jordan\u2019s face, and he started to stick his tongue out the side of his mouth as he got back in the batter\u2019s box. The pitcher let loose the next pitch, but this time, the ball traveled substantially slower, and curved downwards. Jordan eyed the ball all the way in, looking like he was ready to send that ball packing, but held up at the last moment. When the ball hit the catcher\u2019s mitt, a silence filled the air, everyone waiting for a called strike that never came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dOne and one\u2019s the count,\" the umpire finally called out, and the crowd went nuts.\u00a0\u201dGeez, it's just ball one,\u201d Lucas said, shaking his head and grinning, though he was happy that his brother could do what no other batter seemed to be able to do -- work the count.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third pitch of the at-bat nicked the outside bottom corner, resulting in a called strike two. The pitcher seemed to relax a little, but at the same time, the look of determination came back into Jordan\u2019s face. The next pitch, a fastball down the plate, would be his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother crack, and again the ball sailed high into the air. But this time, it headed towards the right-center field fence. Jordan took off like a rocket towards first, rounding the base before the ball came down... right against the wall. The Center Fielder grabbed it and fired it back towards the infield, but not before Jordan came into third base, sliding and just beating the tag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd erupted yet again, going crazy now. Lucas helped up his brother and hugged him.\u00a0\u201dGreat triple, bro!\u201d he exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dThanks!\u201d Jordan beamed back.\u00a0\u201dBut I\u2019m not done yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pitcher now was clearly rattled, and his next three pitches each missed the zone, two outside and one too high. The fourth pitch was swung on and missed for strike one, but the fifth pitch was in the dirt.\u00a0\u201dBall four! Take your base!\u201d Again the crowd cheered, and the opposing coach in the dugout behind Lucas and Jordan started going nuts, cursing and throwing bats and helmets to the ground in disgust. Lucas seemed to be the only one who found it odd that everyone was getting so worked up for a forty-five run blow-out of a game. But he could see how much this meant to his brother, and he knew what needed to be done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the next batter still in the on-deck circle, Lucas caught their head coach\u2019s eye, and casually gave the signal for a double steal -- having the runner on first try for second, and when the catcher would try to throw him out, have Jordan take off for home. The coach hesitated, looking at the runners on first and\u00a0third, then back at Lucas, finally nodding. Lucas relayed this to the first base coach, and then to Jordan, who nodded with a confident grin.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the batter stepped up to the plate, Lucas's heart was pounding, as this play could go bad really easily. The first pitch was thrown and the runner at first took off for second. As the catcher rose to throw, Jordan broke for home at just the right time. The catcher saw Jordan breaking just as the ball left his grasp, and seemingly tried to pull it back into his hand, but it was too late. When the ball got to second and the runner was called out, Jordan was already beginning to slide into home plate, and though the ball was relayed back, the catcher never had a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dSAFE!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd erupted, and Jordan's team stormed out of the dugout, jumping on him and mobbing him at the plate, then lifting him up and carrying him off the field on their shoulders.\u00a0\u201dGeez,\u201d Lucas said to himself,\u00a0\u201dthey\u2019re acting like they just won the World Series.\u201d It was only after the game that Lucas discovered that Jordan\u2019s hit, and his run, were the first of each that the opposing team had allowed all season.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the final batter went down on strikes, and the umpires finally did call the game on mercy after the fourth inning, with a final score of 45-1. Though defeated, Jordan\u2019s team seemed happier and more excited than the visitors did, and Jordan was now a star among the community, at least for today.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got home, though, Lucas couldn't help but wonder and worry about what tomorrow would bring\u00a0-- if it would even come at all. And if it didn't come around, if today happened again and it was game day once more, what would change this time?\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy six AM the next morning, he got his answer. \u00a0</span></div></div>",

His mind raced wondering why this is happening over and over, and also wondered what might have changed this time.  He looked around nothing seemed different at the moment, but then again nothing ever did until he got to his brothers baseball game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts were then interrupted by a wonderful smell of breakfast wafting from down stairs.  Now that was different his mom rarely cooked breakfast but he wasn't about to complain about that and he ran downstairs passing his brothers room to get some fresh breakfast.  His mouth watered at the sight. There was a huge pile of scrambled eggs, pancakes, three types of breakfast meats; bacon, sausage, and porkroll; hashbrown, and two larger pitchers of milk and OJ.  He felt like diving face first into the table of food, he ran up to it but was stopped by his mother before he could get at it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ah ah; You know that's not for you that's for you brother.\" she chastised.  Lucas made a face \"What?! all this for that little twerp?!\" he whined as he heard loud heavy thumping around upstairs.  'jeez he must be jumping around up there' Lucas thought to himself.  Then turned back towards his mother \"Then what do i get to eat?\" and she hands you a small bowl of boring tasteless oatmeal.  \"Why cant i have some of that?\"  he whines again.  His mother turns around with an annoyed look on her face \"You know full well we cant afford to feed Jordan and you the same things!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas is sitting at the table just playing with the oatmeal not wanting to eat it but his stomach grumbling in hunger from the smell of the delishious food on the table.  Once again he heard the loud heavy thumps this time coming down the stairs.  \"There's my little man\"  his mom coos at Jordan.  When Lucas looks up he is absolutely dumbfounded by what he sees.  His brother is massive is almost every way imaginable.  \"I'm ready for this game! no one can stop me!\" he gloats, and Lucas and only agree thats is probably true.  Jordan is huge standing 6'9\" and his clothes are like a second skin stretched over the titanic muscles that cover his body.  He stretches with his bat over his shoulders behind his back, this pose clearly shows the cobra-hood like lats that he now possesses and the massive boulders of power that are his biceps.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/38723895@N02/4720984510/in/photostream\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.flickr.com/photos/38723895@N0...</a> )<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan sits down at the table and starts to quickly down the huge meal that was specially made for him.  Shoveling food into his mouth and chugging milk from the pitcher.  Lucas can only stare in shock and awe at this new form of his little brother.  But it clear that he maybe younger but he is obviously not the little brother anymore.  When he is finally done he pats his rock hard abs \"Now that was a good breakfast, a little small but good.\"  'Small?! is he crazy?!' Lucas cant help but think to himself.  Jordan leaves the table to start to get changed for the game today leaving Lucas still shocked and looking around for maybe a few leftovers to eat but there is nothing left.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rakin stood in front of his bathroom mirror, tears streaming down his face. This first day of middle school sucked, just flat-out sucked. It was probably the worst day of his life. Not knowing anyone at all at school was bad, sure, but he had to deal with the fact that he had just moved to the United States from Dubai, and was probably never going to see any of his friends again. What's more, being the new kid with a \"funny\" accent, brown skin, and a Middle Eastern background meant that every bully this school had would taunt him, and even the normal non-aggressive kids would shun him. It didn't help that he was the shortest boy in the sixth grade, looking more like a ten-year-old, though he was a month past his twelfth birthday. His mother tried to make him feel better by telling him it was an experience that would make him stronger in the long run, but that didn't help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, he thought through sobs, everything seemed stacked against him, and there didn't seem to be any room for improvement for the foreseeable future. He would just have to do the best he could to survive, and then maybe he would either learn to cope with all the crap he was going through, or hopefully his father would decide to move the family back to Dubai after this business opportunity in America failed to pan out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he took a shower, he started to feel better, and thought that maybe things wouldn't be so bad after all. But then as he washed his arms, he felt the bruises that were there as a result of being slammed into a locker by Lloyd, the biggest and meanest bully in the school. Lloyd was an eight grader but through a combination of early puberty and most likely being held back a grade or five, he was as big as any of the teachers. He had a mop of stringy red hair on the top of his head, and the natural ruddiness in his face made him look angry all the time, though that probably wasn't too far away from the truth anyways. Rakin could tell from the start that Lloyd meant trouble, right as soon as he saw the six-foot-tall boy coming walking through the hall during the break between second and third periods, and he tried to avoid the bully by turning around and walking the other way. Unfortunately, Lloyd made a beeline straight for Rakin, grabbing him by the shoulder and whirling him around, saying that he wasn't going to let a \"terrorist\" punk roam the halls of \"his\" school. It was racist \"terrorism\" in of itself, but there was nothing that Rakin could do about it, and no one else who walked by seemed to care as Lloyd punched him in the arm, then stuffed him into his locker. Luckily, through either dimness or because he didn't care, Lloyd hadn't locked it or even latched it all the way shut, so it was easy enough for Rakin to sneak out once he was sure the coast was clear, and make his way to class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the worst thing that had happened, Rakin thought as he stepped out of the shower and started to towel off, but the rest of the day wasn't much better. Teachers constantly mispronounced both his first and last name, and some even made a slight sneer as they said it, though they at least attempted to hide that fact. Only one person would even say more than a few words to him, and that was a boy who seemed to be every bit as bullied as he was. At least this boy, Dan, seemed like he was more intelligent than most of the other students at this school, though he did look like a stereotypical nerd, skinny with thick-rimmed glasses and blonde hair in a bowl-cut. At this point, though, Rakin would have to take all the friends he could get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least the day was finally over now. After brushing his teeth, Rakin slipped into his pajamas and climbed into bed. As he closed his eyes, he held out hope that the days would only get easier from here, but he dreaded that was being naive. Little did he know that he wasn't even done with this day yet, though perhaps that wouldn't be such a bad thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, when he wakes up, he notices something odd, and not just that it's the first day of school again.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">We've all seen the movie Groundhog Day, right? You know, where Bill Murray plays a sarcastic but lovable weatherman who mysteriously finds himself having to repeat his least favorite day of the year (Groundhog Day) over and over again? Well, this story finds someone else in a similar situation. But with a twist!! (duh duh DUMMMM!!!!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the first chapter or two you'll pick a main character and situation, then follow that character as they repeat the same day over and over again (and no, it doesn't have to actually be February 2nd, any day will do). The main character of course realizes that they're experiencing the same day again, but, just like in the movie, to everyone else the day is as new as it was the first time. However, though the basic events the main character sees and participates in are more or less the same, they notice some peculiar changes from day to day, and these changes get more and more pronounced as they go through more and more repeats of the day. These could be things like a physical transformation of one or more characters, or a change in weather or appearance of a place, or pretty much anything else you can think of. And, of course, the main character is free to act differently than they did the previous day(s), and influence events that way if they wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty much anything goes. I'm going to put a choice at the beginning for what amounts to a sort of sequel-ish to the movie (though, I should emphasize if it's not obvious, that I do not own or have anything to do with the characters or story of Groundhog Day, which is property of Columbia Pictures and was written by Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis). Feel free to put your own own characters or others from whichever work you wish. I reserve the right to edit this story, but I will probably only do so if I see something really egregious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks, and happy writing!</td>",
