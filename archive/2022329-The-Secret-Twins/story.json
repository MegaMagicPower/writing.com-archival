Our new school was named after the city we live in. We had four classes together: Creative writing 303 (AP), Per-calculus (AP) and Computer Animation 202 (AP), and Drama. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, we are smart. And we don't care who knows. All you have to do is study. Plus, Hannah is a good study partner. If we play our cards right, we might even graduate a year or more sooner.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah and I know this year is going to be the best year yet. There are so many possibles that are new school has to offer us. Yes, our newly built 21st century school still has a few small things left to polish. But it has all the latest stuff. I just don't want to bore you with all the details.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a onclick=\"$('#dropNote1').toggle (200);\" style=\"cursor:pointer;color:#0000ff;\" title=\"\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Deleted Scene: Boring details</span> <span style=\"font-size:8pt;opacity:.75;text-decoration:none;\">\u25bc</span></a><div id=\"dropNote1\" style=\"padding:0px;display:none;\"> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">They just finished building the new school. It has all the latest cool technology. This new school was designed with technology in mind. The school board even added new classes focused on computers, technology, and coding <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe school board saved money by building a K-12 school instead of three separate schools. All the classrooms were inside, but had section separated sections for elementary school, middle school, and high school.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe busses are all electric with a diesel generator as backup. They even have solar panels and wind turbines to charge the buses and power the school.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach section had their own school office, principal's office, gym, cafeteria (not that we be eating their barely edible food), and other rooms that are not important. We are not allowed to cross over to the other sections without permission. Since Hannah and I have AP classes we can enter into the High School section. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah and I got personal tours of the whole school last month. Each classroom has access to its own dedicated gigabit internet,  has the latest AC WIFI network, digital whiteboards, 4k cameras that record our lessons, blackboard-like features for homework for both the student and parent. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a 21 century school, with digital books that always update.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, our parents can now log-on and see what homework we have, are future homework, and our grades, and all the teacher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s notes at any time. Our teachers can personally write notes to each parent about each assignment or any comments they want the parent or student to know.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an effort to help boost grades and class attendance. If a student does not show up for a class, has missing homework, or any other trigger, the parents get a text or email alert. Now the parents can be actively engaged in our learning. YAAAY! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Hannah and I like best is if we missed a day, or had to stay home, we can still watch the lesson live, or watch it again later if we miss something.  We even get a copy of the notes from the digital whiteboard sync to our OneNote notebook. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany of the parents were not sure about the cameras, because of piracy concerns, but they will be used this year as a test. I like it, because it helps us to playback what the teacher taught. Plus it keeps a record of what the teacher said in class. So they have to behave also.</span> </div>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth our parents: my mom and Hannah\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dad, was in the middle school office. They forgot to bring our birth certificates to complete our registration. One would think that they could use last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s records, but they had a new system.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah and I were with the other 15 parents and their children that had other issues that kept them from going to their first period. No one was happy being stuck there. The parents had places to be, and their kids wanted to be anywhere but here.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp front, my mom and Hannah's dad was complaining about having to wait. They were fighting with each other on who should go first. They seem to care more about getting to work, then getting us into school. Or it may have to do with the fact that our parents are in the same room for more than five minutes,  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never seen two people that dislike each other that much. Even children as young as five know how to behave better than our parents do, and that is when they are at their worst.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems the only thing those two agree on was they did not want to be at school over a silly thing that could have waited for another time. However, the school made it clear, no birth certificate, no school.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt bugged my mom, who was a little impatient today, that she had to physically and personally hand them my birth certificate. Well, she could have given it to me, but she doesn't want me to see it. I'm guessing it has to do with my father.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><span class=\"cgreen\">Are those your parents fighting with each other?</span></b>\" A high school girl asked Hannah and me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><span class=\"cviolet\">Yah, they have always hated each other,</span></b>\" Hannah said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><span class=\"cblue\">It's been that way ever since Hannah moved next door to me when I was five,</span></b>\" I said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the last house available on the block, and since that first day. our parents hated each other. I sometimes think that they might have known each other before that, but could never tell. They told us that they never knew each other, and wish they never have to talk to each other. They never did explain why they hated each other. Or why they wanted me and Hannah to be friends.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><span class=\"cgreen\">I thought you two were brother and sister,</span></b>\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><span class=\"cviolet\">Well...that is the way we feel about each other,</span></b>\" Hannah said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><span class=\"cblue\">And we're best friends,</span></b>\" I said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><span class=\"cviolet\">Best Friends! We even joke about being twins since we share the same birthday,</span></b>\" Hannah said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><span class=\"cblue\">Seven minutes apart</span></b>!\" I said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm the oldest. But Hannah acts like she is. Hannah says that girls mature faster than boys, so she's actually older. It's only seven minutes...so I caved and let her win...like I always do.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><span class=\"cgreen\">I don't have any sisters. And my dad is going to have the son he has always wanted. My parents got divorced a few months ago so he can marry his mistress. They fight a lot, but they don't hate each other. They even forgave each other. But your parents!...argue just for the fun of it,</span></b>\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe high school girl started to cry but stop when she noticed the tears running down her face. Both Hannah and I try to comfort her. She did not seem embarrassed to cry in front of us. Maybe it was because we have a similar situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave her a clean handkerchief that I had. You never know when you need one. Maybe a girl might be in need of one. But I just use to blow my nose.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><span class=\"cviolet\">They do that all the time,</span></b>\"  Hannah said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><span class=\"cblue\">But only if they are breathing the same air,</span></b>\" I said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><span class=\"cgreen\">Why do they hate each other?</span></b>\" the girl asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><span class=\"cviolet\">It's a mystery. But Tanner and I think it's because they use to know each other.</span></b>\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><span class=\"cblue\">But they denied knowing each other before that day Hannah moved next door,</span></b>\" I said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><span class=\"cviolet\">We never did get your name,</span></b>\" Hannah said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><span class=\"cgreen\">I'm Katie.</span></b>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe explain to Katie that our parents refuse to tell us about my father, and her mom. We even stress the fact that they never allowed us to see our birth certificates. Katie told us that her mom showed her birth certificate long ago. Katie thinks it's odd that our parents don't want us to see our birth certificates.  </span></div></div>",

Every other parent knew how to behave themselves. The principal only had to come out of her office to discipline Hannah's father, and my mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought it was a student at first. But when she saw our parents she knew she was in for a long morning. She made sure that everyone knew that our parents were acting like stubborn children. Then she told them that they will be last in line. That did not make them happy, but they realize they were being childish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHannah and I were at the other end of the office with Katie. We wanted to be as far away as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie asked what we thought about the new school. We told her about the tour that we went on last month. It turned out she was there also but was in the ninth grade group, that had their tour an hour earlier.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katie! Hannah and I are taking AP classes this year. And we get high school and college credit.\" I said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to impress her for some reason. And I did not know what else to talk about. Hannah's usually better at conversations than I am.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too. My mom likes that I'm earning college credits at the same time.\" Katie said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of us share the same two classes: Creative writing 303 (AP) and Pre-calculus (AP). Though, we did have other AP classes as well. Katie liked that we  shared classes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie smiled at me. \"Maybe you and I can study together?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy face turned red\u2014only a little red. Of course, Hannah had to make fun of me. Katie whispered something into Hannah's ear and they both started laughing. They both would not tell me what was so funny. Girls! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe only eighth-grade class we had was history. All the other were AP classes over in the High School section. But Hannah and I were still technically middle schoolers. I think Hannah and I are the only middle school students that have AP classes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter we graduate early, the school has a special college program that allows us to take AP classes at the school. Some are online, but others are in a classroom. It's free and allows us to get some of our basic credits out of the way before transferring to a university or community college.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two can eat with me at lunch. I'll make sure everyone is very nice to you.\" Katie said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah and I were a little disappointed since we could not eat with our eighth-grade friends. But our class schedule just did not allow for us to eat at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Other day in her room we were talking about how excited we were about taking these advanced courses. She started to cry. She was afraid that she would lose touch with her friends.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI told her that we still had after school, cheerleading, and there was also the weekends. I reminded her that her friends live close to us. I reminded her that I was her best friend and that I would be here for her whenever she needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm the only boy she allows to see her cry. Not that I see her cry that often. She thanked me and hugged me very tight for a long time. I wiped some of her tears and told her that everything will be fine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

High school and middle students started school at the same time, except elementary starts at around 9:00 PM. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy father and Miss Abigail, Tanner's mother, started to argue. They were arguing about having to wait for the meeting with the principal. They did not like that Tanner needed an afterschool program for P.E. We didn't need the afterschool program\u2014it was just the best solution. One that both me and Tanner preferred.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie brushed some of her black hair from her eyes. I like how the midnight blue highlights were only on the hair in the front. She let some of her hair hide her chess, the rest was in the back. I wished my hair as long as hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie looked over at our parents. She told her that even after what her dad did, that both she and her mom forgave him. They are even friends on \"speaking terms\"\u2014her words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If your parents hate each other, why do they allow you to be friends,\" Katie asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few weeks ago, Miss Abigail took me and Tanner to get new clothes. We both enjoy shopping together. It's almost like a mother-daughter bonding activity. I never knew my mom, but if I could choose any mom, it would be her. I just wish she and my dad will get along. Grow Up already!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanner hates to shop for clothes. Or maybe he just hates spending hours picking out clothes. So I thought I make it fun and put on a modeling show for him. I also made him do a little modeling too. His mom took lots of pictures. I knew he had a lot of fun. But he'll never tell anyone he did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI helped Tanner to pick clothes that had style. Katie told me he looked very cute in what he was wearing today\u2014I told him so. I think she likes him but she doesn't feel ready for a relationship. Personally, I think they should be friends for awhile. No use breaking up in a few weeks and not being able to stay friends. What a waste! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanner surprised me by picking out an outfit for me. He may not know what he should wear, but I think he knows what he likes to see girls in. Though, I did have to change it a bit. But for the most part, he was spot on. I'm even wearing the outfit today, except I have a different top on. The other top goes better with tomorrow's  outfit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I knew. His mom likes me. We even went clothes shopping a few weeks ago. She helped me pick out bras, something my dad doesn't feel comfortable doing.\" I said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her dad does not like any boy she might bring over. What father would. But he likes me. We both hate sports, but we do talk about cool technology. Like the super battery that he is currently working on. It has about 20 times the energy density as a regular battery, and can be charged to 80 twice as fast.\" Tanner said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanner was trying to impress Katie, who surprisingly, was impressed with what he was talking about. She even understood what he was saying. Her eyes were fixed on him. And I noticed her smile more when Tanner and she were talking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie could not understand why our parents would bond with the other's child but still hate each other. We told her that our parents encouraged us to be friends.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes I think her dad is my real dad. But why keep it a secret?\" Tanner asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe they are your parents,\" Katie said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why would they keep that from us?\" I repeated.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a mystery,\" Katie said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanner and I have always joked about being twins. The more Katie talked about it, the more me and Tanner thought it was possible. We need to get our hands on our birth certificates.  </span></div></div>",

We do look alike. There was that one time when we were eight, I convinced him to dress like me. Convinced? Well, more like highly encourage. He did not have a choice. And I also dressed like him just for the fun of it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe was even able to fool both of our parents for the day. My dad almost took him shopping for new girl clothes. His mom wanted me to go with her to get my haircut. They were not so happy when we told them that we switched places. They did think it was a little cute. But made us promise never to do it again\u2014we didn't listen. Today, I do not think we be able to pull it off. You can tell that I'm a girl. And Tanner's voice can no longer pass as a girl.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI would like to see if we could switch places and fool our parents again. Though, Tanner has no desire to pretend to be a girl. So I'm going to have to trick him into doing it somehow. And it would be fun to have a sister. I'm just teasing. But I think it's still possible.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is they anything you can think that might suggest that you are twins,\" Katie said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we do have these dreams about being twins. I had one last night.\"  I said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I also had one last night. I was going to tell you about it later,\" Tanner said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe both had dreams about being twins on the same night? Not possible. We never went into detail about our twin dreams. Now I wish I had. Maybe we always had them on the same night. Maybe we even shared the same dream. I need to get with him later and see how much our dreams match up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tanner, in last night's dream, where did we go after school ended?\" I said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, in my dream, you dragged me down to cheerleading. You needed me to try out with you. When it was time for our tryouts, we both were suddenly wearing cheerleading outfits.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And they didn't noticed that you were wearing the female version,\" I said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI really want to see him in a cheerleading outfit. I think he'll look cute.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don\u2019t know what a male version looks like. Anyway, then we made the team, but I did not want to join the team.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then they told us they needed us to be on the team together because we were twins,\" I said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then they promised me a male version if I will join, after laughing at me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two did shared the same dream!\" Katie said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think it is possible we are twins?\" I asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hannah and Tanner, what more proof do you need. Those are twin names.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I could choose anyone to be my sister or twin, I would pick you Hannah.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Tanner, I would pick you too, even over a twin sister.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then it's settle, you two are twins. Not only do you two share dreams, but your parents encouraged you both to be friends.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie's right. What parents would spend so much time with a child that is not theirs. Especially a child who's parent you hate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm heard that twins have a unique bond,\" Katie said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't believe they would keep this a secret from us. But everything else seems to fit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"But we still need proof. Then we need answers,\" Tanner said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should try to get a DNA kit. They sell them at Walgreens and Walmart, but you have to send them in to get tested. You can test each other, and it's under $100. And they even email you the results.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or we can get ahold of our birth certificates, and save $100,\" Tanner said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanner is right. We don't need to waste $100, if we can see our birth certificates. The DNA test will be Plan B. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We did not want a buddy. It made us feel like we were little kids that needed a big brother or sister to look after us.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be both your buddies.

For a moment they were quiet. Then they started to laugh again. <i>Why am I being left out in the cold?</i> I know it has to do with me.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is so funny?\" I said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing!\" Both the girls said at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! Don't leave me out in the cold. If we are going to be friends, I need to be part of the inside jokes. Come on, it's not fair.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine Tanner!\" Hannah said, \"Katie tell him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!

Because...I think we should...should just be friends.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew my face was very red. And of course, Hannah had to point it out. She forgot that Katie blushed also.<i>Katie thinks I'm cute. What does that mean?</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop teasing him. They'll be a day when a cute boy will make you turn red. And you wouldn't want Tanner to laugh at you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah apologized. She said that Katie was not the only girl that thought I was cute. But she wouldn't tell me their names. Only that they don't go to this school.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like your blue dress. And your hair.\" I said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer light blue dress when just below her knees. She had to wear a matching darker blue short sleeve shirt because her dress had straps and was a little low cut.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer long black hair had little bits of dark blue highlights. Her highlights gave her hair a little personality. It was just noticeable if you were looking. She allowed some of her hair to hang in front.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Tanner, you look great too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hannah helped me to pick it out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He would be lost without me. I told him I'll help him look good for girls,\" Hannah said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's working,\" she smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Katie. Hannah explained it to me. Sometimes, girls think boys are cute, but only want to be friends. I like that we are friends now. Maybe...you can help me out with girls this year.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure...I guess...I can help you. A nice boy like you, what girl would not want you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wondered if I and Katie can go out and do something fun. Maybe as friends. We just met, but I think she would  be a fun girl to hang out with.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She and Hannah were talking about girl things. I heard something about clothe shopping. Katie smiled at me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there something you want to ask me?\" Katie said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katie, now that we are friends and all. I was wondering if maybe...we can go out and do something fun...you know, as friends.\" I said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie was silent for awhile. My heart was beating. And I don't know why. It was only a PG-date. Just friends hanging out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...don't know. I have to think about it,\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah gave me a hug from behind me. \"I'm proud of you Tanner. You finally asked a girl out. And she is a ninth grader,\" Hannah said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas she teasing me or being nice? I was blushing again. But at this point, I did not care. But Hannah did not point it out this time. Maybe, she was being nice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a real date\u2014just a PG-date. I thought she and me can go out and do something fun.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A PG-date?\" Katie asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A PG-date is when a boy and girl go out just for fun as friends. You can dress up nice if you want. But there is no pressure or expectations and no kissing,\" Hannah said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard some girls talk about that. I liked that idea. Having fun without having to worry about being boyfriend and girlfriend,\" Katie said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Katie, how about it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie was about to tell me her answer when her mom came rushing into the room. She had a meeting with the principal about Katie. She was holding lots of papers. What is it was this school and paperwork? It is a 21 century school, you think you can submit your paperwork electronically.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Making friends already. I knew you would,\" Her mom said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie's mom changed her name back to her maiden name after the divorce. Katie's last name is James.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're eight graders, but they are taking AP classes. We share pre-calculus and writing,\" Katie said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You watch out for them,\" Miss Parker told her daughter in a light-hearted voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already told them I would,\" Katie said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah and I explained to Miss Parker about the buddy system. And we also suggested to her about changing the title from \"Buddy\" to \"Companion\". \"Buddy\" seems so childish. It was not like we needed one anyways. But if we have to have one, then we wanted Katie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hugged her daughter and told her she loved her. Then she walked into the principal's office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Tanner. What did you have in mind?\" Katie said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was jumping for joy inside. But decided to not let on how excited I was in case she thought this was more than two friends hanging out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we can eat pizza.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as we can get extra sauce.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Extra sauce! That\u2019s my favorite!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can order the pizza and eat it at my house. I'm working on a coding project?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You code? I can tell we are going to be great friends.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah doesn't like to code so she left us to talk. She went over to her father for a few minutes. Katie and I talked about our coding skills. She knows things I don't and I know things she doesn't. No need to bore you with those details. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI told her about the game I wanted to make. She's told me that she was learning to write apps, and wants to learn about game design. She offered to help me to design it. It is a big project. And if she wants to spend time with me helping me, I'm not going to object.</span></div></div>",

I find coding boring. But I do know a little about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have a website and I like to customize it. I don't need to ask Tanner every time I need help changing something.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think Katie likes Tanner. And I mean more than friends. Before he asked her out, Katie and I were talking. She told me that she thought that Tanner was a nice boy. But she was not ready to date. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did not want to ruin a good friendship before it began. I suggested putting Tanner in the Friend Zone. Katie just wanted real friends. Not a boy that she will break-up within a few weeks or months. And she did not want to break Tanner's heart. She thinks he is a nice boy. He deserves better than that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie and I noticed that Tanner was mumbling something to himself. I told Katie he was just rehearsing something. I joked that Tanner was going to ask her out. Tanner? No way. He is not that bold.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Katie agreed to pizza with Tanner. They learned they both know how to code. So I let those two lovebirds alone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went over to talk to my father. I told him a little bit about Katie and how Tanner liked her. He even praised him for getting a date with a ninth grader. Just like a father would. I had to explain it was not a real date. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My boy has a date with a ninth grader! I knew girls would like a nice boy like him.\" His mom said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy father looked over at Heather. He suggested to her that maybe Katie needs Tanner and many boys in her life. It was not true. All Katie needed was someone to love her. Not for someone to suggest that she gives herself away.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know my father. And he would never want anyone to call me that word. And I called him out on it. But quietly, because I didn't want Katie or Tanner to hear.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was about Tanner's mom. He was suggesting that Heather was that...not Katie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Typical Sebastian. Just because Katie wants to spend time with my son, doesn't mean she's a...\" she said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Heather, you should know,\" my dad said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they started to argue. And I left those two alone. No sense in talking to them when they are like that. If only I knew why.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have been here for over an hour,\" my dad said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanner's mother got up and went to the front desk.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are wasting my time.  I have more important places to be than being stuck here with him,\" Miss Abigail said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman at the desk leaned forward, She said it in a very calm voice, \"I need you two to calm down. The principal will be with you shortly. Then you two can leave.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew she wanted to tear into them. She told both of them to sit down and wait to be called on. Then she went back to her typing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm not sure why they just did not let them complete their paperwork and throw them out. If they are going to act like children they are going to be treated like children.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remember my father doing the same to me when I was little. I was six and I wanted him to take me to get some pizza. But I kept on bugging him. And he told me that I needed to wait till he was ready. And the longer I through a fit, the longer it took. Tanner told me a similar story with his mother.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy dad and Miss Abigail went back to their seats. They quietly started to argue over something. So I left them alone so that I did not have to hear them.</span></div></div>",

We told her that he was just not able to see what he had right in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Lily is about ten years younger that Andrew. Katie believes that Lily was the one that convinced her father to move 45 minutes away to Scottsdale, Arizona where he was born. She believes that Lily hates her, and doesn't want her to come between her and their son. And I can totally see that.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie felt betrayed by her father when she found out what he did. At first she did not want to believe it, but after her mom told her, she cried for a long time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears were running down Katie's face. She couldn't help it. I know the feeling.
