            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It is a beautiful Saturday afternoon out on the farm; everything has finally been situated after the move. School is almost over for summer break. You looked though the barn and are now heading past the machine shed. You notice a funny seam on the back of shed in the shape of a door.  You push on it and it opens up.  Inside you find a light switch and it reveals a machine that has two pods with their doors open and a computer stand in the middle. The machine has been turned on so somebody has been in here. Inside each pod is a chair, a bright light on the ceiling and a big red button on the inside wall. There is an old green notebook on the floor that says simply \"Instructions\" on it. You bend over to pick it up, but are startled by catching a reflection of yourself in the mirror in the corner of your eye.  You walk over to it, you are:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You wonder who was in here. You turn around and pick up the note book off the floor. You glance through it. It is all hand written and it has basic instructions on how to turn on the machine and operate it. It has a number of pages which list various experiments that the creator of the machine had tried. It seems that the machine is supposed to be a mind switching machine, you laugh to yourself, looks like a pile of garbage from a bad sci-fi show to you. You sit in one of the pods and read on. You see experiments of transferring person to person, person to animal, animal to animal.<br>\r\nAt the end of some of the experiments various notes were highlighted the ones that stood out to you were:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Do not excessively use the memories of the person you transfer too, the more you pull them up, the easier these memories are to access and the harder your memories become to access. Let your memories seat themselves into your new body after they are imprinted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Do not jump from body to body; try to return to your body because memories from each different body maybe transferred with each jump. Your original memories become weaker each time they are imprinted. Return to your body for a week or two to strengthen your original memories if you transfer bodies and original memories weaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Be careful jumping into animal bodies, animals have limited memory access and instincts are very strong, the machine has a problem transferring all memories to simpler animals. Subjects in animals with simpler brains have problems accessing imprinted memories. Animals with complex brains are ideal, be careful to access your memories not the animals memories until your memories are seated, accessing animal memories may cause animals memories to come to surface and you may be overwhelmed by the animals original memories. In case of loosing subjects imprinted memories subject may need to transfer back to original body for a week or two to recover original memories<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Animals in human body utilize that human body's memories as well as their own memories.  Animals will be disorientated at first, but the longer they are in human form the more of the host body's memories they will acquire.  Most test subjects were quite cooperative in transferring back to their original bodies.  The longer they are in human form the more they start believing they are that human. Further down the page a little warning: Animal subject #9 resisted being transferred back to original body.  Claims it was really a human. Had to use force to get back into pod. Animal subject #9 not to be used for further research<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are many experiments, listed modifications to the machine problems and fixes until they stop half way through the notebook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep reading away, you wonder what happened to the original people who owned the farm. Just then the pod door closes you jump up and the lights get bright.  There is a brilliant flash of light.  It feels like you are being ripped from your body by this light.  Looking back you can see your body falling almost like a doll back into the seat with the notebook sliding out of your bodies seemingly lifeless hands. You try to go back, but can't.   It feels like you are caught in a hot dry wind that is carrying you away. You see another figure ahead of you. Colliding with this silouett  for a second you feel you are part of someone else, but the light pulls you through them. The sensation is so strange.  It feels like the figure that collided with you took something of you with it and you took part of it.  The light is so intense you can't see anything, but now you feel like your falling.  Being carried down by the light for a brief instant you think you see another body, but it isn't yours.....</span></div></div>",

What is going on here.   <br>\r\nShe must have access to a time machine to you think, but how is this possible?   Course you just switched bodies so this is very possible!   She must be trying your life on to see if she really likes it.  She has approximate conception times for your kids.  What is her plan?  Hmmmm look at these stock pages, maybe you should take them.

You make a choice for her and she loves it. She hugs you and you hug her back. That's when you suddenly hear two people shouting. You quickly make your way upstairs where you see your son and daughter arguing. They're just little children. You think as you sort the mess out. They both apologize to the other and return to their room. A slight shock came upon you as you hear your son say: Sorry mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom, they called you their mom. How great that feels to hear. You quickly rub a tear away as you realize this is what you always wanted. No more alone, having a family surrounding you. Better than being stuck in that manor, though you miss your expensive clothes. You're now just wearing a pair of jeans, sneakers and a sweater. Not really sexy or stylish. But perhaps you could change that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost time to make dinner but you were also curious about the clothes you had at your disposal. What to do first?</span></div></div>",

Your voice sounds different, like what you hear from recordings,  Now you realize that's how your voice really does sound.  \"You like my body?  It has quite the sex drive, It's been that way since high school.

Come on Liz.... you can't really be that dense.  We switched places with one of my Dads inventions!\" Misty in your old body says as she pulls canvass covers off of other contraptions around the lab.  \"I wondered where he hid these before he disappeared.\"<br>\r\nShe pulls the canvass off of giant metallic circle wrapped in Copper wires with a small stand next to it.  \"This was supposed to be his time machine, he wanted to go back in time switch places with people and prevent disasters from happening, but it never happened.  He disappeared before he succeeded in his dream.\"<br>\r\nShe turns and looks at you, \"Wouldn't it be nice to go back in time and fix things that went wrong in our lives.  We could use the time machine go back  to certain points in our lives and make them turn out the way they should have.   I could marry a good guy.  You could go back and not be such a geek-et, goody goody back before you got married.  You could learn to live and have fun.  We could go back and fix each others lives!

Help me get my life on track.....\"  She sobs harder.  \"People think I'm the town tramp I can't get rid of that reputation in the present, but if you won't go back in time and help me, please.... please help me find a good guy and keep him.  Be me for awhile and help get me on track.\"<br>\r\n\"I've done so many bad things, from porno's to prostitution.

There's a few things that could be done to help with my \"reputation\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n -What do you want me to do about it, Misty ?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n -Well, first of all, if we want this to work, from now on we'll have to call each<br>\r\n other by the body's name. Starting now, <i>you</i> are Misty Davis, the town's<br>\r\n worst citizen i guess , and i'm Liz Parker, everyone's sweetheart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz had a strange feeling : despite the fact that they had found the machine by<br>\r\naccident, she felt like Misty was actually enjoying being Liz, that there was<br>\r\nmore to the change than just solving her problems...She quickly tossed the<br>\r\nthought aside. Misty had always been supportive of her, and she had no<br>\r\nreason to doubt her willingness to change her reputation. And Liz somehow<br>\r\nfelt a thrill at having the chance to be someone else, even if it meant enduring<br>\r\nremarks thrown at Misty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-All right, <i>Liz</i>, what do you want me to do ?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n -Well, my main weakness has always been men. So if for some reason I became<br>\r\n more...well, let's say stable on the matter, i guess my reputation would get <br>\r\n better !<br>\r\n<br>\r\n -And how do you plan to accomplish that ?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n -Well, that's where YOU come in, my friend. The thing is, now that <i>I</i> am married<br>\r\n to Kyle, there'll be no problem for me to satisfy my...hmm needs. You'll just need to<br>\r\n lay low as me for a couple of weeks, and I'll be fine and we'll switch back !<br>\r\n<br>\r\n -WHAT ? You want to stay as me for weeks ?! And have sex with my husband no less ?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n -Hey girl, as far as he's concerned, Kyle will just be with his wife like nothing ever<br>\r\n happened...and for the duration, let's say a month. I think it'll be enough to make everything<br>\r\n better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n -Well...i really love Kyle and i don't want to do that to him, but if it means so much to you,<br>\r\n i'll be Misty Davis for the next month, and you'll be Liz Parker. But you'll need to know some<br>\r\n things about me not to mess everything up !<br>\r\n <br>\r\n -Same for you ! Even if i'm a single mom, i still have a kid to care about, and we don't want<br>\r\n Zack to get suspicious, do we ?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n -I guess you're right...Let's work on a list of things to know about each other during the day !<br>\r\n We'll lay low for now, meet up here during the night and starting tomorrow, we'll be able to<br>\r\n fool everyone !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz was starting to get into this. Even if she loved her husband and kids, she had wanted a <br>\r\nbreak from her life for a long time...to be free again would be an amazing feeling, she thought.<br>\r\nAnd being the town's \"resident bad girl\" was also sort of exciting, even if she knew it wasn't<br>\r\ngoing to be all positive. And Misty...well, she was a couple of years older than Liz, but Liz<br>\r\nhad always been jealous of her. She always thought she had kind of a dull, \"girl next door\"<br>\r\nkind of look, even if it was absolutely false. Misty, on the other hand, had a sophisticated, <br>\r\n\"Playmate of the month\" kind of look that added to her excitement. And SHE, not Misty,<br>\r\nwas going to be able to \"show it off\" for the next couple of weeks. In a way, even if she<br>\r\ndisapproved of Misty's behaviour with men, she understood why Misty \"flaunted\" her assets<br>\r\nlike that. In addition to her glorious breasts, she also had a face that showed almost no<br>\r\nsigns of time, with only slight wrinkles on the corner of her eyes, and long flowing blond<br>\r\nhair that Liz had also admired for a long time.<br>\r\nIt was gonna be a good couple of weeks, after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty, even if she kept a neutral face, was beaming inside. She quickly sensed that Liz<br>\r\nwas getting into her idea more and more. Misty had actually insisted on staying swapped,<br>\r\nbut she had a different agenda than what she told Liz. She went from man to man because<br>\r\nshe had never found someone that could match her criteria fully. But since the Parkers <br>\r\nsettled in the neighbourhood, she had found someone she thought was her match made in<br>\r\nheaven : Kyle Parker. She had quickly tried to \"seal the deal\" while Liz was away, but<br>\r\nKyle politely declined, saying he was in love with his wife and that it wasn't going to change.<br>\r\nThis situation actually increased Misty's interest because she knew that once she made Kyle<br>\r\nhers, she could keep him forever.<br>\r\nThen, a couple of days ago, she remembered that her dad once told her about his invention : he<br>\r\nhad built a body-swapping machine, but she tought it had been destroyed until she saw Liz<br>\r\nin the barn uncovering it. She quickly pushed her in and made up this story about her \"reputation\",<br>\r\nand hoped a month would be a sufficient time for her to come up with a plan to knock Liz out of the<br>\r\npicture. Maybe she could destroy the machine and tell everyone that <i>poor lil' Misty</i> had lost it..?<br>\r\nBut for now, she had to learn more about Liz's habits...she couldn't let anyone know about the swap,<br>\r\nand especially not Kyle.<br>\r\nWhen Liz suggested the \"list\" thing, Misty thought it was too good to be true ! Between the memory<br>\r\ntransfer the machine induced and this list, she'd have everything she need to step into her new life<br>\r\nas Liz Parker without anyone suspecting. And hey, maybe Liz would actually enjoy being her ?!<br>\r\nShe had enough of her life, enough of her buxom blonde body...nobody even took her seriously with<br>\r\nher stripper breasts !!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-You're welcome to my life if you like it...\" she finally muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-What did you say, Misty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-Careful ! Don't let your mind slip again, <i>Misty</i> ! Understood?<br>\r\n -Yes Mis...yes Liz !<br>\r\n -All right ! I'm gonna go back to <i>my</i> husband, he should be back from the railroad by now. We'll meet<br>\r\n up at midnight here tonight, okay?<br>\r\n -Okay ! Don't forget to tell Zach to come back home, he must still be playing with <i>your</i> son Darryl while<br>\r\n he should be doing his homework.<br>\r\n -Don't go too hard on him, i'm kind of a \"cool mom\" type so...<br>\r\n -Okay, I'll try not to push him too hard...but tell him i went by anyway !<br>\r\n -Will do ! See you later, <i>Misty</i> !<br>\r\n -See you later, <i>Liz</i> !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth women went home happy, but one of them was starting to hatch her plan...into a more permanent stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Shaking your head you begin laughing to yourself.<br>\r\nWhile you study your notes you finish making a magnificent dinner.  You've never made anything like this, but it seems kind of natural.  Must be the benefit of being in Liz's body and some of her latent memories.  It is strange how Martha Stewart you are becoming, you are even beating Liz at her own game you think as you taste the main course.  The strangest thing is you are actually enjoying it doing all this domestic stuff, something you dreaded as Misty.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou poke your head out the door and yell, \"Dinner time!\" as you place the last of the courses out on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk back into the kitchen and actually begin planning meals for the week when Katy come into the kitchen.  \"Hey MOM!\" Katy says very sarcastically.  \"Are you going to help me with my project, MOM.\"  She looks you in the eyes and asks, \"You remember that idea you had....MOM?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething is up, She must know!  Keep calm Misty you think to yourself.  How could she know you weren't really Liz. Act calm.  What would Liz do, just act like Liz would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry Katy, I totally forgot about the project, tell you what after dinner I'll check on Li...err Misty and make sure she's doing ok and then you have my undivided attention.\" you say biting your lip you can't believe you almost blew not now when you are so close.</span></div></div>",

I try and take care of you, you are like a sister to me,\" Misty says with a toothy smile.  \"But Kyle thinks your pretty worthless and doesn't know why I keep you here.  I know you had a hard night whoring around the town last night and who knows whose bed you woke up in before you came home early this morning...\"<br>\r\nMisty stops lecturing you as the kids come in. \"Just shape up, remember we not only give you room and board, but we pay you....Just do your job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi kids, Hurry up and eat...We have to get you to school,\" Misty says as she looks at you. Then her features turn more stern, \"You smell like a distillary, I don't imagine you are in any condition to drive.\"  <br>\r\nLooking at her watch Misty blurts out, \"Hurry up kids time to go, Mommy will take you to school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they all head out the door, you can hear Danielle say, \"Why do you put up with her Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's got nobody else, she's just a washed up whore who has nobody,\"  Misty replys<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle's comment for some reason hurt you a lot more then anything Misty would say.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting at the dinner table you look at the dirty dishes with the half eaten breakfasts on them.  <br>\r\n\"This isn't my life, I have to fix this,\" you blurt out. 'But how, how do I fix this?' You think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First step is you have to stop sleeping around\" <br>\r\nYou jump from the sound of the voice and almost fall.  Two strong arms catch you.  Looking up you see it is Kyle.  Everything feels so right in his arms, like this is where you belong.  Like you should belong to him.  The business suit doesn't do much to hide his muscular physique. He picks up his brief case grabs a cup of coffee and continues.  \"I don't know why Misty puts up with you, she is a saint, I would have fired you a long time ago.\"  He shakes his head, \"Just straighten up and fly right before its too late Liz. You should go clean yourself up.\"  With that he leaves the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis words cut into you. <br>\r\nYou feel so low now, you have such a crush on him and he's married to your best friend.  Holding your head, you have a terrible hang over, you can smell the booze and cheap perfume emanating from you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing up to your shower you strip down and you see your tattoos.  There is a large scarlet \"A\" right above your vagina, with \"For Deposit only\" written in a arch in a semi circle around it.  Above that is written \"Cum in me\" and \"Grade A Whore\" with the A also scarlet.  There are a number of designs on your body. You run your finger across the spider web tatoo on your left breast.  Looking in the mirror in the shower you can see \"Whore\" and \"Cum Dumpster\" written on your lower back.  Then you notice on your vaginal lips on side is written \"Slut\" and other \"F...\"   There are hundreds of little horizontal lines tattoo's down the outer part of your legs that are supposed to represent notches for every guy you have slept with, there are so many you can't even count. Feeling tears start to form in your eyes as you think about who you are,  This can't be your life.  A whole flood of memories of all the guys you have been with.  You can't even count, plus working at the cheap \"Gentleman's club\" in town.  Your stage name is \"Dirty Liz\" and to honest your days there might be numbered, you can't bring in the cash like you used to so you've been going to the truck stop late at night working as a lot lizard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing into the shower you feel the warm water flow down your body, the soap doesn't seem to wash the smell of cigarettes, cheap perfume and booze off of you.  You feel so low, you look at your purse sitting on the chair, you could really use good drink from your flask.  Then thoughts of how good you feel with a  buzz going and getting a little action in bed.  Then you stop and start to cry, \"This can't be my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Misty walks into the bathroom and starts to talk to you. \"Liz it's OK, don't worry I won't let Kyle get rid of you.  You were my maid of honor, you sang at my wedding and I will always watch out for you.  I wouldn't want you to wind up like Samantha, You girls went wild in high school it was like you were possessed or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty hands you a towel as you get out of the shower. \"Give me a hug Liz.\"  You hug each other.  \"Now girl, get cleaned up and we will go grocery shopping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Misty you say, \"I wish I had your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Now, Liz...We can't all be as lucky as me.\" Misty says with a big knowing smile. \"Now lets get ready.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'll be back by 4.\" She concluded, leaving with an air of superiority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz enjoyed the peace and quiet of the empty estate, quietly humming to herself as she went from room to room. Then she realized there was absolutely no reason to be so quiet about it. She put her cleaning track on, dancing to the beat as she entered the kitchen. Somebody had used a hedge-clipper, left the dirty thing on the counter. Kyle wouldn't like his stuff lying about like that. This obviously belonged in the shed. She grunted, picking it up. No choice but to face the horribly bright and uncomfortable outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving borrowed a pair of boots and an ancient looking wind-breaker, she cautiously stepped over to the shed. It looked like rain, but walking any faster was impossible in these boots. They must be Kyle's. A warm feeling crept trough her belly, thinking about him. It was swirling, twisting. Unsure where to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe focused on the shed, pushing the emotions away again. No sense in running with a giant pair of scissors anyway. Once inside, she easily found the empty spot on the wall an clamped the hedge-clipper back into place. Just then, the mother of all rainstorms broke out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Typical\" She said, staring out the open gateway, she could barely make out the house through the thick downpour. \"No way I'm going through that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWandering through the shed, she went looking for a comfortable place to sit and check on her phone until most of the storm had passed. She pulled the canvas off of a giant metallic circle wrapped in Copper wires with a small stand next to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god.\" she gasped through open fingers, recognition in her voice as she looked over the panel. \"The old bastard build a fucking time-machine...\"</span></div></div>",

Her smoking, drinking and other activities left you out of breath as you attempted to sprint the room to catch your old self.  What surprises you is the all this action is turning you on.  What is going on!  You are about to orgasm!  What is wrong with this body!   Realizing you can't catch her in your current condition you leap in desperation to stop her.  It is almost a totally uncoordinated belly flop that falls painfully short, but some how the tips of your fingers end up catching her foot and tripping her.  <br>\r\n\t\u201cNO!\u201d She screams reaching towards the portal as it shuts down.

You might as well you didn\u2019t finish, you should have had fun instead of being such a stick in the mud.\u201d<br>\r\nFeeling a little hurt you say, \u201cI went out to a party once had a one night stand with Kyle I got pregnant and my life turned out pretty fantastic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe first guy you had relations with, wouldn\u2019t it have been fun to date a few people before Kyle?

If Misty wants you to make her into a new person you were going to do it right.  You even found a pair of horn rim glasses with just plain lenses to finish the look.  <br>\r\nThis time your going to surprise old Miss Klein, you will hardly need any training.  It always seemed to irritate her that you needed to be shown how to do the various tasks around the library.  Thinking about it more, you wish you were in your old body instead so you could get the credit instead of Misty for being good.<br>\r\nSo many things were racing through your mind as you walked in the door.  The other two interns haven't shown up yet.  You walk towards her standing straight almost military style with your heels clicking on the floor.  You walk straight up to Miss Klein.  She doesn't seem quite as old as you remember.  Now you think she is quite attractive.  She stands up to greet you.  She was in her late 30s or early 40s, blond, a nice build with a older sexy librarian thing going.<br>\r\n\"My name is Misty Davis and I am looking for Miss Klein, I am here to start my internship.\"  you said with a calm matter of fact voice.   Miss Klein smiles at you, \"I am Miss Klein and I am pleased to see you are early.  That is a quality that is disappearing in this day and age. <br>\r\n\"Thank you Miss Klein, I am hoping to learn allot from you if you will let me.\" Laying it on quite think.<br>\r\nYou could tell she was eating it up.  She smiles and gestures you to follow her, \"lets get started Miss Davis.\"<br>\r\nShocked, you can't believe how nice she is toward you, thinking back you always remember her as so distant and almost rude.  <br>\r\nThinking back to your first day, you remember you were late, could that have been the problem?<br>\r\nShe shows you the back room and is amazed at how fast you pick things up.  Little did she know that you had years of practice.  Smiling she says, \"Your going to do well here.  I have to go out to the desk and help the other interns, if you need any help, just come and get me.\"<br>\r\nAfter a half an hour you find you almost have everything done, you could hardly believe it, you distinctly remember your first day lasting for ever.  You didn't get done that day till almost 10:30, then you had to help the other interns Samantha and Emily finish.  <br>\r\nThis is great your done, you head out to the front and see a very angry looking Miss Klein. She looks at you and asks, \"Are you having trouble to?\"<br>\r\nSmiling you say, \"No, Miss Klein, I finished the back room and was wondering what other tasks you had for me.\"<br>\r\nWith a surprised look on her face, she goes into the back room to check on your work.  <br>\r\n'Go ahead check on it.' you think to yourself, 'it is perfect, you won't be able to tear me a new one like you did on my other first day.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a minute later she steps out with a smile. \"My my my, that is a pleasant surprise Miss Davis.  I don't have any more real tasks for you, but could you aid the two interns that are trying to place returned books on the shelf, they will explain the system to you.  Quit frankly they are having a bit of a problem with it.\"<br>\r\nWith a smile you reply,\" Yes Miss Klein I would love to help.\"  You could see her relax some and it made you feel good.  Quickly you walk towards the back, kind of excited to see a younger Samantha, maybe you could help her not make the mistakes that ruined her life too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the back you see <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After exploring the house a little you settled to your room and called Emily.  <br>\r\nYou had to call her 3 times before she finally picked up.  Once she did you could hear loud music on the otherside.  \"Emily?\" you ask not sure if you had the right number. \"Hey Misty... How's it going? You could hear Emily yelling over the noise into her phone.<br>\r\n\"I was wondering if you still wanted to work at the library with me.\"  You asked trying to figure out where she was.<br>\r\n\"I don't know Misty, I'm working at the Salon and these girls are showing me how to have fun.  I don't know if I want to work at the library that would be really boring.\"<br>\r\nThere is a pause and then she says, \"I'll think about it Misty, but the library internship is full, I asked about it.... There are a few cute college guys here I'll catch ya later.\"  Then she hangs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If Emily is working at the Salon where is the real Misty in your body working?  You got to find out.  Quickly you call try to call Misty, as the phone goes to voice mail, you realize you dialed your own phone of the body you currently occupy.  Paging through the numbers  for Elizabeth you realize your old number isn't in Misty phone.  \"Wow I see where I rank.\"  you mumble to yourself.  You start to dial your phone, but realize you can't remember the number.  \"I have had the same number since I got a phone, how can I not remember it,\"  you say to yourself with growing concern. <br>\r\n 'How am I going to get to my old house it's across town.  I'll have to call Kyle and have him give me a ride'<br>\r\nYou call Kyle up you can hear Samantha in the back ground.  \"Hey Misty,\" Kyle says.  you hear Samantha in the back ground say, \"What does she want, lets go for a walk Kyle.\"<br>\r\n\"I was wondering if you could pick me up and take me to Liz's place, I want to check on her?\" you ask.<br>\r\nKyle responds, \"Well I don't know if that is such a good idea, Liz doesn't want to talk to you.  I don't know what happened, but she even changed her phone number.  I really don't want to get involved in the situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis hit you like a ton of bricks what is she up to?  \"A.. sure.... thanks Kyle, I'll see you tomorrow.\" you tell him confused about the whole situation.<br>\r\nKyle hears the tone of your voice and says, \"You can come down here we are having pizza if you want.\"  you hear Samantha yell, \"No Kyle. this is supposed to be just us. Please don't invite her.\"<br>\r\n\"I'll think about it.\"  you say<br>\r\nYou could hear Kyle whisper to her, \"That wasn't nice.\" as you hang up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow now you have a whole bunch of things to find out, one you have to talk to Misty in your body and find out what she's up to, convince Miss Klein to hire Emily, and convince Emily to come to work at the library, get Emily to date Kyle and keep Kyle and Samantha from dating.  <br>\r\nFirst thing is to track down</span></div></div>",

After a half an hour you realize that nobody knows or else nobody will tell you for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap, Only one way to do this\", you mumble to yourself as you start walking towards your real home.   It has been a long time since you were home.  This whole situation has been a mistake, you should have never let Misty talk you into switching places with her younger self.  If anything you should have switched places with the younger version of you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst part is the more time you spend in Misty's body the more you are becoming her.  Instead of having memories of your past you are having messed up memories of what must be her past as her older self, mixed with memories of your past which makes no sense.  It should not be possible, because the young Misty hasn't done these things yet so they can't be her memories. They can't be your memories could they?  You have so many conflicting memories,  Some of you as Misty married to Kyle, some with Samantha and Kyle being married.  These must be just deep seated fears manifesting themselves as false memories you hope.  <br>\r\nAs you walk further along you think back, to your time in the future, they consist of you being such a slut in the future, basically becoming Misty.   Her mind is so messed up just the thought riding a cock makes you so wet it looks like you peed yourself.  Looking down, you sigh, \"Crap.\"  Shaking your head you decide to keep going. <br>\r\n'How can those thoughts be Misty's, this is the young Misty's body, she hasn't become a slut yet, she maybe one in making, but she isn't one at least not yet.'<br>\r\nA little before midnight you make it to your old house.  The lights are off, but you decide to ring the door bell.  <br>\r\nA light comes on and two figures come to the door.  It's your mom and dad, wow you can't believe how much you miss them, you shouldn't have let Misty talk you into taking her place in the past.<br>\r\n\"Misty...\" your mom yawns, \"what are you doing here.\"<br>\r\nYou can see your dad trying hide a baseball bat behind him as he clumsily slips it into the closet next to the door hoping you wouldn't see it.  It almost makes you laugh as you think back to your youth.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I was looking for Elizabeth, I haven't heard from her for awhile.... I lost my cell phone and got a new one and a....I don't know her number.  I was just really worried.\" you ramble.<br>\r\n\"Misty, this could have waited till morning,' Your real mom says looking a little pissed.  \"You know she's been working at the truck stop and works really late.\"  <br>\r\n\"Truck stop?\" you stammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What I don't remember working at the truck stop,' Thinking really hard, 'I have to ask Misty about this.'  'What is going!' you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom looks at your dad.<br>\r\nDad nods at your mom and says reading her thoughts, \"I'll take Misty home. let me get dressed.\"    Your mom starts writing  down a number and hands it to you, \"call her tomorrow, she works the late shift at the truck stop so call her later maybe around 3.\"<br>\r\n\"Come on night owl,\" your dad says twirling the keys in his hand as you both go to the car.<br>\r\nRiding back towards Misty's house in your families old car fond memories flow back.  If only you could spend a day as your old self, you can't believe how much you miss this.  Who would have ever  thought that you would want to spend at least one day in your boring life as a kid again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad drops you off at Misty's house, waits outside till he makes sure you get in safely and then drives off.  As you head up stairs, you realize still no sign of Misty's parents.  What is going on. Where are they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you get ready for bed, you think, tomorrow you'll try call your Misty in your body and see what she is up to, then try and convince Miss Klein to hire Emily.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It is strange, the entire time you've been in Misty's body, you haven't seen Misty's parents.  Thinking about it more, you have never seen Misty's parents, you've seen their pictures, but never have met her parents.  Do they hang out in the lab?  You never have seen them in there.  Never see them around the farm.  Who maintains the farm grounds?  Does Misty?  Do they work in another lab?  It has been handy not having them here, because you can come and go as you please and have the run of the place, but you know deep down something isn't right. 'After I get a hold of Misty and ask her some questions about what she's doing, I must ask her about her parents.'<br>\r\nAfter your shower, wash your hair, primp and get ready for your day, you sit at the table and stare at the phone number your real mom gave you. It totally does not look familiar.  Why can't you remember it?   <br>\r\nTyping it into your cell phone you want to hit the call button, but stop your self.  Doing this repeatedly for a half a hour, you actually hit the call button.    A groggy sounding \"Elizabeth\" with some strange noise in the back ground.  \"Hey Misty, I can't talk to you now, but what if we meet for breakfast.  I'll come by and pick you up.\"   <br>\r\n\"Sure, but...\" you respond,  as she hangs up. <br>\r\nHow did she know it was me?  How is she going to pick me up? What is she up to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well I'll find out I guess, this should be interesting.' thinking about what to say,  'Then off to work.'  You decide to go to the lab and see if you can find Misty's parents.  The place is empty, but you can tell somebody has been using it.  There are tools around the time machine and the pods.  Somebody has been working on it.  You hope it is Misty's parents.  You check the dates.  Then to your surprise you see a very young picture of your neighbor Rebbecca Johnson  and a whole bunch of news paper stock pages.  Looking at them closer they start two years from now and go four years past your time.  \"What is this what is going on?\"  You blurt out.  You'll have to ask Misty.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a car horn.  You go outside and see Elizabeth in a brand new car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the... HOW can I afford that?  How come I don't remember that?\"  Shaking your head, speaking out loud in shock.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over and see her in a expensive skanky outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you afford this? you ask with growing concern, <br>\r\n\"Tips are great Misty,\"  She responds, \"I make a fortune, I'll have this car paid for by the end of summer.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm Elizabeth,\" you remind her.<br>\r\n\"Get in,\" She gestures to the other door, \"you look like Misty to me, so you are Misty.\"  Your old body teases you. \" Don't worry Misty, just be Misty and keep me out of trouble.  Unless you find a good guy for me to date.\"<br>\r\nFeeling anger welling up inside, you blurt out, \"Like Kyle.\"<br>\r\n\"Sure that would rock. I would love to go out with him.\"  She says smiling at you.<br>\r\n\"Yeah I bet you would.\"  Looking straight at her. \"Is that why Kyle's working with me at the library?\"  <br>\r\n\"Yes, you should date him, before Samantha does, you know they'll never break up if they start to date.  I should have dated him this summer not Emily.  I'm just setting the time line straight.\"   <br>\r\nLooking at your old body you ask, \"Is that why you set this up?   To get Kyle? \"<br>\r\n\"The time line will straighten itself out, You'll marry Kyle, but his first love will be me or I should say you.  I will have an excellent memory of High school love, You will get the guy both times, now and the future.  Just trust me.   My parents have been trying to fix the time line for years, trying to stop major disasters, wars, accidents and they never were able to.  Trust me! \"<br>\r\n\"What about your parents Misty?  Where are they?\"<br>\r\nYour body smiles at you, \"Misty they are around, but they are very busy.  Enjoy your time in my body, date Kyle or else you will loose him to Samantha for ever.\"<br>\r\nShe stops in front of the library. \"I have to go Misty, I will see you later.\"<br>\r\n\"It's Liz, \"you respond feeling dumb that you can't drop that point.  <br>\r\nMisty in your body laughs and says, \"Look like Misty to Me.\"  <br>\r\nYou step out of the car in front of the library after shutting the door Misty speeds off.<br>\r\n\"That conversation cleared up nothing.\"  you yell throwing up your hands as you watch the car turn the corner.  \"We didn't even stop to eat.\"<br>\r\nYou don't know if you should trust her or not, but today Kyle will be working with you instead of Samantha.  Maybe you should make your move, date him stay in Misty's body and then dump him letting your old body date him.<br>\r\nWhat are you going to do.<br>\r\nFeeling frustrated you walk into the Library.  At the front desk you see a surprised look on Miss Klein's face as she looks up from a book.<br>\r\n\"Misty, my you are early, I like that.  We have a lot in common.\"  She says smiling. <br>\r\n\"Have you thought about hiring my friend Emily,\" You ask.  <br>\r\n\"Misty, you know the answer to that.  I can't hire anybody else..\"   Miss Klein says looking sincere.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It is weird, it is almost like you were pretending that you were somebody else, but in reality you were Sharon.  Your mind is so logical, it try's to reject that you could be anybody else.  <br>\r\nYou are looking through the budget and there is no money to hire Emily, you don't know how you are going to be able to do it unless you pay out of your own pocket.   Looking at both Samantha and Misty or you should say the real Sharon Klein, you feel embarrassed for them, they are two horny school girls trying to get Kyles attention. It would be so good to be young again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait... You are young... or you are the young Misty... Liz in Misty's body.. It is so confusing it makes almost no sense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch Misty.  It is funny; as Sharon you've had suitors before, but you've never actively pursued them.  Watching Sharon as Misty, you get to see a new perspective of yourself as girl that has a chance to do what she wants without any consequences.  A second chance in life, to be the girl that gets the guy she wants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize that Sharon has a Crush on Kyle a bad one.  She day dreams about asking him out, wondering if he'd go for a gorgeous cougar.  Watching the girls hit on him turns you on and you find your fingers teasing your lower areas.  Nobody knows what your are doing behind the desk, it is kind of kinky.  You realize Sharon is kind of a perv.  You start fantasizing about Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to shake your head and look down, if you don't watch it you will become Sharon Klein.  You have to call Emily then switch back as soon as possible.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe day goes on and you quickly fall into Sharon's routine.  Two hours before close you take a 15 minute break.  While siting in the break room, you notice a file in your purse and see that it is the one on  Rebecca Johnson from the lab.   You must have picked up the file at Misty's place, maybe before the switch your can't remember.  Starting to fantasize about switching with her, using the stock pages and starting over.  If this info was sitting by the body switching machine maybe somebody was planning on switching with her,  why not be you.  A new beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is going on here, I am not Sharon Klein, you have to remind yourself.  You have to get Emily hired on quickly and switch back.  These thoughts are ridiculous and now Sharon knows about the switching machine too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up the phone you dial <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Were you every that foolish when you were younger.<br>\r\nWatching Misty she seems to be hitting on Kyle just as hard as Samantha now, just another teenager in heat you guess.<br>\r\nShaking your head you throw yourself into your work.  It seems to never end. You've been off your game ever since lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunch! that is right....  Lunch with Misty. That's when... Just as you were starting to recall the events of earlier today; a man asks you for help to find some children's books.  He is tall hansom and one look at his ring finger and you know this hansom hunk was single.  It's been so long since you've been laid. So long you can't remember the last time.  You find yourself fantasizing about being in various positions with the man.  <br>\r\nAfter some heavy flirting You find his book.  He thanks you and gives you his name and phone number.  Feeling like a school girl yourself you check him out and watch his tight butt as leaves the library.  <br>\r\nHearing some giggling you turn to see Misty  and Samantha watching you.  <br>\r\nA little embarrassed you throw yourself into your work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more you work, the more you ignore your emotions and take care of your tasks at the Library, the more natural it feels.  By the end of the day you feel almost like your old self like nothing ever has happened.  You see girls still drooling over Kyle still.  Wouldn't it be nice to be young and care free again.  You laugh a little, and be that young and dumb, maybe not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening as you close up the library.  Walking to your car you reach into your purse to have a smoke.  As your purse opens up you see a file on a Rebecca girl.  The memory of going to Misty's place on your lunch come's back to you, but everything seems so far fetched, it's hard to believe to your logical brain.  It was almost like a waking day dream.  Could you really be Misty or Liz?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you ask Misty about it?  Should you stop by Misty's house to check on what that machine?   Faint memories of who you really may have been, go through your mind like recalling pieces of a dream from a couple days before.  Quickly you realize you have to get a hold of Misty switch back before you forget who you really are.  You hope you haven't done any real damage to your mind.   As you walk around back towards your car, you notice Kyle and Misty making out in the back of his car.  You wish you were the one making out with him.  Pulling out the phone number, at least your going to get a little action tonight it's been a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDriving home you call the guy and make plans to meet him for dinner and a couple of drinks.

This really scares me,  If you didn't trade places with me to help mold my personality I was afraid,  by not taking the salon job, I would be trapped as a geek-ET for ever....Thanks for helping me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty pulls out a new outfit, you can't believe she is going to put it on.  It is so slutty.  It looks like something a hooker would wear complete with fishnet stockings.  <br>\r\n\"I don't think you should be going out in that outfit in my-body.\"  staring at her outfit in disbelief.<br>\r\n\"For once in your life trust me.  I will make you more outgoing than you could ever imagine.\"  Misty says turning toward you giving you a quick wink.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I don't want to be known as a total slut,  I want to be more outgoing and social.  I was pretty much an awkward teen myself, working in the library helped me be a better student, but also made me a social pariah.  I want to climb the high school social latter without slutting my way to the top like you did.\"<br>\r\nMisty looked hurt, \"Trust me, I will make you popular, you'll shock a few people tonight, but when this is all done you will have fantastic memories from tonight.\"  Misty continues who was that guy you had such a crush on... Oh yeah, Cory!   You will remember having a nice little date with Cory after tonight.  Trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty points a finger at you.  \"You girl will sit in the corner with your shy or I should say my shy future husband and have a wonderful conversation.\"  Misty's smile gets bigger, \"and you will watch as Emily Becker comes in and begins to flirt with him.  Next thing you know, you will be all alone.  I remember this party all to well.  Now put this dress on and lets get working on both of our futures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Upon arriving at the party, Misty picked up a drink winked at you and said, \"this will be a memorable night for you I guarantee it.\" <br>\r\nShe left you behind and paraded your body in that skimpy outfit around as she socialized.  You began to wonder if you were actually changing the timeline, for one you could not remember going to this party and if you did you couldn't remember going to any party wearing something that slutty.  <br>\r\nPicking up a drink you wondered if this was a mistake.  Wandering around the party you remembered why you hated parties, especially when you hardly knew anyone here.  You tried to start conversations with people, but they would walk over and start talking with other people. I never remember parties being this bad,  Wow Misty was right she was a social pariah, nobody would talk to you as her.  It made you really sad as you began to feel sorry for her.  Finding an out of way spot, you sat down with a new drink feeling a little tipsy as you listened to the music and began watching the clock waiting to go.  Looking across the room, you noticed Kyle sitting in the corner doing the same peaking up nervously looking around.  Your heart melted, he is such a dork, why aren't any girls talking to him you wonder.   He's tall, built, muscular, just so dang shy.  You notice Emily talking to him a little.  Jealousy began course through you as they talked,  it was all you could do not to jump up and slap her. <br>\r\nThinking back you remember her breasts got huge all of a sudden towards the end of last semester and she instantly became popular.<br>\r\nMisty grabbed Emiliy's arm and began introducing her to a group of guys. <br>\r\n'What is she doing, Emily and Kyle are supposed to hook up tonight!' You watched as Emily disappeared with this fall football player toward the dance area.<br>\r\n Strangley you felt relief that she was gone until You nnoticed Samantha looking at Kyle and start walking over towards. him with two drinks.  You can't let her talk to Kyle, she would ask him out and that would change the time line.  Samantha always had a crush on Kyle.  <br>\r\nQuickly you walk over you sit down next to Kyle and begin talking to him.   Samantha gives you a dirty look as she walks by.   You pretend not to notice and start talking to Kyle.   Before you know it you both are having a fantastic conversation.  You know him so well,  it feels great to have a normal conversation in this messed up situation.  Liz is talking to the DJ and he turns up the volume.  You roll your eyes back, you are so over house parties, you just want to talk to Kyle.   Having a hard time hearing without thinking you grab his hand and lead him outside to the porch and sit in the swing.  Your old body comes outside with a couple drinks.  \"What is up party people!!!\" She says handing you both a couple of drinks.  \"The fun is inside, come back in.\" She hands you both a large drink and without  missing a beat turns around going back into the party.   \"She's a little wild tonight,\" you laugh and continue on with your conversation with Kyle.  The whole time you had to hold Misty's body in check.  Her raging hormones, making you want to kiss him or do things that you wouldn't even  do in your body when you and Kyle are married.  Hours go by and the party is ending when you realize Kyle was supposed to be inside to have Emily come over, talk to him and steal him away from you as Misty.    You bring him inside, but notice Emily is gone.  Oops this isn't good.  You look around and can't find Misty in your younger self either.  The only person you see that is familiar is Samantha who is eyeing Kyle..  You can't leave him with her around  \"Shit,\" you accidentally blurt out thinking to yourself, somehow  You have to fix this tomorrow. <br>\r\nKyle asks \"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n\"Nothing, You say taking couple more drinks from the cooler and take him back outside to the swing.</span></div></div>",

They would then date till college, when they broke up that's when you would meet him at the party and fall in love.<br>\r\nSitting with Kyle on the swing, both of you more then a little inebriated you give him a kiss, a nervous passionate kiss with all the feelings you have for him, all the nervousness that you might loose him in the future.<br>\r\nKyle looks a little shocked then he leans in and kisses you back.  Looking at the moon and the stars you think, 'if this is your only chance to be with him you better make it count'.  Before you know it you are making out with him.  Years of being married to him allows to know just what to do to get him excited.  You haven't felt this exhilarated in years. Taking his hand you lead him back to Misty's house, or your home for the time being since you are stuck in her body.  Once there you lead him to the bed and begin making out with him.   <br>\r\nBefore you know it your shirt is off and he is kissing your breasts.  <br>\r\n\"Slower I want this to last,\" you say as you feel fingers slide under your panties.  You smile as you guide his fingers to the magic spot.  Gasping, you smile at him,\"that's it, nice and slow.\"<br>\r\nKissing him softly you notice he is shaking.  You can't resist this.  He is so cute, you want him so bad.  Smiling at him you take off the rest of your clothes and strip his clothes off and sit on top of him.  You begin kissing that masculine chest of his.  You slide your aching pussy gently on to his throbbing shaft.   Slowly and carefully you begin riding it up and down cowgirl style.  You work yourself up and down slowly carefully working him deeper into your virgin pussy.  Your legs begin to shake,  you want to finish, but you can't.   He slowly rolls both of you over and begins thrusting his shaft deeper into you.  He whispers, \"Should we stop?\"<br>\r\nSmiling back at him you whisper as you thrust back, \"No, I need this so bad. Please don't stop.\"<br>\r\nHe thrusts deeper into you, it hurts so bad and so good at the same time.  The look on his face you realize he shot his load into you.  Quickly you roll both of you back over.  Where you get the strength you don't know, but you begin impaling yourself on his still erect shaft.  It's like this body of yours is on a mission.  You thrust faster and faster till every muscle in your body is about to explode.  Suddenly you can't move, your body is so tense.  Kyle thrusts up into you one last time.  It seems every muscle release at once, you let out a massive moan that turns into a scream.  You begin a number of short thrusts and collapse in a heap on top of him.<br>\r\nYou curl up tight to him and begin cuddling.  </span></div></div>",

Running your fingers slowly across his chest, you find yourself wanting to go another round with him. You are so horny, its unbelievable.  Kissing his chest you hope he wakes up and even think about sliding his morning wood inside of yourself.   As you move your leg you can feel how sore you are, but every fiber of your being wants him inside of you.  He's not waking and you want him inside you again so bad.  What is wrong with you, why are such a bad girl.  You don't want to be, but the more you try and stop yourself, the more you have to.<br>\r\nSlowly and delicately you climb on top of him and slide his manhood inside of you.  Smiling you look down at him as you realize he is trying to pretend he is sleeping.  Carefully you begin riding his shaft, but you find you are so sore that you don't know if you'll be able to pull this off.  You keep going riding him harder and harder till you are exhausted.  Every fiber of your body wants to finish, but your body isn't able. <br>\r\nAs he did last night Kyle rolls you over, your eyes locked as he holds your hands against the bed with his.  He carefully begins thrusting into you.  It is so cute he has no idea what he is doing, but looking into his eyes, you can see his inner beauty and how much he wants to please you. It makes you want him more.    This body you inhabit is almost animal, you want him and you want him now.  If only your body was up to it, you could show him what you were made of.  You find inner strength and wrap your legs around him.  You begin thrusting back, matching his moves.  It hurts so bad, but when he bottoms out he hits some spot that is just intense.  \"GIVE IT TO ME\",  you almost scream.  \"Make me.... your personal.... SLUT.  You moan out out in between thrusts.  \"Make me your private...WHORE,  TAKE ME!\"   you start moving in unison, both of your bodies sweating as you move faster.  \"MAKE ME YOURS...FOREVER!!!! You scream.  All of a sudden you gasp,  you can't breath.   Your body is so tense, your eyes locked into his. You can't move Then it releases.  as you fall back onto the bed It feels like falling back into a bed of flowers.  You realize somewhere in your love making your hands broke free and put deep scratches in his back.  You look into his eyes wanting him, only him, there is no one else for you. you want to stay like this forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turns to the door as he notices Liz leaning against the doorway eating  an apple.  \"Don't stop on my account that was beautiful,\"  she takes another bite and continues almost laughing, \"private slut... personal whore....\"  Kyle is freaking out, rolls off of you  falling to the floor, grabbing his pants and runs into the bathroom.  You couldn't notice Liz's Cheshire cat grin.  You look at Liz and you feel so hurt, it was a beautiful moment and she ruined it.<br>\r\nLiz knocks on the door frame and barges into the room. \"Hi Misty! Hi Kyle!, wow you both make a beautiful couple.\"  She winks at you and Kyle still trying to cover himself as he trys to find where his clothes had landed around the room from the night before.<br>\r\n\"I'll call you later Misty!\" He tells you as he runs out the door still trying to pull on his pants.<br>\r\n\"Well this is interesting how are we going to handle this?\" She says smiling.<br>\r\n\"Are you going to break up with him?\"<br>\r\n\"....Or you going to date him till college and we do the dating switch-a-rooo?<br>\r\nLooking at you she says, \"What if I'm pregnant?\" <br>\r\nBurying your face in your hands you try to explain, \"I don't know what happened, I lost Emily, I started talking to him and I don't know!\"<br>\r\n\"So you boinked him,\"  she says cutting you off as she sits on the bed, taking the last bite of her apple \"Makes perfect sense.\"<br>\r\nPutting her hand on your back she says, \"well what should we do, break up with him? date him? go to the future see what happens? You two do make a fantastic couple\"  with her other hand she throws the apple core across the room into the rubbish can.  \"Score!\"</span></div></div>",

A tremendous pain extrudes from you nether regions, you don't know if you'll be able to walk you are so sore.<br>\r\nYour youngerself smiles at you and quickly pipes in. \"Don't worry Misty or I should say Liz, I don't have my period at all this summer.\"<br>\r\n\"What?  Why are you telling me this?  I don't want to be dating my future husband in your body.  Your mind isn't right Misty.  All I can do is think about him, you have huge stalker tendencies.  I just want to follow him home and lay in bed with him all day!  I just want to take another roll in the hay with him even though I hurt so bad I don't think I can walk.  I don't want this body anywhere around my husband!\"<br>\r\nLooking hurt Misty in your body turns to you and says. \"Well being you isn't all that great you are a dweeb, you body is afraid of doing anything fun.  Matter of fact I went out with Cory, that guy you had a crush on all through high school.  We made out last night, how does that memory strike you.\"<br>\r\nKind of shocked, you could remember back to high school and making out with Cory, and other things Misty isn't mentioning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bitch! You slept with him!  You lost my virginity\"  You say trying jump up and slap your body.  The sharp pain causes you to collapse in a heap on the bed.<br>\r\nMisty bends over you and flicks her thick strawberry blonde hair back, \"Looks who's talking Bitch, you were awful quick to loose my virginity with Kyle and it is a wonderful memory I'll always have that now and you be able to have that holier then thou attitude.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty starts to walk to the door, \"I don't know what you want to do, but we have 3 months before our older versions of ourselves arrive after we sent them through the time gate, we better make the most of what time we have I know I will.\"  With that and a evil little smile and wink Misty walks out of the door.  </span></div></div>",

You've deliberately dressed Misty in the most conservative attire you could find. If Misty wants you to make her into a new person you were going to do it right. You even found a pair of horn rim glasses with just plain lenses to finish the look. You would hardly require any training  you though, almost feeling like de ja vu as you walked through the door. <br>\r\nYou act like your old body would as you walk up the front desk, with a polite decorum that would be expected as Liz but a completely new look for the the body you currently inhabited. <br>\r\n\"My name is Misty Davis and I am looking for Miss Klein, I am here to start my internship.\" you said with a calmly to the woman at the desk. Miss Klein smiles at you, \"I am Miss Klein and I am pleased to see you are early. That is a quality that is disappearing in this day and age. <br>\r\n\"Thank you Miss Klein, I am hoping to learn allot from you if you will let me.\" Laying it on quite thick.<br>\r\nYou could tell she was eating it up. She smiles and gestures you to follow her, \"lets get started Miss Davis.\"<br>\r\nShocked, you can't believe how nice she is toward you, thinking back you always remember her as so distant and almost rude. <br>\r\nThinking back to your first day, you remember you were late, could that have been the problem?<br>\r\nShe shows you the back room and is amazed at how fast you pick things up. Little did she know that you had years of practice. Smiling she says, \"Your going to do well here. I have to go out to the desk and help the other interns, if you need any help, just come and get me.\"<br>\r\nAfter a half an hour you find you almost have everything done, you could hardly believe it, you distinctly remember your first day lasting for ever. You didn't get done that day till almost 10:30, then you had to help the other interns Samantha and Emily finish. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nIt was almost eerie you thought...how similar your first day was here, it almost felt as though you were living out your past life in the body of misty..a though that gave you a terrible sense of foreboding as niggling thoughts began to enter your mind. What if by helping Misty be more 'goody goody', you were inadvertently giving her your life?  <br>\r\nYou then thought of Misty in your body..becoming the party girl that Misty always was, you hoped that she wouldn't go overboard..the last thing you want is your life becoming Misty's you thought. A knot formed in your stomach..you thought of the party and of the changed events, you needed to do something about Kyle and fast. You made a huge mistake giving in to Misty's uncontrollable urges, as you thought about how passionate it was, you hoped it hadn't left a lasting effect on Kyle, you shuddered at the thought of your husband falling in love with Misty of all people, knowing that if you kept in contact with him who knows how the past might change further. You thought back to the changes, and what scared you most is the feeling that the past was already being changed..you didn't want to admit it but the thought of Misty losing her virginity to Kyle felt almost normal to you.. as though it had always happened, as the vivid memory of you losing your own virginity to Cory at the party seemingly feeling normal. You allowed these memories to come to the forefront of your mind as you thought about how good you looked in your slutty dress, how glad you were that he couldn't resist your charms once you launched yourself onto him.. he was such a stud you thought to yourself \"with a huge dick too\" you murmured..\"wait where did that come from?!\" You thought.. that sounded like something Misty would think...'have Misty's party girl antics in my body done something to my mind?' am I becoming more like what Misty used to be?? You needed to find Misty and get to the bottom of this..</span></div></div>",

The place is a disaster from being short staffed and the end of School rush of books being dropped off.  You find an empty cart and start organizing the books per section so they are easier to put back.  Then you wheel it over to Emily and Samatha to put away.  Your mouth drops open as you see they have only put a handful of books away all morning.    <br>\r\n\u201cHey Misty, why are you bringing us more books,\u201d Emily whispers loudly.  \u201cWe haven\u2019t even finished up with these.\u201d   <br>\r\n\u201cI thought you would be done by now!  You two have been working on this all morning!\u201d  You say a little to loudly.  An old lady pokes around the corner and says \u201cShhhhhhh,  this is a Library!\u201d<br>\r\nEmily looks at you angrily, \u201cwe\u2019ve been working all morning and we haven\u2019t had a break yet.  You work on it while we go to the back.\u201d  With that they turn around and walk into the break room. <br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s probably trying to get out of here early so she can get laid,\u201d Emily says to loudly for a library as Samantha and her walk to the back.<br>\r\n\u201cSHHHHHH!\u201d you hear from around the corner again.   <br>\r\nLooking at the carts and knowing how much more has to be done you know there is no hope at being out at a decent time.   Looking at the carts you bite your lip and start organizing the other cart.   As you put books away you help a number of Patrons.  Its amazing how Misty\u2019s outgoing personality pays off in a library of all places.  If these people knew what she would become would they talk to her?  She was amazingly well read, but that helped her with her high end clients.  Her knowledge of the arts and world events was amazing.  The problem was remembering what events were in the future and what was current.  From the number of questions it must be finals week at the local University and procrastinators must be finishing their final projects.  Looking at your watch, you realize the interns must be still in the breakroom.  You remember how Miss Klein blew her stack when she caught you and the girls back there.   You have to get the carts back to the front and get back to the break room and prevent the ass chewing that would happen shortly.<br>\r\nBringing the empty carts back up to the front you quickly start restocking them from the towering back log of books.  Looking around you see every cart the library has overflowing and hardly any room behind the desk because of the stacks of books.  Your heart sinks as realize you probably aren\u2019t going to be able to see Misty today and not till the weekend. <br>\r\n \u2018Shit!, too late\u2019  You think to yourself  as you hear Miss Klein losing her cool with the interns in the back.  It is almost comical as they almost run out of the backroom  and try to find something to make themselves look busy.  <br>\r\n \u201cSuck up!\u201d Emily whispers loudly to you as she purposely bumps into you taking the cart you were restocking.  Samantha walks by picks up the other cart you were working on and whispers, \u201cMeeting at 4 in back room.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly you start organizing another couple carts, you figure it would be best to lay low for awhile and look busy, while Miss Klein cools down.  You remember how furious she was all day after the backroom incident.  Could you have defused the situation?  Probably not, but it is an interesting question.  How much of history can be changed?  Can there be any real changes to history?  Everything is unfolding just as it had in the past or is it?  You are dating Cory and Misty is dating Kyle, everything seems right.  It is so nice that Misty let you have her body so you and Kyle could loose your virginity together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the book carts you prepped you start placing books on the shelf.   You start thinking of Kyle, but force yourself to think about anything else.  Your start thinking about the first day at the Salon.  You were the receptionist the hairdressers were party girls and immediately took a liking to you especially with Misty in control of your body.  You were such a hit that Chasity even had her boyfriend make you a fake ID so you could come party with them at the dance clubs.  It was a easy day, you spent most of the day gossiping and telling stories.  Misty was such a people person,  was that making you extrovert or are you making her an extrovert?   You think about the Asian girls who do nails in the back of the salon.    Two of the Three Asian girls had been former prostitutes in the past and would work with Misty in the future at the strip club\u2026.<br>\r\nYou snapped back to reality as you felt a hand touch on the shoulder,  you turn and see a smiling Miss Klein,  \u201cMiss Davis, meeting in the back room at 4.  There is also a handsome young man here to take you to lunch.   I wish I was a few years younger, I would take him up on his offer if you don\u2019t.\u201d  She turns and starts to walk away and then turns back winks.  \u201cI am impressed with all your hard work, if your lunch goes a little long it will be ok.\u201d  She winks and walks away.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You find yourself skip running to the back room to get your purse.  After gathering your things and signing out, you quickly head back towards the front.  Making your way through the library  to meet Kyle you see Ms. Klein smiling at you you making a subtle motion with her hand to slow down.  You realize you are almost running through the library.  Looking to your left you see Emily and Samantha laughing at you. Quickly you force yourself to walk in a slow 'elegant' manner to the door.  Opening the door the warm air hits you like a wall.  As the door shuts behind you it cuts the sound of the interns laughing at you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Looking into the reflective glass windows of the library, you check your makeup and hair.  'What are you doing you think to yourself, I'm trying to cool it with Kyle.  Not make him fall in love with me.'   As soon as you say that you find yourself checking your hair again.  Misty has beautiful large head of hair that extends down her back with a slight natural curl to it.  Pulling off your fake horn rimmed glasses, you look at her big blue eyes and her high cheek bones, her big pouty lips.  Her tiny frame, large breasts and beautiful round butt.   Both her breast and butt almost look to big for her body.  How are can her breasts be this big and this perky?  Shouldn't they sag? 'Damn I wish I looked this good you think to yourself,' as you rotate and almost do a partial curtsy in front of the window.  You mouth drops and you almost fall over as you realize Kyle was standing right there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi... You want to do stuff,\" your blurt out embarrassed by being caught admiring yourself.  You hand smacks you head once you realize that you made it even worse by the stupid comment you just made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah..Ahhh...Ah.\" Kyle stutters as he points to his old beater car.  <br>\r\nYou can't believe it, it is the old car he had when you guys were first dating.  It was such a piece of shit.  You actually miss this old car and all the fun you two had in it.  You grab him by the hand and almost make him fall down the stairs as you somehow run down the steps in your heals. Kyle opens the door and asks \"Want go get a sandwich or salad at the Mall?\"<br>\r\n\"Fuck that shit,\" you blurt out with a big smile,   The shocked look on Kyle's face was priceless.  \"We are going to Biggie Burgers!\"<br>\r\nYou and Kyle used to go there all the time, before it closed when the kids were born.  Old man Biggie the cook and owner decided to close it, because it was hard for him to hold onto waitresses who could put up with him.  You hated to see it go.   It was cheap, fast and the burgers were wonderful.  You always used to get stupid salads because you were afraid of your weight,  but you loved the signature Biggie Burger.  Kyle always ordered the Biggie Burger and you would  take a couple of bites of his burger.  This might be your last chance to have one again.  <br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Kyle says looking like he was in shock.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nParking in front of Biggie Burgers, Kyle runs around the car apologizing that his car has no A/C and the inside door latch doesn't work.  You reach out grab the door handle and give the door a little kick expertly opening it up like you used.  Kyle looked surprised as you smile at him hold your hand out to have him help you out.  As he gives your hand a little tug you jump up and kiss him.  \"Don't apologize, I love your car.  Lets eat!\"  With that you take him by the hand and drag him inside to the counter.  The place was as filthy and run down as you remember it.  The waitress looks up at you and asks, \"can I help you.\"<br>\r\nKyle says, \"I'll take a Cheese burger combo.\"  Your jaw drops.  He always get a Biggie Burger, Quickly you blurt out, \"He'll take a Large Biggie Burger combo, Make that two Large Biggie Burger Combos.\"  The waitress lifts her eyebrow as she looks at your tiny frame as she take Kyle's Money and hands him a number.<br>\r\nHe starts leading you towards the back of the restaurant.  \"Oh no Kyle, we are going to our booth,\" You say as you lead him towards the booth up front.  \"You are with you future wife and you have to show her off!\"  You turn red as you realize what you just said.  You look back at Kyle he is blushing too.  You feel all giddy again as you sit down in your old spots.   You don't know what is wrong with you.  You are so manic and excited right now its like you aren't even in control.   You have to calm down you tell yourself, this is not going like you wanted it to.  <br>\r\n\"Kyle starts to stammer,  I've never had a Biggie Burger before, I've always have had a cheese burger...\"    \"Shhhh,\" You touch his lips with your pointer finger and smile, \"trust me, You will love it,  you'll never want to order any other burger from here again.\"  With that you  lean over the table and kiss him.   He is blushing so bad,  Biting your bottom lip, you look around noticing no one is looking,you slip off your left heal and touch his crotch with your foot.  You can feel his ragging Boner. He turns bright red, jumps up and hits the table in the booth.   You think to yourself,' Misty you have to get yourself under control here, What is wrong with you!  I can't be doing this, so much for playing it cool...'  Just then the waitress puts the tray down with your meals on the table.  She looks at you with a smirk and says,  \"Be easy on the boy, Missy. I don't want to clean up a mess in the booth.\"  You and the waitress both chuckle, she turns and walks away.   <br>\r\nYou quickly eat your fries and devour your Biggie Burger.  It was so good, better then you remember.  Kyle looks a little surprised as he tries to keep up.  You guys make small talk as he works on his meal and you suck on straw of your Soda.  Wow Misty must never drink caffine, you are totally buzzing right now.  Kyle finishes and looks at his watch, I better get you back.  I don't want you to get into trouble.  He puts a tip down and you grab his arm and lean against him slightly as you both walk to his car.  <br>\r\nDriving parking in the back of the library next to the employee entrance in the shade,  \"Can I call you tonight,\" Kyle stammers.  You notice he isn't getting the door, cause he is trying to hide his the tent in pants.  Looking around you see nobody, \"Let me take care of that so you can get the door for me.\"  Kyle looks like he was about to freak as you unzip his pants and pulls down his underwear.  \"I was going to give you a blow job...,\"  Taking one last quick look around.  \" but I think we are alone out here.\"  You kick off your heals, unbutton your blouse, unhook your bra and slip off your panties.  Quickly hitting the lever on the side of his chair it slide back. lifting your leg over Kyle, you quickly straddle him.  You can't believe how nimble and acrobatic Misty's body is. Looking into his eyes you slowly lower yourself on top of him as you feel him slide inside of your wet pussy.   You are surprised by the 'glisst' sound it makes.   \"Suck my breasts,\" you whisper As you go up and down on his member.  Its so hard to keep going with the door to your side and the steering wheel at your back.  You can't believe how fast you are starting to go.    Your eyes start to roll back in your head as you are about to hit your orgasm.  Kyle finishes you off as he thrust deeper into you.   You can hear his horn honking with his every thrust.   You quickly collapse into his arms, you feel like your floating surrounded by rose pedals,  You just want to lay like this in his arms even though it is very uncomfortable.<br>\r\nYou smile at Kyle.  He is looking around half terrified he will get caught, while trying to give you a kiss, he is such goody goody.  Then out of nowhere he blurts out, \"You want to meet my parent on Friday.\"   Surprised, you kiss him and smile and almost whisper,  \"Yes\"  <br>\r\n\"I'd better get back in, I'm so late,\"  you say as you refasten you bra. <br>\r\n \"I'll call you tonight, he say as you climb out of his car and put on your shoes.  \"No,\" you smile.  \"You are going to pick me up.\"  Shutting the car door you start toward the library employee entrance.  Looking at your panties in your hand, you run back to the car where Kyle is still sitting in shock with his drivers side window open.  Peeking in you look into his eyes, then give him a kiss as you shove your underwear into his T-shirt pocket. <br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Kyle says in almost a squeaky voice.  You laugh, blow him a kiss and run toward the back door as you buttoning your blouse.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have I just done,\" You say to yourself.  \"I was going to cool down our relationship or break up with him.... what did I just do.\"<br>\r\nIt had felt like you weren't even in control, it was like you where along for the ride with someone cherry picking your memories.  It was like it was you, but not you.  What ever was going on now you as Misty has taken his virginity, making your special memories hers and making new ones you would never do.   Reaching for the door knob of the rear employee entrance you Feeling Kyle leaking out of you.  As you pull the door open you catch a glance of yourself in the  reflective glass, your blouse is buttoned wrong, your hair and make up are totally messed up. \"Wow,\" you say to yourself.  \" I have to talk to Misty before this goes to far.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you open the door, before your eyes can adjust.  You see a shadow in the hall way.  It is....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You can feel dread flowing through your body.   \"Come with me Miss Davis,\" Ms Klein said sternly as she gestured towards her office. <br>\r\n'OH NO! What have I done!' echoes through your mind as you follow her down the hall way.  Tears starting to well up in your eyes. To make matters worse you can feel Kyle dripping down your leg its cold as it rolls down your leg to your long black socks.  You are starting to shake, you feel so humiliated.  'What was I thinking! I can't let Emily or the others see me cry'.  Ms Klein opens the door pointing to the chair in front of her desk.  It is a very nice plush leather office chair.  You sit down and the back of your dress clings to the back of the chair as you sit.  You can feel the cold leather on your bottom.  In a near panic you quickly make sure you the front of the dress is not exposing anything and try to pull down the back of your dress but Ms Klein turns towards you as she sits in her chair.  Quickly you snap to attention.<br>\r\n'What more could go wrong' You think to yourself as you close your eyes and wipe away some tears.  Just then you could feel more of Kyle leaking out of you onto her beautiful chair.  You want to scream, but quickly you regain your composure.  You can't loose control and start crying not now.<br>\r\nMs. Klein leans over her desk and looks you in the eyes.<br>\r\n\"Do you want to work here Ms. Davis.....\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, Very much so, Ms. Klein.\"<br>\r\n\"That is a surprise to me Ms.  Davis,  is this how one acts at an employers especially one that deals with the public and has children frequenting the premises.\"<br>\r\n\"Your actions out in the parking lot are not acceptable and not what I would expect from someone who wishes to work at this library.\"  <br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Ms. Klein I don't know what came over me..\" You stammer<br>\r\n\"What did come over you Ms. Davis! What were you thinking!  Why would you do that in public, in our back parking lot!  What if someone else would have seen you!\" Ms Klein was almost beat red and shaking.<br>\r\nYou start sobbing.  \"I don't know.... I was trying to cool down our relationship....I even was going to maybe break up with him...\"<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't call that cooling down your relationship and I wouldn't want to see what you would do if you did break up with him.\"<br>\r\n\"I know,\" you sob almost uncontrollably.  \"I don't know what is wrong with me.... I couldn't control myself!   Before I met him I want to go to the University become a scientist like my dad..... Now....Now... I'm some sort of Succubus!   I just want belong to him,  I want to have his babies...\"<br>\r\nRealizing what you just blurted out you start crying so hard you can't talk.  Why did I just say that!   Am I a total freak!  You are crying so hard, you bury your face in your hands.  What is wrong with me I have to talk to Liz or me or the real Misty!  You just totally messed everything up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise you feel a hug.<br>\r\nMs Klein is hugging you.<br>\r\n\"Its OK dear.  It's hard being a teenager. Especially one in trouble.  Does he know he's the father!\"   She holds your hand and helps you up. <br>\r\n\"What!\" You whisper in shock.<br>\r\n\"Your glowing my dear.\"  Ms Klein says with a smile.  \"I don't know if I can save your job.  If someone files a complaint there is nothing I can do, But I think I was the only one that saw what happened.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Klein looks down at the mess on her chair, she frowns, shakes her head and looks at you.  \"Lets get you cleaned up.\"  You follow her in shock.  'Can I be pregnant.  Its too soon,  I just had sex with him this weekend.  It can't show yet. Nobody can know yet.   I don't have my period  for 3 months I thought she said.

Wow she missed her calling she could have been a stylist.<br>\r\n\"Just a little makeup goes a long way.  Especially for you Misty, you are a natural beauty.  Just a touch her and a hint there makes you look professional, but you must apply enough to accentuate that your are the beautiful young woman that you are.\"<br>\r\nAs she finished she looks you in the eyes,\"I will do what I can to help you.  I don't know what other people know.  I think from what I've seen so far you are a good worker and would make an excellent member to our team, but if the wrong people find out what you have done I can't do anything to save your position.

You think about Kyle picking you up.  You don't want to meet with Misty right away, you want your time with Kyle.  Misty will be there later, I will call her tonight.

Oh my God.

He will make everything better.<br>\r\nBefore you knew it all the interns were going towards the back for the meeting.  You sheepishly followed with your head down.  Sitting in the back away from the others you sat expecting the worse.  You could see Emily and Samantha talking to each other and laughing.  They kept looking at you.  Were they talking about you?  Were they outing you to the other interns? <br>\r\n Ms.  Klein walked in and everyone fell silent.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Klein began lecturing everyone about the problems she had seen today.   She seemed so mad, you still remember her speech from when you were here so many years ago.  You were so afraid of her back then.  Everyone was afraid of her.   Now you see her differently.  She looked at you and then looked at the other girls and went on about how you had to be professional on duty and off.   When you are on property and off you must act with the dignity of the position that you hold.  Y.  Do people realize she is talking about you?  I hope not.   After about a hour of lecturing she looked over the interns and then glanced at you.  I expect a lot better out of you tomorrow.<br>\r\nWith that she </span></div></div>",

We are going to start over tomorrow after a goodnight rest and hopefully we will have a much better day tomorrow then today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody starts to leave and you get up to follow.

There cannot be another repeat of today, that is totally unacceptable.\"  You could feel a tear starting to form in the corner of your eye.  She smiles at you and wipes your tear.  \"I'll see you tomorrow morning.  Call your boyfriend and have a good night, don't dwell on today.  Enjoy your time with him, be young, trust me.  I am more jealous then you know.  When your my age you won't remember our conversation, you won't think of this job, but you will have sweet memories of your first love, trust me.\"  With that she turned around and walked out the door towards the front desk.  You quickly gathered your purse and belongings, thankful that Ms. Klein didn't fire you.   You texted Kyle to pick you up and were totally surprised when he sent you a text immediately that he was on his way.  Excitement ran through you with his reply!  You found yourself jumping up and down with excitment.  Quickly you looked around making sure no one was watching you.  Everything seemed good now, everything right.  Quickly you ran outside to meet him.  Looking in the reflective glass you checked yourself out, making sure your hair and everything was just right in between skip pacing in front of the library.   The light was right so you could see some of the patrons they looked like they might be laughing, but that didn't matter Kyle was almost here.  Then you saw Ms. Klein standing looking out at you from behind the glass,  She had a sad smile on her face... Then you heard Kyle's piece of shit car or the \"POS\"  you quickly ran down the steps.  He jumped out of the car as it backfired a couple of times.   You remember when you were young how this car embarrassed you so much.  Now it was a fun memory that you get to relieve.   You ran up to him, through your arms around him and gave him a passionate kiss.  Your right leg was actually lifting up like on a cheesy romance movie.  \"Let's go, I robbed the place,\" you tell Kyle, he opens the door and you jump in.  As you fumble with the seat belt, He shuts the door, runs around the front of the car and jumps in.  As you drive away you see Ms. Klein standing out front of the library with her arms folded.  She looked like she was smiling at you.  Down the street it looked like Liz and her boyfriend were walking towards the library.  Wow she was wearing a skimpy outfit.  Did I wear things like that back then?  <br>\r\nKyle asks, \"where to beautiful lady?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your thighs began to squeeze together as you started fantasizing of him inside of you again.  <br>\r\nRaising your head, looking him in the eyes, your hand subconsciously going to his lap. You manage a half whisper, half pathetic croak, \"Take me home.\"    You can feel the tension in him as his pants begin to tent up to your gentle touch.  You love the power you have over him. He is so shy, so trusting, So young and naive.  He was putty in your hands with your years of experience as prostitute combined with your memories of being his wife.  You know him inside and out.    It made you feel so strong and powerful, it was almost more then you could take.  You wanted to take him right here.  <br>\r\nTrying to get a hold of yourself you made the mistake look back down at his shirt pocket  with your undies.  He held on to them all day!  Why is this turning me on!  Is this one of Misty's kinks! Oh my, I'm getting wet, I'm trebling What is wrong with me!  <br>\r\nSqueezing my thighs together trying to get some sort of relief, desperately  trying get control of myself.  Looking down there is a wet spot on the seat! My God!  There is a small wet spot on my dress between my thighs!  I'm soaking through my dress! Looking up at him, does he notice.  A wave runs through you as he looks down at your lap.  Strangely you want him to notice, need him to notice.  He's sweating and shaking!  He is so cute, such a goody goody.  Wait till we get home, I'm going to.... His hand nervously touches your leg.  He is shaking like a leaf.  Biting your lip as you smile.  You take his hand and you pull his fingers under your dress and slide them against your wet vagina.  He swerves a little bit, but quickly gains control of the car.  Biting your lip harder you guide his fingers a little deeper as you gasp.  You can't help it, your such a bad girl and it is so fun playing with him.   He trys to speak, but all that come out is a high pitch squeak,\"AAAHHHH...... then he stammers, \"So...AAAhhh....HOooww wa wa was.....your day?\" <br>\r\n\u201cJust get me home and I\u2019ll show you how my day was,\u201d you whisper in his ear as lean up against him.  You close your eyes as you push his fingers deep inside of yourself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed to take forever, but you pulled into the driveway.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, nobody is home Kyle,\u201c you whisper as he sits shaking in his seat.   Smiling you gesture to the door with a smile, \u201cOpen my door and take me to the house.\u201d  He jumped out and ran around the car hunched over, desperately trying to hide the fact that  his member was stretching his pants to the limit. As he fumbles around the car, you pull out a bottle of perfume, its his favorite.  Giving yourself a couple of quick squirts to your wrists, you wipe in along the base of your neck.  He opens the door and helps you out of the car.  Gracefully you move around him. Taking his hand and leading him to the house. As you move you made sure to sway your hips back and forth.  Up on the front porch you turn to him and kissed him, slowly and deeply.  Then looking into his eyes you whispered, \u201cpick me up carry me across the threshold and make me yours.  <br>\r\nHe carefully picked up your tiny frame with ease.  He looked into your eyes with lust.  He opened the unlocked door and carried you in to the sofa in the living room.  You realize you are having Misty\u2019s live one of your fondest  memories  of you being carried into the house when you moved in.  What are you doing, you have to stop this.  Kyle kisses you softly you close your eyes as your concerns melt away.  Your hands undo his pants pull them half down.   Laying you down on the sofa you feel him inside of you as he kisses your neck.  He stops for an instant as you feel him inhaling the perfume on your neck.   He kiss you again and you feel him deeper inside of you.  instinctively you wrap your legs around him, you both move in unison following his lead.  What am I doing, I don't even have your shirt off, I'm such a slut, what am I doing.  \"Ohhh,\" you moan as you pick up your pace not waiting for him.    \u201cOH MY GOD, YES!\" You blurted out. \"I'm going to quick!\" Digging your fingers in his back.  He picks up his pace,but its to late.  AAAHHH...OOOOHHHH,\" you moan.  \"NOT YET,\" You moan as your head arches back and you pull him inside you with all your strength.  As you pussy spasms, He cums also. It feels like you are a flower petal floating on water as you look into his eyes.  Breathing heavily you manage to whisper, \" I feel like such a slut, I'm not even undressed,  I didn't even take my blouse off.  I came too quickly.\"  He smiles and kisses you as he tries to catch his breath.  He whispers, \"You are not a slut,  I Love you with all my heart.\"  <br>\r\nYou are so happy, your wrap your arms around him, \"Promise me you will never let me go,\"you whisper in his ear.  <br>\r\n\"I promise!\" He whispers.  <br>\r\nHis whispers drove you into a frenzy as You used your years of skills and your intimate knowledge of Kyle to begin christen the other rooms in the house.  His cell phone rang a number of times, but he ignored as you kissed him.  As you sat naked in the laundry room, he finally got up to answer it.  A feeling of anger and hurt runs through you that he got up to answer it.  The anger builds as you realize when you would christen the house in the future, you made love in the same rooms in the same order.  Was he reliving his and Misty's first time in the house together?  Did you subconsciously relive this memory of the future as Misty?<br>\r\nKyle looks at you, \"That was my Mom, I'm supposed to go home I'm late for dinner.\"  I'm sorry Misty!\"<br>\r\nSorrow flowed through you,  You had planned to make him dinner and for some reason you believed he was going to stay the night with you.  It felt like your heart was breaking.  He quickly get dressed as you follow him to the living room.  You covered yourself with a dirty towel form the laundry room.  He kisses you and starts out the door.  He turns back and says, \"I love you, I'll txt you and I'll pick you up for lunch tomorrow.\"<br>\r\nHe shut the door and he was gone.   You sit on the sofa, you can't believe he was gone just like that.  Why did you think he was gonna stay with you? <br>\r\nYou aren't married, you are just a couple of kids.  Getting up you go to shower as you decide what to do next.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Are you OK?\"  Ms Klein asks looking at you with concern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping back to reality you come up with a plan as you look up at Ms. Klein through the tears in your eyes.  You are amazed at how fast Misty's rapid fire brain works.  If the plan works you can get answers from the real Misty and save your job if there is any negative fallout from the parking lot.   <br>\r\nThe problem is you can't even talk, you are crying and sniffling so bad,  it is embarrassing.  You try to wipe the tears flowing down your cheeks with your hand.    Now to get Ms Klein to take you home, take her to the shed and switch places with her.   It takes all you effort to compose yourself to ask,  \"Can you bring me to my house quick so I can get cleaned up?  I'm not feeling well and Kyle was my ride.  It's not that far, but would take me to long to walk and get back in time.\"<br>\r\nMs Klein has a frustrated look on her face, but quickly nods.   Taking a tissue from the box on Ms. Klein's desk you wipe your eyes and the tears off your cheeks.  You can't believe she is helping you out so much.  She would have fired the real you, Emily or Samantha in a heart beat for any infraction back in the day.  What does she see in you?  <br>\r\nTurning you hear the click as Ms Klein hangs up the desk phone after talking to one of the other librarians at the front desk.  She picks up her purse and pulls out here keys.  Smiling at you she says, \"Lets go Misty. We have to hurry.\"<br>\r\nFollowing her to the parking lot, you are impressed with her car.  How can a librarian afford a car like this, she must have a sugar daddy.  Opened her door Ms Klein throws down a sweat shirt she had laying in the back seat onto the passenger seat.  Sitting down you can't believe how plush and comfortable this seat is. you could get used to this.  As you buckle up you tell Ms Klein your address.  \"Yes, I know Ms. Davis,  I live up the road from you.\"  <br>\r\nWow  she lives in the huge house next to you, where Rebecca Johnson's lives in the future.<br>\r\nA short drive later she pulls up into your yard. \"Be quick Misty,\"  Ms Klein says to you as she looks into her mirror to check her makeup.  You climb out of the car and point to the shed, \"Ms Klein come with me quick!\" <br>\r\nMs Klein follows you, concerned  something is wrong.  Amazingly she moves pretty fast for someone in heels and enters into the shed right behind you.  She looks around at all the equipment and opens one of the notebooks on the table and begins skimming through it as she asks,<br>\r\n\"What is this Misty?\"<br>\r\n\"Please Sit in that pod Ms. Klein, its a body switching machine.\"<br>\r\nMs.  Klein starts laughing and sits down in the pod,  \"You have one over active imagination, Ms. Davis. We have to hurry!  We don't have time to get caught up in you little girl fanta....\"<br>\r\nHitting the button in your pod you cut off Ms Klein conversation as the doors slam shut and a brilliant light surrounds you.  It feels like your floating in the light.  Everything feels right at first, but then Something feels wrong.  It feels like a strong dry wind is blowing you, but for some reason you aren't flowing towards your new body like before.  It feels like you are being ripped apart as the dry wind and light increase in intensity.  Pieces of you seem to go be carried by this wind, but feels like great portions of you are falling back into Misty's body.  You feel like a puzzle with pieces falling away.  It feels like Ms Klein flowing through you as she travels towards Misty's body.   Its like you are her, part of her, almost one as she passes through you into your body.  Something is very wrong.  When she passed through you it's like she took most of what was left of you back into Misty's body.  Its like you are a thread now being pulled in two direction as you unravel.  You are getting thinner and thinner as you fall apart, you try and scream but nothing comes out. It feels like you are so thin you are going to break. Then everything fades away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes and you fall out of the pod.    You try and react, but your thoughts aren't there.  Your body doesn't seem to work.   It is like you are a shard of tapestry thrown over another.  The other tapestry fills all the missing spaces.  Trying to breath, its like you aren't part of this body, like you are unplugged.  It's like you are drowning.  You manage to gasp and feel air fill your lungs.   You are starting to feel sensations again.  Your head is pounding and if filled with thoughts that aren't your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head feels like its pulsating and burning, you look at Misty dancing and twirling in front of a mirror with the notebook in her hand.  She is such a beautiful girl, such a hard worker and so smart.  How you have fantasized she was your daughter.  Oh my is she twerking.....  OUCH your hair pins are red hot in your hair.  quickly you pull them out.  <br>\r\nYour long thick blond hair falls around your shoulders as you stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour are not sure how long you have been out.<br>\r\n\"Misty what was that?\" you ask holding your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA confused Misty turns around and looks at you.  \"That's your body switching machine Ms. Klei...Misty...Oh my I almost called you Ms. Klein.\" She puts down the notebook and twirls again with her hang clasped together under her chin.  She is so excited.  \"Can we stay this way for awhile.  This is so wonderful.  I can't believe this.\"  She is jumping and skipping around.  She has so much energy.  I wish I had that energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself wishing you were her.  She has a glow about her.  A beautiful teenage girl in trouble, but so happy, so care free.  A handsome boyfriend.  You think back to when you were her age.  You actually were dating her boyfriends father.  He looked just like him, he was so sweet and shy, but from the wrong side of the tracks.  Your family never approved of him.  Sometimes you fantasize what life would have been like if you followed your heart, lets face it you would have had to struggle.  It wouldn't have been easy especially since your family controlled most of the towns industries.  Your family would have punished you for marrying beneath you.  Instead you have had two loveless marriages.   The first left you barren when you first husband cheated on you and left you with a disease.  They were able to cure you, but the scarring kept you from easily having children.  Right after your second marriage Misty's father offered Misty to you to adopt as a baby, you were thrilled it was an answer to you prayers, but then your second husband left you for his secretary.  Your parents forbid you to adopt her.  A single mother would not be proper.  You did manage to convince to finance his projects.    After that you always felt like love is not real and you will never find it again.   You were so depressed, your parents built the house up the way to watch over the little girl.  You watched her from afar, but could never be part of her life.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears come to your eyes It is so wonderful looking at her it reminds you of the happiest time of your life, before your marriages.  How you felt as a teenage girl in love when everything seemed possible.  Thinking back you secretly wished Kyle's father had made you pregnant with a daughter.  How you could have been her best friend, combed her hair like your mother did in the morning as your talked about dreams, books and hopes for the day.  Shaking your head you think what a silly fantasy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms Davis you have to get ready, we don't have all day,\" you remind Misty.  Your head is pounding so hard you can hardly think.  Misty leads you to the house she quickly showers and comes out with a cute outfit.   It looks like one you would pick, she has very good taste.   She has the notebook from the shed under her arm and a comb in her hand.  \"Could you come with me and  comb my hair,\"<br>\r\nYour shocked that she would ask almost a complete stranger to comb her hair, but you are so touched and excited that she asked you.  \"Yes, Misty, I could help you with your hair.\" Oh my I hope she didn't hear the excitement in my voice that wouldn't be proper<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking of putting my hair up with  chop sticks,  but I don't have any chop sticks.\"   Misty says as you comb her hair.  \"Here we can use these, \" you answer as you pick up some yellow pencils from a jar on her desk.  She hands you a clip on flower, it's like she know what your are thinking you are in heaven right now.  leaning back you admire your handy work, fast and gorgeous.  \"It's beautiful, I love it!\" She chirps with excitement.  \"Can you help me with my makeup.  I always put it on to thick.  Can you show me how to apply it properly.\"  You swallow, you can feel a tear this is like a dream come true.   \"Yes, Yes.  I would love to help you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you finish her makeup, you tell her.  \"The secret is to use as little as possible.  You must look confident and in charge.  Men like that.\"   Then you wink, \" But at the same time you have to add a touch of desperation so they think they have a chance with you and you are approachable.\" <br>\r\nYou both laugh and the clock plays music at the top of the hour.<br>\r\n\"Time to go Misty we are very late.\"  You quickly wrap your hair up and use pencils to hold it in place like Misty's hair.  You both laugh and run out to your car.  <br>\r\nAs you drive back towards the library.  Misty is still reading her notebook.   She looks over at you and shyly asks, \"Could you help me with my hair and makeup if I came over to your place before work?\"  She looks down at the note book.  \"My father disappears for long periods of time with his projects and its just me...\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, Misty, I would like that.\"  you answer.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I would love that!\"  Misty exclaims. <br>\r\nYour head is still pulsating and a little ice cream might clear it up.  It is so weird despite the pain, you feel so young right now, so energized.  Almost like you aren't even you.  Thinking back to the shed, you laugh to yourself, body switching machine, indeed.<br>\r\nPulling in to the drive through you order for both of you.  Misty looks at you and say, \"How did you know that was my favorite.\"  <br>\r\n\"I don't know, but I knew it is your favorite.\"  you answer perplexed, maybe there is something to those machines crazy Doc Davis built.<br>\r\nYou both quickly eat your ice cream and chat. It's amazing how much you have in common.  Which books you've both read,  your favorite flowers, favorite birds, about your horses.  You both talk about her dreams about life with Kyle.  They sound just like your old dreams when you were her age.  Its amazing.   The ice cream and the conversation helps clear your head.  It seems like the more she makes you tell her about yourself the more your mind clears up.  <br>\r\nAs you pull into the employee parking lot and park Misty looks at your and asks,  \"If you had a chance for a do over, would you?\"  You look at her and laugh, \"You have a wonderful life ahead of you Misty.  Live it to your fullest. I am happy perfectly happy with my life.\"<br>\r\nShe throws her arms around you and hugs you. \"Thank you, Thank you so much!  You don't know how happy this makes me.\"<br>\r\nSmiling at her, \"Let's go its going to be hard explaining this to the other librarians\"<br>\r\nAs you walk together into the library you feel like something is wrong.  You can't shake it for some reason.  You look at Misty as she punches in and immediately throws herself into her work.   Its amazing its like she has been here for years.  She must be very observant, because she is using tricks you do to help speed up her work when she is behind.  She is a fantastic asset to the library, you just hope you can save her job.    As walk past where the other interns were working you hear one of the interns Emily make a snide comment about the twins.  It actually feels like a complement.   <br>\r\nWalking towards the front you see the other librarians up at the front desk looking at you crossed. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The other Librarians were very upset. They had handed you their first day evaluations of the interns, but were all concerned about the rumors that were drifting around about Misty in the parking lot and wanted her dismissed.  \"We can't have someone like that working here.\" Abigail said pointing towards Misty.<br>\r\n\"You have just heard rumors, you can't judge her on rumors alone.  Trust me she is a hard worker, a fantastic worker!  Look at her! She is doing more then all the other interns combined,\" You say gesturing towards interns. <br>\r\n\"I have a meeting with them.  I was going to keep them late,  But maybe we should let them all go early. We'll start over tomorrow.\"  Seeing the stern look of the other Librarians you know their minds were made up.  \"Please let me talk to her.   Let's give her one more chance! She would make a fantastic asset to the team.\"  Deep down you know you will  will have to let her go!  Who know hopefully they will come around tomorrow.  Looking at Misty a strange fear some where deep inside you that is simply terrified to let Misty go.  Its such a strange sensation like you will be trapped.  Like some part of your mind is trying to tell you something.<br>\r\nShaking your head.  This strange sensation keeps coming up from time to time, but as you fall into your daily routine fortunately it keeps getting weaker.  Thank God, you can't let strange emotions get in your way, you have a Library to run.  Time to get back into my routine Misty sure has shaken that up today you think as you walk to the back room for your 4 o clock meeting.  To be honest if she does go everything would return to normal.  The little nagging sensation wants you to at least go back to shed to look at Misty's machines.  Almost pleads with you. Find out what she did to you, why your head hurts.  Why aren't you more concerned about what happened?  What did it do to you?  Thinking about it causes your head to hurt.  You definitely don't have time for a headache.  Back to Work!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou Quickly prep for the meeting, glancing through the notes.  Add comments to a number of the individual reviews.  Entering the back room you feel back on top of your game, doing what you do best.  You take charge, Tell it like it is.  It intimidates the interns, but honest feedback is the best solution.  The meeting goes very well, you point out a lot of the problems that the interns will have to work on tomorrow.  How they have to ask questions to the full time staff if they don't know how to do something.  To be honest they staff is just as guilty by avoiding the interns as the interns were at avoiding the staff.  At the end of the meeting you tell them they can punch out early.   They all take off excitedly.  You pack up your paperwork and go after Misty to talk with her.  She has all ready punched out and was outside.  Stepping out you see her with her boyfriend.  Your mouth drops open as you see the kiss she is giving him.  Well I can talk to her in the morning.  <br>\r\nPutting your paper work on your desk, you make your way to the front desk.  You have to relieve Abigail for her 20 minute break.  As your clean out the book return a scantily clad Redhead teen walks in.  Her clothing was almost obscene.   She wore stiletto high heel pumps, with fish net stockings, very short shorts, a tube top and a miniature leather short coat.    She was chewing bubble gum with her mouth open and leading what appeared her boyfriend by his hand.  He was a very tall hansom young man.<br>\r\n\"Is Misty here.\"  She rudely asked.  <br>\r\n\"It's not polite to chew bubble gum with your mouth open.\"  You reply as you sit down and look at her sternly. <br>\r\nShe turns and gives her boyfriend a long kiss,  then turns around with the bubble gum noticeably missing, smiles and asks, \"Is Misty here.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid not, she has left for the day.\"  You answer. \" But she will be back tomorrow, Is there anything I can help you with.\"<br>\r\n\"No, that's all right.\"  She smiles turns towards the door leading her boyfriend as she says loudly,  \"Lets go to my place,  My parents are gone, lets have some fun.\"<br>\r\nAbigail taps you on the shoulder to relieve you and sighs,\" What is wrong with young girls these days.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know Abigail. I'm afraid for the future of the human race.\"<br>\r\nAfter seeing this rude redhead that strange sensation starts to flow through you again.  It's strange, there is a real fear somewhere deep down inside of you.  Like something is horribly wrong.  You aren't feeling right at all yet. Maybe some fresh air would help you.  As you walk out the back door you see Misty's boyfriends car off in the far corner of the lot.  \"I thought they left a long time ago.\"  You start to walk towards it hoping to talk to Misty.  Half way across the lot you stop as you see the car going up and down.  <br>\r\n\"OH My,\"  you think.  What is with these teens now a days.  I would never do something like that.  Quickly you walk back into the library a little mad  You shake your head as much as you like Misty you probably won't be able to save her job.  Its only a matter of time before she gets caught and the scandal will force you to fire her.  It is a shame, you really like her.<br>\r\nAfter you get back in the building, you turn and look out the window.  You see Kyle driving away with Misty head leaning on his shoulder.  The anger you felt melts away as it replaced with feeling happiness for her and loneliness for yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason the rest of your shift you are so much more outgoing with the patrons than you usually are.  Towards the end of your shift a handsome gentleman walks in.  He has three kids in tow.  You over hear him talking with his children to make sure they find books for him to read to them when there mother drops them for the weekend.  That they had to hurry up before their mother came to pick them up.  Walking over you strike up a conversation with him as you help pick out books with him.   Before you know it you have his phone number and  a date for the night.  <br>\r\nThe other Librarians look at you in shock.  You can hear the whispers, \"What has gotten into her.\"   Smiling to yourself you are going to break yourself out of this rut you have been in.  Fortunately for the other librarians the rest of your shift is pretty much uneventful.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just the realization that when you weren't in the mood for sex and Kyle said that his last girlfriend never turned him down for sex, that he would be referring to you. Also what was funny was instead of Kyle pushing for sex, you were the one pushing for sex. When you thought of Kyle, he was just so pure and innocent, that there was nothing better than being close to him.

Except it wasn't the kind you get from two young couple. No, Liz wanted to surprise Kyle tonight and asked him to do anal. She remembered going to clubs and doing that sort of thing. And she noticed how much guys loved it when they got to do anal. They proceeded to do anal, but Liz discovered that Kyle was not that anal person. <i>Awww, he's so innocent and pure, I can see why Misty fell for him</i>. After sex, Kyle asked Misty if she was ready to meet her parents tomorrow, Liz remembered that Misty and Klye's parents didn't get along, so she was going to see if she could change that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She remembered college fairly lonely, as she made no friends at her Library job due to being Ms. Kleins favorite and focus on the job. And her one saving grace of college being Kyle somehow ending up with Liz. At night she still longed over him, thinking of those special memories of losing her virginity to him. Part of the reason she agreed to go back was to see if there was anyway to win Kyle back, or at least learn how Liz did it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty pulled up a quite revealing dress \u201cFitting dress for Liz\u201d. Then she heard Chasity\u2019s car come around. And Misty, in a dress that left nothing to the imagination for Liz\u2019s body, ran to her car and was presented with Liz\u2019s fake ID.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty pulled up to the club, and one by one all the salon girls got out and showed their fake ID, getting into the club. This was exciting to Misty as she doesn\u2019t remember going out to clubs, especially underage. Misty found everything exciting, guys hitting on her. Being the object of someones affection. In fact, she found it easier to reject guys now instead of wanting to hook up with guys (she always figured her problem was she fell in love too quick). Instead she navigated the dance floor, dancing her heart out. Eventually Chastity came up and told Misty that Brad, her boyfriend has a thing for red heads and if she was interested in a three way. Misty, maybe out of a little revenge, or wanting a new experience decided. <i>When in Rome </i>. And said yes.</span></div></div>",

I hate to do this to you sweetie but it was the only way, something was in that cat and then it swapped with me and now that thing is me and---\" suddenly Daryl's memories came flooding in just as they had for that thing \"--- you watch a LOT of porn, like a LOT of porn \" if cats could blush early would have been but alas he couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"A-anyway we gotta stop this thing! So I'm gonna have to hide you or find you a body so we can do something\".

You walk in total silence for a while until you hear a voice: it your own,well your original body's voice, and it's talking to someone, \"well It is weird seeing as I wasn't female before but you gotta listen to me, Job, this could be the perfect plan!\" \" Dude I just don't feel comfortable being someone else, I mean can't we get in trouble for this? \" \"not if nobody finds out and your on the run already right so why not escape it all and come be apart of this family\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mom-thing wasn't going to try to make someone else swap with a family member too is 'she'? \"Okay fine dude, but only if you're sure\" \"trust me, job, the bitch who had this body originally is gonna kick the bucket tomorrow anyway, I'll make sure of it\" 'she' added sinisterly. \"Alright but can I pick who I wanna be though\" \"sure\" \"I'll be the dad, he looked pretty swole\" Job said as you watched him to into where the machine was. Now Kyle was gonna be swapped by this Job, and there was nothing you could do about it without revealing who you were since the mom-thing was heading up the stairs now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only just hid as 'she' came around the corner towards the room your husband was currently sleeping. You stayed in your hiding spot (under some dirty laundry that was big enough to hide your teenage body) for 5 minutes until you heard voices again but this time ones you recognized \"I just don't realize why this couldn't have waited until the morning\" Kyle said in a throaty voice that suggested that he was just sleeping \"then the ice would have been up and you and me wouldn't be able to cherish this moment now c'mon!\" The mom-thing said as she was pulling on your husband's name to go faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow them from a safe distance away to the machine where you see the dirty face of job hiding in one of the seats and then the mom-thing sat a groggy Kyle in the other seat and pressed a button and before Kyle could understand what was happening he switched with Job. Soon Kyle (now Job) came out of the seat and was promptly handcuffed and knocked out by both Job and the mom-thing who set him outside in the night to rot. Job looked happy and actually missed the mom-thing who slapped him \"hey what did a do that for, your my wife now aren't ya?\" \" I may look it but it's still your old pal Malcolm in this sexy bitch so no more sentimental deal unless I say so if we're being watched by the kids which we might even swap with the old gang soon too hehe\" u<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hide again and see them leave and head up to the bedroom and as the door closed you boot outside to check on Kyle. He was pretty beaten up and as you soon find out as you're telling him your take this Job guy wasn't in mint condition when he left since he had some sorta disease in him. \"Liz promise me you'll fix this, promise me you'll save the kids from these monsters!\" He says in Jon's gravelly voice \" I'll try honey I'll try\" you say as you watch him nod silently as he gets up and walks over to Daryl who watched the whole thing to down in his little hope and guided him to the woods where she hoped there was a safe place as she headed back inside and snuck back to the room.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The crying man (assumed to be Tara) ran into the woods hopefully finding the cottage where her family resides in, later on at lunchtime a knock at the door is heard Malcolm goes to unlock it and Daryl comes in to tutor the new Tara \"hi Tara! Ready for tutoring!\" He said \" in y-yeah sure, can I uhhhhh get somethin' special if I answer right like Kanye some cocai--\" \"Coca-Cola! Coca-Cola is Tara's favorite drink nowadays hahaha\" said Malcolm nervously as Daryl just nervously laughed and Sat down to tutor this new Tara. At night you have uneasy dreams of them all circling around and killing you, you need to get away from this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up to hear a loud slap in the master bedroom, you sneak out to see a slight crack and put your ear to it and hear this<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You dumbass, Damon, we could've gotten caught this afternoon if it weren't for me!\" Said Malcom<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" Look man, old habits die hard\" said this new 'Damon'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You're not even in the same body anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" Don't mean I don't want some cocaine! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh yes it do, it you don't start acting like a sweet little innocent ten year old girl soon I'll switch you with another fucking member of the crew!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" okay okay, jees yuh made yuh point\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Little girls don't talk like that, Damon\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I mean, okay mommy *giggle*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" Now that more like it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Man, this is torture\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear footsteps coming and scamper away before Tara or Damon emerges from the room and back into her room to do God knows what. You go back to sleep dreaming about Tara alone in the world being harassed and abused, you hope she found the cottage. You wake up to a pebble hitting your window, you check your alarm clock: 5:32, you unwillingly roll out of bed and look out the window to see Daryl dressed in a sportswear tank top and tight yoga pants, Kyle and Tara are standing in a huddle behind him \"meet me outside\" he says as he guides them back into the brush. You walk outside and find them hiding behind a busy except for Daryl who was acting like he was exercising, \"okay so we came up with a plan to get our bodies back\" \"okay what is it?\" Kyle answers \" first we need to swap me with Daryl's girlfriend everyone but Daryl looked a little uncomfortable. Daryl noticed the awkward sense in the air and said, \"look it was the best idea I could think of to get dad out of the Bob's body\" \"true but Mary is mean\" said Tara \"shut up, twerp\" \"shush I think that her now\" \"who?\" You say \" everyday me and Mary jog up the road, not to say though I'm gonna help her get into the house and then swap her with dad\" said Daryl as he jogged out of the brush and met up with Mary at the houses mailbox where they talk for a bit then do some squats and stuff (is that a boner?) And suddenly Mary makes a surprised face and Daryl punches her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds he checks to see if she is still alive then starts to pull her toward the garage where Kyle joins him \"minor difficulties at the end\" Daryl explained \"I'll say\" says Kyle as he lifts her up and into the machine and floods suit soon after. Daryl and you start the machine and soon enough Mary walks out groping herself, \"Damn cleavage is amazing to feel\" Kyle says as he continues to feel up his new teenage mature body \"I know right!\" Says Cal as he feels his own breasts as well. You with and say \"c'mon guys let's go, what's the rest of the plan?\" \" Oh right, so we swap me with Mary and soon enough we'll switch Tara with another person and soon enough we'll slowly switch back everyone if everything stays the same\" explains Kyle as he and Daryl start jogging with Tara not to far behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou need back to bed hoping to get a few more hours of sleep in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

Then she continued, \"but one night while she was sleeping I got too curious and snuck out and grabbed a little girl from a neighbor's house and swapped with her, she was very confused on the situation but man was I one happy little feller I danced and skipped just because I could! I told her that she could have her body back if she promised not to tell and she gladly took the opportunity to quickly promise and we both swapped back and she went on running back to her home.\" She took her another pause and you think you saw a little tear as you see her mutter, \" if only I just kept to myself\" the she continued \"then some things started to happen, I frequently saw that girls father peek over the fence to watch my wife just do her regular chores to which I hollered and told him to mind himself, he never really fought back just needs and went back to whatever h was doing, you gotta understand at the time I thought he was just taken a great interest in my wife and wanted to have her for himself never did what happen next fully come to my attention until it happened\". She stopped and and grabbed herself some food, \"don't even need this anymore but damn it still tastes so good\" she says as she says a grizzled that was in her bag, \"anyway, later that night I awoke to my bed empty but myself and a large range most happening downstairs so I headed down there to see that girls father push my wife into the machine and activate it, I quickly stopped it and grabbed hold of him and knocked him unconscious, we decided to swap him with our cat and soon as bad our go to experiment when we needed to swap something, I don't regret it either since later in the following paper it was found out that he regularly abused his daughter and made her do horrendous things (that was probably how he found out about the machine) so we eventually left the building and him an eggs machine to fly and move on with our lives, after all these years I decided to come back and see if for myself, again you have ta understand my wife died a couple years ago and my children are all away from home so I have plenty of free time, and little did I expect that our dear old cat and been able to escape his body\"  she finished her take and looked at you in anticipation to which you stared back in fascination at the story that has happened here not long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Soooo yah, that's how I came back and found you there, now I don't feel sorry for killing the masters but I do feel sorry for you, this so a nice body after all and I don't think you can keep a sane mind knowing it's in a state of undead right now, but I can still get you another body so you don't have ta stay in that one\" she says to you as she leaves the room a d walks into a room to admire herself in the mirror, \"man, you keep yourself in shape! Even dead you look amazing\" she compliments you. You with as you have to watch her fondle your breasts and slap your ass a couple time before finally returning her attention to you and asking \"so which body do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In fact, I can hardly remember being a dog. Maybe all this was just a dream. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See Liz who would tell your bitch started to become you in the same way that you're starting to become her, that's not wonderful Liz, or rather Spike !!\" Misty said with a Machiavellian laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply look at your old body with your tongue hanging, and in your state of happiness, you can not even make an attempt to move away from the king. The orgasm you feel is stronger and stronger than you could imagine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body looks around and continues, \"Well it seems like she's having all the fun she wants and she's enjoying it, let's consider it an equitable exchange, by mutual agreement.\" With that, Misty says, \"Let's leave our two dogs at ease and have a beer to celebrate their new life as a human spike or better LIz.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two come out of the barn let you get raped by Misty's dog you can not think the orgasm and the pleasure and very strong everything you feel and realize and that your dog is stealing your life and you have no idea why Misty is helping she.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what feels like an eternity, the king enjoys within you and dismounts. You collapse and lie in the barn hay, happy and content. But as soon as fear begins to grip you as you realize that you are becoming more and more like a dog, you must soon escape this fate that Misty is trying to give you before it is too late, you have to find a way to warn her Someone what happened.

Why did not I think of this before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then get up and start walking towards the exit door of the barn to try to find Kyle to try to tell what happened to you, however, when you start walking, the memories of your bitch begin to bloom and you start to think as it would be if the kids were out of the barn, you'd love to play ball with them. And where is that damn cat, you want to teach him a lesson. The memories of playing with children and chasing cats fill your mind, you realize that you are becoming the family dog, that your dog's memories are starting to get stronger in you, they are trying to replace your memories, you need to come back quickly otherwise you will end up thinking that it really is your dog.

You try to break free and scream for help, but everything that comes out is barking. Misty then approaches and comments<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Liz, I imagine you did not give up wanting your body back, did you?\" she bends down and begins to caress her head. You try to say yes, but you can only pronounce a yip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty smiles and looks at you. \"I've already told you that I will not help you get back into your human form, you have to accept your new life, but know that you did me a favor by becoming a dog by accident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is not sounding good, you think to yourself, then you start to whimper more. Misty continues to caress her head. \"Do not worry girl, you can trust me,\" she says with an evil grin. \"Besides, your old bitch is acting totally normal, as if nothing had happened, she does not want to be a dog again, all she wants now is to be human, is not it Liz?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Misty! It's great to be able to communicate and talk, with people instead of barking, I never thought that being human was so wonderful,\" Spike says in his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love this side effect of the machine, when you put the mind of an animal in a human body, the animal adapts quickly and does not want to stop being human. Too bad that in humans in animal body, this does not always work perfectly, mind human has the tendency to resist the change more, it is tries to cling to every ounce of hope of being able to return to being human again.Pretty that this is not going to happen to you \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cringe and realize that you are in a very difficult position where Misty has all the cards in your favor, so you start to whimper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not be sad, girl, I have a plan to solve this dilemma, where you will accept your destiny easier, it is very simple, you will know now ...\"</span></div></div>",

Mary who inhabits your body has a strong glow, while Mary\u2019s alternate ego that inhabits her old body has a very dull glow.<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Thank you, Thank you.\u201d Mary's body said, \"I thought I was done for.  Those pills backfired, they didn't work like when we were taking them and I was becoming the dominate consciousness.  How did you know that Darryl had overwhelmed me?\"<br>\r\nDarryl's body answers, \"It was easy, he was trying to act exactly like I would have.  You were always the more masculine part of us, the athlete, we have shared the same body since as long as we both can remember, and I think I can tell when you are in control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do?  How did you get him out of this body and get me back in control?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just turned off the safeties on the machine and pulled the data cable out of the pod I was going to stand next.  I figured correctly that he\u2019d shove me into the closest empty pod.  My only fear was that you were either to far gone to save or else you might accidently get transferred into oblivion with the real Darryl.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour original body plugs the cord back into the other pod and turns the machine settings back to normal.  \u201cNow I can get my body back and you can have the body you deserve.\u201d You watch as they step back into the machine and switch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey step out again,   You can tell that the weakened aura of the masculine version of Mary that you once cohabitated a body with was now in your old body and the bright glowing aura of the feminine version of Mary was back in her body.<br>\r\n\u201cThis is perfect we can have the lives we always wanted without the medication destroying one of us, you can be the sports jock that takes care of me and I\u2019ll be able to be the femmy girl I want to be and we won\u2019t get in each others way\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know I am so weak after those drugs, my mind is being overwhelmed by Darryl\u2019s memories, I think I\u2019m becoming him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary back in her body laughs, \u201cThat\u2019s perfect silly, we couldn\u2019t ask for anything better.  Don\u2019t you see? You are becoming your dream body.  We\u2019ll be the perfect couple, because we totally understand each other and you can totally blend into his life, nobody will every know what really happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both begin to walk away hand in hand.  You float down at them and try to enter your old body but bounce off.  Your old body looks at Mary and says, \u201cI felt a shiver up my spine.  It felt creepy.\u201d  <br>\r\nShe laughs and says, \u201cThat\u2019s just goose bumps\u201d, as they both start making out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch helplessly as your old body and Mary both make love to each other.  You notice the longer Mary\u2019s alternate personality stays in your body the stronger its aura gets and the weaker yours becomes.  If you don\u2019t get back into your body or into another body soon, you may just fade away.  What do you do? <br>\r\nYou figure you have two or three choices <br>\r\nChoice one try and get back into your body while its sleeping. Choice two find somebody who can see you.  The third choice is to go to the body switching machine and jump into a body in the instant when their mind has been pulled out to be swapped with another body.  The third choice you throw out for now it is a long shot and you are fading to fast to wait that long for somebody to show up to the body switching machine, but it might help you get your body back later.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You get up in the morning and realize this hasn't been a bad dream like you hoped, you are Goth girl Cami.  Her room is even dark and scary.  You look at your arms and you no longer see your aura.  You totally appear as a normal healthy young woman with very weird clothing, strange jewelry and bad makeup tastes.  You wonder where the real Cami is.  You go to the bathroom and look in the mirror you see yourself as Cami and you see a second reflection of her in the mirror also.  She looks pissed and you can tell she wants to get her body back.  You look at her say, \"look, I'm sorry; I need to get my strength back, before I switch back with my old self, you saw me yesterday I was almost totally faded away, and it scared the shit out of me.  Now that I'm in your body and have access to some of your knowledge I realize somehow those pill changed me where I'm no longer a exact match for my own body, I need to use the switching machine to force me back into my old body.  I am so sorry to do this to you, but as soon as I can, I'll switch back.\"<br>\r\nSlowly you turn around then you look back with an idea,<br>\r\n\"For letting me use your body, I'll help make you popular, I know everything Mary knows, I know everything I originally know, I can do this.\"  <br>\r\nCami image appears to be screaming 'No, I like who I am' in the reflection on the mirror, she continues to pound on it like she's trying to get out.  You really think you can help her be popular and are convinced its what\u2019s best for her, but where is this idea coming from is it your idea or Mary's old prejudices against anybody who is different.  You shake your head it\u2019s for Cami's best.<br>\r\nYou walk down stairs and see Cami's mom and say, \"Mom, I don't want to do this Goth thing anymore, can you take me outfit shopping and help me clean up my room.\"  Cami's mom looks so excited she jumps up and hugs you.  I am so glad you are out of this phase, she runs out and talks to Cami's dad.<br>\r\nCami's dad gets a surprised happy look on his face and gives Cami's Mom all the money in his wallet, his credit cards and his check book.   He yells in, \"I'll take care of everything in your room, I'm glad my little girl is back.  You both go out shopping.\"<br>\r\nAs you walk out the door you catch a reflection of Cami in the mirror she is totally pissed, she looks like she wants to kill you.  You say, \u201ctrust me,\u201d as you walk by.  It doesn't calm her down.  Cami's mother says, \"What was that dear?\"  You smile and say, \"Nothing, lets get shopping!\"<br>\r\nYou go to the store and your mom buys you a number of preppy outfits.  Then it\u2019s to the salon and you get your hair died back to its original flaxen yellow blond and your nails painted red from black.  You can't believe how hot Cami looks dressed up.  You think to yourself you are doing her a favor before you go get your body back.  <br>\r\nYou tell your parents how you want to go out for sports and cheerleading they look so happy.  You start running and riding bike.  You make sure not to take any more pills to harm the real Cami's personality after all you are a guest in this body.  <br>\r\nWhen you go out for Volley ball you realize you have all your original skill as Darryl, Mary's drive and Cami's quick intuition.  You dominate the game and even push Mary out of the captain\u2019s position.  The Coach say's Mary has lost a lot of her skills and strengths as a player, but he hasn't seen skill like yours in a long time.  It feels great to dominate the game and be so good at it. The coach mentions that you might get a free ride to college in a few years on a scholarship.<br>\r\nWhen you see Cami\u2019s reflection in the mirror she seems not to be as pissed about what you\u2019ve done,  She has gotten semi-transparent, her Goth makeup is gone, her hair matches yours and a lot of her movements match yours in the reflection.  <br>\r\nAfter a few weeks Cami's Dad has her room totally fixed up.  It is so girlie it would have made you gag when you were Darryl, but it seems perfect now.  You think wow, I've totally straighten out Cami's life, she's thinner, has new friends, more energetic and really showing off the natural wholesome beauty that she possesses.  Her parents are so happy and you seem happy, more happy then you\u2019ve been for a long time.<br>\r\nThat night you go to the mirror to gloat and show Cami her new life.  You realize that you've been so caught up in improving her life and showing up Mary at school that you've totally lost track of how the real Cami was doing.  What you see is, you as a skinny preppy version of Cami and a very faint image of the real Goth Cami over imposing yours.  She has almost totally disappeared.<br>\r\nThis is horrible she's worse then I was when I took control of her body.  <br>\r\nI can't let you fade away Cami; you lie down in bed and use her memories to try and astral project.  I am so sorry you whisper.  You enter an almost trance like state, you see what\u2019s left of the real Cami's personality stuck in the mirror.  You try and project out of her body, but instead watch as what\u2019s left of her begins turning from the gothic image to almost a mirror image of her new body she then seems to dissolve into a gaseous state and drift from the mirror into you.   As this energy enters you can feel all her fears, wants, desires, everything she is all her hopes and dreams become yours.  As she fades into you, a faint voice echoes in your mind, 'I've always loved you Darryl, I've always wanted to be with you, but never knew how.'  With that the voice was gone.  <br>\r\nYou jump up out of your trance and go to the mirror and look for any signs of Cami.  After staring and hoping you realize you've waited to long.  How could you do this to her?  How did this happen, you purposely didn't take the drugs to protect her.  <br>\r\nHer thoughts are so mixed with yours now, you know she did this to save you; she wants you to stay here together as her.  You are now a mixture of 3 people, your personality is Darryl's, your memories are mostly Cami's, but you do have Mary's feistiness and internal strength.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And what's wrong, Mary? Why are you crying?\" Wendy, Mary's best friend, asks. Her other friends stop what they were doing and look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to wipe the ruined mascara from your face and answer, \"Daryl broke up with me! He's going out with Julie now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julie that slut!\" Another friend you didn't know remarked. \"What a total bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll deal with her after the party, ok?\" Wendy offered. \"I'm not missing a second with Jason at the party!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls started giggling and talking. You know that Jason Stevenson is a jock at the high school and that he is the perfect man but only recently broke up with his girfriend. And he is coming to the party, apparently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour of finishing the preparations and waiting for people to come (which didn't take too long as Mary was popular as well), the house party began. You've never been to an all-out house party, but this one could be compared to the ones cliched in the movies, except people aren't destroying the furniture and getting drunken hammered and throwing up in the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to act like Mary, talking with friends mostly and taking drinks when offered. Bad idea to be drinking shit that might have something more than alcohol in it, but you can be mad at yourself later. People wouldn't drug anything, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to get buzzed and lose control of what you're saying and/or doing. Hopefully you didn't say anything about the switch between your body and Mary's gorgeous body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that evening as the party started to reach it's best and everyone had showed up, someone brought stereos and cranked the music up all the way on some rap songs. You remember dancing... or was it singing? in the living room kareoke-style with people equally drunk as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think you said something to leave that room, so you went up to Mary's bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swung open the door, slamming it against the wall, but no one cares-- Mary's parents were gone for the entire night and most of the partiers were somewhat drunk anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were startled to see someone on Mary's bed. He took your dainty hand and sat you on the bed. He shut the door and was equally as drunk. You both talked for a little while, over what you can't remember. He was breathing hard and you think you remembered seeing a bulge in the guy's jeans. Then, you had passed out, whether by alcohol or by some drug (which is the less likely) you can't be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you wake up that next morning, you examine the house with a hang-over. Who was the guy that you had talked with (and hopefully did nothing else with)?</span></div></div>",

You grinned to yourself as you went to wake Julie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Juliiiiieeee,\" She groggily sat up.  She realized it was you just as she was getting out of the bed at about the same time you found out she slept in a thin bra and panties.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>About a hundred different questions ran through your head as you stood there staring at the strange machine, growing all the more excited with each passing second. Being able to switch bodies with someone and live out their live, well it was...it was...it was like some crazy plot line from a comic book, not something that you ever imagined could actually be <i>real!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally managing to tear your eyes away from the machines impressive workings, aware that this discovery was just way too big to keep to yourself, you then quickly turned and sprinted back out of the machine shop to find anyone you could to show it to - little caring who it actually was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately you found your immediate surroundings to be pretty much deserted (apart from all the chickens that were milling around your feet), due to it being just after breakfast and everyone having gone off in various different directions. Your dad was out in the far fields somewhere working on a tractor that had broken down the day before. Your little sister, Tara had gone off 'exploring' again with the dog and was probably God knows where. And your twin sister Katy, as far as you were aware, had headed over to her friend Julie's house to do...whatever it was teenage girls did with themselves. That just left your mom, who had the last time you'd seen her been cleaning up all of the breakfast dishes as everyone piled out the door. \"Mom it is then I guess,\" you said with a shrug, realizing that she probably wasn't the most ideal person (and probably wouldn't believe you either), but just needing someone to tell, no matter who it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpotting her through the kitchen window, busily washing dishes as you rushed towards the house, you immediately began shouting before you'd even stepped foot in the door, giving her quite a fright as you did. \"Mom! Mom! You're not gonna believe what I just found in the old machine shop! It's totally awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting over her initial surprise, your mother looked at with a rather similar expression of disinterest that she greeted most news about the farm with (not being quite as enamored by the place as the rest of you were). \"Don't tell me...\" she sighed, returning once again to the dishes, \"Is it another old piece of junk that your father is going to spend days fixing instead of doing something useful?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Guess again,\" you told her, shaking your head, \"It's an actual real life, fully functioning <i>body switching machine!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A body switching machine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you know, like in the movies and stuff. A machine for actually changing bodies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom wasn't buying this for a second, scoffing, \"Seriously Daryl, you expect me to believe that? I'm your mother remember. I'm not as gullible as your little sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you're not, and I'm not making it up. Seriously, come look and see! There's the secret door in the back of the machine shop, it leads right to it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A secret door?\" she replied, raising an eyebrow, presuming that you must have somehow been confused. \"Are you sure it's not just a store room and this 'body switching...thingy' isn't just some old piece of farm equipment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no way! It's way too advanced looking to be farm equipment,\" you assured her, the machine being leaps and bounds ahead of anything else in the machine shop, \"Besides, there's a manual and everything that explains what it does! C'mon, please! Please come and look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a another sigh, your mother finally gave in, telling you, \"Oh alright. If it'll make you happy. But you have to finish up the dishes in exchange Mr.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Whatever,\" you agreed, grabbing her the by the hand, \"Just come look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that you quickly led your mother out of the back door and across the yard, towards the machine shop, a place that up until now she hadn't actually stepped foot in. \"So this is what your father does with all of his spare time?\" she muttered disparagingly as she gazed at all the various pieces of dusty old, half rusted machinery lying about the place, presumably looking for the thing that had gotten you so excited. Ignoring this and instead continuing on towards the hidden door you'd discovered not fifteen minutes prior, you went inside, stopped in front of the two large pods and awaited her reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on earth is that?\" she asked, stopping in her tracks and staring at the machine with a look of both surprise and confusion, having presumably not expected to find anything quite like this - it being way more advanced than anything else on the farm, what with the many flickering diodes, LCD screens and God knows what else on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already told you, it's a body swapping machine!\" you grinned, unable to repress your own eager excitement as you quickly ran over towards it and grabbed the manual up off the floor, presenting it to her. \"See!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the manual from you and opening it up, you watched as your mother's skeptic curiosity soon gave way to complete and utter shock as she soon realized with her own eyes that it was indeed exactly what you'd been trying to tell her it was. \"Oh my God,\" she gasped, almost dropping the booklet to the floor as she looked back up at the machine, then over at you, then at the machine again, her jaw hanging open, \"This...this is <i>incredible!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy that she was in agreement with you and feeling even more excited now that you had someone to share in this amazing discovery, the two of you quickly fired questions and theory's at one another about where it came from and what it was built for, and even if it did indeed work. Surprisingly though, it was your mother, not you, who posed most of these questions before you'd even had the chance, appearing positively enamored with the thing and at the prospect of actually becoming someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you imagine it? Swapping bodies? Becoming someone else? It would be an absolutely incredible experience. Like nothing anyone had ever done before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it would be totally cool,\" you grinned, having been thinking about all this since you first discovered it, asking then, \"You think we should test it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even missing a beat, your mom rather enthusiastically replied, \"Of course! Don't you want to see it in action, sweetheart? Don't you want to swap bodies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah. But I mean, do we know if it's safe and stuff? And I mean, do we really have anyone to swap bodies with? Dad's not here. Neither is Zack or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daryl, sweetheart. We don't need your father or anyone to try it out. We're both here. Me and you can test it out and see if it works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me and you?\" you replied somewhat taken aback, having not been prepared for this suggestion. \"You mean <i>us</i> swap bodies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" she nodded. \"We can test it out right now and find out for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But won't that be...I dunno, kind of weird? Me becoming you and you becoming me? You are a girl after all...and <i>my mom</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis fact didn't seem to bother her however, as she glanced over at you and giggled, \"<i>And?</i> Don't you want to experience what it's like to be in the body of a woman...to be someone completely different from yourself?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou supposed this was true, and in all honesty it would be kind of cool to see what it's like to be a girl. Still there was a bit of a difference between being a girl and being your own mother, and you couldn't help but feel a little embarrassed at the thought of having...well her parts, so weren't entirely sure what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And besides, we're just testing the thing,\" she continued, clearly not feeling the same, \"So what does it really matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving in then, figuring she had a point and that you wouldn't be her for long, you told her, \"I uh, I guess,\" reminding yourself again that this was a body switching machine sitting there in front of you and anyone else would give their right arm to try it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy with this answer, your mother then eagerly smiled, \"Excellent. Then hop in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing as instructed as your mom had a final little read over the instruction manual to make sure you followed everything to the letter, you climbed into the left pod and got yourself comfy (or as comfy as you could). Your mother then set all the various buttons and switches to the correct positions on the control panel and climbed into the other pod, before looking over at you and asking, \"Okay, sweetheart, you ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready as I'll ever be,\" you replied, feeling a nervous anticipation taking over your body at the prospect of actually working and becoming her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here goes nothing then,\" she said, looking just as nervous and as excited as you were, as she reached over and pressed the big red button beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA matter of seconds later, the machine began to hum, the sound growing impressively louder and louder until it abruptly stopped and a huge flash of blinding white light suddenly shot out from the pods completely obscuring your vision for a second before quickly vanishing, leaving you breathing heavily your pod, unsure of what exactly had just happened...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The first of which was the feeling of air on your exposed skin.  You were wearing your mom's sleeveless blue sundress which left your arms and legs quite bear. The machine worked.  You were now a 32 year old woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext you noticed some strands of red hair in your eyes.  You reached up and felt your mother's bangs on her forehead.  You ran your fingers through her long thick hair.  It went down past her shoulders.  You gave it a tug, just to make sure you weren't dreaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext you looked at your hands.  Your skin was lighter toned.  Your fingers were long and slender. Your nails were painted a bright red.  On your left hand, you saw your mother's wedding ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour new hands didn't keep your attention for long as soon your eyes were drawn to the two large, cream-colored, mounds on your chest. You cupped them in your hands and gave them a squeeze watching them shift and move under the fabric of your sundress. Keeping your hands on your chest, you looked down at the rest of your body.  Your wide hips, your slender, smooth, legs and your tiny sandaled feet with toenails that matched your fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the pod door swung open and you saw your old body grinning at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daryl! It worked!  We've switched bodies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly tore your hands away from your chest and put them awkwardly by your side<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha\" your mom laughed \"I see you're wasting no time getting acquainted with your new assets.  They're technically yours now, so you can do what you want with them.  I told you you'd enjoy being a women\" she winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took your first steps out of the pod and realized just how different this body was.  Your hips now swayed.  Your breasts bounced up and down. It really was an incredibly strange feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...what do we do now?\"  you said, hearing your new feminine voice for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" your mom replied \"If I remember correctly, you agreed to finish doing the dishes.  I think we should spend a few hours taking our respective bodies for a test drive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few hours? I thought we were just going to see if it works...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, where's the fun it that?\" your mom asked \"You could learn a thing or two from being in my body for a day.  Plus, I saw you feeling yourself up...don't tell me you didn't enjoy that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did have to admit that all the new sensations were rather intoxicating.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\" you agreed \"but what are we going to do about the rest of the family?  Am I supposed to just pretend to be you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While it would be fun to fool everybody, it might also be fun to tell the family about this machine.

He walked up to his father in his new wedge hells and tripped. \"Lots to get used to around here dad.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle looked to his wife then to his son and could tell something was wrong. \"You two swapped bodies?! That's the most perverted thing I've ever heard!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh relax Kyle\" Liz said to her nervous husband. \"It's still me, only now I'm your son.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy?\" Tara said to Daryl as she tugged on his dress. \"Not anymore twerp. Hahaha now I can mess with you from inside mom's body!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Daryl be kind to your sister, well daughter.\" Liz said with a laugh. \"Come on you two, give it a try!\" She said walking over to the machine.</span></div></div>",

It might be fun!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad was standing with his arms crossed like Tara always did when she was acting like a brat, \u201cNonsense!  I\u2019m the father and I make the decisions around here remember?  I\u2019m not walking around in my own 10 year old daughter\u2019s body!\u201d  Dad didn\u2019t realize it, but he stomped Tara\u2019s foot like she always did when she was mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody else laughed seeing Dad act so much like Tara.  Now the shortest and youngest member of their family, Dad looked up confused, \u201cWhy are you all laughing?  Get back in the pod now young lady!  We need to switch back!\u201d  Everybody continued to laugh and Dad let out another shriek, \u201cOMG!  Come on!  What is so funny?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Daryl\u2019s teenage boy\u2019s body, Mom patted Dad on the head and tried to hold back her laughter, \u201cRelax sweetie.  It\u2019s just hilarious for us to watch you act just like Tara.  You have her exact facial expressions when she\u2019s mad and the same mannerisms. You even stomped your foot like her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad finally let out a smirk \u201cI did?  Wow?  I guess that makes sense since I\u2019m in her body.\u201d  Dad decided to relax and have some fun.  He recalled a recent outburst that Tara had last week about not being able to wear makeup yet.  Dad imitated her, \u201cUgh!  You are so unfair Mom and Dad! I can\u2019t believe you still treat me like a little girl.  I\u2019m 10 years old you know!!??\u201d  Dad stomped Tara\u2019s foot again and pretended to walk away mad.  Dad turned back just like Tara did during her outburst and shrieked, \u201cUgh!  I hate you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody laughed hysterically after watching Dad do a perfect imitation of Tara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay!  My turn!\u201d  Daryl said joining in on the fun.  Since he had Mom\u2019s body, he did an imitation of her.  Daryl quickly ran into the kitchen and put Mom\u2019s apron on,  \u201cWhat happened in here!!??  I can\u2019t believe you kids!  I cleaned the house all day and you are home for 10 minutes and completely mess it up!  Clean it up now or you are both grounded for a week!  And no phones at the dinner table or I\u2019m taking them away!  Kyle honey, can you please turn down the TV?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara jumped in on the imitations.  She quickly sat down in Dad\u2019s favorite chair and sat like Dad always did with his hand slightly down the front of his pants, \u201cI can\u2019t turn it down now!  The game is in overtime!\u201d   Everybody laughed and Tara then ran into Dad\u2019s closet.  Moments later, she came back wearing his jogging shorts and t-shirt.  She went back to everybody else and did a few stretches with Dad\u2019s body.  She sarcastically imitated Dad again by looking at his watch, \u201cIt\u2019s 5 am!  I\u2019m going for my daily run!  Gotta get 5 miles in every day! Want to join me Daryl?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom quickly ran into Daryl\u2019s bedroom and jumped under the sheets.  Mom did an impression of Daryl, \u201cUgh!  Leave me alone Dad! You know I always sleep in until 10.  I\u2019m a lazy teenage boy! Can I borrow 10 dollars?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody continued to laugh after they each did an impression of the body they were in.  After a few moments,  Dad looked up at his former body with an uneasy feeling, \u201cUh oh Tara.  I think your body needs to pee.  It must have been all this laughter.  We should get back into the pod and switch bodies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom interjected, \u201cSo soon?  We just started having fun!  I have a bunch of funny impressions I still want to do with Daryl\u2019s body!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaryl agreed, \u201cI agree!  I have a few more Mom impressions I want to do!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara looked down at her normal body and nodded, \u201cThey are right!  I still have some good Dad impressions that I just thought of!  Here\u2019s one now!\u201d  Tara stood up in and pointed Dad\u2019s finger like he always did when he was making a point, \u201c\u2026 I\u2019m the one who earns the money around here to put food on the table.  As long as you live in my house, I make the rules!\u201d  Everybody snickered as Tara continued, \u201cIs that clear young lady?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad laughed at Tara\u2019s impression of him and replied, \u201cYes Daddy.\u201d  They both laughed again causing Dad have to pee even more.  Dad knew everybody else wanted to stay in their current bodies so he finally agreed, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll think of some more impressions while I\u2019m using the little girl\u2019s room!\u201d  Out of habit, dad headed towards the master bathroom.  Daryl cut him off.  Daryl also felt Mom\u2019s body needed to pee after laughing so hard.  Daryl pointed down the hallway to the kid\u2019s bathroom, \u201cSorry sweetie, but the little girls room is down there!  You better hope your brother didn\u2019t pee on the seat!\u201d  Daryl winked as he went into the master bathroom.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad groaned as he headed towards the kids bathroom.  It was much smaller than their fancy master bathroom.  But he knew the rules about the kids never using their bathroom.  Since he was currently one of the kids, he would have to use theirs.   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The oldest daughter, Katy, had just gotten home.  While Dad was figuring out how to pee as a girl, the rest of the family had obviously filled in Katy about the secret body switching machine.  Katy looked wide eyed at her little sister\u2019s body and smirked, \u201cDad?  OMG?  I can\u2019t believe that\u2019s really you!  That\u2019s so exciting that the machine actually works.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad gave a smile and did a curtsy with Tara's ladybug dress, \u201cYep!  It works just fine! We\u2019ve been doing funny impressions of each other.  Want to give it a try?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty nodded and said, \u201cSure!  I have a great idea for a Mom impression!\u201d  Katy looked at her mother\u2019s body and said, \u201cCome on Mom!  Let\u2019s get into the pods!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom\u2019s body giggled, \u201cThat feels so weird to be called Mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty nodded, \u201cOh yea.  I forgot all of you have already been using the machine.  Who are you again?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Daryl.  Mom and I were the first ones to switch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty replied, \u201cOkay Daryl.  My turn to impersonate Mom!  Let\u2019s get in the pods!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaryl grabbed Mom\u2019s breasts and jiggled them up and down, \u201cAwww.  Already?  I was just getting used to these!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty pushed Daryl into the pod and activated the machine.  Moments later, they swapped bodies.  Daryl was the first to step out and still had his hands up from fondling Mom\u2019s breasts.  But now he had two handfuls of Katy\u2019s boobs.  Daryl joked, \u201cHmmm.  Not bad Katy.  Mom\u2019s are much bigger but yours are much more perkier!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty stepped out of the pod and took a moment to look at her new body, \u201cWow!  This is crazy.  I still can\u2019t believe this works!\u201d  Looking over at Daryl who was still feeling her normal body\u2019s boobs, Katy said, \u201cAhem!  Hands off the merchandise please!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaryl stuck his tongue out, \u201cWhatever.  It\u2019s technically MY body for now!\u201d  Daryl put his hands down and then concentrated on Katy\u2019s lower body.  Katy was wearing a tight pair of jeans. Daryl felt Katy\u2019s butt and was confused, \u201cUh?  What am I wearing?  Everything feels so tight?  It feels like there are things poking into my body from everywhere!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty nodded, \u201cYou are wearing my thong you idiot.  Us girls wear them to make sure our panty line doesn\u2019t show.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, cool!\u201d Daryl ran to a mirror to check out Katy\u2019s butt in the mirror.  However, after uncomfortably touching Katy\u2019s crotch through the jeans, Daryl asked, \u201cAre you sure this thong is on right?  I had Mom\u2019s pussy for awhile and it didn\u2019t feel like this?  It\u2019s like there is something else poking completely inside?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing Daryl say the word pussy, Katy rolled her eyes, \u201cCan you please refrain from using that disgusting word while you are in my body?  It\u2019s very unladylike!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaryl replied, \u201cWhatever.  Mom\u2019s VAGINA didn\u2019t feel like this!  Daryl pulled Katy\u2019s skinny jeans slightly away from her crotch and looked down her panties.  Daryl finally noticed a string was dangling out of Katy\u2019s vagina.  Daryl looked up shocked, \u201cNo way!  Is that what I think it is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty winked, \u201cYep!  It\u2019s a tampon!  I just started my period today!  Enjoy those cramps while you\u2019re in my body!\u201d   Daryl quickly replied, \u201cGross!  Let\u2019s get back in the pods!  I want Mom\u2019s body back!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty laughed, \u201cSo soon?  I thought you liked my perkier boobs?  Just like you mentioned a second ago, its technically YOUR body now right?  So deal with it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaryl groaned as they walked back out to meet the others.  Katy immediately went into her Mom impersonation.  She strolled around the living room acting like Mom always did and said a few jokes making fun of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next 10 minutes, everybody continued to take turns doing funny impersonations of the bodies they were in.  At times the jokes got mean, but everybody still had fun enjoying how unique the situation was.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She made everybody a sandwich and placed them at the table.  It took everybody a moment to find their current body\u2019s appropriate seat at the dinner table.  Now in Tara\u2019s spot at the table, Dad couldn\u2019t resist another impersonation as he pouted like Tara always did, \u201cUgh!  I\u2019m totally not eating this!  I wanted macaroni.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Dad\u2019s body, Tara interrupted and said what Dad always says, \u201cThat\u2019s what we are having for lunch princess!  Eat it or it goes in the trash!\u201d  Tara grabbed Dad\u2019s sandwich and pretended to throw it in the trash.  Dad jokingly replied, \u201cOkay okay!  I\u2019ll eat it.\u201d  With a cute smile, Dad added, \u201cCan you atleast cut the crust off for me Daddy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody burst out in laughter seeing how perfect the impersonation was.  Tara was always particular about what she ate and was always complaining at the dinner table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty noticed that Daryl got up to make another sandwich and quickly corrected him, \u201cNot so fast!  Only one sandwich with my body okay?   It\u2019s swimsuit season and I don\u2019t want you to gain me any weight!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaryl thought about her comment and suddenly wondered what it would be like to wear one of Katy\u2019s swimsuits.  Daryl suggested, \u201cHmm.  That\u2019s a good idea.  Anybody up for a swim after lunch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Daryl\u2019s body, Mom also smiled, \u201cThat sounds like a fun idea!  I\u2019d like to see what walking around shirtless feels like!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Dad\u2019s body, Tara agreed, \u201cMe too!\u201d  Tara then reached into a bag that was lying on the counter from a shopping trip last weekend.  She pulled out a brand new yellow one-piece swimsuit and held it up to her former body, \u201cThis is perfect opportunity!  I was hoping to be the first one to wear my new bathing suit.  But given the opportunity, it will be great to see how it actually looks on me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad took the small one-piece and gulped.  The idea of wearing a woman\u2019s swimsuit was intriguing to Dad.  However, he would much rather try it as a woman with more assets like Katy or his wife, Liz.  Dad felt tiny in Tara\u2019s 10 year old body and wondered if anybody would want to use the secret body switching machine again and switch places.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Mom\u2019s body, Katy did her best to sound motherly, \u201cSettle down everybody!  You know the rules.  No swimming for 30 minutes after eating!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody laughed and decided what to do next.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm you now and you're me....It's freaking incredible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you'd never seen her act quite like this before and she was admittedly doing quite a good job of pretending to be you, you weren't really in the mood for this right now, telling her, \"Okay. Whatever...\" before grabbing the instruction manual and heading over to the control panel of the machine to try and figure out where you'd gone wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother however wasn't ready to stop just yet, still giving it all she had with this rather pointless performance. \"'<i>Whatever</i>'? Are you serious? We just swapped bodies and you're like 'whatever'?! This is way better than 'whatever'! This is the greatest discovery in the history of the world! I mean I'm...I'm a chick!...Holy crap, I'm actually a chick....\" It was at this point that her voice sort of wavered, and looking back up from the booklet you saw her attention once again focused on her own body - her eyes lingering on her large chest for a lot longer than you would have deemed appropriate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, as funny as this wasn't to begin with, it definitely wasn't funny now. Your mom was acting way too creepy for your liking and making you feel more than a little uncomfortable. As far as you were aware she'd never been that great of an actress, but here she was giving an almost Oscar worthy performance as fourteen year old boy in an adult woman's body - moving and talking in a manner that was far more familiar as...well, <i>as you!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, seriously, mom, just quit it will you! You're freaking me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom? Why do...why do you keep calling <i>me</i> mom?\" she replied, sounding rather disturbed. \"...What the hell is going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I wanna know!\" you shot back, feeling your own growing sense of unease quickly building (your gut telling you that something was seriously wrong indeed).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We...we switched bodies...Didn't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we didn't! We're still in our own bodies! I'm Daryl and you're my mom, so will you please stop pretending like you're me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buh...but...No. No way! You have to be mom,\" she said, her voice trembling now with desperation. \"<i>I'm Daryl!</i> I'm your son and <i>you're</i> my mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point that the realization of what had happened suddenly hit, seeing the fear and sincerity in your mother's face, and standing there staring at one another for almost a full thirty seconds while this information sunk in, you both then simultaneously squeaked (as if indeed you were the same person) \"...oh shit!\" The body swapping machine might not have worked as intended, but it had definitely done something...something which was just too freaky for words!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God. I think that somehow the machine has switched mom's mind with mine,\" you said, attempting to understand it as you did (your 'mom' clearly doing the same as well), \"So that you think you're me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" she responded, shaking her head defensively, \"<i>I'm me.</i> It must have switched <i>your</i> mind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't make any sense, how can it switch my mind? ...I'm already me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you thought? How do I know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I am!\" you yelped, finding it utterly bizarre that you were having to actually prove your own identity, before of course realizing that your 'mom' was obviously feeling exactly the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, then prove it! When was the fist time I got into a fight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the 4th grade, after Billy Mackenzie tripped me up in gym class,\" you told her, shooting a question back of your own. \"Where was my super secret hideout in our old house, the one I used to keep Tara from stealing my toys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duh...in the attic, behind all those old lawn chairs,\" she replied with a shrug, as if finding the question way too easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding on a much harder question to ask then, you found yourselves once again (rather eerily so) hurriedly blurting out the exact same thing, asking \"Where did me and Mary have our first kiss?\", and answering almost immediately with \"Out in the woods by that gnarly old oak tree!\" - proving without a shadow of a doubt that it most definitely was your mind inhabiting your mother's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap,\" she gulped (or should you say he?), dragging her eyes back to her now middle aged hands, no longer looking quite so amazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. We're the same person,\" you said, still trying to wrap your head around it - it appearing for all intensive purposes that it was your mother standing right there in front of you. \"Or at least you think you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed was one of the more bizarrer conversation you'd ever had in your life (as if it wasn't bizarre enough already), as the two of you tried to figure out what the hell had gone wrong and how the machine had managed to screw up so badly, as well as trying to come to terms with the reality of your situation. Your mom, or the 'other you' was clearly having difficulty getting to grips with the fact that he wasn't who he thought he was, and you similarly were more than a little freaked out at having to deal with 'yourself' in the guise of your own mom. It was all just completely surreal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, after a rather exhaustive search of the manual and after somewhat unsuccessfully trying to retrace what your mom had done to the controls, the two of you ended up drawing a complete blank - having no idea what had gone wrong, nor how to fix it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand how this happened. It says nothing anywhere about copying brains or rewriting minds or whatever the hell this is,\" you sighed, chucking the manual to the floor and looking up at the 'other you' in frustration. \"How are we supposed to fix it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beats me,\" he shrugged, giving up his own overly thorough examination of the various dials and switches. \"If only we knew what mom did when she turned it on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't like...you know access her memories or anything like that then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, no,\" came his reply, laughing at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap! That would have been really useful too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith very little options remaining now - the only sensible, adult brain in the room having been replaced by your dorky one - you figured that there was nothing for it, you had to tell your Dad, hoping that he would somehow be able to reverse this and actually bring your mother back... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Putting this idea to him then, you saw a sudden look of realization appear on your mother's face as the 'other you', nervously yelped, \"No, wait! We can't! What if he fixes it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" you asked, pretty sure that's what you'd been trying to do for the last fifteen minutes or so. \"That's what we want him to do. Dad's good with mechanical stuff. If anyone can bring mom back he can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but...but what happens to me? If mom gets her own mind back, do I just like disappear or die or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't something you'd actually given any thought to, but in a way you supposed that was what in essence would essentially happen. \"Uhm, I...I guess so,\" you replied, getting the impression by his panicked look that that definitely wasn't what he wanted to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, the next words out of his mouth where, \"Then maybe this isn't such a good idea. I'm not sure I want to die. Not yet anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaced with a similar prospect, you weren't entirely sure you'd want to either, but still 'he' wasn't really anyone, he was just your mom who thought she was you, and you really did need to get your mom back. Treading as tactfully as you could then, you tried to assuage some of these worries by explaining, \"But you won't really. You'll just be who you're supposed to be - which is mom.\" pointing then to your own forehead as you added, \"You'll still be in <i>here</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You'll</i> still be in there,\" he said, mimicking your action by pointing at his own head, \"But the you that's in here...that is mom, he'll be gone forever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly there was no sneaking anything past yourself and you unfortunately couldn't really argue. \"Well technically, yes. But what are we supposed to do? <i>You're mom</i>, not me! You're not supposed to be in there. You can't just stay inside her body and pretend like everything's normal. It wouldn't be right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlumping against one of the pods, being of course aware of this himself (it was 'his' mom too his mind had overwritten after all), he replied sadly, \"Yeah, I know. It's just...I've, well, I know I'm not really you, but it totally feels like I am. And here I am inside someone else's body...experiencing something that nobody has ever done, and you're wanting to change me back already!\" You could see where this was going, but you let him continue on, really feeling for his predicament. \"Couldn't I just stay a little while? Not forever, but just long enough to truly experience what it's like, and maybe have some fun with it. Don't tell me it wouldn't be totally awesome to have yourself as your 'mom'? We could totally play video games all day, and I could let you off with all kinds of shit, and we could do whatever the hell we want because I'm an adult now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly that was kind of a fun thought - being your own parent (though a slightly surreal one at the same time) - and you didn't doubt having yourself for company wouldn't be a blast. Heck, who'd be more fun to be around than someone who likes and hates all the same stuff as you do, knows everything you know, and who you wouldn't have to worry about upsetting or annoying, cause he's exactly the same as you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please,\" he begged, snapping you from your thoughts, your mother's pleading face being a sight you don't ever think you'd seen before. \"Come on, dude, you know it'll be awesome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile probably not the wisest decision you'd ever made, your curiosity did eventually win out, figuring that there'd be no real harm in letting him stay for a little while. And so you told him, \"Okay. I guess.\" watching as his face instantly lit up. \"But on one condition...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, anything! Name it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we're not going to tell dad, then we've got to figure out how to fix this thing ourselves. Agreed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it!\" he beamed, looking like he would have agreed to just about anything as he enthusiastically jumped up off the pod and began doing a stupid little dance. A stupid little dance that you often did when things went your way, and which seeing now, performed by your mother's body, looked absolutely ridiculous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he'd gotten this out of his system and you made a mental note to stop dancing like that in the future, you asked yourself, \"So...what now?\" having no real idea what to do now, this whole thing being a very unreal and confusing situation. Not that you couldn't see the funny side though, adding jokingly as an afterthought \"<i>...mom</i>.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With your eyes still closed tight, you slowly brought your hands to your face. You could feel your old facial features. But something felt, off. Your skin felt softer and smoother. Wondering what the heck had happened, you slowly opened your eyes. As you do you try and look down at your hands, only to have something block your view. As you brush it away you notice that it's long red hair like what your mother has. Upon further inspection you discovered that you were wearing her blue sundress, heeled sandals, underwear, and even her red nail  polish on your fingers and toes. Now that you thought about it, you could even feel her makeup. Slowly, you pushed open the pod door and stepped out. Looking around you noticed your mother doing the exact same thing in your clothes, all magically resized to fit her perfectly. That's when it hit you that her clothes fit you perfectly as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha, what's going on\" mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, I don't know\" you replied. \"I thought that this was a body swap machine, not a clothes swapping machine\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we should probably try and change back.

Not now. Not while we're stuck like this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let's see if we can find dad and see if he can fix this, and us\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we don't have any other choice right now\" mom replied with an extremely long face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou followed your mom out of the shed, stumbling a bit from time to time due to the heeled sandles she had put on this morning. After the short walk back to the house, you immediately went to your room to change out of your moms sundress. However, the moment you got in there and looked through what had been your clothes you realized that somehow more had changed than just what the two of you were wearing at the moment. Pulling a pair of jeans out of your closet you discovered that they also looked as though they would no longer fit you but rather your mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moooom\" you called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Daryl\" she said as she walked into your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like whatever happened to what we were wearing also happened to all of our clothes. These won't even fit me anymore\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and did you notice the family photo in the hall. It seems like somehow the machine changed our lives or something like that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's ridicules\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It makes more sense than any else right now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess your right\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, so how about this.

You think to yourself.  You look up at the bathroom window again. He's taking a polish shower spraying himself with deodorant.  NO WAY... you can see him in the window spraying himself with Febreze.  You shake your head.  You always tell him if he wants to get a girlfriend instead of playing video games in the morning if he'd just take time to shower this wouldn't be an issue.  You wonder why you are friends with the kid sometimes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is dragging on forever.  You see him rummaging in his bedroom window looking for a T-shirt.  No way... what is the matter with this kid.   His Mom yells up to him again.  \"ZACK are you coming down.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear him reply.  \"I\u2019m almost there MOM.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think I\u2019m going to give him an atomic wedgy when he gets down.  Could this kid be any slower.  You think to yourself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Zack running down the steps and stumbling the last couple almost plowing into the door.  Classic Zack you think to yourself.  Zack steps out side and shuts the door behind him.  He opens his mouth and he starts stuttering.   Ka-Ka-Ka-KA-tty  wow, yoooou sure smell pretty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mouth drops open\u2026.  This cat is smooth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab him by the arm and say, \"Shut up dude you are embarrassing yourself.  Let\u2019s walk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get him away from the house.  You can see his mom watching out of the window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get any ideas Zack it\u2019s me.\"  Zack just sits and stairs at you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YO, eyes off the boobs, dude look at my eyes.\" you say as you point at your eyes.  <br>\r\nZack continues to stare at you breasts.  <br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD.... YOU are such a dork, no wonder you don't have a girl friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zack it\u2019s me Darryl.  Ask me a question only I would know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack just continues to stare at your breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F@%&amp; THIS DUDE!\"  You reach down and get a hold of Zack tight-ie white-ies by the elastic waist band and pull for all your worth.  You rip the elastic off and throw it at his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks at you in complete shock and says, \"......Darryl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That\u2019s what I've been trying to tell you. You are so dense sometimes.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack looks at you and asks, \"How did this happen.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell him about a mind switching device and that it would be easier to show him.  You take him to the secret door in the machine shed and show him the equipment.  You have to keep him on target because he keeps staring at your breasts and drifting off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you gonna help me get my body back or what, Zack?\"  You ask him, it is very hard to conceal your frustration with the guy.  You are starting to understand why girls get so frustrated with boys.  You hope you have never acted this way.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Zack,  me and you have to go to Krissy's party tonight!  I got to get my body back, the real Katy kind of flipped out I don't know what is going on.  Are you going to help me?\"  <br>\r\nZack finally says yes and that we should meet tonight at about 9.  This will work out perfect.  Now you have to pretend to be Katy for the rest of the Day so nobody gets suspicious.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The doors close and there is a brilliant white flash.  It feels like you are being ripped out of your body almost like a giant magnet is pulling you away.  As the lights dim you look down at your arms they are very hairy. <br>\r\nThe door opens up and you step out.  You see your body standing in front of the mirror.  <br>\r\n\"Wow I can't believe it worked, you old body says.  I got to play ball with your friends, I have so much energy.  I'll be back Darryl.\"<br>\r\nYour dad runs off in your body.  You wonder what to do, for some reason you are kind of tired and want to take a nap.  <br>\r\n\"Wow, I should get a beer and kick back and relax,\" you say out loud as you shut the secret door.  As you walk toward the house you see Rebecca Tara's hot school teacher she waves at you as she goes jogging by.  You wave back and start towards the house.  <br>\r\nShe comes jogging up behind you and grabs your butt.  <br>\r\nYou jump startled not realizing it was coming or that she was even behind you.<br>\r\n\"Where's Liz?\" She asks<br>\r\n\"Ahhh....\" You don't know what to say you've always had a crush on this woman and here it\u2019s almost like a dream come true except you are your own dad right now. <br>\r\n\"You are so cute. You are acting just like a school boy who has crush on me.\" She says looking over the top of her sun glasses and biting her finger nail very seductively. \"Well school boy, you should stop over and help teacher.  I have some special home work that you need to finish over at my place.\"  She smiles and says, \"I'll be next door, don't keep me waiting.\"<br>\r\nWith that she jogs off towards her house.  You are in total shock as you watch as she goes inside and waves at you.  You have dreamed about this for so long and now the day comes and you can't because the body you are in is married to mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go inside still in shock and grab a beer and come out and sit on the porch swing and start rocking back and forth drinking a nice cold one.  Wow this is crazy you think to yourself.  You are fighting every urge in your body to run over there.  Just then Zack and his Mom ride up on bicycles. <br>\r\n\"Where's Darryl,\" Zack yells.<br>\r\nYou almost spring up to go play ball with him, but realize you better not blow your cover and yell back, \"Playing ball over at the park.\"<br>\r\nZack goes peddling away while Misty comes up parks her bike and walks inside.<br>\r\nShe comes out with a brew and sits next to you.  She starts talking about how hard it is to find good men, how some women get all the breaks. Five beers later and a lot of small talk you both are really buzzed.  <br>\r\nMisty says, \"Well the boys will be over at my place after they get done with ball, Liz is away at her mothers with the girls for the weekend.  Looks like nobody here to keep an eye on poor daddy.\"<br>\r\nShe gives you a kiss on the cheek and says, \"I'd better lay down on the couch I've had a little too much.\"<br>\r\nYou can't believe this; Zack's smoking hot mom is hitting on you, Rebecca too.  Wow this is the day that you've dreamed of all of your life and you are stuck in your dad's body this is so not fair.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You start down the road and walk past Rebecca's place.  Her window is open you can hear her moaning and the sound of her vibrator.  <br>\r\n'Wow, this is so unfair.'  Farther down the street, you decide to walk to the park, might as well watch Zack and your dad in your body having fun playing baseball.  When you arrive at the park you don't see anybody.  <br>\r\n'Hmmm game must be over, might as well keep walking, stuck in my dads body on a beautiful night and nothing to do.

There in front of you, lying on the bed, was your very own mother dressed in what could only be described as an incredibly revealing, semi-transparent, silky white babydoll, displaying her mature, curvy body in a way you had never seen, or even imagined before. The thin material clung to her every curve, displaying her voluptuous, hourglass figure in it's entirety. Her breasts were pushed up and together by the lacy cups, creating the most spectacular looking cleavage and looking positively enormous to your eyes. Her long, smooth legs were left almost entirely bare, the babydoll ending less than halfway down her curvy thighs, and although the material wasn't entirely see-through, you were certain that between them you could just make out a dark patch of hair, indicating that she wasn't wearing anything beneath. \"Looks like someone did forget about our plans tonight,\" she smiled, tracing her hands slowly up her sides, before flicking our her long red hair, letting it cascade beautifully down her shoulders while you remained stood there in complete and utter shock, not quite believing what you were seeing. This was your mom standing there in front of you dressed up in the kind of silky, sexy lingerie you'd only ever seen before in magazines or in movies, <i>your mom!</i> And clearly from the sounds of it she had plans for more than just standing around letting you gawk silently at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Jesus...\" you quietly mouthed, barely able to speak as your eyes flittered frantically in disbelief from your mother's face (which looked as if it had been slightly made up), to those very large looking breasts that were practically bursting their way out of her top, and down to the dark patch that lay between her legs, letting out an audible gulp as all these things suddenly hit you at once; Your mom had dressed up for your dad, and as you were currently him that meant she had dressed up for you. <i>Your mom had dressed up in sexy underwear for you</i>...It was way to freaky to take!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling at your expression and misinterpreting your shock for lust, your mother flashed you another sexy little smile and said, \"Looks like you approve of my new outfit, Kyle,\" as she began slowly walking towards you, \"I picked it up yesterday especially.\" With your barely clothed mother now baring down on you, you instinctively began to back away, out of both nervousness and fear, knowing how incredibly wrong this situation was and how desperately you had to get yourself out of it, having your own mom coming onto you being beyond anything you'd ever experienced before. Unfortunately your mother moved faster than you, and as you awkwardly stumbled backwards towards the door, filled with panic, your eyes still locked on her voluptuous form, she reached out past you with her arms and pushed it closed, pressing herself up against your chest as she did and imprisoning you in the room. Feeling your mother's large, squishy breasts squashed between your bodies and looking at the wanton expression that was openly painted across her face, realizing that you were now trapped, you had honestly never felt so terrified in your entire life, a terror that was made all the worse by the fact that as disturbing and as downright wrong as this situation was, your penis (or rather your father's) was having the natural reaction to having a scantily clad, large breasted woman's body pressed up against you; it was beginning to grow hard!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh shit...oh shit-shit-shit-shit-shit</i>,\" you began to chant inwardly to yourself, growing short of breath as you realized what was happening, feeling slightly disgusted with yourself for growing aroused in front of your mother but being unable to help yourself. Here she was, dressed up for sex, looking every bit like the mom you knew, but at the same time completely different, as if she'd been transformed into some sort of sexy, mature, underwear model type, her body being every bit as impressive as the models you liked to look up on the Internet, and more so. This was not just a picture of some faceless woman from a far away place, this was an actual woman standing right there in front of you, and it was your mom! \"Mm, yeah, I'd say you definitely approve,\" she giggled, continuing her earlier comment as you suddenly felt her hand on your crotch, taking the breath right out of your lungs as she gave your penis a gentle tug. Up until this point you'd never had another person touch your cock, not even your girlfriend, so having your mom suddenly doing it out of the blue left you rather stunned (more so than you already were). Not that it didn't feel nice though, in fact it felt more than nice, you just couldn't get over how wrong it was, especially with your mother's pretty made up face winking at you, and the feeling of what you could only assume was her hard nipples poking through your shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting go of your crotch, she then twirled back round, showing off her big round ass as she slowly wiggled her way towards the bed, giving you a seductive little glance over her shoulder as she did, before laying down on it and very purposefully crossing her nicely toned, smooth legs. \"So cowboy,\" she teased, looking back up at you, \"Seeing as the kids are all out for the next couple of hours, what's say you get over here and give your beautiful wife the ride of a lifetime?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this caused you to let out another gulp as you processed what your mother had just said, not quite able to grasp the enormity of the situation, of having just been propositioned into sex with your own mother. It was just so surreal and freaky, like you were in a dream or something, and you knew deep down that you should just turn and get the hell out of there as fast as humanly possible...only you didn't. You instead just stood there, staring at the vision that was your mother, waiting for you, her eyes filled with lust for what she wrongly assumed was her husband, her every little move causing your penis to twitch harder. Her husband...<i>your father</i>, was currently as far as you were aware, out there somewhere doing it with your sister's friend, seemingly unconcerned with the fact that he was now 14 and having sex with someone over half his age, as well as cheating on your current girlfriend, Mary. If he was so unconcerned about it, then why shouldn't you be? After all, you'd already had two propositions so far tonight, two propositions that had left you incredibly horny and in need of release, so why shouldn't you take advantage of this opportunity? Sure she was your mother, your mom, the woman who'd given birth to you, who'd fed you, clothed you and raised you, and the thought of doing anything sexual with her was admittedly very wrong...incest even. But on the other hand, you were a horny 14 year old boy just out of adolescence, who'd never so much as seen a real life naked woman before, never mind had sex (you and Mary having yet to get past the making out stage). This was like every young boy's fantasy come true, to have a mature, attractive woman coming onto them, and though you'd never really thought much about it before, your mom certainly was attractive, her curvy body filling out that slinky babydoll perfectly and doing things to you you'd never even imagined possible. So would it be so wrong? You were technically her husband now after all...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She notices your sister on her bed fast asleep. \"Both my parents are at a party and they drugged sis. Probably with those sleeping pills mom normally uses. Those things are really heavy, she'll be asleep until tomorrow morning.\" You tell Julie as she wants to wake Katy up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least we'll be seen together and you know it might not be that bad they're gone.\" Julie says as she sits next to you and puts her hand on your lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julie, I really can't go anymore.

I mean, we have the age, we should enjoy ourselves at well.\" You say standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daryl, you know that I would like that, but we still have Tara around.

Wait that's it! You've got it. You'll just switch Katy and Tara. Katy in Tara's body would be awake and knowing she can take care of herself you could still go out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course the sight of Julie as your mom makes you hesitate, she clearly is trying to seduce you. You can feel your throat parched as she rises her skirt. You need to do something quick!</span></div></div>",

After a couple of hours, you where finally able to fix the problem, but you weren't sure if it would work. However before you could do anything else some walked in. It was Katy and Julie coming in and chatting about stuff, until they spotted Tara or should you say Daryl. Just great more problems to deal with. With your best impersonation of Tara you great them, \"HI Kety, hi Julie what brings you here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tara... what happened to your dress it's all dirty?\" Katy responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... w-ww-was looking for my dolls.\" You quickly looked for an answer while grabbing the dolls left by Tara. You where surprised that she was right, looking down at your self you see that your or should I say Tara's pink dress there was brown spots. Katy then looks at the machine and gets a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tara, did you know that this machine can swap you with anybody else\", Katy said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou where surprised that Katy knew about the machine, but she was clueless that she wasn't talking to Tara, but Daryl. You also wanted to test out the machine to see if it would work so later you could switch back. \"I would like to switch,  but with who..?\" You responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good question...\" both Julie and Katy said in union. </span></div></div>",

You where actually excited to be a cow and get milked and on the bright side you won't be in Tara's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\" Katy said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty was examining the contraption with a confused look on her face. \"How are we ever going to hook up Betsy to this she'll never fit on this pod. It looks like it's only meant for humans.\", she said with a disappointed look on her face.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a sec!\", said Katy as she pointed to an attachment on the side of the machine. \"Check this out! It must be some kind of adapter. It even has an adjustable strap. We can fit this on Betsy after all! Oh thank you Tara! We'll certainly bring home a first place ribbon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked nervously at the attachment as Katy ran out to get Betsy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if Betsy will be able to pass for you?\", she said as she scanned the notebook. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to be a cow for 2 weeks!? What have I gotten myself into?\", you thought as Julie read through the book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, here it is. She approached the machine and rotated a few dials. \"This should give Betsy a high enough intelligence to pass for you. She'll even be unaware of the change. It says we can wipe enough of her memory so she'll never realize anything was wrong. Don't worry.\", she said as your eyes got bigger. \"You'll keep your intelligence. Wouldn't be worth doing the switch if you couldn't understand Katy. Finally, Katy came into the room, pulling a very reluctant, and irritated cow into the hidden room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked a Betsy and began getting excited. You really want to spend a whole 2 weeks as a cow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, okay, let's get this over with.\", you said, trying to hide your concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the pod as the girls adjust the device and attach it to Betsy's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up!\", said Katy. \"She's not going to tolerate this much longer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could change your mind, you pushed the red button. You felt strange and disoriented as if you were being sucked out of your own body. Seconds later, you were looking at yourself in the pod. You tried to yell, but all that came out was a very loud \"Mooooooooooooo!\". Looking down, you could see your front legs and almost staggered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! Easy girl, I mean Tara,\"said Katy. \"Just calm down a minute until you adjust.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour vision was a little different than you were used to given the placement of your new eyes. After a few minutes, you felt comfortable enough to take a step. As you moved forward, you became very aware of your new, very full, udder swaying. A few more steps, and walking came much more easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you understand us?\", said Julie as she rubbed your head. \"Moo 3 times for yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moo... moo... MOOOOO...\", came out of your very thick and clumsy lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent!\", exclaimed Katy. \"Let's get you back before Mom or Dad notice. It's also time for your milking.\", she said with a wink. \"Why don't you two make sure Betsy, I mean Tara is okay. Get her out of here and close the door behind you. With any luck, she'll forget that this room is here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty led you toward the pen as Julie helped up your previous, and very confused body. \"How do you feel\", she asked you as you walked. So many new sensations hit you as you walked along in your new and massive body. \"Oh, you can't quite answer me.\", she realized and smirked. \"We'll have to work out a code. One moo for \"No\" and two moos for \"Yes\". That's how I'll be able to communicate with you. I bet this is exciting! I've always wondered what it would be like to be an animal. Maybe I'll try it out once you switch back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to admit, it was kind of exciting. No school or obligations. It could be a nice vacation. Everyone else would just see you as a simple milk cow. Eat, sleep and enjoy the outdoors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you reached the gate, Katy released you from the strap and led you into the pasture. Go ahead and eat and get to know the other cows.\", she said pushing you forward. \"It's time for dinner and Dad will be back any minute now. He'll need some help unloading the new livestock and we'll have to make sure Betsy has a clear enough head to help him unload. From now on, you're Betsy. Go on Betsy! We'll start rehearsing tomorrow girl. I owe you one!\", she said as she ran back toward the house.</span></div></div>",

He knew the mostly black furred cow was named Daisy and the other brown cow was Maggie. It was very strange looking at the cows eye to eye now that he was as big as them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaryl wandered over to a grassy patch and began to graze. His movements seemed much more natural now. He didn't have a whole lot of experience with the cows, but he didn't think it would be that difficult to pass himself of as Betsy. After all, cows really didn't do a whole lot. He wondered how Betsy was handling herself in Tara's body. A lot has happened and he doesn't even know where his old body is. He was worried what could Tara be doing in his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Daryl began chewing his cud, he looked up and saw his Mom walking towards the barn. \"It must be time for milking.\", he thought as he made his way to the milking area so he would be first. His Mom came out with a harness and looked at Daryl suspiciously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want any trouble this time Betsy. For once try to make this easy on me.\", said Liz as she attached the harness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she pulled Daryl toward the station, she gave \"Betsy\" an odd look. \"Katy's made a lot of progress with you. That's a GOOD GIRL!\", she said as she patted Daryl on his muzzle. \"You're so much more cooperative than normal. If you're this calm through your milking, I might have to give you a special treat. In fact, I do have a surprise for you later. I think you'll enjoy it quite a bit.\", said Liz with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaryl was wondering what kind of surprise she had in mind when all of a sudden his Mom began massaging his udder to get the milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA low moo escaped his big mouth as he felt a very pleasant feeling wash over him. \"Oh my God! This... feels... amazing!\", thought Daryl as he closed his eyes and relaxed. He thought that Tara would totally enjoy this, but right know he was enjoying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a very pleasant 10 or 15 minutes, Liz stood up from her stool and gathered the buckets full of warm milk. After storing the milk, she led a somewhat disappointed Daryl back to the pasture, praising him all the way back. \"Maybe I overreacted when I said you'd make a tasty steak.\", she said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaryl's eyes got big as he processed his Mom's last comment, but he quickly realized that his Mom was joking. After all, the fair was coming and Katy needed her prize cow. However, the comment did unsettle him quite a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting settled in the pasture, Daryl's mind wandered as he began grazing again. It wasn't long before he heard his Dad's truck driving up toward the house with a very large trailer in tow. After the car stopped, he saw his old body come out to help unload the trailer. Hm it seems Tara was doing fine in his body. He wondered what his Dad brought.</span></div></div>",

Katy came over to the edge of the fence and casually motioned him closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked up to see Katy, he was glad she stuck around. \"Looks like you've for some more company!\", said Katy with a smile. \"You seem to be adjusting well. We heard how much of a good girl you were from my Mom. Did you enjoy your milking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mooooo moo...\", said Daryl without thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty giggled and stroked his muzzle. \"That's what I thought. I can't wait to try it myself! Don't worry. It'll be a secret between us girls\" said Katy with a teasing smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever his eyes went to a distance.There, strutting into the pasture, was a very large black bull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh Betsy. I think you should enjoy being a cow, and maybe you might get your fist taste of being a cow. Also Tara this might be your first experience, so your hormones will be kind of strong but there will be more. See you tomorrow.\", said Katy. He shifted uncomfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no! I'm so screwed!\", thought Daryl as he stared at the massive male. \"In more ways than one.\" He has forgotten that Katy thought he was Tara, just great.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning,  Katy came by. Daryl kept his backside up against the fence. He saw Katy walking over to him with a smirk on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now Betsy. Don't let that bull wear you out tonight. We'll be getting up bright and early to practice for the fair. Looks like we'll have some calves running around soon. Want to see what it's like to be a Mother?\", teased Katy. She then added, \"We'll Tara technicallyrics your still young but your in Betsy's body so it doesn't matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you could do is moo, \"Mooooo.\" Katy then left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaryl really regretted switching with Betsy. He wished that he could switch back already, but knew that he must stick it out a few more weeks. After all, he couldn't quite ask them to switch him back. He really missed being able to talk and was growing bored. It was starting to get dark and he was now alone with the animals. As he began eating grass again, he noticed the bull had mounted one of the other cows. The cow moo'd very low as the bull rocked her back and forth. She was certainly enjoying herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Daryl watched, he began to wonder what it felt like. The milking he had earlier was amazing, but this... Could he really let that happen? After all, nobody would be even know. He felt a tingle as his mind wandered. Memories of being mounted by a bull flooded his mind. He remembered how great it felt the last time it happened. \"Last time!?\", thought Daryl. \"I must have triggered Betsy's memories and that might not be a good idea. It makes sense that I would have some of Betsy's memories considering that she probably has Tara's memories. I don't want to lose myself to her thoughts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMemories of giving birth flooded his mind as stood there watching the bull. He let out a very loud and long moo as the bull dismounted and looked over his way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck am I doing!?\", thought Daryl. \"I gotta get a hold of myself.\", as he tried to push the thoughts from his mind. \"But this hormones are so strong I just want him in my.\" He didn't realize that his body was walking on het own towards the bull. The closer that you got to the bull, the more excited you became. The musky smell became much more intoxicating as you approached. You were right by Buster now as you let out a soft moo and turned around to give him easier access. You felt like your heart was going to explode, but you knew that you were beyond the point of no return. \"Best go along for the ride now!\", you thought as you tried to convince yourself that it was for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large bull sniffed your rear and with his powerful back legs, lifted his front up to mount his eager mate. It was only moments before he found his target and started pumping away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MoooooOOOOOooooooooOOOOOOOOOO!\", forced it's way out of your large, thick lips. Your mind blanked as the euphoric feelings washed through it. \"Oh... OOOOOOO... OH MY GOD!\", you thought as the orgasm hit you. Your knees felt week as sexual pleasure let Betsy's instincts take control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 3 seconds later, it was done. The bull dismounted and walked away leaving you a bit disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes glaze over as you basked in the afterglow. Satisfied, you began to eat grass and walk around, making sure to stay close to your new mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the sessions weren't long, they were frequent. The bull mounted you at least 20 more times in the next few hours. You were certainly enjoying yourself. As the bull mounted you, yet again, you looked up to notice two girls staring at you. After a brief period, the bull dismounted after inseminating his favorite cow. Trotting up to get a better look, you noticed the taller one had an apple in her hand for you. As you approached the girls, two of them giggled and blushed as they began making noises. It took you a moment to recognize the one who held the apple as Katy. Ittook you even longer to realize that you could understand what they were saying. \"Oh my, Julie and Katy saw the bull mounting me.\", as the shock of the situation registered in your muddled brain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Betsy, looks like you are enjoying yourself.\", said Julie as she looked deeply into your large cow eyes. \"Still with us Tara?\", she whispered. \"Moo three times if you can understand me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you mooed three times, relief washed across Katy's face. \"Thought we lost you there for a minute. Well you're a good sport for sticking with it! I thought we'd at least give you the chance to change your mind. I'll have to think of an extra special reward for you once you're back to your old body! This new perspective might be good for you.\", said Katy with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he wanted to blame his instincts for taking over, he finally admitted to himself that it was his human mind that was curious. \"It's getting easier to slip into the roll of Betsy, but I am still able to snap back to human thinking with just a little effort. That was more me wanting to feel pleasure than Betsy wanting to reproduce.\", he thought as he went back to join the herd. \"Well, now that they saw me, I don't have to worry about hiding the act.\", you thought as you stared at the bull. \"What the hell. Since I don't have anything better to do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over to your mate so he can find you once he's rested a bit. Maybe if I start acting more like Betsy, they'll get worried and ask me again if I'd like to switch back. That shouldn't be hard to do.\" you thought as you relaxed your mind and let more primitive thoughts guide your actions for a while. You have to admit, it's very relaxing and erotic to slip into Betsy's thoughts. \"What's the worst that can happen? When they change me back, I'll get my human mind back anyways. I can snap out of it anytime I want to.\"</span></div></div>",

Very good. I've enjoyed myself a lot, too.\" She presses herself close to the guy beside her. Daryl.

You can just stand around anywhere, getting boned, and noone will care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, anyway, Betsy,\" Julie interrupts. \"I told Daryl about you and Tara swapping bodies. And that's when I found out about him and Tara. Or you and Tara. Well, you understand.

Or maybe switch with someone else. But I'm Daryl now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, yeah, we thought we'd come down here and see if you're still in there, I suppose.

In panic, you manage to get in two moos before he mounts you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so hot, Daryl,\" Julie says. \"She wants to swap back, but suddenly she's overcome by lust and have her brains fucked out of her. We're standing here, and she doesn't even care.\" You do care, but you can do nothing about it, with the ox on top of you, with Betsys instincts overriding you. \"I want you to take me right here, babe.\" You watch, your body in utter pleasure, your mind in utter despair, as Daryl and Julie fuck in front of you, watching them as they watch you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they are done, after Buster is done with you, your mind is in a haze, half gone.

It's like they stopped experimenting with it.\"<br>\r\nHe hands you the note book as he starts adjusting dials and settings.<br>\r\n\"Do you know what you are doing Zack? you ask as you start browsing through some of the warning in the scribbled into the notebook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne warning about changing the existing timeline.  It suggests the user of the time machine only had a certain amount of time after altering a timeline before your memories adjusted to the current timeline.  It also warned that the time line seems to find ways of \"healing\" itself after certain minor paradoxes. What does that mean?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zack we should probably read more about this.

Quickly you and Zack run outside and hide in some bushes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear parts of a conversation<br>\r\n\"Misty stay out of my lab!\" ... I will be gone tonight..... after you get back from the mall....stay home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as Misty walks in a huff towards a car that just pulled up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvidently you were watching Misty to closely for Zack's liking as he punched you in the arm. \"knock it off you mouth breather,\"he hisses. \"That's my mom.\"<br>\r\nYou punch him back. \"She's hot,\" you reply not wanting to tell him about your crush on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a brilliant flash in the lab.  Both of you run out of the bushes to peek through the door.  Nobody is in the lab, but you notice the time machine is running.  <br>\r\nPointing to the time machine you say, \"I think he just used it to travel through time. maybe he's doing the experiments?\" <br>\r\n\"SWEET,\" Zack exclaims. \"This will be easy now.  We have nobody home tonight, we can just buy some comic books, go back to our time and cash in!  Let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down the road you see the lingering dust cloud from the car that is taking Misty to the mall.  You wish some how you both could have bummed a ride.  <br>\r\nAs you walk down the gravel road you are amazed at how much has changed.  The farm was on the edge of town, now you are now miles away from town.  Where there used to be houses down the road there were nothing but fields or pastures for animals.  <br>\r\n\"We should have brought our bikes Zack,\" You sigh as you remember how long of a walk it is to the mall.<br>\r\n\"Maybe we didn't think this out very well,\" Zack says sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple hours of walking you arrive at the mall.   It is brand new, with a lot of the shops are still vacant.  If you both would have traveled much further back in time there probably wouldn't have been a mall to go back to.   Now your main concern is if the comic book store is even in the mall yet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you both walk around the mall.  You see your Dad and a couple of his friends in the athletic shop looking at  baseball gloves and a soccer ball.  <br>\r\n\"Quick Zack before they see us,\" You say as you point out your father in the shop window to Zack.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There it is,\" Zack says nudging you a briskly walking  towards the comic store.  \"Look at that Darryl!  They must have just opened the sign isn't even up above the door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking in the door you start looking at various magazines. <br>\r\n\"So which ones should we buy?\" you ask Zack as you rummage  through another stand. <br>\r\nZack looks at you with a frown, \"I'm not sure;  I don't even know which ones are worth a lot in the future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH Zack!  I can't believe this we came back in time and we don't even know what we are looking for.\"  You sigh in disbelief.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at your watch, \"Come on Zack, lets get something to eat and go back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading to the food court you go to deli stand to buy a sandwich.  Zack hands the clerk a credit card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'NO Zack you idiot' you want to scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly you pull out a $20 and hand it to the clerk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk says,</span></div></div>",

It looks like it'll lead into a residential area and give us a good area to hide in. Let's go!\"<br>\r\nYou sprinted as fast as you could for the fence, with Zack following close behind you. There is a hole in the fence so you and Zack climb through. Out of nowhere, your in somebody's front yard  and see what appears to be a Chevy I-ROC Z sitting in the driveway. Even though it is a glorious sight, you have no time to spare as you continue hurrying through the streets, trying to not look out of place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp ahead, it looks like some sort of town square with many buildings, cars , and people walking on the sidewalk. It now appears the coast is clear and you both made it out OK. It was getting a bit late, around 5:30PM. The farm where you were at to begin with was miles from where you are now. \"We need bikes...NOW.\" Yeah i agree with you\", said Zack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if someone was listening to your conversation, a crowd of people formed at the town theater. A sign read: Back to the Future 2 Preview. <br>\r\n\"Man I loved that movie series\", you said. \"Little does anyone know, time travel is possible.\" <br>\r\nTwo kids on bikes cut us off on the street, and joined the line to see the preview. Conveniently, the two kids bikes were left unattended, so you motion Zack to follow your lead. <br>\r\nThe two of you casually rode off back to the farm and you felt anxious to return to see your family again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Zack make it back to the farm, now what?</span></div></div>",

After making sure she is sound to sleep, you slowly untangle yourself from her, being very careful not to wake her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up, you cover Emily up with a sports blanket that was laying on the recliner.  Wow I wonder what she thinks in the future when she sees you in her class. You are starting to feel very strange, you start coughing a little. Kissing her, you are tempted to stay in this time with her or have her come to the future with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't forget your mission, you have to find Misty.  Going from room to room you try and find her.<br>\r\nAs you walk past a bed room you see Zack making out with your Mom.  Zack looks at you and flips you off.  You close the door.<br>\r\n'That turd,' you think to yourself.  'I can't believe mom would make out with somebody like Zack.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are starting to feel dizzy, is Zack getting some where with your mom?  Did you change the time line when you banged Emily? Where is Misty you wonder, just then as an answer to your quest you see Misty laying on her bed crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Misty? You ask.  <br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" she says, \"the other girls are so beautiful, they can get any guy they want.\"  \"I am just lucky Todd likes me.\" Misty sob<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding! you are the most beautiful women I know, I've always had a crush on you! I've always wanted to be with you!\"  You say with all the emotions pouring out of your heart.  \"I love every part about you.  You are the perfect woman......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could finish Misty jumped up from the Bed and kissed you.  \"Thank you Kyle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not Ky.....\" She kissed you again shoving her tongue down your mouth before you could finish.  She throws you down on her bed and began making out with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you start kissing her behind her ear and working your way down her neck, she starts pulling off her clothes. \"Don't stop,\"Misty gasps.  'Wow what luck two women in one night!  This one is your dream girl!\"<br>\r\nShe helped you strip your clothes off, you started nibbling on her ear lobes, working your way down her neck, ending at her nipples.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a little whimper and grabbed your manhood.  \"Be gentle with me.\" she said as she guided it into her wet womanhood.<br>\r\nAs you both began making passionate love, you could not help hear your Mom and Zack doing the same in the next room.<br>\r\nSlowly you and Misty began to build towards climax.

Do we all feel this ashamed of all of our perceived imperfections?  What is wrong with you! As a guy this is would be your perfect body, but yet as a girl you find all kinds of faults with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling up your pajama bottoms and putting on your top you decided to try and set things right.

Wondering who's room your in, you remember you have to stop Misty from dating Todd tonight otherwise Zack will cease to exist.  Then you remember the beautiful night you had.    \"I scored with my teacher that was sweet,\" you say as the sound of your voice shocks you.  Quickly you sit up in bed.  There is a heavy weight on your chest.  Looking down you notice a pair of large breasts, there combined weight pull you forward.  Looking around to make sure nobody else is in the room you fondling your newly acquired breasts.  Who did you switch bodies with?    Quickly you walk over to the Vanity.   It kind of looks like you have switched places with Emily, but... you have blonde hair...and you look kind of like a cross between her and your dad.   Admiring your new body you notice in the corner of the mirror in Rainbow letters is the name 'Dana.'   Touching your face and looking into your deep blue eyes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This body is beautiful,\" you say turning around admiring it.  As you say it deep feelings inside of you seem surprised.  It is like who ever this body belonged to hated it, noticed every blemish and perceived defect. Thought she was ugly and thought nobody could love her.   You couldn't believe how ingrain these thoughts were into her brain.  As a former teenage boy all you know is you would love to date a girl this hot.  Even her \"perceived faults\" made her more beautiful.  Nothing you could think of though could answer the questions about how you got this body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I Emily's Sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around again to make sure nobody else is in the room, you slide your hand under your panties to explore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOvercoming the urge to try and<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got to get a hold of Zack, I got to switch back.\"  you say as a picture grabs your attention looking.  It has group of girls you recognize that you go to school with, and  the girl who's body you inhabit in in the center.  Another picture is sitting on the end table.  It is a picture of your Dad, Emily your teacher and four girls of various ages that look about like about the same, like your current body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning on the little flat screen TV the local weather plays, to your surprise it is your Mom who is the Weather lady!!! The date is the day after you and Zack went into the past on his comic book scheme!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What has happened?  What did I do?  What is going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DANA!!! Breakfast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's your Dad<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I dead? Did I change the past? Why do I exist? Are these other girls my Sisters from my timeline?  What happened to Zack, What happened to Mom. How do I fix it?  Wow this is blowing my mind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DANA, Hurry up! Did you shower yet!

As the family pulls out of the driveway, you find yourself hoping you go to the same church.  Maybe you can see if Zack still exists somehow, what happened to Julie and everybody else you care about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou live in a nice neighborhood,   This is the same area where your girlfriend lives\u2026. What was her name?  You can\u2019t remember!   You can remember your ex-boyfriends name, Karl!  You calm down and start looking at the town, hoping to notice changes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your disappointment as you drive through town you couldn\u2019t help but notice everything looks the same.  People who you seems the same, is it just you that changed?  Deep down you were hoping that somehow, the changes you made would have effected everything more then they did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family roadster pulls into your old church and everybody makes their way inside.  You are early, your old family never came in early, Your new mom Emily is talking to a couple of women towards the entry way as your Dad leads  the rest of the family to his favorite spot.  Doesn\u2019t matter what timeline, Dad still takes the same seats.  Looking around you see all kinds of people you know, family friends, but not the people you wanted to see most,  Misty, your real mom Liz, Samantha, Zack and Julie.  You were really hoping they would be here somehow.  You realize how much you miss Julie too, maybe you should have asked her out, she was always so good to you.  Now neither her or Zack may exist any more.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Emily your new Mom sits down next to your dad. Church will be starting soon and you struck out. Two of your sisters begin pushing each other.  <br>\r\n\u201cGirls\u201d Emily whispers staring them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then rushing into the church comes Todd \u201cthe Rodd\u201d with Misty and four girls in tow.  Your gaze settles on Misty, you can\u2019t help but notice how beautiful she looks.  Her big hair done up in a beautiful bun with a bohemian fishtail braid which flows perfectly with conservative looking outfit witch seems to show off her elegant curves.  Her horned rimmed glasses and outfit seems like a poor costume that hides the raging cougar beneath it.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they make their way towards some seats, you cannot help, but notice all the \u201chigh society\u201d women trying to talk to her.  It is so weird, these women scorned her in your timeline, now they go out of their way to be around her.  She seems to have told them a joke as a bunch of the women who were talking to her begin laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strange sensation grips you as you realize you are getting wet looking at Misty.  Your maleness is secure you think to yourself with relief.  Just then to your surprise she turns looks at you and winks.  <br>\r\nYou wonder what was that about? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is your boss from the library Dana,\" Kathy chimes in making a kissy face.  You give her a little punch in the arm.<br>\r\n\"Girls knock it off.\"  Emily whispers loudly.  \"Have some respect we are in church!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rumor has it that Misty and the Weather lady have been having a lesbian affair for years and Todd the Rodd is frustrated cause he can't do anything about it.\" Tammy your sister chimes in<br>\r\n\"Girls!\" Emily whispers a little too loud this time as people look.  \"This is church, quiet please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody settles down and you look around for Samantha or your Mom; or you should say Liz.  How every it works out in this time line. As you gaze around you find yourself looking at Misty, you try to remember Zack!  Zack you can't remember his face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is all blowing your mind.  Sitting back your try and get a grip on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the church service begins you use the time to start putting the current events into perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour actions in the past have caused your dad and his old girlfriend to marry.  Your Dad hasn't changed at all in this time line, except he is a history teacher at your school.  <br>\r\nYou have 3 sisters, now Kathy Tammy and Zoe.  If you were all the same ages you could all pass for each other. <br>\r\nLooking at your Emily your current mom she is still a teacher, she is a little heavier then she was in your time line.  Her breasts are bigger, which is hard to believe.  Unfortunately her breasts are so big, they make her look fat, in reality she is actually in not that bad of shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, this body has the same problem, your breasts are so big they make you look heavy.  Fortunately your boobs are perky enough that the bra doesn\u2019t have to fight to hold up the 'girls' like Emily.   These huge breasts of yours make a lot of the other girls hate you because, you do have such big boobs.  Only guys seem to pay attention to you now, your friends from school don't seem to talk to you anymore and the guys all want something else then friendship from you.  Like your ex boyfriend Karl who just wanted to get into bed with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody gets up breaking your train of thought.  Quickly you glance at your sisters hymn book and join in. After the song you sit down and begin thinking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour real mom; since she never dated your Dad, finished her degree and graduated from the University with a degree in Meteorology.   She evidently became the weather lady for the local station.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack's mom Misty took your Mom's internship at the library and became a librarian.  She is your boss now, since you also have an internship there.  She seems involved with the community and seems to be the center of attention with everybody in the church. From what info you have been able glean since she walked in the church she is quite the popular socialite of town and is on the city council.   Wow you still have a hard time wrapping your mind around that one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Samantha you have no idea what happened to her.  Todd always was so mean to her and Julie and it is so weird, Misty seems to dominate him, you can see how mad it makes him. It makes you happy to see Misty control him and do what she wants him to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo as far as you can tell Julie and Zack don\u2019t exist, unless they exist like you in another body.   The way your memories are beginning to fade, you have to find the time machine soon before you forget who you really are.  You have to find the shed and the time machine, but your memories are fuzzy where that is.  As the church service ends you think about talking to Misty, but how to broach the subject about the machines.  You have to make it quick since the family is heading to dinner and you want to ask your Mom about her and your father how they started to date.  The problem with that is what is different this time, why did they stay dating and not break up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalking to the Family,\" I'll catch up to you guys I have to talk to my boss quick.\"   Your mom Emily looks at you a chuckles and says, \"Good luck.\"  Then she gestures to the crowd of people around her.   \"Honey, you might want to talk to her tomorrow when you are at your internship.  She is the most respected Woman in town and everybody wants to talk to her especially after church.  She's on all these church boards and committees.  I don't even see you getting close to her.\"  Let's go out to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about it maybe you should talk to Misty's kids and see if one of them is really Zack.  If he exists he can help you.  The problem is how do you find out if one of them is Zack?  How do you ask?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was saving myself for marriage, I always thought I would, but that night I made passionate love with your dad and I knew I would always be with him.  I was addicted to him after that.

I'll stop over like I'm going to visit Zack and in fact we'll be able to stay together.  Your old body begins kissing you.  You can't help but melt.  The hands of your old self begin to unbutton your blouse revealing your large breasts.  You can feel the breath on your neck as your bra comes undone.  You pants and undies come off and next thing you know, your old body is making love to you.  The energy begins to build as your penis slides into your new body.  With every thrust the energy becomes more unbearable.  You feel like you are going to explode and you feel your fingernails breaking off into your old self\u2019s back.  Finally you let out a scream and your body feels like it flew apart, then you slump back feeling all tingly and relaxed like you are nothing but a pile of Jell-O just laying there on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour old body tells you, \"Remember don't tell anybody, it is our secret.  You better go back to my place before Zack sneaks out.  I'll stop over later.\"  Your big former body leans down and kisses you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ask, \"How do I get home?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silly girl, you drove remember?  Your old self replies<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how to drive, \"You say in your new sexy voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you do, just think where the car is parked down the road a bit and it will all come to you.  Trust me.\u201d  Your old self leans down and kisses you again and you feel all warm all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't believe it, your old body was right you can remember driving over here.  You know how to drive!  This is so cool.  You remember you have a date tonight too in this body with your coach.  This is so bizarre.

Gently rubbing at the fleshy folds with one hand, while you continued washing your boobs you couldn't help but think about Zach and what his reaction might be if he found out you were now his mother (not to mention the fact you had sex with her while she was in your body), and whether or not you should indeed keep it quiet just as his mom had said. He did know about the machine after all, though you were pretty certain from his reaction earlier that he didn't believe you, and besides, you weren't exactly sure how long Misty intended to keep your body, it may only be for a day or two, so best to just play along for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, after making up your mind, and continuing your little masturbation session while you showered, you suddenly heard Zach's voice shout from the other side of the bathroom door, reminding you that he was still in the house and hadn't yet sneaked out. \"Mom? Is that you back from the store already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yuh-yeah...I'm, I'm just having a shower,\" you stuttered back, quickly removing your fingers from your body and feeling a little embarrassed as you did. It was weird being called \"mom\" by your best friend, you thought, but seeing as you had did have 14 years worth of raising him still knocking about inside your head, it did make it somewhat easier to swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay, that was fast,\" he then said, sounding a little disappointed (his plans to sneak out clearly being skuppered), before asking, \"Did you get any soda while you were out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Misty's original plan may have been to head to the store to get some groceries, all that had presumably been forgotten after she'd decided to head over to yours to investigate the machine; you yourself having headed straight back here after switching bodies, this of course did beg the question of what exactly you were going to tell Zach you'd been doing instead. \"Oh no, sorry, I uh, I didn't,\" you told him aware that the truth was out of the question, before reaching into Misty's memories again to find some sort of suitable excuse, \"I didn't actually make it to the store, I eh...I bumped into Mr. Johnson instead. He eh, he had to cancel our date for tonight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brilliant, now what am I supposed to drink?\" Zach grumbled, his voice trailing off as he presumably went back downstairs, your excuse seeming to have done the trick, having decided it best to blow off your date for the moment, finding the idea of dating the coach a little creepy, as well as allowing yourself far more opportunity to familiarize yourself with your new female body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now all I have to do is let Coach Johnson know,\" you thought, rinsing off the suds and stepping out of the shower (deciding it'd be a little too weird continuing your masturbation session with your best friend/son still in the house).<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Making sure to get the right stuff so Zack will eat it.  As you walk through the store you notice a few guys are checking you out.  It always makes you feel good when they do.  You can hear the sound of your heals clicking the ground and make sure to move your butt just so as you make you way to the check out line.<br>\r\nYou get to the checkout and Darryl's girl friend Mary is running the register.  You think to yourself, if only the sweet child knew what you and her boyfriend just had done.  She is so young and has no clues about the real world.  If only you were that young again.  Too bad there wasn't a mind switching machine... Maybe you would switch with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe asks if you want paper or plastic and tell her that plastic would be fine and hand her the cash.  You take the bags out to the car and start for home.  You pull into the driveway and notice that Zack isn't in his room, playing video games.  He snuck out.  <br>\r\n'That boy' you think to yourself, 'well at least he's getting some exercise over at Darryl's place.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put away the groceries and think to yourself, 'well at least I don't have to make supper now.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head up stair to get ready for your date.

You try a bunch of them on and find one that would be perfect for tonight.  You finish your hair and start putting on jewelry.  You look in the mirror and say, \"Misty Davis you are beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick up your purse and go down to the kitchen.  You put a post it note on the fridge with instructions for Zack when he gets home.  You look back make sure everything is off in the house and lock up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarl Johnson the boys coach at school is waiting outside in his car.  You get in, he kisses you and drive to the movie theater.  He's a very hansom man, in his mid to late 30s his little sister teaches at the school to.  What was her name... Becky or something like that.  They boys have a crush on her you know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the movie he takes you to a nice restaurant.  He begins talking about his career and other boring stuff.  You could careless about this.  He senses you are bored out of your mind and takes you to the bar.  There are so many guys vying for your attention, it is so fun.  They buy you drink after drink, you have a wonderful time. You have way too many and Karl takes you home.  You notice that Zack isn't home so you invite him in.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You\u2019ve been watching way too many movies.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh to yourself, you guys didn\u2019t switch, but you may have done other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack looks at you and says, \u201cDarryl wouldn\u2019t even play video games with last night, we did homework together.  It was way too creepy.  We had vegetables instead of chips; we drank water instead of pop.  He even scolded me for stuff I was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Zack and think wow he needs friends like that, people to help him out in life.  \u201cYou know Zack it sounds like Darryl really cares about you and is thinking about your future.  I\u2019m glad he\u2019s thinks enough of you to do that.  It\u2019s almost the end of the semester and you are very close to failing.  Maybe this will save your butt young man.  Why do you think I grounded you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack looks at you and says, \u201cMom the mind switching machine looked very funky, it had two pods and a control stand.  Darryl said it didn\u2019t work and was goofing when he told me that, but I wonder.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then you had a flash back of being Darryl and some faint memories of being him, but they were so faint.  You shook off the feeling.  You started to think well if there was a body switching machine maybe you could use it to be young again or help out Zack to keep him from flunking.  Maybe you could trade places with Darryl\u2019s girlfriend from the store.  It was weird but it was like you had memories about the switching machine from when you were younger, that your parents built it and you knew how to operate it, but for some reason so many of your memories from when you were younger aren\u2019t accessible right now.  You decide that you were going to sneak over and check out the old farm site.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut first you decide to play Zack in some video games for some reason. You totally kick his butt and make him clean his room for losing.  He is totally awed by this and seems more convinced that you and Darryl switched places.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s odd that for some reason you can\u2019t remember much about them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look and there is a big pile of split logs in the way.  There is no way you can move them.

You look at him kind of shocked like you just got caught.  In your sexiest voice say, \"OOOh I was just around checking out the old homestead.

It was wonderful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarryl smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you say, \"I have other memories too.\" You watch as Darryl frowns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blurts out; all of your original memories should be too weak for you to access.  I overrode the machines safeties; you should think you are me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at him all confused, and then decide to play along.  Well I have been having a lot of memories come up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarryl looks over at the shed and all the logs blocking the door way.  Then he walks up to you and says, \"The way the machine was set up was that all of your memories would transfer to your new body, but I overrode the safeties so they would not be strong memories.  Just faint memories so you would forget all about them.  Plus I had the machine put in subliminal memories that you would totally believe you are the real Misty Davis and that you wouldn't think about the mind transfer machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Darryl and ask him why he would do this<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks at you and says, because I was getting old.  Have you looked at yourself in the mirror I was getting into my 40s.  I wanted to be young again and besides you are Zack\u2019s best friend and I knew you would take care of him once I put your mind in my old body.  Also with your body I could hang out with him and help him out as his best friend.<br>\r\nPlus I wouldn't mind being a nice handsome young man for a while, I have all the girls eating out my hands I know all the tricks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't mind being me; you were a horny little boy not getting any action now you are a gorgeous cougar with guys calling all the time.  You have to admit its fun.  Keep being me for awhile, stop trying to bring up old memories.  You are a wonderful mother for Zack, what would he do if you left him.\"  Tell you what, I'll get the wood out from in front of the secret door by tomorrow and if you want to swap we will.  Otherwise I can set the machine to take out all of your old memories of being Darryl.  You\u2019ll be happy as me; it is who you were meant to be.  You are Misty Davis and you better get home to take care of Zack.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Darryl\u2019s body said that, you felt strange a little dizzy then realize, that you better get home and take care of Zack.  Darryl\u2019s body bends down and kisses you.  You blush a little and say, I\u2019ll see you later Darryl, you should stop over.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarryl looks at you and says I\u2019ll give you a call tomorrow, we\u2019ll figure stuff out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to both of you Zack was watching everything go down behind the trees.

Not like your first one, which had been huge and had tons of drama.  Your life had calmed down now for some reason, it\u2019s like you are a totally different person, like this isn't even your life.  You almost feel trapped in this life and you don't understand why this should be the happiest day of your life.  You aren't marrying some controlling idiot like your first husband.  You did pretty good for yourself you are marrying a younger man, a very well built hansom man at that.  He does have his faults though he's way into sports at times he's almost a clich\u00e9 of the classic high school coach maybe that's how they all are.<br>\r\nYour car pulls up to the reception site at Lake Park, you get out and everybody is there to greet you and \"Coach\" as everybody likes to call him.  You see Daryl and smile at him, last night while the groom and his friends were having a bachelor party, you and Daryl and a little send off of your own.  It was quite fun.  Afterward last night you told Daryl how you feel like this life isn't yours he got all worried and said you should see a physiologist and they could put you on medication for that.  You didn't know if you should smack him for being a dork or hug him for caring.  Anyway you didn't tell him that you can't take medication because you are pregnant.  You aren't sure if the kids Daryl's or coaches, maybe that's why your emotions are so weird.  What bothers you most is you can't remember much of your life.  Some times your memories are of being a boy almost like you were Daryl, but that's not possible.   You've dreamed about being Daryl and living his life at while you were sleeping.  When you think about when you are awake you think about switching places with his girlfriend for awhile or even that cute girl from the wrong side of the tracks that his sister hangs out with.   In any case you would need some sort of way to switch places with somebody like on that movie freaky Friday to do that.  <br>\r\nYour reception is wonderful.  Afterward you and coach head off on your honeymoon.  Darryl seemed a little jealous when you left the party, you tell yourself 'girl you still have it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Daryl starts moaning softly in his sleep, moaning a little louder as you run your tongue over his balls.  He slowly wakes up as he's about to cum.  \"Oh, hi there Misty\" he says lustily as you groan in pleasure as he jams his 7 inches farther down your throat, harder and harder.  He tells you that his parents are out of town for the night, and Katy is staying at a friend's house.  Then he flips you around and starts to pump furiously into your hole, faster and harder each time.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decide to risk not letting Zack in on your plan just yet, purely for the sake of being able to mess with him as Ms. Becker. You decide that firstly you need some means of getting her to show up to the machine shop in the first place. The farm shop that you've just bought has been good business for your dad. He's started to branch out. Such is his experience of fixing old farm equipment that he has recently taken to repairing old household items too. One of Ms. Becker's defining qualities is how much she loves her old clock. It was a horrible old thing that she must've bought from an antiques place a while ago and she insists on going on about it all the time at school, even during lessons. This could be quite helpful in engineering a swap with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day you go about your paper round as usual but just as you head down Ms. Becker's street you pull a pamphlet you had in your pocket, advertising your dad's shop along with a couple of other assorted pamphlets you were supposed to deliver to other people and slipped them together in with Ms. Becker's paper. When you reach the door to Ms. Becker's house you get off your bike and hide it in a nearby bush, taking Ms. Becker's mail in your hand. You, knowing that by this time of the day she will be getting ready to leave for work and will leave the house in about five minutes time, head around the side of her house out of view. From here, you open up a rucksack on your back and pull out a remote controlled car and wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 5 minutes later you hear Ms. Becker heading down the stairs. You place the remote controlled car on the floor and begin to steer it towards the garage. As you know from your paper round, Ms Becker always leaves the garage door slightly ajar, just enough for the little remote controlled car to pass under. You wait for the sound of the front door being opened. When you hear the front door finally open, peering round the side of the house you drive the RC car into the wheel of Ms. Becker's real car triggering the super-sensitive car alarm. Panic stricken she runs to the car to turn the alarm off and you quickly slip in through the open front door. It gives you just enough time to reach the hallway and hide in an under-stairs cupboard. She returns soon after to lock the house and you hear the lock on the front door turn. Now successfully inside your English teacher's house you set out to find the clock. It doesn't take too long as you soon find it on the wall in the living room. You sneak up to the clock, pulling out a screwdriver and weakening some of the screws that hold it together, not to an extent where it's about to collapse but significantly enough that it will come apart reasonably soon. You unlock the front door and sidle out closing the door behind you, retrieving your bike and RC car and heading off for school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough Ms Becker comes for a visit to the machine shop to get the clock repaired. The pamphlet had worked. You know that she's not available to visit the shop during school hours so you've offered to help your dad in the shop for the next week. He was pretty enthusiastic to see you taking an interest. When Ms Becker walks in she's surprised to see you but doesn't seem too concerned. When she asks for the parts to fix the clock you show her to the back room and she follows you in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This doesn't look like a storage room\" she says suspiciously when she enters the room.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry miss, just take a seat and I'll go and get you your parts\" you reply nervously. This is the moment that you've waited nearly a week for and you can feel yourself breaking into a sweat. Ms Becker obediently sits in one of the pods whilst you make yourself look busy. When you're sure she's sitting comfortably in the pod you turn and press the button closing the pod door on Ms Becker. <br>\r\n\"Wait.. what are you?\" she calls out as you step into the other pod and close the door, hitting the button as a flash of light fills the pod and you begin lose consciousness.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You appear to have passed out inside of one of the pods. it takes you a few seconds to realize that your body now feels completely different. You slowly get up, feeling your chest, ass and hair bounce a little as you do. You blink and start to take in your surroundings. You reach for the pod door and try to push the handle to open it but it won't budge. Your vision is starting to come back to your and you try to open the door again, this time with more effort and the door swings open. You step out of the pod and again feel certain body parts move a little as you do. You seem to be a little weaker then you're used to. You straighten up and finally begin your new life as Emily Becker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spot your own reflection in a mirror in the back of the shop. You're starting to tell why all the guys in the year find you attractive. Your chestnut hair is long and sleek and reaches past your shoulders. Your face is that of a young lady, 25 years or so, unblemished and beautiful. Your breasts are large, probably C's as they stretch the front of a rather small hot pink blouse. The desirable hourglass figure, with wide hips, a generous ass and long thin legs make you the perfect hot teacher. You're also wearing a simple black knee-length skirt and a pair of heels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile pleasantly to yourself in the mirror making you look more beautiful than ever and start to gather yourself. Darryl appears to still be unconscious in the other pod. You can't have been out for too long as there still seem to be customers in the shop from the sounds of things and Ms. Becker (well you) had shown up quite close to closing time. Leaving the clock in the store room you head out, weaving in between the slightly irritated customers and out into the cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately as you leave the shop a cool breeze blows up your skirt. It's quite uncomfortable at first but you begin to get used to it after a while as you walk back trying to remember where you parked the car. You soon find the car and for the very first time in your life, you drive yourself home. You park the car in the garage and pull the garage door down, leaving a gap at the bottom and head inside. When your to get home you decide to unwind for a bit. You set the coffee machine to get some coffee ready and then head upstairs. Upon finding your bedroom you look around and spot a mirror on the wall. You spend a few minutes, stripping, posing, squeezing, poking,prodding, groping, feeling and masturbating before returning to the kitchen to drink the coffee. After a nice relaxing hour or two in front of the TV you enjoy a warm bath and then head to bed for the night.</span></div></div>",

This was not part of the plan.<br>\r\n\"Darryl or I should say Spike, this will be so fun, you'll get to try out being a dog for awhile and I'll be you.  I can see what it is like being popular.  It'll only be for a little bit I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not part of the plan and it is making you quite nervous that Zack didn't suggest this earlier.  <br>\r\nZack's old body begins getting up holding his head and moaning.<br>\r\nThe real Zack now in your body shuts down the machine and tells once again.  \"Trust me, it'll just be for a bit, and we'll switch back to normal now lets go over to my house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Zack nervous.  you wonder if he means your house or Zack's house?

We'll certainly bring home a first place ribbon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked nervously at the attachment as Katy ran out to get Betsy. Tara ran after her, leaving Julie and you alone by the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so sweet Daryl. She said as she gave you a quick kiss on the cheek. We'll have a lot of fun. The fair is next week and I'll make sure I stop by and visit you every day. I wonder if Betsy will be able to pass for you?\", she said as she scanned the notebook. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to be a cow for 2 weeks!? What have I gotten myself into?\", you thought as Julie read through the book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, here it is. She approached the machine and rotated a few dials. \"This should give Betsy a high enough intelligence to pass for you. She'll even be unaware of the change. It says we can wipe enough of her memory so she'll never realize anything was wrong. Don't worry.\", she said as your eyes got bigger. \"You'll keep your intelligence. Wouldn't be worth doing the switch if you couldn't understand Katy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes passed as Julie sat with you on a bench holding your hand. Finally, Katy came into the room, pulling a very reluctant, and irritated cow into the hidden room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked a Betsy and began to panic. You didn't really want to spend a whole 2 weeks as a cow, but you were afraid to back out now and disappoint everyone, especially Julie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, okay, let's get this over with.\", you said, trying to hide your concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the pod as the girls adjust the device and attach it to Betsy's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up!\", said Katy. \"She's not going to tolerate this much longer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could change your mind, you pushed the red button. You felt strange and disoriented as if you were being sucked out of your own body. Seconds later, you were looking at yourself in the pod. You tried to yell, but all that came out was a very loud \"Mooooooooooooo!\". Looking down, you could see your front legs and almost staggered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! Easy girl, I mean Daryl.\", said Katy. \"Just calm down a minute until you adjust.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour vision was a little different than you were used to given the placement of your new eyes. After a few minutes, you felt comfortable enough to take a step. As you moved forward, you became very aware of your new, very full, udder swaying. A few more steps, and walking came much more easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you understand us?\", said Julie as she rubbed your head. \"Moo 3 times for yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moo... moo... MOOOOO...\", came out of your very thick and clumsy lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent!\", exclaimed Katy. \"Let's get you back before Mom or Dad notice. It's also time for your milking.\", she said with a wink. \"Why don't you two make sure Betsy, I mean Daryl is okay. Get him out of here and close the door behind you. With any luck, he'll forget that this room is here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty led you toward the pen as Julie and Tara helped up your previous, and very confused body. \"How do you feel\", she asked you as you walked. So many new sensations hit you as you walked along in your new and massive body. \"Oh, you can't quite answer me.\", she realized and smirked. \"We'll have to work out a code. One moo for \"No\" and two moos for \"Yes\". That's how I'll be able to communicate with you. I bet this is exciting! I've always wondered what it would be like to be an animal. Maybe I'll try it out once you switch back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to admit, it was kind of exciting. No school or obligations. It could be a nice vacation. Everyone else would just see you as a simple milk cow. Eat, sleep and enjoy the outdoors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you reached the gate, Katy released you from the strap and led you into the pasture. Go ahead and eat and get to know the other cows.\", she said pushing you forward. \"It's time for dinner and Dad will be back any minute now. He'll need some help unloading the new livestock and we'll have to make sure Betsy has a clear enough head to help him unload. From now on, you're Betsy. Go on Betsy! We'll start rehearsing tomorrow girl. I owe you one!\", she said as she ran back toward the house.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He knew the mostly black furred cow was named Daisy and the other brown cow was Maggie. It was very strange looking at the cows eye to eye now that he was as big as them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaryl wandered over to a grassy patch and began to graze. His movements seemed much more natural now. He didn't have a whole lot of experience with the cows, but he didn't think it would be that difficult to pass himself of as Betsy. After all, cows really didn't do a whole lot. He wondered how Betsy was handling herself in his body and hoped that she didn't do anything to embarrass him. Then again, he was a little worried that she would play his role too well. \"I can't believe I let them talk me into this!\", he thought. \"What if I'm stuck like this? Do Mom and Dad know about the machine? Is this what happened to the previous owners? I really should have thought this through.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Daryl began chewing his cud, he looked up and saw his Mom walking towards the barn. \"It must be time for milking.\", he thought as he made his way to the milking area so he would be first. His Mom came out with a harness and looked at Daryl suspiciously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want any trouble this time Betsy. For once try to make this easy on me.\", said Liz as she attached the harness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she pulled Daryl toward the station, she gave \"Betsy\" an odd look. \"Katy's made a lot of progress with you. That's a GOOD GIRL!\", she said as she patted Daryl on his muzzle. \"You're so much more cooperative than normal. If you're this calm through your milking, I might have to give you a special treat. In fact, I do have a surprise for you later. I think you'll enjoy it quite a bit.\", said Liz with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaryl was wondering what kind of surprise she had in mind when all of a sudden his Mom began massaging his udder to get the milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA low moo escaped his big mouth as he felt a very pleasant feeling wash over him. \"Oh my God! This... feels... amazing!\", thought Daryl as he closed his eyes and relaxed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a very pleasant 10 or 15 minutes, Liz stood up from her stool and gathered the buckets full of warm milk. After storing the milk, she led a somewhat disappointed Daryl back to the pasture, praising him all the way back. \"Maybe I overreacted when I said you'd make a tasty steak.\", she said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaryl's eyes got big as he processed his Mom's last comment, but he quickly realized that his Mom was joking. After all, the fair was coming and Katy needed her prize cow. However, the comment did unsettle him quite a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting settled in the pasture, Daryl's mind wandered as he began grazing again. It wasn't long before he heard his Dad's truck driving up toward the house with a very large trailer in tow. After the car stopped, he saw his old body come out to help unload the trailer. Betsy didn't seem to be struggling with his old body. Katy and Julie were heading toward the trailer as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julie must have stayed for dinner.\", thought Daryl. I wonder what he brought back from the auction?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was certainly enjoying herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Daryl watched, he began to wonder what it felt like. The milking he had earlier was amazing, but this... Could he really let that happen? After all, nobody would be even know. He felt a tingle as his mind wandered. Memories of being mounted by a bull flooded his mind. He remembered how great it felt the last time it happened. \"Last time!?\", thought Daryl. \"I must have triggered Betsy's memories and that might not be a good idea. It makes sense that I would have some of Betsy's memories considering that she had mine. I don't want to lose myself to her thoughts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMemories of giving birth flooded his mind as stood there watching the bull. He let out a very loud and long moo as the bull dismounted and looked over his way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck am I doing!?\", thought Daryl. \"I gotta get a hold of myself.\", as he tried to push the thoughts from his mind. \"I'm a man, not a stupid beast.

To pass the time you made a  game out of swooshing away fly's with his tail as you ate grass.  As the sun set you watched the family all head in the house, heard the TV going, laughter and talking.  I miss everybody a lot!  I can't wait for this thing to be over with.  As the night went on you found a nice grassy spot under a tree and slept for awhile.  You woke up looked up at the moon and stars and began eating again.  In this boredom you just ate and didn't think about anything, just how good the grass tasted.   The more you did this the more natural it felt.  The sun starts to peak up over the horizon. Usually you would admire a sunrise like this, but today all you can think about is eating and being milked to alleviate the pain in your udder.  Seeing the Bull stepping out of the barn you let out a low long mooooo as your thoughts drift from feeding to the joys of being breed.  You let out a mooooo again wanting the bull to satisfy some ancient hunger your mind did not fully grasp.  Just then you saw somebody approaching the barn. This broke the hypnotic spell of the bull as thoughts of relief and joys of a good milking filled your mind.<br>\r\nMoving as fast as your aching udders would let you trying to get ahead of the other cows into the barn.  Pushing ahead of the rest you were first in the milking stall.<br>\r\n\"My girl! You are a whole new cow. It was almost impossible to get you in the stall a couple days ago,\" your mother says in amazement.<br>\r\nSuddenly you snapped to, you realize since last night you fell into Betsy normal routine you are not sure when it started, but you must not let it continue, no matter how natural it felt. Just as you came to that realization your mind began to fog from the bliss of milking. This will be what you miss most when you go back to your old body.  All thoughts drift from your mind as you enjoy the blissful lactation induced state.  <br>\r\nYour mind is in such a fog that you didn't notice Julie and your old body sneaking down from the hay loft holding hands as they slinked away before they got caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly came down from your milking induced euphoria as your mom finished up, you mooooed for her continue. \"All done girl! Besides Katy will be out soon for your training.\" she slapped you in the rump and sent you out of the stall as the next cow quickly filled your space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked back into the pasture you started to panic. It was like your human mind was disconnecting or you were using Betsy thought process so much you were forgetting how to use yours.    Terror started to grip you, you shook your head, your instincts were to run. You fought your instincts fearing if you ran you might completely loose yourself and become Betsey.Just then you saw...... Waiting for you.</span></div></div>",

As your Mom was returning Daisy to the pasture, she stopped to compliment Katy on her work with their prize cow. \"You're going to win the competition for sure! Betsy's always been a prize winning cow and now she has the attitude to go along with it.\", she said as she smiled and put her arm on Katy's shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your Mom headed back to milk Maggie, your sister whispered in your ear. \"You seem to be adjusting quite well. What we need to do is simple for the most part. We just need to make sure you have good posture when presenting yourself to the judges. They will be examining your udder quite a bit, so try not to let that excitement get to you too much.\", said Katy with a wink. \"Is everything okay so far?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mooooo....\", you said. You wanted to tell her about your instincts taking over, but that was a little hard to do given your inability to talk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about that bull, Buster. I won't think any less of you if you'd like to let him have his way with you.\", said Katy. \"It's natural for your Body and you're in heat in case you haven't figured that out for yourself. You should enjoy your experience a little before we head to the fair. The bull is on loan with us for a few weeks. Don't worry, I saw Julie run off somewhere with your old body. She's been having fun with your body, so it's only fair that you have some fun yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what!?\",  you thought. \"Betsy's having all the fun and I'm stuck here learning how to be a good show cow.\" This concerned you quite a bit. \"What if Betsy refuses to trade back? Can they trick her into doing it? After all, she doesn't know about the transfer device, or does she?\", you pondered as Katy led you to the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a fairly easy run through of what was expected of you, Katy patted you on the nuzzle and gave you an apple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm... my favorite!\", you thought as you took the apple into your mouth and chewed it up. \"Actually, I should say Betsy's favorite. I need to keep things under control today. I have to keep better focus so I don't end up in cow mode again. I want to keep her thoughts and instincts from mixing in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay there girl, I'm going to take you back to the pasture. Try to have a little fun and get into character\", said Katy as she rubbed your back. \"Besides, Dad might think there's something wrong with you if you're not interested in getting mounted by the bull. There are other ways to get the results he's after, but I promise you that they aren't as much fun.\", she said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the day wore on, your boredom increased. It wasn't until mid day that your curiosity got the better of you and you wandered over to the bull who was happily munching on the grass. Looking around the farm, you didn't see anyone around. Mom had to run out for groceries with Tara in tow, your Dad was running errands in the truck, and you saw no signs of Katy or Julie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe closer that you got to the bull, the more excited you became. The musky smell became much more intoxicating as you approached. You were right by Buster now as you let out a soft moo and turned around to give him easier access. You felt like your heart was going to explode, but you knew that you were beyond the point of no return. \"Best go along for the ride now!\", you thought as you tried to convince yourself that it was for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large bull sniffed your rear and with his powerful back legs, lifted his front up to mount his eager mate. It was only moments before he found his target and started pumping away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MoooooOOOOOooooooooOOOOOOOOOO!\", forced it's way out of your large, thick lips. Your mind blanked as the euphoric feelings washed through it. \"Oh... OOOOOOO... OH MY GOD!\", you thought as the orgasm hit you. Your knees felt week as sexual pleasure let Betsy's instincts take control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 3 seconds later, it was done. The bull dismounted and walked away leaving you a bit disappointed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes glaze over as you basked in the afterglow. Satisfied, you began to eat grass and walk around, making sure to stay close to your new mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the sessions weren't long, they were frequent. The bull mounted you at least 20 more times in the next few hours. You were certainly enjoying yourself. As the bull mounted you, yet again, you looked up to notice three human girls staring at you. After a brief period, the bull dismounted after inseminating his favorite cow. Trotting up to get a better look, you noticed the taller one had an apple in her hand for you. As you approached the girls, two of them giggled and blushed as they began making noises. It took you a moment to recognize the one who held the apple as Julie. It took you even longer to realize that you could understand what they were saying. \"Oh my, Julie saw the bull mounting me.\", as the shock of the situation registered in your muddled brain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Betsy, looks like you are enjoying yourself.\", said Julie as she looked deeply into your large cow eyes. \"Still with us Daryl?\", she whispered. \"Moo three times if you can understand me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you mooed three times, relief washed across Julie's face. \"Thought we lost you there for a minute. Well you're a good sport for sticking with it! I thought we'd at least give you the chance to change your mind. I'll have to think of an extra special reward for you once you're back to your old body! This new perspective might be good for you.\", said Julie with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you've already given him his special rewards. I saw you and...\", Katy began to say before Julie elbowed her stiffly in the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH NO!\", you thought. They gave me an out and I was too out of it to understand them. Looks like I'm stuck until after the fair. If I'm not careful, I'm going to be content with being milked and birthing cows for the rest of my days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he wanted to blame his instincts for taking over, he finally admitted to himself that it was his human mind that was curious. \"It's getting easier to slip into the roll of Betsy, but I am still able to snap back to human thinking with just a little effort. That was more me wanting to feel pleasure than Betsy wanting to reproduce.\", he thought as he went back to join the herd. \"Well, now that they saw me, I don't have to worry about hiding the act.\", you thought as you stared at the bull. \"What the hell. Since I don't have anything better to do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over to your mate so he can find you once he's rested a bit. Maybe if I start acting more like Betsy, they'll get worried and ask me again if I'd like to switch back. That shouldn't be hard to do.\" you thought as you relaxed your mind and let more primitive thoughts guide your actions for a while. You have to admit, it's very relaxing and erotic to slip into Betsy's thoughts. \"What's the worst that can happen? When they change me back, I'll get my human mind back anyways. I can snap out of it anytime I want to.\"</span></div></div>",

You've become the bull's favorite cow and have lost track of how many times you've been mounted. You're really not sure what day it is, but you believe that the fair is coming up any day now. It's another lazy day for you as you pull out another tuft of grass and chew at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about mid day when Julie called you over to the gate. You quickened your pace as you noticed her waving an apple in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Daryl, I think it's time to swap you back.\", whispered Julie in your large ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her with a very confused look on your face. \"But Katy needs me for the competition. What's going on?\", you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing the hesitation, Julie smiled. \"You're Dad is planning on selling you at the fair once the competition is done. He made a deal with a farmer across town for your sale. The offer was too good to pass up since the farmer even agreed to give your family your first calf. I figured that there was not going to be a better time to make the swap. Your family is out for a while running errands. Katy wanted me to take you to the machine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie opened the gate and without a moment's hesitation, you walked up to the secret room. \"I'll kind of miss this life a bit.\", you thought. \"It was an interesting vacation, but I don't want to live the rest of my days as a dairy cow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie fumbled at the door a moment before it swung open. As you walked toward the machine, you noticed that your former body was already in the pod. Upon further inspection, you noticed that the door was barred shut. Your old body was pounding on the door, but you couldn't hear what he was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's probably best that we didn't wait any longer.\", said Julie. \"Betsy was a little reluctant to swapping back. Seems that being a teenage boy is preferable to a dairy cow. After all, she doesn't remember being a cow in the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the first thing that I'm going to do is take a long shower.\", you thought as she placed the device on your head. As Julie walked over to start the machine, you stared at Betsy pounding on the glass. The sound proof pod made it impossible to hear her. \"Poor girl thinks that she was really me. It must be a little frightening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute or so, you noticed that she was frantically pointing at herself and mouthing some word. \"What is she saying? Joo Lee? Julie? Oh no, what the...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that you felt the familiar pull as your mind was sucked out of your body. As you slowly opened your eyes, you saw your old hands in front of your face. You were back in your old body. You clumsily lifted your hands to your face and were relieved to feel your old face. Standing up, you went to open the door, but you noticed that it was still locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie was leading Betsy back to the pasture already. It seemed that she was having a difficult time with her as she pulled sharply on the harness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a sec.\", you thought as your hazy mind started thinking clearly. \"Was that Julie? If it was, that would mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes passed as you realized your predicament. Julie slid back into the room, smiling at you. Seeing the sow in tow certainly didn't make you feel any better. As she hooked up the device to the sow, you tried desperatly to get her attention. \"Let me out of here! Please Betsy!\", you pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Julie's body flipped the switch as your mind was sucked out of your body yet again. Moments later, you felt the hard floor underneath your stubby legs. Although your new body felt strange, you were a little more comfortable walking on four legs versus two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a cute little piggy you make!\", said Julie's body as she patted you on the head. \"Guess I have a little explaining to do. You see, Julie wanted to switch with your original body for a day. She was very, uh, persuasive.\", said Betsy with a smile. Once we switched, my old memories came back to me and I remembered my original self. I decided that I would like to stay a little longer than I originally planned, but I knew she would want to swap back after our little adventure had run it's course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to protest, but the only thing that came out was a loud \"Oink... Squeel... Snort!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry little Piggy! Tara takes good care of her pets! After all, your a breeding pig and not meant to be bacon.\", said Betsy with a gentle tone. I know you had fun in my old body. I'm sure you'll enjoy yourself in this body as well. Don't worry, although I want to see what being human is all about, I do want to swap back to my old body after the fair. Also, the whole story about seling you to the farmer was just an act. I'll swap back once the fair is over. I do miss being a cow, especially now that I have some better company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oink... Oink...\", was all that you could manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I explained everything to Julie. She knows what body you're in right now. I'll go back to my body willingly when the time comes. Katy will eventually swap \"you\" back with your human body. The real Julie will take care of the swaps once she's able to talk again. Until then, it's time to get your human body out of here before he comes to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie walked the new Daryl out to the house. After a brief period of time, she came back for you and guided you towards your new pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have fun Sally! She said as she closed the gate behind you. As you watched her walk away, you heard a snort from behind you. The boar nudged his nose into your rear and rubbed up against your side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least I have some company.\", you thought as you rolled in the mud to try to cool off.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Let Simon have some.\", scolded Tara as she shook her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before you noticed the pig's instincts were coming to the surface. \"I wonder if pigs really have 30 minute orgasms?\", you thought as you looked at your mate. The close proximity to the boar was sending a tingle down your spine. After Tara walked away, the boar was sticking his nose in your flanks again. The thought of the boar mounting you was too tempting. You couldn't believe that you were in this position, but decided to let your new instincts take over. After all, what else did you have to do to pass the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boar was a bit more patient than the bull. He was really getting you worked up by the time he finally mounted you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes rolled back in your head as the boar pumped away.

Wild squeals escaped your lips as you pushed back to meet his thrusts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Orgasm after orgasm rocked you, but the sow wasn't finished. \"This... Is... Amazing!\", you thought as the mate showed no signs of slowing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt must have been about 40 minutes of pure bliss before your sow dismounted and fell to the ground, exhausted.

A series of snorts escaped your thick sow lips as you thought about the whole experience. Hopefully, nobody would know what really happened. It would be embarrassing, to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe days really drug on and you were bored out of your mind. Your pen was small and the only thing you had to do was eat and sleep. The scraps that they fed you weren't nearly as good as the ones you were fed back home. You lost track of the time as the days just kind of ran together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the day of the competition was here. You recognized Tara amassed she approached your cramped stall. She was carrying an apple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sally!\", said Tara as she held out the apple for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou greedily took the apple from her hand and rubbed up against it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready girl? We're bringing home first place for sure\", said Tara with a big smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get this over with so I can get back to my old self.\", you thought. \"She's right though. We are bringing home first place.\", you thought as you proudly trotted behind your sister to the competition.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just to make sure that the sow's instincts didn't take over, you took to doing mental exercises throughout the day. The days passed by quickly now, as you got used to living the life of a sow. Although you did miss your human form, you finally admitted to yourself that the sex was pretty amazing and helped to pass the time. In fact, you kind of lost track of what day it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, while getting mounted by the boar, you looked up to see a familiar face. Katy waited by the side of the fence, blushing from the sight before her. She waited patiently for another 20 minutes until the boar dismounted. Embarrassed, but curious to what she had to say, you walked up to your sister, hanging your head a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daryl, it's actually me, Katy. Uh, Betsy finally fessed up to her body swap. Everyone is back in their original bodies. Well, everyone except you. The switch back caused Sally to get her original memories back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SQUEE!\", you exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now don't worry! She's agreed to keep up appearances until you get back. She's intelligent enough to pass as you. Unfortunately, that's not going to be possible until after you give birth. Dad insists that you stay put until you deliver the piglets. Farmer Carter is an expert at delivering baby pigs and Dad feels more comfortable having him around for the birth. It, um... seems like you're taking care of your part.\", she said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oink! Oink! OINK!\", you say as you try to communicate your frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now don't you worry. It could be...\", trailed off Katy as the farmer approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there Katy!\", said the farmer. \"Did you miss Sally? She's a fine pig and seems to be getting along rather well with Buster over here. If she isn't pregnant yet, it will be real soon! I'll let you name all of the piglets.\", he said with a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty smiled. \"I'll have to start thinking up some names. When do you think she'll have the piglets?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we'll have to wait a few more weeks. If she goes into heat again, it could be another month before we find out. If she doesn't go into heat, then we're probably about 4 months out. Depends on a lot of things. We'll also have to wait a while before we bring her back. Want to make sure the youngins are eating well.\", said Farmer Carter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"4 MONTHS!?\", thought Daryl. \"I'm going to be a sow for four more months!? What did I get myself into!? I could spend the next 6 to 8 months in this body. I'd better keep Buster interested to make sure this speeds up.\"</span></div></div>",

Days turned into weeks, as Daryl settled into Sally's routine. \"How long has it been? I don't feel any different?\", thought Daryl as he rolled in the mud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn answer soon came to him as the boar came sniffing around. He was certainly taking an interest in Sally's body again. Daryl quickly got to his feet as he felt the tingle in his flanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an equal amount of disappointment and excitement as he realized that he was indeed, in heat again and not pregnant. \"Here we go again.\", thought Daryl as he tried to convince himself that he wasn't excited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelief washed over him as the boar mounted him again. He certainly missed the pleasure that went with mating and began to wonder if he even wanted to go back to being a human.

You head back and play fetch.  Spike in your old body has been completely overwhelmed by your memories and seems to think that she is you.  You on the other hand can no longer think in words.  Your basic instincts such as eat, play and get attention from everybody overwhelm all other thoughts.  Only that night when everybody is sleeping and you finish checking out all the different noises around the farm and you finally go into your dog house do you have faint memories of who you really are.  You try to bring them up, but you become so easily distracted by any noise ready to protect the family.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonths go by.  People do notice the change in your old self.  They notice how Katy is so much more helpful always watching out for everybody.  Many of spikes personality characteristics are showing.  Spike in your body isn't concerned about popularity and is nice to everybody.  Spike starts to date Zack.  Which was popularity suicide something you would never do.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost a year goes by and your parents find the body switching machine in the secret compartment on the tool shed.  They experiment with it switching back and forth.  You deep down know who you really are, but your mind and cognitive abilities are totally canine.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne night you watch as your old self and Zack experiment with the machine.  You watch as your body get into the pod then you knock Zack down and jump into the other pod.  Switching back with your old body.  Once in your old body all your old memories come back to you.  You also know everything that spike has done in your old body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opens up and Zack is out side the pod with a whining dog spike.  He yells at you, \"Bad dog, Bad dog....Get back into the pod and let\u2019s turn you back to normal.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look and say, \"No way creep. You get into the pod.  This is my body and I'm staying in it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike begins howling and making terrible whimpering noises.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack tries to force you into the pod and you kick him in the nads and say, \"What part of no, don't you understand.  I've been trapped in that dogs body for to long.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack goes running off.  You step outside and your spike begins barking at you and runs after Zack.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start towards the house.  You want to take a good bath.  You'll actually enjoy it.  You remember when you were a dog how you hated taking baths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are almost to the porch and your parents and your brother are all standing there.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad says to you, \"Spike its time you go back to your old body.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at him in disbelief and say, \"No dad, its me, your little girl.... Katy...... Little Katie-did.... you remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad looks at your mom and says I remember something about this in the notebook.  I think she really thinks she's Katy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad, mom, brother and Zack come over and pick you up and begin carrying you back towards the tool shed and machine.<br>\r\nSpike is jumping up and down besides you barking for joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou plead with them not to put you back into the machine.  Once in the tool shed your dad looks into the computer log.  \"It goes back to the time we found the machine two months ago and it shows not transfer between a dog and a human except a little while ago with you and Katy.\"  \"Sorry Spike back you go.\" as they shove you into the other pod.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't do this to me. I'm really human.  I'M KATY!!!!!!!\"  You scream<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a brilliant flash and you find yourself back in spikes body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look through the window and see your old body hugging your dad and mom.  \"I thought I was going to be a dog forever.  I started loosing all my memories of being human and started thinking I was really spike.\"  She said as she was crying she kissed Zack and gave him a passionate hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do with spike?\" your old self asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe'll leave her in the pod for a couple hours, she loose all your residual memories and go back to being her old doggy self again.\" You dad says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel so bad for her she really believed she was human.  No wonder the warning about the experiments with animals in the book.  Your family and Zack walk away.   Your old self returns and looks into the pod at you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whimper at your old self.  Your old self whispers and says, \"Wow I was so lucky I accidentally erased the logs from prior to when we discovered the machine.  If I hadn't they might have thought that we had really switched and I would have lost my perfect life.  I may have been stuck as a dog forever. I'll let you out in couple of hour\u2019s girl.\"  Your old self runs off and leaves you in the pod<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think to yourself.  I may be able to switch back with my old self in a couple of hours, but my memories might fade again and I'll think I'm a dog.  Or I can make a lot of racket and see if I can switch with somebody else the sooner the better.</span></div></div>",

The family back in the house make a decision that you need to calm down before they even think of letting you back out. With every bark you can sense the dog mind and memories trying to force their way back in. You tell yourself you need to be stronger this time. You need to remain human, at least in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you give up. No-one is coming. You live in the country and it's night time. Unless a burglar is coming you're not getting out of here. You start to wail and cry. Dismayed at the injustice of the whole event you resolve that if you can't swap with someone, you might as well kill yourself. A dogs life isn't your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you're about to fall asleep a bright white light fills the room. You jump up suddenly as someone must be using the pods. A chance to swap! You run to the centre of the room only to find one man. What looks like an old man is stood there smiling at you. You stand there shocked.<br>\r\n\"Hello Kate.\" He says. His voice contains wisdom, power and most noticeably, love. Kate began to say 'who are you and how do you know who I really am?' When she realised that he couldn't understand you.<br>\r\n\"Who am I? Well that's a very simple question for I am. But many simply call me God.\" Kate was dumbstruck, firstly she'd never even thought that the guy could understand her, and second she'd never even considered the existence of God. God continued speaking. \"That form must be uncomfortable for you. Here maybe this is more to your liking.\" With that Kate felt a warm feeling run through her. She closed her eyes due to the bright light filling the room. When she opened them she almost shrieked for joy. She was Kate again. \"Thank you.\" She said through tears and hugged the person in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's one more thing.\" God announced. \"There can't be two Kates can there?\"<br>\r\n\"No, of course not.\" Kate replied. God smiled once more and clicked his fingers. In less than a heartbeat the false Kate was sprawled on the floor in front of Kate and God. She looked up at the stranger and then to the other person and immediately felt fear grip her.<br>\r\n\"Look Kate... I can explain...\" She began.<br>\r\n\"SILENCE!\" God said forcefully. The false Kate was silent.<br>\r\n\"Good. Now you have stolen Kate's body and when I gave her a chance to get it back you helped conspire to keep her a dog. It would be a fitting punishment for me just to click my fingers and leave you as Spike.\" The false Kate whimpered. God carried on. \"But you have had your body stolen too. Spending many years as a cat. However there has to be a Kate and a Spike. I'll give you a quest. Boots is still alive in your body. He is close to here in the nearby town. You two will have to team up and find Boots. Once you find Boots then he can have Spikes body and you can have yours back. I'm afraid Julie has accepted her fate and is now Boots permanently. I'm not to interfere with willing choices.\" God again clicked his fingers and the false Kate turned into Spike the dog. He ensured that the dogs memories and mind didn't encroach on her mind. But she could still use them when needed. God reached down and patted Spike.<br>\r\n\"Go and rest now Kate. You and Spike have a journey ahead of you. One thing. Stay with Zach. Your children are important to the future. I'll always be with you.\" As Kate led the new Spike out of the shed finally happy for the first time in many days. She turned and looked back at the shed to find it dark and uninviting. She breathed and addressed Spike.<br>\r\n\"This is only temporary. I don't blame you for trying to steal my body. We could have helped you, you know. Anyway, we'll get your body back. I promise.\" Kate then held her hand out to Spike who looked at it curiously before holding her paw out and shaking it.<br>\r\nAnd so began their adventure.</span></div></div>",

Julie realizes what you are doing and walks calmly up to her former body while you are on her back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara and Katy see this extremely strange situation.  Spike is usually fighting the cat, and is just letting the cat (you) sit on his back.  Julie's body is acting non-human.  Katy quickly sees the instruction manual and figures out the machine.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bends down to you and picks you up.  \"Did this machine change you into a cat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head and both Tara and Katy erupt in laughter.  They ask the same question to the dog and Julie nod's her head and barks twice to confirm.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty ant Tara realize what happened but are extremely confused about where your body went.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty reads the instruction manual quick and then agrees to change with one of you so you all can talk and explain the situation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKary decides to jump into one pod and Tara tells you that either the dog or cat has to get in the other pod.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho gets into the pod to switch into Tara?</span></div></div>",

You follow the girls up to the house to get help.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you are inside the house, you notice it smells different since you are a cat.  You hear Your sister's and Julie talking and decide to explore the house as Boots.  You go into the living room and find Boot's scratching post.  You sharpen your nails on the post and realize you have to pee.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh realizing Boot's pees in a litter box.  You squat down in the box and pee like you have seen Boots do a million times.  You look up to see the girls laughing at how easy you made peeing look for a cat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! You really had to go didn't you?\"  Tara says laughing as you walk back toward the girls.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister Katy is on the phone trying to get a-hold of your Dad.  There is no answer on the other line! She hangs up the phone and tries your Mother too.  She does'nt answer either.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty sits down and says, \"I guess we just have to wait until they get home from work to do anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize it's going to be a few hours until either of them gets home.  You start wondering why they don't call the police.  You then realize the police would never believe such a story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smell something delicious and look over at Tara who is pouring cat food into Boot's bowl.  You realize you are hungry and decide to eat some of the cat food.  It tastes amazingly well to your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you sit down to watch a movie while you wait.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty and Julie keep jabbering about how neat it is to be in each other's bodies.  You are puzzled why they didn't just use the machine again to become normal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing you realize is that you fell asleep.  You look up to see that you are being lifted into Boot's kennel!  You bend your neck around to see that your Mom is putting you away for the night!  She has no idea it is really you in Boot's body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls are all fast asleep on the couch and your mother quietly covers them up with blankets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns off the lights and tip toes upstairs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou.....   </span></div></div>",

Whenever Mom eats, food is forced into your mouth.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few days, you sense you are inverted because you can tell Mom is laying down.  You think somebody is trying to touch Mom's belly and you kick back at the hand.  You finally realize they are pushing to hard on her stomach and very repetitive.

It grosses you out but you cannot do anything to change the situation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start kicking as hard as you can to try and make it stop.

You pull into Ms. Becker's driveway and unlock the door and make a V line for the computer.

Taking it over to Emily's copier printer you make a duplicate.

Where would Ms. Becker go as me?  A party?  At home?  Looking at the stack of papers you have a overwhelming urge to finish correcting them. <br>\r\nWhat am I doing!

You are now 26 and a dead ringer for your mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie walks over to you, \"Katy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily smiles, \"don't you want to go to the party tonight too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie reluctantly steps into the pod.  Emily starts up the machine again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily steps out of the machine, She is now 16 her breasts have tightened up, her butt has shrunk up.  She looks in the mirror and smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie steps out of the pod, she also looks like a 26 year old version of her mom.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily smiles, \"I'll take you to the party after that I am going on a date after that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Julie look at Emily. \"Who you going out of date with?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles, \"you'll see, but first lets drop you off at the party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to take my drivers test again, but I am 16 and I've set it up through the school.\"  Emily says as she drives you to the party.  This starts to sink in, she must have known about the machine, but is she planning to stay young and leave you both older?  It doesn't matter right now, time to have fun.  You'll figure it out later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drops you both off and begins driving off, \"Have fun girls, I'll have fun tonight!  I'm going out with your brother, Katy!\"  She laughs as she drives away</span></div></div>",

Why did they sell the farm right away?  You wonder if Zack knows what happened, the people who owned the farm were relatives of his... The last entry in the notebook was about 2 days before the farm went up for sale.  The couple that owned the farm just packed up and left. This is quite the mystery.  You sit back and start mulling all this over when; all of a sudden your brother poked his head into the lab room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweet\u2026. a secret room!  You can\u2019t even see the door when it is closed\u201d Daryl says as he plays with the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coool! What is all of this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is supposed to be a mind transfer machine,\" You tell Daryl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughs at you and says, \u201cwhat ever.\u201d He starts poking around the computer stand and starts to look into the other pod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie comes in the door with a glass of juice.  She totally lights up when she sees Daryl.  She asks, \"How are you and Mary doing, Daryl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaryl replies as he pokes around the other pod,\u201d Never been better, why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t resist, being his sister and knowing what\u2019s best for him, \"She's a complete butt-wad!  What do you see in her?  She's bossy, she\u2019s rude, and she\u2019s arrogant.... I hate her with a passion!  You should kick her butt to the curb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaryl starts to come up with a reply, but before he could Julie bumps him with her butt and Daryl falls off balance into the pod.  The door on the pod goes shut and there is a big smile on Julies face as she pushes the button on the control panel.  Next thing you know you are in Daryl's body and he is in yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie says, \"I was looking forward to switching with Katy, but this will be so much better.  You guys should stay like this till tomorrow night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, this might be fun.\" you say as you fight off some strange sensations.  You look over at Daryl in your body.<br>\r\n\"Get my hands off those you perv!\" You yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour old body turns all red and says, \"Sorry Katy, don't know what came over me.  Looks like I'm not the only one.  Seems somebody over there is pitching a tent.\u201d  You shift away from all red and say, \u201cthen it\u2019s agreed we\u2019ll switch tomorrow night.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The young Misty escorts a confused older misty to the time gate types in the date you had just came from and pushes her through the time portal.  <br>\r\n\"There we go, don't need her interfering with our future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Misty and ask, \"Why have you come back to the past.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at herself in a Mirror and says, \"I want to fix things about myself, undo a couple mistakes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty looks at Zack who is sweating heavily and looks sick. \"What\u2019s wrong baby,\" She asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack looks at his mom and says, \"I don't know I haven't felt well since you jumped through the gate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well tonight we'll go to the party where I met your Dad Zack and conceived you.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack looked at his Mom in shock, \"I can't believe you just said this to my friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty laughs, \"oh by the way we can see your parents too, Kyle and Liz.  They aren't dating yet, but they start around this time.  Your Mom is around too Julie but she isn't dating that horrible father of yours yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Julie and she looks down all embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you guys want to go to the party?  I have to go or else Zack won't exist\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You realize there is no way that they will let Tara in, but luckily Julie offers to watch her.  Julie says she wants to see where her mom grew up.  This will work out perfectly you think.  As Julie walks away with Tara, you and Darryl start feeling sick as well.  You wonder what is going; maybe this is a side effect of time travel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty looks at you, Zack and Darryl and says, \"lets go in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside you see Your Mom she is drinking and talking to this huge man.  Misty say's, \u201che's the captain of the college football team.  He'll be a famous quarterback one day.\"  Misty looks around and says, \"That's funny Katy, I could have sworn you father was here with your mother tonight....hmmmm..... Oh well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty walks off and starts talking with a guy that looks kind of like Zack.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarryl looks over at Zack, \"Holy cow, Zack! That must be your father.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack looking really sick says, \"I've never met my father, this is really cool.\"  Zack try's to go over to see him and begins getting really sick.  He almost collapses.  <br>\r\n\"I don't know what's going.  I feel so weak.\" Zack says as starts stumbling.<br>\r\nBoth you and Darryl grab Zack before he falls over.<br>\r\nAcross the room you see Misty go into one of the side bedrooms with Zack's soon to be father.  <br>\r\nTen minutes later Misty steps out with her drink and spits a load of cum into it. <br>\r\nZack looks horrible now.  One of the foot ball players looks at him and says, \"Wow he can't hold his liquor.\" <br>\r\nThe guy who Misty was in the room with steps out and she throws her drink at his face.<br>\r\n\"You creep! You promised you would take care of me and our son and you ran off!  You piece of shit!\"  Misty kicks the guy in the nuts and he falls to his knees.<br>\r\nA couple of football players come over and look at the guy.  \"Is he giving you trouble Misty?\"<br>\r\nShe nods and they pick him up and throw him out the door.<br>\r\nMisty walks by and she doesn't see to recognize Zack, she just storms by.  Zack now is almost to the point of complete collapse he is looking horrible.  Both you and Darryl take him to the bathroom.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Darryl and ask what should we do?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarryl says \"I don't know, we got to get Misty and Zack's dad back together.   You notice the more the more friendly the football guy gets with Mom the more sick you and Darryl get.  You turn to Darryl, \"We have to get Dad and mom together too or else we could be in trouble too.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You walk up to Misty and drag her away from them. Afraid they would do something to you too, you call her big sister. The boys back off then, and some of them seem less interested in Misty now. You look around for Zack but you can't find him, you then go up for a room. Most of them are occupied with horny teenagers. You find a small one and let Misty sit down on the available bed. \"What's wrong with you? \"Your only son has vaporized, and you're hooking up with every other boy? Misty looks at you angry, \"so what? I'm just having a little fun,\" Misty said playing innocent. \"Your son is gone from existence, and you are enjoying yourself?\" You ask her. \"Yeah, you know how hard it is to try and raise a son alone?\" \"You have everything, both parents a house, while I had to take care for mine. I had to take the most sleaziest jobs you could find, so yeah I deserve a little fun.\" <br>\r\n\"But Zack is gone, you say almost crying. Misty sees this and steps down a little. <br>\r\n\"I know, but I don't want to stay the rest of my life raising a son alone. But what did you do different this time?\" You ask her. \"I took him in my mouth,\" she says. \"The first time I did it with him, was the worst time ever. I don't want to do that ever again.\" She says embittered. \"She then looks at you. \"But maybe we can change that, how about you take his place?\" Misty suggests. \"Me? But I'm a virgin.\" You answer. \"I mean you take his body and then impregnate me, Misty says. \"But he's going to leave you, you say, what would that help?\" \"Simple, you have to stay like him until Zack is born, then he won't leave me and we can leave both of them.\" <br>\r\nYou think about it, but you're not entirely sure about this. Meanwhile you feel a lot better, seems Katy did it already. \"Isn't there some other way, we can do this?\" You ask her. \"No way, I mean not while I have a say in this.\" You then thought about something. \"What if we swap you with someone else and make that person do it with quarterback? That way you won't feel a thing.\" Misty looks at you, and thinks about it. \"Sure, if we can find someone who would want to do it with that gorilla.\" \"Okay, let's find someone.\" You say already wanting to leave the room. \"Not so fast, we toss about it.\" Misty says grabbing a quarter. \"Heads means you will have to swap, tails will mean I get to swap. \"Fine, do it.\" You say.

You were the one who was supposed to cease to exist or at least, changed into my son.

You're unsure what to do but go down with your feeling and rub her tongue with your tongue. You see her eyes wide opening and then you throw her on the bed. You continue kissing her, the way she smells makes you kiss her neck all the way down. Meanwhile she strips you out of your clothes. You then try to undo her bra but it's harder than it looks. \"You'll learn it.\" She says undoing the bra herself. You're immediately over them, you kneed them and try to suck on them. \"Don't do too hard. They will stay here.\" She says giving you advice. You listen to her advice and you notice her getting more relaxed. You then think it's time for it. \"Are you ready?\" You ask her. She just nods and you push it inside.

It's tight inside, but then you notice something. You saw a drip of blood. You then realize she must be a virgin until then, and you were her first one. It gives you the power to kick it up a notch.

Misty looks a bit unhappy with the situation but complies. The TV works and you find a TV show to watch. While Misty first looks uncomfortable, she later relaxes a bit as she watches the TV.

She quickly uses it to dry herself off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will need some different clothes, I'll get some for you.\" Misty goes upstairs leaving you alone with your former mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks suddenly nervous as she notices that you've been staring at her body all this time. She quickly covers herself up, but changing her mind she removes her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All those guys looked right through me, I don't care anymore if somebody sees me naked.\" She tells you. She removes her bra and her skirt, standing there naked in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was different than your mother used to be, she was always a bit shy about her body exposed. You can only look at Stacy's well developed breasts and nice figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we sit down?\" You ask her, not knowing what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods as you both sit down on the couch where you and Misty just sat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you don't have any idea where Liz or Misty might be?\" You ask her to break the ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy shakes her head. \"I seriously don't know, there was this guy that really liked me for some reason. He kept asking me to come over for some private dancing, but I was too scared. Then Misty suddenly walks over to this guy and starts dancing in front of him. I got called away and I haven't seen her the rest of the evening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy looks down as she seems troubled. \"And you know what the weirdest part is?\" She asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head. \"As weird as it might seem, when Misty began to dance in front of him. She...She really looked good, I mean I did.\" Stacy looks really depressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pat her on her back, you don't know what else to do.</span></div></div>",

Your Mom is a cosmetologists, she's out going and lets you do what ever.  Mine is a prude, a former librarian who is so out of touch with anything cool, it\u2019s painful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie looks at you with a hurt expression, \u201cI go over to your house to escape my life, you have it so cool.  Your Mom and Dad do things with you, make time to hang out.  I want to change my life, trust me.  My Dad is a dick, total ass, not like yours Katy.  Your Dad is quite and shy, but always makes time, When you screw up and do something wrong he's totally cool!  There is no hitting or yelling or screaming.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It is unbeliveable how a  much has changed in this part of town.  The road to the high school go right through open fields.  No houses,no gasstations, no mini malls nothing. Wow if you went back in time a little further and bought this land you could be rich!  It is amazing how this area has really developed.   The high school building itself stands alone out in a field.   In your time it is completely surrounded by housing developments.   As you get closer, you see the doors are all propped open.<br>\r\nWalking in to the building you look at Julie and giggle, \"Wow, I can't believe nobody is stopping us.\" <br>\r\nThe janitors don't even pay attention and continue cleaning the halls and rooms.  Some of these guys still work there in your time, but they are a lot older.   Going down the halls you see a summer job sign up sheet with both of your Moms names on them.  Your Mom has her name for library assistant; Julie\u2019s mom has hers as an assistant for the hair salon.  <br>\r\nJulie is ahead of you. in her pretty designer pants, tight shirt, long beautiful hair, her make up carefully applied.  She always looks beautiful, her mom is an excellent beautician.   Looking at the list and the pencil on taped to the string you think this is a perfect opportunity.   Maybe a little beauty school could help your Mom loosen up.  You erase your moms name and put her on the sign up sheet for the hair stylist assistant.  <br>\r\nYou put Julies Mom name on the librarian assistant\u2019s sheet in place of your Mom's name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strange sensation runs thorough you as you finish changing the names.  As the feelings pass you look down.  You\u2019re now in a tight short skimpy dress and a tight fitting halter top and a designer purse.   Holding out your hands, you now have long acrylic finger nails.   You catch the smell of your perfume.  Julie walks over, she wearing her a geeky outfits, no makeup, her hair held in a pony tail with a scrunchy and her ugly glasses.  The girl has no style; you don't know why you hang out with her.  She could be so pretty is she tried, too bad her home life sucked so badly.  <br>\r\nYou realize this isn't right, things are changing from your actions.  Julie looks at you, then turns to the display case and stares at herself in the mirror.  She touches her glasses and turns and looks at you and asks, \"What did you do?  Look at me?  What have you done? We have to fix this!\"<br>\r\nWalking over to a display case you look at the reflective mirrors in the back.  It\u2019s strange you can remember your old past and this new one you've created.  Looking in the mirror, you look so beautiful almost painted up like kewpie doll.  You know you can't tell Julie what you've done so you think of a lie.  <br>\r\n\"I bet the others are messing something up here in the past!  We better find them and fix it!\"<br>\r\nThe Janitor yells, \u201cYou can\u2019t be in here, not dressed like that.\u201d<br>\r\nBoth you and Julie run for the door, its hard going in your heels.  As you leave the building and the summer job sign uplists, memories of the previous time line  begin to fade.  You just have to keep Julie occupied till the old time line fades away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull out a cigarette out of your purse and start to light it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie whacks it out of your hand.  \u201cAre you nuts?  Your two months pregnant!  You aren\u2019t smoking are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back kind of shocked, \u201cYou are such a prude!  I don\u2019t know why I hang out with you.  Let\u2019s go find everybody else.\u201d  You think to yourself was I pregnant in the other time line too?  Did I smoke?</span></div></div>",

The farther I go from that school the more I change.  I have two distinct memories of my past, one where I don't like my home life, I am popular and I know who I am.  That set of memories is fading!\"  <br>\r\nShe points at you, \"The other is I hate my home life, have no self respect, only exist to get a little approval from you!  Why; I don't know!\"<br>\r\nThrowing her arms in the air, she looks at you, \"You are a skank, you have way to much make up on, you are pregnant, you smoke....You...You...aren't the sweet girl you should be!  I have to change what you did back, I can't be a nobody; a yes girl, to a bitch.  I have to turn you back to the sweet shy girl you were.\"  She begins walking back towards the high school and turns back towards you almost pleading she asks, \u201cTell me what you did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your problem; bitch can't stand me being popular!  Want to destroy that, want me to be like you are now!\"<br>\r\nJulie looks at you, \"You don't get it, what you were, is who I wanted to be.  You are a whore now; you don't even know which guy you've been with is the father to your kid.\"  She says pointing at your belly.  \"I'm going to save both of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't let you, I am popular in this timeline!\" you say totally furious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are not popular; you are just a quick lay for the guys!\"  Julie yells back as she starts towards the high school.  You can hear her talking as she walks away, \"I don't care if you won't help me.  I know the area where we were when things started to change; I'll find it and fix it for both of our sakes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll stop you!\" you scream as you start after Julie.  Your heels don't let you move very fast and you are very out of shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How, they won't let you back in!\"  Julie reply's entering into the school.  \"Prepare to change back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STOP!\" you scream, but it\u2019s too late as Julie walks into the building.  You start after her, but a Janitor points you toward the door.  \"Not dressed like that miss.\"  This guy doesn\u2019t know fashion sense. \u201cGrrrrrrr.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie hates her dad so much; well I'll take care of that. I'll find him and keep him from being with Samantha, Julie\u2019s mom.  As the thought rolls through your mind, you watch as Julie stumbles.  She gets up holding her head.  She's stumbling around like she getting drunk.  \"Go ahead try Julie; I'll stop you another way!\"   You can see the fear in Julie as she almost runs towards the area where you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn toward town; you have to find either Julie dad or mom.  That bitch won't destroy your popularity.  The problem is getting there in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA car stops.   It\u2019s a younger version of your dad.  He leans out and asks, \u201cNeed a ride miss.\u201d With a smile, \u201cYes you\u2019re a lifesaver.  I need you to take me to see a friend.

She smirked harder as you let out a gasp and then offered no resistance when you pulled her into the house and slammed the door shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0'You can't smoke in my body! What if my '<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tina looked at the smouldering cigarette in her fingers, 'I mean, clearly I can. I think you mean to say I \"shouldn't smoke\" in your body.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That....that was true. Why had you made that silly mistake? It wasn't the kind of thing you usually did. Your eyes darted around as you tried to reason it out but they kept coming back to Tina who was just grinning and taking languid drags on her cigarette. You got angry then, and out of frustation, you swung for Tina's head, trying to knock the cigarette from her mouth, but the girl giggled and stepped back smartly so that you only connected with air. The momentum of the attack carried you to the ground and Tina stood over you .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0'It's obvous, don't you think?' Tina dropped the cigarette and crushed it beneath her converse. 'Different minds, but different brains too. All that chemistry in my brain which caused me to be angry, sociopathic, unbalanced, whatever, it didn't come along for the transfer. Just the mind. My mind is in a pristine environment and has its chance to shine, whereas yours, on the other hand, well, the case may glitter but the contents inside are rotten the whole way through.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You watched from your position on the floor as she stepped towards the door way. As she put her hand on the handle, she turned to you and said, 'I watched you with my kids today. Spying. My memories came back pretty fast and I was angry with you, so I stormed over and then when I saw you with them, I was furious, because, who the fuck did you think you were doing all that with my kids, but then, I always hated them, you know. The kids, I mean. Felt they tied me down, that they were mistakes, the whole bunch of them. They're yours now though, and for what it's worth, you'll be a better mother to them than I was. You know, so long as your mind can cope with my broken brain.' She gave a smile then left the house with you stilll on the floor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rather excited by this prospect, having always wondered what it might be like to be a grown up (and not be pushed around by her big brother and sister all the time), Tara grinned and grabbed Boots, before quickly scampering out of the machine shop and across the farm, towards the house on a mission to find her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz meanwhile was standing at the kitchen sink, washing up the lunch dishes and singing away to herself, when out of the window she spotted her youngest daughter running towards the house clutching hold of that mangy old farm cat and scaring away all the nearby chickens in the process, her face lit up with a childlike enthusiasm that only a ten year old could possess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah to be young,\" Liz smiled, finding her daughter's energy and excitement amusing, wishing that she could derive that much pleasure from running around exploring and playing with the farm animals as Tara did. She really had taken to the move the best, every new discovery in this new house or on the farm being like a new adventure for her, which Liz had to admit, made her feel slightly envious. Still feeling like this move wasn't the right one for her, having left so much behind and being unsure of what her place was now. Kyle, her husband had his own job, as well as the farm work and enjoyed spending his days off out in the fields, having always wanted this kind of life since he was a small boy. Daryl, her son was very similar to his father in that respect, also enjoying living out in the fresh air of the country side, having already made close friend's with a young boy named Zack and even gotten himself a girlfriend who lived not too far away. Katy, her daughter she supposed was the only member of the family in a similar position as herself, not really having taken to her new surroundings at all, having always been a popular girl who was very much missing her friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If only I could be as young and carefree as Tara,\" Liz thought, thinking that perhaps would be the answer to her problems, and would stop her worrying about all the things she was missing out on in the city and just enjoy the admittedly rather picturesque and beautiful countryside around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she was thinking this, she watched as Tara, almost tripping on a mound of dirt, headed straight towards the house and a moments later appeared, flushed and a little out of breath in the doorway. \"Mom! Mom! You're never gonna believe what me and Boots found!\" she cried, dropping the cat to the floor, her eyes wide with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling again at her daughter, Liz turned away from the sink and asked, \"Oh, and what's that? Not another magical portal into the fairy realm? (referencing Tara's last major 'discovery' in the corn fields).\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's even better than that! It's a body swapping machine!\" she yelped, grabbing at the bottom of her mother's blue, flowery dress, \"Come see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling her eyes a little at this, wondering to herself what else her youngest daughter's overactive imagination was going to conjure up next, Liz replied, \"Oh wow. A body swapping machine? <i>Really?</i>\" playing along, not liking to shatter the illusion, \"And did you use it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not yet. But I wanna!\" Tara said, glad that her mother was on board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? This isn't Boots I'm talking to is it?\" Liz smiled, pointing to the cat that was now sitting licking it's paws underneath the table, \"And that's Tara there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head at this, Tara adamantly told her, \"No, I'm me, mom. I'm Tara!\", not being entirely sure how her own mother could confuse her for a cat, as she explained, \"I haven't used the machine, I've only looked at the manual. But I need someone to test it on, so come look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to sweetheart, but I'm in the middle of the dishes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll only take a second. Please mom. <i>Please!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her young daughter pleading with her and pulling on her skirt again, Liz finally relented, deciding to humor her for the moment and get back to the washing up after. \"Oh alright then. Lets go take a look at this 'machine'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis pleased Tara no end, and grabbing at her mother's hand she led her out the back door and back across the way she'd came, towards the machine shop beside the main barn. Liz, unlike her husband, her son and Tara hadn't really done too much exploring around the place as of yet, and had never actually been inside the machine shop, not thinking that there would be anything much of interest to her there and being somewhat right as the walked in through the door. \"Well I guess this explains where she got the whole 'body swapping machine' thing from,\" Liz thought as she looked at all the old pieces of farm equipment that littered the place, most of which was all rusted and covered in dust. It not being such a huge leap for Tara to make up stories and pretend what some of this machinery actually was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, is that it there?\" Liz asked as they headed towards what looked like the seat of an old tracker that had been ripped out, with some of the levers and an old gearbox sitting beside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. It's through here,\" came Tara's reply as she rushed right past it, towards the secret door at the back that she'd only just discovered about fifteen minutes prior. Entering the room again, the light being still left on from before, Tara then stopped and grinned, pointing at the two large pods before her. \"This is it. This is the body swapping machine,\" she beamed, looking back round at her mother's reaction as she stared at the thing with a look of surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My goodness,\" Liz said, having certainly not expected to see something like this, the strange object in front of her looking far from the old piece of rusting equipment she thought it would be, \"What is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already told you, it's a body swapping machine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz however still didn't buy this, presuming that it was a machine alright, but not entirely sure what kind. Something the previous owners of the farm must have left behind. It didn't look like anything for the farm however, and seemed way more modern and advanced than anything else in the machine shop; containing flickering diodes and LCD screens and God knows what else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we try it now, mom?\" Tara asked excitedly as her mother began examining one of the large pods, still trying to figure out exactly what it was, \"I wanna see if it work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetheart, I don't think it's actually a body swapping machine somehow,\" Liz replied, looking back round at her daughter, not particularly wanting to spoil her game, but being a little more concerned now that if she played around with it she might get hurt, seeing as it obviously wasn't an old piece of junk that no longer worked as she thought it might be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Tara slightly upset, realizing that her mother didn't believe her, and so grabbing the instruction book she'd discovered earlier, she marched over to where Liz was still curiously looking and held it out in front of her. \"It <i>is</i> a body swapping machine. It says so right here!\" Taking the notebook from Tara, Liz gazed rather curiously at it, before opening it up and reading what was inside, getting a more than startling surprise when she realized that what he daughter had been telling her was the truth all along; this thing, this machine <i>was</i> created for body swapping!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God,\" she gasped, looking back up from the pages and over at the machine, being totally blown away by this discovery, having never imagined that such a thing could actually exist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this, Tara smiled and folded her arms rather smugly, telling her mother, \"See, I told you it was a body swapping machine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...I'm sorry, sweetheart,\" Liz stuttered, still trying to take this all in, being entirely swept up in her own new found amazement, \"This...this is <i>incredible!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So can we test it now?\" Tara asked, her enthusiasm once again returning now that Liz was fully on board, \"Can we try and swap bodies to see if it works?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis question slightly flummoxed Liz, having always been the straight and sensible type, and yet being totally amazed and excited by this discover, just the same as her daughter, feeling an intense curiosity building within her to actually give it a go. \"I...I don't know. Should we?\" she said, becoming more than a little flustered, allowing the responsible, adult part of her brain take over for a moment, \"I mean is it...is it safe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks safe to me,\" Tara replied anxiously, having no such concerns as she began pulling at her mother's skirt once more, \"Come on. Please, mom! It'll be so cool if it works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz thought about this, being of course very curious what swapping bodies might actually be like; especially with her young daughter, whom only minutes ago she'd wished she could actually be more like...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oh, why not?\" Liz suddenly answered, throwing caution to the wind and decided to share in some of her daughter's child like enthusiasm for discovery, figuring that if the instruction manual said it was safe enough to try, then it was safe enough to try. \"It might be fun to be you for a little while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara immediately jumped for joy and let out a loud squeal of excitement, \"YAAAAAAY!\" wanting to very much see what life was like in her mother's body as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling again at her daughter, Liz then looked again at the instruction manual, wanting to make sure they followed everything to the letter. After a quick but thorough read through, she then headed towards the main control panel and instructed Tara to get into the left pod, which she promptly did. Then after making sure that all the buttons and switches were set correctly on the control panel as was shown in the book, Liz stepped into the other pod and said, looking over to her daughter, \"Okay, sweetheart, are you ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, I'm good to go,\" Tara grinned, her small body filling with anticipation as she crossed her fingers tightly, praying that it would work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here goes nothing then,\" Liz said, feeling just as nervous and as excited as her daughter clearly was, as she reached over and pressed the big red button beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA matter of seconds later, the machine began to hum, the sound growing impressively louder and louder until it abruptly stopped and a huge flash of blinding white light suddenly shot out from the pods, filling the entire room for a second before quickly vanishing, leaving both mother and daughter breathing heavily in the pods, unsure of what exactly they'd just seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara was the first to emerge, finding that her vision was slightly blurry from the bright light and that her senses were a little on the peculiar side. The first thing she did notice as they began to return to her, and as she stood up was both a heavy weight pulling at her chest and a few, long strands of dark red hair that had fallen across her eyes; Tara's hair having always been a light strawberry blond color which she tied back in bunches. \"<i>Oh wow...</i>\" she whispered, grabbing for the hair, discovering her mother's deeper, more mature voice coming from her mouth. \"It worked! Oh my God, IT WORKED\" she suddenly squealed, gazing first at her much larger, older looking hands, complete with wedding and engagement ring decorating a finger and much longer, prettier looking nails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping up out of the pod, feeling her much larger, heavier body jiggle and bounce in places she'd never even imagined before, utterly amazed and dumbfounded that the swap had actually happened, Tara's gaze then lowered towards the two large masses of flesh she now had decorating her chest, mostly concealed beneath her mothers pretty flowery blue dress, but with just a hint of their size and shape visible beneath one of the undone buttons. <i>\"I've got boobs!</i>\" Tara shrieked as her mother's hands grabbed for the two big lumps sticking out from her body, having always imagined what it might be like to have breasts (being only 10 and therefore flat chested), having always admired both her big sister's and her mother's. Now she had a pair of her own and they truly were ginormous, her mother having always been a very busty lady, and Tara was positively overwhelmed by the sensation as she groped at the big, soft and spongy orbs, feeling their immense weight pulling at her body in a way she'd never experienced before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs all this was happening, Liz too had discovered that she had also changed, being on the opposite side of the machine than she had previously been on, her body feeling a whole lot lighter and smaller, and without those exceptionally heavy weights on her chest that she'd had to carry around for the last twenty odd years. \"It worked...\" she said, echoing her daughter's sentiments as she sat in the pod patting at her slender frame, hearing Tara's youthful prepubescent voice coming from her mouth, before quickly jolting up out of the pod to see her former self grabbing excitedly at her body, looking absolutely amazed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tara, it worked!\" Liz shouted, jumping out of the pod in a manner she was certain she could have never done in her own body, watching as her daughter (now her) turned to see her own former self looking right at her. \"We've switched bodies! We've actually switched bodies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them then descended into a mass of hysterics as the squealed and danced and leapt about all over the small room for the next several minutes, examining each others bodies and noting all the dramatic differences there in. Tara was obviously hugely happy that she was now bigger and taller and had breasts, as well as a nice curvy womanly figure that was the exact opposite of her skinny little ten year old body. Liz similarly was delighted to be younger and fitter and unburdened by her heavy chest, finding the fact that it was now she who had to look up at her daughter rather amusing, being now over a foot shorter than her former body was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is incredible, I can't believe I'm actually my 10 year old daughter,\" Liz smiled as she grabbed at Tara's short little bunches, examining her different colored hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so cool, mom. I'm a grown up now!\" Tara giggled, looking down at her much smaller mother, enjoying the fact that she was taller now (5' 6\" instead of her previous 4' 4\").<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You certainly are,\" Liz said, laughing at the sight of her former self towering over her, finding it rather strange to see (as if she was looking into some sort of really weird and crazy mirror), but at the same time rather enjoying the experience. Looking back down at herself for a second, Tara's body which was currently clothed in a cute little pink t-shirt with a white pony on it, a pair of blue shorts and some dirty looking white socks and sneakers, she then wondered what they were supposed to do now that the test had been successful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsking Tara this very question, she gave an immediate and decisive reply. \"We should totally spend the rest of the day like this!\" she beamed, enjoying very much being inside her mother's body and not yet wanting it to end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, sweetheart. Do you think that would be such a good idea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it'll be fun. We can even try tricking dad and Daryl and Katy into thinking I'm you and you're me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, that would be fun,\" Liz admitted considering it for a moment, before quickly coming to her senses, \"but I don't think so. We've tested the machine out and it works. We should really swap back now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis answer didn't go down well with Tara, as she began to plead, \"Awww. Please, mom! Please can we spend a bit longer like this! I wanna be a grown up for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you do,\" she replied, finding the image of her own body pleading with her slightly surreal, \"And while I must admit it really is amazing being young again, we really should...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if you like being young, don't you want to experience it for longer?\" Tara said, cutting her mother off, \"Don't you want to run around and play and forget all about doing grown up things like dishes and cleaning and just have fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Liz pause, her young daughter certainly had a point here, she was kind of fed up of being stuck indoors doing nothing but household chores all day, but really having nothing else to do here on the farm to pass the time. Maybe it would be nice to be Tara for a while, to stop worrying about things so much and just enjoy being in the moment. It had been a very, very long time after all since she'd been a little girl, messing around and having fun. Would it be so bad to experience that again, to stay in this body a little while longer? Surely not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what, you're right,\" she said, deciding once again to go with her heart rather than her head, having always wanted the to get to know her children better and thinking that there would be no greater chance than this. \"It'll be a nice little change of pace for us both. You'll get to experience things as me and I'll get to experience things as you. Then at the end of the day we can switch back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Tara cheer out in celebration,\"Yes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's just one condition,\" her mother then added, having one final stipulation, \"This stays just between you and me. Nobody else can know about the swap or about this machine, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Tara agreed, happy to go along with anything if it meant getting to be her mom for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Then we'll meet back here tonight after nine. Until then, I'm Tara - <i>your daughter</i> and you're Liz - <i>my mother</i>. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it.\" Tara smiled, unable to contain her enthusiasm as she joyously squeaked, \"<i>This is gonna be so much fun!</i>\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Having decided to spend the rest of the day as each other, Liz laid down a few quick ground rules, aware that if her 10 year old daughter was inside her body then she didn't want her doing anything that she'd later regret (Tara being naive to a lot the responsibilities her mother had to deal with on a daily basis). With that all sorted, she then decided that the first thing she was going to do in her new, youthful, nubile young body was exactly what Tara had been doing earlier, and that was having fun exploring the farm. Having only moved here a couple of weeks ago and having spent most of that time inside the house, Liz had yet to properly see everything the countryside had to offer, there being many fields, trees and even a nearby river that she'd only ever heard tales about from her daughter or son, and seeing as for the time being she didn't have any grown up stuff to worry about, she might as well make the most of her time and perhaps relive a bit of her youth. After all, that was the point of the swap wasn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have fun, <i>mom</i>,\" Liz giggled after the two of them had closed the secret door again and exited the machine shop, waving her young daughter goodbye as she skipped off with Spike the dog in tow, calling back to her as she went, \"Don't forgot about the dishes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't, <i>Tara!</i>\" her daughter waved back, actually finding the idea of doing dishes kind of novel, especially in her mother's form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her mother vanished into the distance, Tara's attention returned to herself again, as she gazed down at her mature, curvy body, taking in the wondrous sight of her big boobs again, as well as craning her neck to check out her large, firm butt. Finally, Tara then grabbed the bottom of her mother's dress to look at her long legs and began spinning on the spot, doing a little pirouette for an imaginary crowd (and a few chickens that happened to be pecking at the ground nearby), before breaking into yet another giggle and heading quickly off towards the house. This time accompanied by a lot more jiggling and bouncing though, her new chest clearly not having been designed with running in mind. \"Whoops! Better watch out or I might knock myself out,\" she thought to herself, realizing a gentle stroll might be the better way to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the house again, Tara went inside, finding as she did that she became even more aware of her new increase in size; seeing everything from a slightly higher perspective as she headed towards the sink where a few of the lunchtime dishes still waited to be washed. Washing dishes had never really been something Tara had ever done before, having watched her mother do it often enough and even helped out drying them, so doing them now really was a kind of new experience and helped her to feel the part as she stuck her hands into the still slightly warm water and began singing to herself like her mom did (though admittedly a very different kind of song than her mom usually did).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm away over to Julie's now, mom,\" she suddenly heard a voice say from behind, and turning round she saw her older sister, Katy walking towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh my God, she has no idea it's me!</i>\" Tara chuckled inside her head, having forgotten her sister was still in the house (her dad and Daryl having left after lunch to fix a fence and do something with a tractor, which of course Katy had no interest in doing). \"Uhm, okay, Katy,\" she replied with a big grin, having to keep herself from giggling out loud, as she did her best impression of what her mother might say, \"Have fun and...and don't stay out too late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Too late?</i> Mom, I'm only gonna be gone a couple of hours. I told you that already. I'll be back before dinner, \" her sister replied, giving her an odd look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara didn't know quite how to respond to this, this being her first ever attempted conversation as her mother, and so after a brief pause, repeated again, \"Have fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" Katy said, grabbing an apple from the fruit bowl and heading out the door, \"See you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she had gone, and Tara observed her walking past the window, she let out another little yelp, congratulating herself again on the deception (forgetting that it hadn't exactly been flawless).\"Wow, that was so cool. I totally fooled Katy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was funny, Tara had always been somewhat in awe of her older sister, wishing that she could be more like her; Katy being much taller, much prettier and a whole load more popular (at least where they used to live). She was basically a younger version of their mother, with similarly long red hair, a nice figure that had more than started to develop, having already grown a nicely sized pair of boobs and looking like, when she was slightly older, was certainly going to follow in the same busty footsteps as their mom. Tara on the other hand had always been more of a tomboy and was never all that popular with other girls (not like Katy was), so she always wished she could be more like her, even though their interests weren't exactly the same. Now though, now that Tara <i>was</i> their mom, it was almost as if she'd jumped one step further; being taller, more mature, and far curvier than Katy, and a grown up to boot. It was a wonder she'd never though of being mom before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, let Katy have fun with her friend, I can have my own fun,\" she said to herself, thinking about all the times she'd begged her sister to let her tag along with her, having little interest in doing that now. Knowing that her day was going to be far more interesting than just sitting in Julie's bedroom talking about boys.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Finishing up the dishes, finding that it wasn't quite the chore that her mother made it out to be, Tara then wondered to herself what she was going to do now, before realizing that since the swap she hadn't properly gotten a look at herself in a mirror, deciding to do that now, wanting to take in the full completed picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading out of the kitchen and into the hall, where her mother's old, full size antique mirror hung, she stopped in front of it and took in her new reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I really am mom,\" she smiled, already aware of this fact of course, but seeing herself in the mirror now fully driving that point home. It was a strange feeling certainly, she though, to be staring into a mirror and seeing instead of her own face, someone else's staring back, their movements perfectly matching her own, but it was also really, <i>really</i> cool. There she stood, looking in wide eyed amazement, with a big old grin painted on her face, Tara's 32 year old mother, with her long, dark red hair tied back in a loose, messy ponytail, her long bangs hanging down the side of her pretty, soft and motherly face. Her curvy body was still clothed in that pretty, blue flowery dress, with short little sleeves and a skirt that reached just below the knee, showing off a good chunk of her nicely toned legs, while on her feet she wore a pair of flat, light brown sandals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so cool!\" Tara giggled again, watching her mother do the same, as she then placed her hands on her hips and said, in her best angry mother voice, \"<i>That's it young lady, go to your room!</i>\" Enjoying this, finding playing acting as her rather fun, she then proceeded to act out a few other words or phrases she'd often hear her mother say, specifically aimed towards either her or her siblings, breaking into laughter after each one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of more minutes of this, she then turned her attention to exploring herself again, gently running her hands down the contours of her new curvy, womanly form, very much appreciating the difference from her own scrawny one. Cupping her hands under her large breasts, still having not gotten used to having these, she jiggled each heavy mound up and down a little and gave each one a squeeze, before bringing her hands up to the buttons of her dress and parting the material slightly, trying to get a better view. Moving closer to the mirror, with the gap in her dressed pulled as wide as she could get it, Tara stared into her mother's deep cleavage, the two creamy lumps of flesh being pushed together by what she could only assume was her mother's bra (having never worn one before, but definitely being able to feel something digging into her skin), decorated on the top by a light smattering of freckles. Though she was only 10 and didn't really have much knowledge about sex, that didn't stop Tara from having an appreciation of breasts, having seen enough of them on television and in magazines, not to mention all the women who walked around town in tight tops showing their own off at every given opportunity. She liked how they looked, especially in a low cut top with prominent cleavage on display, wishing that she herself could look like that; breasts just making you seem so much more womanly. This was partly why she admired her older sister so, Katy liking to show off what she had as much as she could (and as much as their parents would allow her), explaining to her younger sister one time that boobs had special powers and that they could make boys do whatever you want. This certainly amused Tara whether it was true or not, and she couldn't wait till she had boobs of her own to try it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this in mind then, wanting to see more of her mother's large chest, she began fiddling with the remaining buttons on the dress, her mom usually keeping her treasures fairly well covered, Tara pulled the top of the dress open, revealing her incredibly deep and impressive half foot of cleavage, as well as the cups of her lacy white bra. \"Mom is so lucky. Her boobs are huge!\" she said, admiring the firm, swells of flesh, before realizing her error,  \"Heh-heh, I mean <i>my</i> boobs are huge! I wonder what they look like naked...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about this, having never actually seen her mom's bare breasts before, only Katy's and only once or twice, Tara figured that there would be no harm in checking it out and gazed around the hallway, wondering to herself if she should check them out here or head upstairs, aware that it might be kind of embarrassing if her dad or brother suddenly came in. \"Yeah, probably best not to do it here,\" she decided, before quickly bounding up the stairs, getting a reminder of how heavy her boobs were in the process as the bounced up and down with every step. Reaching the top, for a brief moment she contemplated going into her parent's bedroom, seeing as it was now technically her room, but chickened out at the last minute, thinking that her dad could still walk in there and instead deciding on the safety and familiarity of her own bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside she shut the door and planted herself in front of her own smaller mirror that hung on the back of her closet, noting as she did her new angle on things again, now looking down at what used to be eye level. Forgetting about this for the moment though and getting back to the reason she'd come in here, Tara grabbed the hem of her mother's dress and yanked it up over her body, getting it caught momentarily on her chest before managing with a bit more of a struggle than she was used to to finally get the thing off. Now stood in front of the small mirror dressed in nothing more than her mother's lacy white bra and matching panties, Tara took a minute or two to evaluate her underwear clad form, once again impressed by the extreme shapes that made her look so womanly. Her breasts were of course huge, and now appeared somehow even bigger without the dress, but her hips and ass were also rather wide, while her waist was relatively slim (not as slim as her own or Katy's of course, but comparatively so), creating a rather beautiful hourglass shape that tapered off onto a nicely toned pair of legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh-heh, I used to live in there,\" she smiled, giving her soft belly a playful little pat, before moving both hands up towards her mother's bra to unleash her new breasts. Having never worn or had to remove a bra before, Tara found this next part a little tricky, as her fingers pulled at the clasp behind her after sliding the straps off her shoulders, not entirely sure how the things was supposed to come undone. She'd seen Katy take a bra off before and that had seemed fairly straightforward, why then was she having so much trouble doing the same thing? \"Argh, who invented these things?\" she groaned, turning her body so her back faced the mirror and looking over her shoulder, needing to see what she was doing if she was going to have any luck undoing the clasp. Fortunately this new viewpoint helped her substantially and working out that there were little hooks she needed to undo, Tara managed to get them off without any further trouble, feeling her large chest slump forward slightly, no longer restrained by the bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy with herself for getting the thing off, as well as feeling some relief that the bra straps were no longer digging into her shoulders, Tara then pulled the garment off and looked down at her now naked breasts. Unencumbered by the bra, the two large, soft mounds hung from her chest with a slight sag, covering her mother's entire ribcage and sticking out rather noticeably on either side of her body. They were still round and firm though and were decorated by the largest nipples this young girl had ever seen. Where as her own were small and a light pink color, her mother's were long and thick and light brownish, surrounded by a bumpy areola that was about the same width as a teacup, pointing straight out from the two fleshy masses like little antennae. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eww, <i>gross!</i>\" was Tara's first reaction, not expecting mature nipples to look quite like that, but quickly getting over it as she began flicking and rubbing at them with her fingers, finding that although they were darker in color and large, very large, they were also kind of cool, the both of them giving off a nice little tingling sensation as rather amazingly, they began to actually harden and grow, nearly doubling in size. Enjoying this fact, and now thinking of the thick rubbery protuberances as just another cool feature of her new adult body, Tara's hands then began happily exploring the rest of her now naked chest, squeezing and pulling at the the doughy flesh and slapping them together like symbols. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter doing this for about five or ten minutes, having a childlike fascination with playing with her new breasts (especially when she would lift them both up towards her face and let them go, causing them to jiggle and rebound around on her chest), Tara then decided to discover if there was any other differences between her mother's body and her own that she'd not yet noticed, her hands curiously sliding their way into her mom's white panties to find out...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pulling at the waistband and looking past the two large mounds that were obstructing most of her view, Tara saw a patch of reddish hair decorating her crotch, this being yet another surprise as she herself was as smooth as a baby down there. \"Yikes, is that what happens when you get older?\" she said, getting her own private form of education on what was going to happen when puberty properly kicked in. Moving her fingers gingerly through the soft, fuzzy forest beneath to see if there was any differences in her 'thingy' (as she affectionately called it), her attention was suddenly diverted when she heard a loud noise from outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemoving her hand from her mother's panties, she headed over to her window, which had a nice view of the back garden, as well as the large barn next to the machine shop. There in the distance she saw her friend Charlie Wilson, who lived across the way, his father, George having become firm friend's with her father, Kyle, often sending him over to help with the farm when George and Kyle were off working in the fields. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie was only two years older than Tara and was a little on the shy side, mostly enjoying his own company while he pottered away on the farm. Tara had first met him two days after they'd moved. George and his wife Claire had come over to introduced themselves and offer their son's services, Charlie having worked for the farms previous owners before they'd sold it. Not really knowing anybody yet and being slightly shunned by her older brother and sister (as well as being a tomboy at heart, preferring messing about in the dirt than doing really girly things) Tara had quickly latched onto Charlie, following him around as he fed the animals or did little odd jobs around the farm. Though he was quiet and a little nervous about this over exited girl constantly pestering him where ever he went, he'd soon got used to her company and had managed to become friends (even if it was a little one sided). Tara found him to be quite funny and knowledgeable about the farm and about country living, Charlie being the one to introduce her to Boots the cat, and he enjoyed listening to the crazy stories she'd make up and the games she'd play, not really having a lot of friend's himself. He was also, Tara though, kind of cute, with his long dark, brown hair and mud splattered face, nearly always dressed in an old blue shirt and work dungarees when helping out on the farm, though she wouldn't admit that to anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing him now, through the window, picking up a pile of old rotting fence posts, which he'd obviously just dropped, creating the loud clatter you'd hear moments before, Tara felt a little flutter of excitement, wanting desperately to run out to her friend and share with him what had happened; share the fact that she was now wearing her own mother's body, very much wanting to see his reaction. \"He'll totally freak!\" she though as she watched him gather up the bits of wood and carry them into the barn, giggling at the thought. Then of course she remembered what her mom had made her promise before she'd gone skipping off into the fields, that neither of them were to tell anyone about the swap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, poo!\" she said, thinking this unfair, having been very much looking forward to telling her friend, but now realizing she can't, not without breaking her promise. \"Hm, well maybe I can't tell him about the body swapping machine, but that doesn't mean I can't still go talk to him,\" she then figured, thinking that it might be equally as fun if her were actually under the impression that she was his mother, having already gotten a kick out of her brief interaction with Katy. \"Yeah. Yeah, that's what I'll do,\" she decided, having quickly overcome her annoyance, looking down at herself and realizing that she'd better put her clothes back on, Charlie surely getting an even bigger surprise if she went outside like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee-hee, that would be fun,\" she giggled as she picked up her mother's bra and put it back on, lifting her large breasts back into the cups and managing, with a lot more success this time, to get the clasp fastened at the back. Slipping the dress back on again and thinking a bit more about Charlie's reaction to seeing her mom naked, Tara suddenly got an idea, recalling what Katy had told her about boobs and boys and thinking that now might be a good time to test it. Charlie was a boy after all and though he'd never really shown any interest in her in 'that way' before, she was certain he wouldn't fail to notice her now, especially if she was showing off her 'motherly goods'. With this in mind, Tara made sure to leave a good many buttons of her dress undone, allowing her breasts and her vast cleavage to be more than amply displayed. \"Lets see what he makes of these,\" she though, giving her chest a playful jiggle in the mirror, before heading out the door and back down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Charlie had finished shifting the rotting fence posts into the barn like Tara's father, Mr. Parker had asked him and was taking a quick breather before getting on with feeding the hens. His day had so far been pretty normal, having woken up and had breakfast like usual, played on his computer for a while, then after lunch headed over to the Parker's farm with his dad, leaving the two of them in the farthest field tinkering with Mr. Parker's new tractor, his dad being good with engines. He had yet to run into Tara this afternoon, which was quite surprising, Tara usually managing to find him where ever he was, appearing from behind with her dog Spike to see what it was he was doing, always with some story or game she'd just made up that she wanted to share with him. Although Charlie did enjoy her company (having it forced on him whether he liked it or not) and appreciated a bit of company from time to time, not having much in the way of friends; female friend's especially, she could be somewhat of a distraction sometimes and it was nice to get some piece and quiet to actually get his chores done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading back to the barn and fetching out the bucket of chicken feed, Charlie then headed towards the hen coop and began scattering the grain on the ground, watching as the chickens all sped towards him and enthusiastically began pecking it up. Hearing a noise in the distance, more specifically the back door of the Parker's house swinging shut, he looked up, half expecting to see Tara coming towards him and instead finding that it was her mom, Mrs. Parker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he didn't really know her all that well, having only spoken to her a handful of times (Mrs. Parker not really being all that involved with the farm): when his parents had first taken him round to see about a job, and on the odd occasion she'd come out with a lemonade or make him and Tara something for lunch, she seemed like a nice enough person. In truth though, Charlie was slightly embarrassed and intimidated around her, finding her to be incredible attractive and not quite knowing what to say or how to act around her. Before her and her family had moved here Charlie's interest in girls was kind of limited, there being Ms. Johnson next door of course (his former teacher), who all the other boys at school had crushes on, but nobody much else really. Now with Mrs. Parker here, Charlie found that he enjoyed his work at the farm all the more, sneaking little glances at her from afar on the odd occasion that she'd appear outside, looking for her children or to hanging out the washing. Only when Tara wasn't around pestering him of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he watched her getting ever closer, in her pretty blue dress, her large chest swaying as she went, he soon realized that she was heading straight towards where he now stood, obviously coming to talk to him. This made him more than a little nervous as he let out a gulp and pretended not to noticed, getting back to feeding the hens like he was supposed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Charlie,\" he heard her say seconds later as she finally reached the coop, her face wearing a big smile as she gave him a little wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, heh-hi, Mrs. Parker,\" he replied, ceasing his activity as he nervously smiled back (having been brought up to always be polite, especially to his elders).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this made Tara inwardly grin as she desperately fought the urge to break into a giggle, Charlie, like Katy being completely fooled by her deception, as she moved even closer.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Whatcha up to?\" she asked, looking him up and down, again thinking how cute he looked with the few bits of loose straw that had managed to find their way into his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, nothing much. I'm just, uh, just feeding the chickens at the moment,\" Charlie told her, wondering what it was she was after, \"Is there anything I can do for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Not really,\" Tara replied, sticking her hands behind her back and swaying gently from side to side, \"I was just bored so I thought I'd come out and hang for a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie gulped a little awkwardly at this, having never known Mrs. Parker to 'hang' with him before, \"Oh...okay,\" before his gaze was then drawn to the gap in her dress, getting an eyeful of the two large breasts that he'd only just noticed were very much on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara couldn't help but noticed this brief action, watching his cheeks turn slightly red as he quickly pulled his eyes away, and feeling a sense of pride as well as excitement that he was looking at her chest (even if it wasn't really hers), she let out a giggle and said, \"Hee-hee, looks like you've been rolling in hay,\" pretending not to notice and instead drawing attention to what was currently in his hair, \"You've got straw all over you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could even react or say anything, still feeling extremely embarrassed to be standing in front of Mrs. Parker with her dress half hanging open (being a young boy and therefore obsessed with breasts, even if he didn't quite know why), Tara quickly stepped forward and began picking out the bits of straw from his head, making sure to position herself directly in front of him as she did. Where as before Charlie had always been taller than Tara, being around 4' 11\", he was now much smaller, his eye line now being directly above her mother's large chest, giving him the most incredible view of her impressive cleavage. The sight was simply breathtaking and although Charlie knew he shouldn't be looking, he couldn't help himself, feeling his face turn even more flush as he felt a slight twitching inside his pants, Mrs. Parker's breasts being just about the most awesome thing he'd ever seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go, that's much better,\" Tara said after having removed all the straw, and after giving Bryan ample time to feast his eyes on her curves, anxious now to see the look on his face and find out if what her sister had said was indeed true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt appeared it was, as looking at Charlie's now practically crimson face, as he desperately tried to look anywhere but at her boobs, appearing altogether mesmerized by Tara's new body. \"Thu-thu-thanks,\" he stuttered, managing to compose himself enough to squeeze that one word out, as he then went back to work dishing out the chicken feed, hoping that the activity would distract from his current embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTossing the bits of straw to the ground, and restraining herself from doing a happy little dance right there in front of him, Tara replied, \"Don't mention it,\" not quite believing how good this felt; to be an object of desire for a change, usually having to do a heck of a lot of work to get noticed by anyone, especially Charlie, who's attention, even when they were talking, was usually a great deal more focused on what he was doing rather than what she was telling him. Now though, even though he was doing his best to look away and appear unaffected by her presence, Tara could tell from both his body language and the fact that he was blushing that he was very much attracted to her mother (having had somewhat of a similar reaction herself towards him). \"<i>This is sooo cool!</i>\" Tara beamed inside her head, as she watched her handsome friend busy himself with the chickens, his bashfulness making him seem all the cuter, \"He must really like my mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering to herself what else she could say to him now, fighting the urge to just come right out and tell him about the body swap machine, and being not entirely sure what her mom would say to Charlie, she then recalled the various times her mom would feel sorry for him struggling in the heat and would take him out a drink, and decided to do that. \"Do you want a drink, Charlie?\" Tara asked him, \"There's lemonade in the house...\" adding quickly, remembering the rest of the beverages they had, \"Oh, and orange juice. And cola. And I uh...I think there's still some Dr. Pepper left if Daryl hasn't drunk it all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though he was rather embarrassed and more than a little intimidated by her presence, Charlie did feel a nice cold drink would be welcome right about now, having worked up a sweat carrying those logs. He also felt that it would provide and good excuse to be around Mrs. Parker a little longer and give him further opportunity to ogle her huge chest, and seeing as Tara didn't seem to be currently around, he wouldn't have to be worried about her noticing when he tried to sneak a peek. \"Yeah, sure. Some lemonade would be nice thanks, Mrs. Parker,\" he said, trying to avoid glancing at her cleavage as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping a bit into her own speech patterns, Tara replied with, \"Cool!\" and grabbed a handful of grain from his bucket without really thinking and helping scatter it across the ground (Tara not being as concerned with getting much and dirt under her fingernails as her mom was).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing up feeding the chickens, Charlie finding some of Mrs. Parker's behavior to be a bit odd, but not really thinking too much about it, the mere fact that she was talking to him at all being kind of thrilling, the two of them headed through the back door and into the kitchen of the house, where Charlie stood awkwardly for a bit as Tara fetched a couple of glasses (it taking far less effort to reach for the cupboard), before pulling out the bottle of lemonade from the fridge. Pouring them both a glass, Tara passed it to Charlie who smiled and thanked her, still getting a thrill out of hearing him refer to her as \"Mrs. Parker\" his cheeks flushing  slightly redder as he did. It really was rather fun this, she decided, masquerading as her mother in front of him, enjoying the way he looked at her now (or tried to avoid looking), having often fantasized about him looking at her own ten year old body that way, but Charlie seemingly having little interest. While having any sort of liking for boys was a relatively new thing for her (the way she felt about Charlie really being the first time and only time), that didn't make it any less magical; often imagining as she followed after Charlie around the farm, that the two of them were great explorers who had met and fallen madly in love with each other in the wild, unable to be separated as they engaged in all kinds of incredible adventures (it really being as innocent as that, Tara being too young to have any kind of sexual side). So having the boy she liked, looking at her in that sort of way, really did fulfill some of those fantasies she'd had and made her giddy with excitement all at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh, I haven't seen Tara today,\" Charlie said after a few minutes of awkward silence as the two of the sipped their drinks, Tara making sure to stand in a position that best showed off her curvy figure, \"Is she away somewhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Nope, she's right here!</i>\", Tara wanted desperately to answer, but realizing that would be breaking her promise, instead relied, \"Kind of. I think she went off exploring in the fields,\" recalling where her mother in her own body was headed the last time she'd seen her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Okay. It's just usually I bump into her when I'm doing my chores.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that this was the perfect opportunity to find out what Charlie really thought of her, Tara said, \"Yeah, she has told me that the two of you hang around together quite a bit,\" quickly following it up with the question, \"Do you like her?...Tara I mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Charlie nearly spit out his drink, not being quite prepared for this question. \"Uh, yeah. Yeah, she's nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good. Cause she likes you,\" Tara told him, letting some of her own personal feelings slip out, \"She thinks your really cool, and cute,\" blushing a little herself after revealing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, she does?\" Charlie asked, kind of having gotten that impression himself but not really having put 2 and 2 together, as well as finding the direction this conversation was taking rather odd, Mrs. Parker acting kind of funny all of a sudden, as if she were pretending to be a little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think she'd cute too?\" she then asked him, prodding him a little further, desperately wanting the answer to be \"yes\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh, I guess,\" Charlie replied, being put firmly on the spot (and not wanting to upset Tara's mother with his answer), \"Yeah, she's cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara's face instantly lit up as he said this, and wearing a delighted smirk, she quickly closed the distance between them, honing directly in on Charlie as she decided to see whether or not she could influence him a little further. \"Well...\" she began, her hands once again behind her back as she swayed from side to side, causing her large bosom to push out directly beneath Charlie's face, \"if <i>she</i> thinks your cute and <i>you</i> think she's cute, maybe you should ask her to be your girlfriend or something...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Watching Charlie squirm rather awkwardly after she'd suggested this, looking very embarrassed and uncomfortable and not knowing quite how to reply, Tara, although hoping that he might have agreed, was well aware she was putting him on the spot (especially asking while in the guise of her own mother), and instead of being upset or angry that he didn't immediately answer, she actually found the look on his face to be utterly hilarious and had to once again keep from bursting into laughter. Where as he had been red before, now he was almost crimson, his big blue eyes darting back and forth rather comically as if desperately looking an exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was exactly how Charlie felt, having little to no experience with girls, so suddenly having one as beautiful as Mrs. Parker standing there before him, with her body very much on display, giving him a tantalizing glimpse of the creamy, pale flesh nestled snugly within her dress, while basically telling him that he should ask out her daughter was a little overwhelming (especially for such a shy guy as he).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that she wasn't going to get anything out of him anytime soon, looking far too tongue tied to even speak, Tara was about to put him out of his misery and move on, before suddenly getting an even better, funnier idea. As he obviously thought that her mom's body was 'hot', as she'd overheard her big sister and big brother occasionally say, and as she was finding that she actually liked this weird sort of power she now had over him, enjoying watching him squirm, Tara then leaned closer towards Charlie's face and said, as more of a whisper, \"Unless you'd prefer to have <i>her mommy</i> as your girlfriend that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Charlie's jaw drop and do somewhat of a double take, thinking to himself that she had to be joking, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've seen you looking at me,\" Tara continued, running her hands up towards her mother's giant chest, really having some fun now, \"And I've seen you looking at my big boobies too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching Mrs. Parker then cup her hand beneath her mounds and give them a playful little jiggle right in front of his face, Charlie felt a really bizarre sensation start to take hold of his body; feeling embarrassed, intimidated, scared, excited and aroused all at the same time, the twitching that had occurred briefly within his pants earlier going into full effect now as he began to grow hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like my big boobies, don't you Charlie? You like that they're so big and soft and fun to play with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't know what to do or say, not quite believing that this was actually happening to him. Here was this incredibly beautiful woman, that was old enough to be his own mother (what had he heard some of the older boys call them again? Was it a 'MILF' maybe?), grabbing at her boobs and shaking and groping at them in front of him. Stuff like this just didn't happen in real life, did it? \"I....I....\" he began to stammer, having no words and not quite knowing what to say even if he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis didn't stop Mrs. Parker though, who looking him directly in the eye, ceased her groping for a moment and said, \"I bet you want to touch them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer to this was a definite \"<i>YES!</i>\", Charlie perhaps having only recently gotten into girls, as well as developed the means to appreciate them, but that didn't stop him from having the same unexplainable fascination with breasts that every other young boy eventually discovered, having long fantasized in his head as to what they might feel like. He didn't say this though, being far too shy and nervous for that, as well as having been brought up with a strong sense of what was right and what was wrong. Aware that touching his employer's wife's boobs would definitely be a step too far (not matter how much he wanted to). Instead he mumbled,\"Mm-mm-Mrs. Parker, I think I sh-should probably be getting back to work now...\" placing his glass down on the nearby work surface as he tried to sidestep his way past her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-uh-uhhh. Not so fast mister,\" Tara said, grabbing at Charlie's arm to stop him from leaving, having not yet had her fill (even if inside she was all but falling apart, not just from his reaction, but from her own performance as well), \"You haven't answered my question yet. Do you like my boobs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that he wasn't going to get out of this without answering her as she pulled him back to face her, those twin orbs of flesh once again being practically thrust against his face, it took all Charlie had to meekly reply, \"<i>Yes</i>...They're very pretty,\" blushing like he'd never done before, unable to look at her, his eyes now fixed firmly to the floor.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This was the final straw for Tara, hearing Charlie actually admitting this, having exercised her new boob power to such a degree that she really had made a boy do whatever she wanted, she just couldn't help herself now and suddenly burst out laughing, much to the shock of said boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie was extremely confused by this, not entirely sure what had happened. One minute he was telling Mrs. Parker that her boobs were pretty, the next she was suddenly squealing hysterically like a school girl an covering her mouth with her hands as if trying to force the laughter back. Was this all just some weird joke she was playing on him? Did Tara set this up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God...Oh God....Oh God...\" Tara giggled, struggling a little for breath as her laughter gradually began to die down, having pretty much released the entirety that had been building ever since she'd first approached Charlie outside, letting out one last final gasp, \"...that was <i>too funny!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking again at her friend, seeing how completely lost he looked, Tara realized that now that she'd done all that, she couldn't very well go back to pretending like she was just her mother again. She had to come clean and reveal the truth to him, even if it did mean breaking her mother's promise. He owed him it after all, especially after all the fun she'd just had with him at his own expense. So, deciding that as long as Charlie didn't tell anyone and kept the secret between just the two of them, then there was noway that her mother would be able to find out and everything would be fine, Tara wiped a small tear from the corner of her eye and said, \"Don't you get it, you big dope? I was just messing around with you! I'm not \"Mrs. Parker\" at all. I'm her daughter, <i>Tara</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis however, simply made Charlie even more confused, not quite being able to understand exactly what Mrs. Parker was now doing, or why she'd just said that she was her own daughter. The joke clearly being lost on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Tara! T...A...R...A...Tara!\" she repeated again, as Charlie continued staring blankly, \"Me and my mom swapped bodies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, okay, Mrs. Parker,\" Charlie eventually said, finding this very weird, being slightly creeped out now and thinking it was probably about time for him to leave. \"I'd uh, I'd better get back to work now. I've still got the pigs to feed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecoming frustrated that he wasn't actually listening to her, Tara stomped her foot down and said, \"Charlie, you're not listening! I'm not Mrs. Parker, I'm Tara!\" her voice becoming almost inaudible as she raced to get the words out, \"I found this secret room and it had a body swapping machine in it and me and my mom decided to test it. She's in my body and I'm in hers. Isn't it cool?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what she was saying, it sounded to Charlie that Mrs. Parker was going along with one of Tara's crazy, made up stories, and while they were usually kind of funny to hear coming from Tara, watching her mother do it made him more than a little uneasy, not knowing quite how to react (especially after the whole thing with her boobs). So, being as respectful as he could, he then replied, \"Yeah. It's really cool..uh, <i>Tara</i>,\" playing along for the moment while he grabbed for the handle on the door, \"I'll...I'll see you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still don't believe me do you?\" Tara said, stopping the door with her hand, deciding that there was only really one way to convince him, \"Alright then, I'll prove it. I'll prove that I'm really Tara.\" While Charlie didn't really see the point to this, there really wasn't anything he could do with her blocking the door. \"Hm, now let me think...\" she then said, pausing for a moment, before enthusiastically proclaiming, \"Oh-oh...Okay, I've got it! Last time I saw you was yesterday while me and Spike were playing by that old oak tree with the swing. You and your dad were carrying all that wire stuff for the new fence and when I asked you if you wanted to go throw stones in the river you said you couldn't because you had to head into town to buy new parts for dad's tractor....or something.\" Folding her arms under her bosom, looking rather satisfied with herself for this, certain that this would convince him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie was a little startled by this, Mrs. Parker having just described everything pretty much as it had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, I am Tara. I really <i>have</i> swapped bodies with my mom. Ask me anything you like that only you and I know and I'll tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Charlie said, finding it slightly strange that she would know that, realizing of course that Tara could have simply told her it as part of their game, but yet still having enough doubt to go along with her request, asking after a seconds thought, \"What...what was that thing I told you last week about the farm that I made you promise not to tell anyone else?\" figuring that Tara surely wouldn't have told her mom that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm. Hang on a second,\" Tara told him, trying to recall what it was (Charlie having told her quite a lot of things about the farm since they'd moved here). \"Oh, yeah, I know what it was,\" she grinned, clicking her fingers as it came back to her, \"You said that the old couple that used to own the farm before us supposedly had a secret treasure hidden somewhere that you'd overheard them talking abo...\" Interrupting herself mid flow, she suddenly exclaimed, \"Oh my God...<i>that's it!</i> That's what I found! The body swapping machine <i>is</i> the treasure! That's what you heard them talking about!\" It made sense of course, being 'buried' so to speak inside a hidden room, and a machine that transferred people's consciousness between bodies surely being what many would consider a 'treasure' of sorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough this could well be true, that wasn't what Charlie was focusing on from what 'Mrs. Parker' had just said, her reveal of his secret, added to the manner in which she'd said, added to the strange almost girlish way she'd been acting ever since she'd walked up to him outside, suddenly bringing him to the realization that what she'd said was true. Tara <i>was</i> Mrs. Parker! \"Whoa....no way!\" he gasped, as this realization sunk it's way in, asking, \"Are you...are you seriously telling me that you're...you're <i>Tara</i> and not Mrs....Not her mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Sleepyhead! Keep up!\" Tara told him in her now more than familiar tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God...that's....that's...that's <i>incredible!</i>\" came his reply as he stood there staring at her in wide eyed amazement, practically in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. Now c'mon, I'll show you where the machine is hidden. You've just got to promise not to tell anyone else. If my mom finds out she'll probably kill me!\" Grabbing Charlie's hand she then pulled him out the door, much like she'd previously done with her mother less than an hour ago, leading him into the machine shop and stopping at the secret door, pushing it open again with her fingers before heading inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ta da!\" she grinned, flicking on the light and illuminating the body swapping machine once more, looking around to see the expression of wonder on Bryan's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. That is neat,\" Charlie said, having never seen anything quite like it before (and that's saying a lot, having pretty much grown up around all kinds of weird and wonderful farming equipment), stepping forward to get a closer look at the pods and the console, before turning back round to look at Tara, still in disbelief that it was actually her standing there instead of her mom. He had about a million and one questions which Tara was happy to oblige answering (at least the ones that she could), talking him through everything that had happened, thrilled to see that Charlie was just as enthusiastic and excited about the whole thing as she was; having never before heard him speak so much before. Usually it was him who had all the answers and Tara asking all the questions, so once again it was another nice little reversal for her as she helped him to understand. In return, and when not being too gobsmacked to speak, Charlie recounted everything he could about the farm's previous owners, Mr. and Mrs. Davis; the two of them having been quite a nice old couple, but Mr. Davis being incredibly smart, like super, super smart, as well as rather secretive at times. It stood to reason then that Mr. Davis could have indeed built this device, but why he'd left it here was another story...well that and the manner in which they'd left, disappearing one night without so much as a word to anyone.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just as he was explaining this, a voice suddenly called from somewhere outside, \"CHARLIE?\" causing them to both spin round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my dad,\" Tara said, instantly recognizing her father's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's probably looking for me to see why I haven't fed the pigs yet,\" Charlie replied, realizing that in all the excitement of this he'd completely forgotten about his chores, suddenly feeling bad for not having finished them. \"I'd...I'd better go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, wait!\" Tara squeaked, stopping him as he made a move towards the door, telling him, \"What if he sees you come out? He'll find out about the machine!\" This being the last thing she wanted, not only because it would mean breaking her mom's promise again, it would also ruin her fun, very much liking the fact that nobody else apart from her and Charlie knew that she wasn't mom. Thinking for a brief moment, and hearing her dad call out Charlie's name again, this time sounding a heck of a lot closer, Tara turned to her friend and said, \"We've got to hide in here till he's gone\", as she ran quickly to the secret door and pushed it shut, shutting them both in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie didn't much like the idea of this, not really being much good at breaking the rules as well as worrying what would happen if he didn't show. \"But I'll get in trouble!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you won't,\" Tara scoffed, pressing her ear against the door to listen out for her father's footsteps, \"My dad's just a big softy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Tara he'll...\" Charlie began to protest, cutting himself off as he heard his name being called again, this time much closer, coming from just outside the machine shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this herself and flashing him a mischievous smile, having had an idea, Tara then stepped back and said to her slightly  flustered friend, \"Oh okay, then. You wait here then and I'll go talk to him. Put him off the trail and make sure he doesn't give you any trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis idea didn't really make a lick of sense to him, watching her open the door again as he asked, \"What?!\" before calling after her with a hushed whisper as she crept out, \"<i>Wait! Tara...</i>\" It was too late though, Tara having her heart set on going and talking to her father herself, wanting another chance to fool one of her family members, as well as keep Charlie from having to do anymore work, wanting the two of them to have fun together now that she'd told him about the machine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShutting the door on him then, leaving him alone now in the hidden room, Tara did up a few more buttons on her mother's dress and turned around just in time to see her dad approaching the entrance to the shop, looking around outside and mumbling to himself as he went, \"Where has that boy got to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Da...I mean Kyle,\" Tara said, slipping up before she'd even started, not being used to calling her father by his actual name as he walked in the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting a bit of a fright, clearly having not really expected anyone to actually be in here, especially not his wife, Kyle jumped a little as he looked over into the corner and saw Liz standing there. \"Liz...? Uh, what...what are you doing in here?\" was his first question, having not known his wife to have ever been all that interested in tools and bits of old machinery and very rarely seeing her out and about around the farm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing much,\" she replied, prodding at a rusty old engine with her finger, spinning a few of the cogs, \"Just looking around at all this old junk and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's not like you,\" Kyle replied, chuckling a little in disbelief, \"I thought you hated machinery. You told me yesterday that you'd rather be hit by a bus than come look at tractor parts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I did?</i>\" Tara questioned, not remembering having ever said that, before of course realizing that he was talking about her mother. \"Oh yeah. I mean I did! Yeah, I hate tractors,\" she told him, quickly covering herself by trying to mimic her mother's distaste, \"...and grease...and oil....and, and all the rest of these dirty, smelly things!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving never quite his wife talk quite like this before (going so far as to stick her tongue out in disgust at the end), almost feeling as if she was doing an impression of his youngest daughter when she didn't want to eat her peas, Kyle asked, \"Okay...Then why did you come in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis threw her a little. \"I uh, I came in here to...to, uh, look for Tara!\" she told him, figuring that might be a reason for her mom to venture out into the machine shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. I saw her about twenty minutes ago,\" he father said, pointing back over his shoulder, \"she was running around with the dog near the old river.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this made Tara instantly forget what it was she was currently doing, excited to hear how her mother was getting on in her own body. \"Wow, really? Did you speak to her? What did she say?\" she asked, anxious to hear his reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She didn't say anything. I was on the other side of the field, so I didn't talk to her. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting back to the reason he'd come in here in the first place, before his attention was diverted by his wife, Kyle then said, \"Anyway, speaking of missing children, you haven't seen Charlie around have you? Daryl went over to Zach's to play video games or something and me and George could use an extra pair of hands with this tractor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head, \"Nope,\" before realizing that this probably wasn't the best answer if she wanted to throw her dad off his scent, she quickly changed her mind and said, \"I uh, I mean <i>yes</i>. I have seen him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good, where is he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not here. He's gone. I mean I sent him somewhere,\" Tara told him, \"He's on a mission for me. That's why he's gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A mission?\" Kyle asked, this sounding almost exactly like something his daughter would say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" she replied, desperately trying to think up some story that would keep Charlie from having to help her dad. \"He's...He's gone to find Boots!\" she blurted, suddenly spotting said cat scampering it's way past the door, \"Boots has disappeared and I sent him off to find him and bring him back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis left her father slightly perturbed, none of it really making much sense to him. \"You sent him off to find Boots? But Liz, you don't even like that mangy old cat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I don't like Boots?!</i> she suddenly squeaked, shocked by this revelation about her mother. Receiving a surprised look from Kyle, realizing that she was once again verging out of character, she quickly scurried to cover her slip up, telling him instead, \"I mean...I know I don't. But Tara does. And I don't want her to be upset when she comes back and finds that she's missing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief discussion about this, with her father pointing out that Boots was a farm cat and often wandered about the place on her own (having been here long before they'd even bought the farm), and that she'd no doubt reappear when she was hungry anyway, he asked his wife if she was feeling alright, finding her behavior more than a little strange as well as what she was telling him extremely out of character. \"I'm fine. Better than fine in fact,\" Tara told him, flashing him a wide smile, \"I feel great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" he said, shaking his head and deciding to give up on this line of questioning. \"Well, if Charlie does return with Boots, or if you do see him before then, tell him I'm looking for him, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, will do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that he turned and left, Tara hoping as he went that he didn't actually spot Boots outside, realizing that would put a major spanner in the works seeing as she was technically supposed to be missing. He didn't however, Boots having crept off somewhere to no doubt chase after some mice, and letting out a relieved little sigh (feeling like that was a heck of a lot more work than it had been talking to Katy or even Charlie), Tara peered around the door of the machine shop and watched as her father headed back out into the fields.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew, that was close,\" she said, before smiling again to herself, glad that her deception had once again worked, really getting into the fun now of pretending to be her mother. \"It's all clear now, Charlie. You can come out now!\" she then said, calling back to her friend behind the hidden door, who appeared moments later. \"I totally fooled dad, he thinks you're off looking for Boots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Charlie could still think however, as he stared at Tara standing there grinning inside her mother's body, was, \"<i>I'm gonna get in so much trouble for this!</i>\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I know where we can hide!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hide?\" Charlie questioned as he was suddenly pulled out of the machine shop. \"Tara where are we going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somewhere nobody'll be able to find you,\" she told him as she began hurrying across the farm towards the fields with Charlie in tow, enjoying the fact that she could now lead this once bigger, heavier boy around so easily (having a lot more strength and weight as her mother than she'd ever had as herself), \"You don't wanna have to go help with the tractor do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I...I...\" he began to stutter, not really being given the proper time to answer before Tara jumped in again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Of course you don't!\" she said, interrupting him, \"You wanna have fun with me now that I'm a grown up,\" adding as somewhat of a tease, \"Besides I've got something to show you. Something I think you'll <i>really like</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see when we get there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding his all rather cryptic, as well as feeling a little like a rag doll being pulled around by now grown up Tara, Charlie asked again, \"Get where? Where are we going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To your den of course,\" came her reply, giggling enthusiastically as she did, as well as stopping momentarily to climb over a gate, letting go of her friend's hand in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this brief respite while Tara hopped over the gate (finding although her mother's skirt got in the way a little, it was now much easier to do than it had been with longer legs), Charlie looked a little confused, and said, \"My den? Wait? How do you know about that? I never told...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing cut off once again, Tara well aware of what he was going to say (as well as finding it funny that for once she knew something about him that he hadn't told her), she explained, \"I know. But your dad did. He said you had a small hut out in the woods that Mr. Davis built for you a few years ago and I found it. It's pretty cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it is,\" Charlie had to agree, thinking about the little wooden hut that he used to imagine, much like Tara did, that it was some sort of fortress or castle, but now more often than not using it as a place to sit in and read comics, when he wanted to get away from things. \"Mr. Davis was real good at building things,\" he continued, clambering over the gate now himself, \"He said it'd give me somewhere to play away from the barn and the machine shop. Guess it makes sense now why he didn't want me playing around there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee-hee. Yeah,\" Tara giggled, the old man obviously being worried that he would find his body swapping machine, just like she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow knowing exactly where they were heading, Charlie was no longer quite so reticent to follow Tara, as the two of them made their way across the fields and through the woods towards his den, chatting as they went about what they thought must have happened to Mr. and Mrs. Davis and why they left the machine behind, as well as Charlie building up the nerve to actually ask Tara what it felt like being another person (more specifically her mom).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's awesome!\" Tara told him as they finally reached the hut, that was nicely disguised between two trees and bush, making it difficult to spot unless you knew what you were looking for. \"You've really got to try it once we get back. Being a grown up feels way cooler than just being me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking that he might have to try it, seeing as it was clear she was enjoying it so much (though unsure who exactly would want to swap bodies with him), he then followed her into his den, closing the door behind them and sitting themselves down on the floor. Though it wasn't especially large or anything, being about the same size as a slightly bigger than average garden shed, there was more than enough room for the both of them in there, Charlie having placed a few sleeping bags and pillows and stuff on the floor to make it more comfortable when he was reading, which they were now sat on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what is this thing you wanted to show me?\" he asked, remembering what she'd said when she'd told him on the way here, curious to find out what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Tara giggle, her mother's face turning slightly bashful for a moment as a coy little smile made it's way across her face, recalling exactly what she'd had planned. \"Well...\" she said, drawing her reply out as she sat across from him, perched up on her knees, her hands reaching slowly up towards the buttons of her mother's flowery dress as she began to undo them, \"...I thought you might like to see <i>these</i>.\" And with that, she tugged the the top of the dress open in one quick motion, displaying her large creamy orbs as well as a good portion of the lacy white bra that housed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie's jaw just about dropped again as he saw this, having not quite gotten over Tara's teasing before using her mother's breasts. Now though, they were even more exposed; perched less than three feet from him, looking every bit as spectacular as the had done before, and more so. He didn't know what to do or say and instead just sat there marveling at the two huge mounds of lightly freckled flesh before him, the added sight of the bra giving him even more of a thrill, seeing something now that he certainly wasn't supposed to be seeing, while Tara proudly grinned, staring at them herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Well?</i>\" she asked, after a second or two, looking back up at her captivated friend's face, watching as it once again turned crimson, \"What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took him a moment or two to actually speak (as well as pull his eyes from her magnificent cleavage), but he eventually managed to stutter, \"Wuh...wuh...what...what about them?\" Looking up again at Mrs. Parker's grinning face and gulping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said back at the house that you liked my mom's boobs. You even called them pretty. So don't you wanna see what they look like naked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are...are you <i>serious?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure. Why not?\" Tara shrugged, not really seeing the big deal, telling him that, \"I've already seen them, and I know that boys like looking at boobs. And seeing as you're like my best friend around here, I thought you might want to see them too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...well I, uh, I...\" Charlie began to stutter again, rather taken aback by this offer (it being like something he could only imagine happening in his fantasies before), as his eyes drifted once again back down to those huge bra encased breasts. \"Buh-but it's your mom's body,\" he told her, wanting once again to simply say 'yes', but common sense overruling him again, \"It wouldn't be right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It may be hers, but I'm in control of it right now. Which means it's mine, at least till we swap back,\" she replied, having decided that this was how her and her mother's deal worked, her mom having failed to mention any rule about not showing off her chest, presumably not thinking that such a situation could occur (little realizing how proud Tara would be of it and how much she'd want to show it off), \"And if I say it's okay for you to see my boobs then it's okay for you to see my boobs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with her permission, Charlie was still unsure, especially seeing as Mrs. Parker was such a kind, friendly woman, and he knew it'd be wrong. Though more importantly than that, he was just too damn scared, aroused, intimidated and excited all at the same time, and trying to reconcile what his conscious was telling him with the feeling currently happening in his groin was basically turning his head to mush. \"I uh, I dunno, Tara. I mean what if...what if...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee-hee. You look so funny when you're embarrassed,\" Tara giggled, finding the expression on her friend's reddened face rather amusing as he struggled to even speak, the power of her boobs being very strong indeed. \"I tell you what,\" she then said, deciding to give him some help, it being obvious that he clearly needed it, \"seeing as you can't make up your mind, how about I just take off my dress and you won't have to worry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he even had time to answer this, Tara was already half way there, flashing him a big grin as she reached for the hem of her dress and once again pulled it over her head, displaying her mother's half naked, underwear clad body. Charlie's eyes went even wider of course as he sort of froze on the spot, taking in the incredible sight of this beautiful, mature woman in nothing but a lacy white bra and matching panties, her naked flesh, although pale, looking very tantalizing indeed. For a 12 year old boy, this was almost like he'd died and gone to heaven and he was powerless to stop the ascent of his penis within his own pants, feeling it rising as his arousal quickly began to grow. Looking at his face now was even more amusing for Tara, little believing her handsome friend could look anymore amazed or embarrassed, but seeing that he indeed could, enjoying it all the more because it was her (borrowed) body that was causing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bet you've never seen a woman in just her underwear like this before,\" Tara said, assuming that he probably hadn't as she reached round behind her back to find her bra clasp, \"My mom's really pretty, and her boobs are <i>huge!</i> Just wait until you see them...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>And with that she unclasped the bra and slid the straps off her shoulders, allowing those two huge masses of quivering pink flesh to jut out proudly from her chest, causing the very reaction in Charlie that Tara had hoped to cause as he sat there - almost in shock - with his mouth hanging open and his eyes pinned to the first real life pair of breasts he'd ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TA DA!\" Tara grinned as she tossed her mom's bra to the floor, holding her hands out wide like some sort of magician who's just performed a grand illusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie meanwhile was completely awestruck, having never felt quite so turned on as he did right now, his penis standing directly upright and pushing it's way out of his pants, creating a very apparent tent. Mrs. Parker's breasts were absolutely incredible, putting even the busty models in his big cousin Mikey's porno mag (that he'd once gotten a brief glance at) to shame; being so much bigger, rounder, and just all over more amazing to actually see live and in the flesh, hovering right there in front of him, less than three feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh my God...</i>\" he silently gulped, feeling his mouth turn incredibly dry as he scanned every inch of those pale, creamy mountains dangling from Tara's chest; each one looking to be almost as big as his own head. As for her nipples, they were long and dark, and appeared to be growing slightly in the cool air, pointing out towards him like two little antennas reaching out towards the sky. He wasn't sure why, but for some reason he desperately wanted to put his mouth around them and suck, wanting to experience the taste and texture of those beautiful thick nubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching her friend's awe struck face try to come to terms with what it was he was seeing, Tara felt another rush of pride for her newly borrowed body, grabbing at both of her heavy mounds and cupping her hands beneath them, exclaiming enthusiastically as she did, \"I know, they're<i> awesome</i>, right? I totally want boobs as big as these when I'm older!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie however, still couldn't quite speak, being positively overcome with arousal and practically jizzing right there in his pants. He couldn't believe this was actually happening; that there was a topless woman with huge boobs kneeling directly in front of him, jiggling each one in her hands. It was as if one of his long held fantasies had suddenly come true. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting for a reply and getting none, expecting him to at least appearing as enthusiastic as she was, Tara then waved a hand in front of Charlie's face, trying to break him out of his trance, giggling as she did and saying, \"Earth to Charlie! Come in Charlie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm uh...I'm so-sorry...\" Charlie finally managed to stutter, unable to take his eyes from Tara's chest though for less than a second as his eyes darted back and forth, \"Wuh...wuh-what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Katy was right! Guys <i>really do</i> get hypnotized by boobs!\" she laughed, finding Charlie's reaction to be unlike anything she'd ever seen before, as if he really was now under some sort of spell. Trying to respond to this, though really having nothing at all to say, Charlie once again began mumbling nonsensically, before being cut off by a now even more enthusiastic Tara, as she suddenly spotted the obvious tent in between his legs. \"Uhm, Charlie...\" she said, stifling a giggle as she pointed to the offending item, \"your 'thingy' is sticking out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing he was on display, Charlie's face turned even redder (if that was at all possible) and his hands quickly moved down towards his pants in a desperate bid to hide his erection from view. Tara didn't seem to care however, being much too naive about such things and simply laughed it off, telling him that, \"It's okay. I heard some of the older girls talking about that once. It happens when boys really really like something, that's what Katy told me,\"  a large grin making it's way across her face as she then said, rather proudly, \"So I guess that means you must really like my mom's big boobs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, yeah. They're nice...really nice,\" Charlie replied, managing to get a complete sentence out this time, Tara's relaxed and somewhat carefree response to his having a hard on (as well as the fact that she was currently topless) making it a little easier for him to deal with, seeing as she wasn't quite at the age yet to be offended by such things. Had it actually been the real Mrs. Parker however, then things would have been a different story altogether, and Charlie dreaded what might have happened if this were the case. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he really had time to think properly about any of this though, Tara suddenly thrust out her naked chest, presenting it to him and said, \"You can touch them if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I can?\" Charlie responded, not exactly sure he'd heard her right, his mind being in a sort of dreamlike fog now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure,\" Tara grinned, bringing her hands again to her chest, cupping and squeezing at the flesh as she told him, \"They feel all nice and soft and squishy,\" moving her fingers onto her large brown nipples, \"and these things are like big, stretchy gummy bears.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Look!\" Tara grinned, excited to show him something he'd never seen before (something that she'd only discovered less than an hour ago herself) as she gripped her nipples between her fingers and began to pull, \"Look how far they stretch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie was of course once again amazed, as he watched the big, fat rubbery protuberances stretch like taffy, causing the rest of Tara's breasts to morph into a conical dome like shape as she pulled them out towards him. \"<i>Wow...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReleasing them again, causing them to snap back and the large lumps of flesh to slump back into their natural, rounded teardrop shape, she then reached out with her hand towards Charlie's (which was currently still pressed against his crotch) and said, \"Here, give me your hand!\" Doing as he was told, Tara took it in hers and led it towards her naked chest, with Charlie watching in amazement as she gently placed it down onto the huge expanse of flesh that was Mrs. Parker's boob, this quite possibly being the greatest moment in his short life as he felt his palm sink into the spongy softness of her warm, smooth skin. \"See, they feel nice, don't they?\" she giggled, experiencing the thrill of having someone else's hand on her new boobies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they do...\" Charlie squeaked, amazed by the sensation of Tara's breast, as well as just how tiny his hand looked in comparison to the mass of flesh it was now resting on, \"It's really, really soft.\" Certainly none of the other guys in his year would ever believe this; believe that he had actually gotten his first even handful of boob off of such a busty, mature woman (even if it was really her own daughter inside her body).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlad that he liked the feel of them too, as well as very much enjoying the sensation of this cute boy's hand on her boob, Tara then reached over and grabbed his other hand and placed it onto her other breast, this time positioning it directly on top of one of her nipples (that she could feel stiffing again) so that he could feel that too. \"You can play with my big nipples too if you like,\" she said, encouraging him as he very tentatively moved his hands around her chest, gently squeezing and prodding as if he was afraid they might burst, but enjoying ever single minute of it as he did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing just that, turning his attention to the thickest, brownest nipples he had ever seen, Charlie reached out with his fingers, caressing first the bumpy, wrinkled circles around each nub, before taking each one between his thumb and forefinger and giving them a light little pinch. This action caused a noticeable reaction within Tara's body, one that she recognized from her own exploration earlier in the house, except this time it was much stronger, as if a little electric bolt had suddenly shot from her nipples straight down towards her crotch.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Give the go ahead, Charlie's eyes widened at the sight before him. The shy young farm boy was still combating the early stages of puberty. Women were starting to be noticed by his young eyes. Only a few weeks prior had he seen his first naked woman, when he had stolen a glance from Mikey's porno mag. That night had been restless for the twelve year old. He could not get that busty model's immense boobs out of his mind and this deeply confused him. Imaging them had made his penis hard. Sure, he had an erection before, but this was different. This had been spurred on by a thought. To top it all off, the feeling felt good, almost right. Then a few weeks later, Tara and the rest of her family showed up. Charlie had developed his first boyhood crush on Liz the moment he had laid eyes on her. Since then, his attention moved away from that busty model to Liz. Charlie could recall even one dream that involved Liz coming into his bedroom one night. She was wearing a bathrobe, but that fell to the floor with a deafening plop. However dream Liz was an amalgamation of the real thing and that porno mag girl, she had the busty model's boobs, but everything else was Liz. Now he was seeing the real thing in the flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, Charlie made a circle around each nipple. Liz's body seemed to tremble in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does that feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara bit her lower lip. A wave of colors filled her vision. How could she describe these emotions? She had never experienced anything like this before. Part of her mind was telling that it was weakness. Tara could not let Charlie get the best of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" Tara pretended that Charlie's probing was nothing, but her voice deceived her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sense of thrill, Charlie moved a little forward, now these lovely breasts were at eye level. He put a hand under each breast, feeling the full weight of them. Suddenly he tossed them upwards, but the breasts only seemed to undulate. Simply amazing to the mind of a twelve year. His eyes concentrated on the thick, brown nipples. He thought for a moment, had they gotten bigger? Returning to their previous position, Charlie gave them another tug. The tent in his pants was struggling against the fabric of his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn explosion of electricity ran through Tara's new body. She had to do everything to stop a moan from escaping. Fear ran through her body. The electricity seemed to have originated from down below. As Charlie continued to tug at the large nipples, the electricity began in the red forest patch down below. Tara looked down to see that Charlie was lost in his own world of sexual exploration. The young girl thought back to her own back at the house. While her own vagina had been smooth, her mother's had a small red forest growing. Much like Charlie, Tara's curiosity got the better of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one of Liz's hand slowly traveled down, quivering with a bit of fear. Grabbing at the hem, the blue flowery dress was lifted upwards, enough to gain access her mother's crotch. Nervously, her eyes darted down at Charlie. The young boy was engaged with a battle with the hardened nipples, still sending sexual urges up and down Liz's body. Tara gulped and ventured forth, lowered the white panties to gain access to the treasure below. Resting on the reddish patch of hair, there was something different now. Her hand felt wetness. What was this? Had she inadvertently peed herself? However the young girl's mind was not hampered by that. Parting her mother's pubes, Tara felt the heat emanating from her vagina. Her old one had never felt like this. Almost by instinctively or better yet what this body was use to doing, Tara took two fingers and brushed against the swollen clit. The feeling was too much. Tara's body arched back and a long moan filled Charlie's secret hideout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the sound, Charlie jumped back in surprise. The sound was primal, almost verging on animalistic. Never child had heard a sound like that before. The rush of emotions had felt good Tara. Now with more confidence, she continued to rub her mother's vagina. Flabbergasted, Charlie looked on with amazement. His view was hindered by Tara's legs, but he could see that her hand was moving back and forth, over her...her. Lost to her emotions, Tara inserted the two fingers, completing her mother's routine of masturbation. Tara was no longer in control, at least completely. Instead her new body had taken over, guiding her on this task of exploration. Finally, Tara orgasm with a defiant scream and collapsed onto the floor of scattered sleeping bags. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie looked around in both directions, hoping no one heard. He felt as though his heart was going to burst from his chest. Sweat ran down from his forehead. What had he just witnessed? Likewise, Tara had no idea what she had just experienced. But it felt <i>good</i>. Silently, she closed her eyes and let the emotions rush through her body. As her breaths became steadier and less labored, Charlie crept forward. His eyes were transfixed as the giant breasts motioned up and down. A musky, unfamiliar smell filled his nose. The smell was a mixture of sex and sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Charlie asked with some concern. \"Looked like you were having a heart attack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No idea. But you helped.\" Tara asked, still laying on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whadda you mean?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you touched my nipples, there was a feeling down below. I got curious and when I touched <i>it</i>, the feeling increased. So I kept on touching it until the feeling became a tidal wave.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie's eyes went down below. He saw a tuft of red hair, before Tara met his gaze and quickly closed her legs. Sitting up, Tara had an embarrassed look on her face. Had she gone too far with Charlie? These emotions were too much for her to handle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can...Can I see?\" Charlie asked, voice trembling.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tara contemplated whether or not this was right, as she sat up, making sure to keep the red patch hidden from the preying eyes of the teenage boy. Her mother had entrusted her body to her. What would she do in this situation?  Of course, the young girl's mind glazed over the fact that Liz would never be in this situation to begin with. Imagine if Liz had been caught. Her name would be synonymous with pedophile. Unfortunately, Tara had been shielded from such troubles. Instead, she used the same thinking as before, her mother had not made any rule about showing off what lay below. Tara was in charge now. If she wanted to show it off, then she should be able to, after all she was the grown up now.  This was her choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile, Tara decided on a course of action, Charlie stared on disbelief. Not only had he felt up the woman of his dreams, now there was a chance he would see her vagina. Now, he had never seen one. He had heard older boys talk about them, but it was a strange mystery to him. Naturally he knew that boys and girls were different down below from his limited sex education knowledge. Charlie remembered being shown a crude caricature of a naked man and woman. For the man there was a tube like shape between his legs, clearly a penis. On the other hand, the woman just a small dash. This line was in the same place as the man, but completely foreign, almost alien like. Later on, Charlie learned that it was called a vagina. Where babies come from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a laser, Charlie's eyes were transfixed on that hidden line. Tara felt somewhat embarrassed by his constant staring. Liz's cheeks had been a flush red. A moistening feeling was beginning to grow down below again. This young girl loved Charlie in a childhood sort of a way. Charlie was too obviously to have seen that since their initial meeting. Tara now had his undivided attention. Maybe if she did show more to Charlie, he would finally realize her crush on him. She was going to bear it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" Tara finally broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this magically words, Charlie felt his erection straining against the fabric. Right now he did not care if the tent in his pants was being shown to the world. His mind only wanted one thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First turn around.\" Tara commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike an obedient dog, Charlie turned around, fidgeting at what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly Tara threw off to the side her mother's lacy white panties that had been caught around her legs while exploring. Unbeknownst to this young girl, a wet spot had developed at the front, betraying her exploration into the feminine mystique. With this last piece of clothing gone, Liz Parker's body was completely naked. Tara opened up her legs, but quickly closed them again. This was not a good position. Repositioning herself quickly, Tara propped herself up with a few pillows behind her back. Opening her legs again, she could see the tuff of red hair again. She hoped that it would be a good view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Mrs. Parker's beckoning him forward, Charlie turned around, almost shaking. His eyes widened at the sight. Unlike that crude caricature, down below, Mrs. Parker had a mess of red hair. Pubes. Charlie, himself, was starting to develop the fledgling growth of pubic hair. Unavailable to believe what was in front him, the young boy rubbed his eyes. No, this was real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie crawled forward to the siren's song. Tara had a smile of delight on her face. Forget breasts, the slit down below had more power than her breasts. This seemed to make Charlie completely brain dead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think, Charlie?\" She called out to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh....I don't know....it's....I-I...\" Charlie was lost for words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara giggled at the sight of her friend. He had been turned into a brain dead zombie. Charlie finally got close enough and that musky, unfamiliar smell filled his nose. Even in his sex-induced daze, he could see small droplets of water had formed on the top of the red patch. Had Tara accidentally peed herself?  More questions were being raised than answered. Finally closing the distance, he could see a faint line being obscured by the red pubes. Was that it? Without even asking, Charlie's hand ventured forth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA reaction was happening to the person inside of Liz's body. The familiar electric was flowing once again from the pussy up to her nipples. Basking in this feeling, Tara closed her eyes. Her hands, as though they had a mind of their own, cupped the hefty breasts. Soon enough they were drawing to the hardening nipples. Taking each nipple, Tara gently pressed down on them between her thumb and index finger. Like before, her vagina began to tingle in reaction. Silently, she bit her lower lip, not wanting to scare off Charlie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that exact time, while Tara was pleasuring her mature and sensitive body, Charlie anxiously grabbed toward what laid beneath the red jungle. Time seemed to have frozen in place. All sound had been deafened. At first he felt his hand being tickled by red pubic hair, along with a slight wetness. Nervously, his eyes darted upward. Tara seemed to have not noticed. Was he going too far? He had only asked to see. No, he could not turn back now. With his other hand, he parted the jungle. Liz's pussy glistened in the dim lighting of Charlie's hideout. He had never seen anything like this before. Testing his luck further, one hand started to probe this alien being. A finger briefly brushed Mrs. Parker's clit. A wave of color filled Tara's vision, even though her eyes were closed. This feeling was fantastic. Charlie recoiled slightly back as Tara moaned and back slightly arched. Was Tara in pain? His fears were alleviated as Tara silently went back to work massaging the bare breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp close and personal, Charlie continued his exploration. Like a brave explorer, he folded the lips and saw a small hole. Suddenly an idea flashed through his brain. Without even questioning the idea, Charlie jabbed a finger inside. Electric rushed through Mrs. Parker's body, making the jab be completely muted. The inhabitant of it, felt wave after wave of ecstasy. Like a few minutes previously, Mrs. Parkers let out a long, sexy yelp, followed by her legs buckling and back arching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie scurried away, frightened of what just happened. Tara collapsed back onto the floor of the den with labored breaths. Whatever that feeling was, Tara had enjoyed it. As the young girl recovered, Charlie noticed a wetness in his pains. A small dark spot had grown, while his penis had become flaccid. What the hell had just happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshamed he quickly hid his crime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do, Charlie?\" asked Tara in between a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I just touched it.\" Charlie replied, feeling he did something wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...there was something else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cheeks burned. \"I-I...there was a hole down there...so I put a finger in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara thought for a moment. Was that the cause of all of these feelings? Not asking any further questions, she sat there silently, recovering from the exploration. Soon enough Tara had redressed herself, though that took some time, especially with the bra. She had wanted to ask for Charlie's help, but he was lurking in the corner, obviously hiding something. However Tara had the good sense not to pry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna head back home?\" Tara asked innocently, feeling like she had enough of teasing Charlie for now<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Charlie dashed out of the door, not even waiting for his now mature companion. </span></div></div>",

Her dad could switch with Charlie, so that he could be little like her mom, and Charlie could be big like him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't k-know Tara\" Charlie said, suspicious \"What if he doesn't want to use the machine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can trick him somehow!\" Tara said, excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them begun to plan out a fairly simple plan of getting Kyle into one of the pods, but it wasn't easy. Kyle would likely be unwilling to do such a thing, and would probably freak out if it occurred. They settled on Tara just calling hm over to the pod to investigate it, and having Charlie slip in while Kyle looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter, about 10 minutes of waiting, they executed their plan. Charlie hid behind the furthest pod, and Tara yelled out for her dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DA-, uh i mean, KYLE!, COME LOOK\" Tara called out, almost blowing her cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle came into the barn, in a slow jog, and out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, what it is love?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at this thing i found back here!\" Tara said, trying to sound curious, pointing the closest pod. \"It's some weird machine\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, what the hell is that\" Kyle said to himself, walking next to Tara with his hands on his hips, staring inquisitively at the pod. \"Hey, did you call me Daddy earlier? i thought we agreed to keep bedroom names in the bedroom\" Kyle said, winking and grabbing his wife's ass as he begun to move toward the pod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBedroom names didn't make any sense to Tara, but it felt really good when he touched her butt. \"Maybe you should look inside!\" Tara urged her dad to do, trying to not seem too excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle stepped inside, and the door closed behind him, without his knowledge. Charlie then slipped into his pod, and gave Tara a thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Charlie shut his door, there was a huge white flash that encompassed the entire room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds later, the two left the pods, with their hands on their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle, who was now Charlie, was in complete shock. \"WHAT THE HELL?, WHY AM I SO SMALL?, LIZ WHATS HAPPENED?, WHO IS THAT GUY\" he said, pointing at Charlie, who was now in Kyle's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, i can explain\" Tara said, nervously. She hadn't really thought of how her dad would react after the swap, so now she had to improvise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Charlie was amazed by how his new body felt, and how much more he could see now that he was taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This has to be a dream, it has to!\" Kyle said, repeatedly, with his hands on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the hint, Tara agreed with him. \"Yeah, this is a dream Kyle! You're a little boy again!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle looked at her, with a half crazy, half fearful look in his eye, and chuckled to himself. \"Of course! this is an impossible situation! I must've fallen asleep out in the barn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie edged into the conversation, \"Yeah!, now go out and play in your dream!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do!\" Kyle said happily, skipping out of the barn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew!\" Tara said, in disbelief. she couldn't believe that worked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do her and Charlie do now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He looked over at Tara as she was motioning for him to follow her, and observed her body for a second. Her luscious curves made him feel new feelings that he hadn't ever felt before in his old body, and he wasn't too sure what to think of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-coming!\" Charlie muttered, shocked that he now had a deep and rugged voice.

I'm sure  Tara will love them.\"<br>\r\n\"bring them here mom and lets see.\" Liz said as she tried to move around in her large wedding dress. \"they look perfect, I love them... and more importantly Charlie will love them too.\" Liz giggled as she took the undergarments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey girls, could you give me a few minutes alone with  my daughter, maybe check that everything is proper in the sanctuary.\" Tara said, shooing the bridesmaids out so she could be alone with Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"you look beautiful mom.\" Tara said as a small tear trickled down her mature face.<br>\r\n\"No Tara, you look beautiful. We will find Mr. Davis eventually, now that we know he is out there we will find him.\" Liz said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been ten years since they had swapped bodies. Somehow they had managed to not only keep their lives intact and productive but also keep the switch a secret from everyone, although Kathy and Daryl suspect something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n At first 10 year old Tara thought it was all fun and games, and she had learned to play many games with Charlie who was suck as her father Kyle. Unfortunately those games had consequences and Tara found herself pregnant in her mothers body. Tara grew up really quick once she had to deal with a child. Charlie had an easier time with his swap. He had lost some years, but growing up around the farm, he could use his knowledge to continue the farm and with Kyle, who was stuck in Charlies body, still around they were able to productively run the farm.  <br>\r\n Charlie and Tara quickly learned how to be adults and parents and Tara gave birth to a healthy baby girl who she named Abigail, or Abby for short. Liz and Kyle had to start over as children. they had a much easier time of things than Tara had. While Liz and Kyle would occasionally help Tara and Charlie make proper decisions, they were needed less and less as time went on. Liz and Kyle breezed through school and after a few years began officially dating each other as Tara and Charlie. Each of them went through puberty again and Kyle became quite muscular and became the high school football star. something he never could have done or been interested in doing in his original body. Liz  grew into a beautiful woman just as she expected she would.  After puberty  Tara's original body began to fill out and she became every bit as a knock-out as her sister and mother had before her. the only difference was she kept her strawberry-blonde hair differentiating her from her sister. Liz was very pleased when she started to fill out, although she didn't make the same mistakes she had in her original years, and kept studying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 5 years after their switch the Parker's received a letter from Mr. Davis who nobody had heard from in years. All the letter said was \"I know about the swap, I know you are stuck, Be patient I am working on a fix. ~Davis<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Tara and Charlie felt a little hope that maybe they wouldn't be stuck in the form of two adults rapidly entering middle-agedom.  Liz and Kyle made it their job to trying to find Mr. Davis but nothing had happened yet.  Eventually Kyle proposed to Liz again with the permission of Tara and Charlie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks mom, but you don't have to say i'm beautiful. I'm old, wrinkly and beginning to sag in certain areas\" Tara said with a grin as she began to heave her impressive bust up and down.<br>\r\nLiz scowled. \"you know what I meant. you know I meant that I don't consider this my body, and we will get you back in this body eventually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yeah, Yeah, I know. Take a joke. And put on those Undergarments, you know your bridesmaids wont begone long.\"<br>\r\n\"alright moooom\" Liz said in an exaggerated tone. <br>\r\nThere was knock on the door startling both women and Kathy's voice said \"they are all ready, and waiting on you.\"<br>\r\nLiz called out \"alright be there in a minute just finishing now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 years to they day and Tara was going to watch her body walk down the Isle to marry the body of her best friend. a surreal experience considering it was her mother and her father she would be watching actually get married.  Now that she was her mother she had been married to her best friend for 10 years.</span></div></div>",

She began inspecting around the bra for a clip of some sort to unhook it, as she seen her sister do before, and eventually found  it in the front of  her bra, in between her big boobs. She unhooked it and they plopped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara had never seen or felt anything like it before, so heavy, yet soft and so nice to set free.

'Come on girl you think to yourself.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you get to the park, you start whining and pulling on the leash.  You can't believe how excited you are.  Every fiber of you wants to run and play with the other dogs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No girl, we have to find Jeff.\"  Rebecca says pulling you along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can take her,\" Misty says as she starts walking toward the opposite end of the park with King<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly you snap to and behave. <br>\r\n\"I think we will be OK, Thanks Misty.  I will call you if I have trouble.\"  Rebecca says as she looks at the benches for Jeff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There he is girl, come...\" She says as she excitedly pulls you along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sits down next to this man and his dog, you like this dog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca and the man start talking.  It is so hard to understand them.  You try and follow the conversation, but for some reason you can't understand what they are saying any more.  Your mind is racing in to many directions.

It look like who ever is in Spikes body is trying to read the labels on the switches to turn in back, but evidently all that information needed to read didn't tranfer with the mind swap or just isn't wired into their new doggy brain.  <br>\r\nSpike begins making the whimper-crying noise as she walks out of the shed.<br>\r\nYou in your new human body seal off the door so nobody can find it.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Your family just moved to a large farm site on the edge of town.  The place is fantastic it has a large house, a barn for animals and a machine shop.  Unbeknownst to you and your family the machine shop has a hidden room in the back. That room contains a lab with a machine with two pods. It is a mind transfer device. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBios: <br>\r\nKyle (Dad): 34 years old, he's well built rugged, outdoorsy, strong, 6'2\" blond. He always wanted to farm. He thinks it will bring the family together. He went to school to be a teacher, but took a job on the railroad to pay bills, so he's gone too much. He's hoping that soon he will have enough cash saved up that he can leave the railroad, try for a teaching job and farm on the side.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz (Mom): 32 years old, she has fair skin, red hair, 5'6\", very beautiful; she doesn't like the move to the country even though town is very close. She is going along with the move but wants to change Kyle's mind. She wants to understand her children, but doesn't think Kyle buying this farm is the right solution. She thinks this move will trap her out in the country where she doesn't want to be. She loves her family, but wants more and doesn't know what it is. She wanted to go to college, she wants to travel, but life happened and was married right out of high school to her childhood sweetheart Kyle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaryl (Son): 14, blond like his dad, almost 6' and growing fast, well built, smart and athletic. He loves being out on the farm. He is very shy.  He and his twin sister Katy are very close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty (oldest Daughter): 14 very pretty, she has long red hair like her mom, smart, but acts like a ditz in school, her mom wants her to live up to her potential. She wants to be popular. She hates living in the country and thinks its hurting her popularity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara (Younger Daughter): 10 years old, strawberry blond, she is the baby of the family, very mischievous, loves animals, and idealizes her older sister. She likes the farm because she wants to get horses and other animals<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca Johnson (neighbor): She's 24 very beautiful, she's Tara's teacher. She has a nice house across the road. She is very wealthy and has a trust fund. She travels with her college friends during the summer. Rebecca and Liz are jealous of each others lives. She would love to be married and have a family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack (Daryl's best friend): He's 14 a little on the heavier side has a crush on Katy, but she would never have anything to do with him since she doesn't consider him popular. Some of his relatives had owned the farm where the story takes place before they left town mysteriously<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie (Katy's friend): very popular, but comes from a horrible home life, so she stays over when ever she can. She has a crush on Daryl. She would love to have a normal life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary (Daryl's girlfriend): she is athletic, very beautiful, but very bitchy and full of herself. Her father wanted a boy and pushed her into athletics. Daryl's family hates her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike (family dog) she is part husky and part German Shepard looks more like a husky with blue eyes. Very protective of the family<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoots (farm cat): This cat was here when the family moved in.  She acts very weird for a cat<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeel free to add more characters.<br>\r\n</td>",
