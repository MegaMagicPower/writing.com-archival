Don't even think about looking through my Dust!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the heiress went to the bathroom while Ruby just pouted from her spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she smirked, \"Well... it's not like she would notice anything strange if I move fast enough~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Ruby puts her Comic down and briefly used her Semblance before she carefully opened the briefcase and began inspecting each vial of powdered Dust, \"Let's see what we have here... some Ice Dust, not surprising... Fire Dust... Lightning Dust...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Ruby decided that she had seen enough was about to close the case when she noticed another vial of powdered Dust that she had somehow missed, \"Hmm? What's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking the vial up Ruby saw that it was filled with Dust... only of a type that she does not recognize and was a rather odd color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of Dust is this? Gravity? No, it would've been purple...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby was so focused on this unknown Dust that she didn't notice the bathroom door had opened and that Weiss was not pleased seeing her partner rummaging through her briefcase, \"RUBY! What are you doing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Weiss! I was just-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in her panic, Ruby accidentally dropped the vial she was holding causing it to shatter on the floor, releasing the Dust and cover Ruby completely while Weiss stood in disbelief and shock at what her partner just did. But at the same time, she was also confused at what kind of Dust she was looking at as the color of the Dust alone was something that she had never seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of the two girls said anything as the cloud of Dust slowly dissipated as Ruby coughed and closed her eyes when...</span></div></div>",

What's wrong? Is there something-\" Ruby stopped when she noticed that the room seemed to gradually shrink before her eyes before she felt her clothes feeling tighter than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Ruby check herself and her eyes widen in shock when she noticed that her sleeves were slowly slipping up her arms! Then both girls heard ripping sounds and looked at Ruby's feet and saw that her stockings were ripped open in several places!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Ruby... You're growing!\" Weiss blurted out, still in shock at what seemed impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby stared at her partner in disbelief, \"What?! But, I can't possibly be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't get to finish her sentence when her the red lacings started to creak and soon Ruby found it a little hard to breathe as she reaches 6 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicking, Ruby quickly removed her black belt as well as her precious red hooded cloak onto the floor. But as she was about to try to remove her boots, several of the lacings snapped off and then her blouse ripped open at where her chest is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weiss... help...\" Ruby pleaded as more of her clothes started to rip in several areas and her boots now feel really tight as she closes in at 6'4\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-what can I do?! I don't even know what that Dust you inhaled is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't help to make things get any better as Ruby's clothes soon start getting torn apart as first the lacings holding her skirt snapped causing the skirt to fall onto the floor passing 6'6\" exposing her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby's stockings had since been ripped up leaving her almost bare in the lower half of her body. Next, her blouse continued to get ripped up as the hole where her chest is expanded before her shoulders tear at the bouse's seams as she passes 6'7\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, Ruby tried to cover her self as her painfully tight boots bulged as a result of her expanding feet. Ruby couldn't say anything before she passes 6'8\" and her bouse finally splits up halfway into two pieces, while at the same time her toes finally made progress emerging out of her boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is now half-naked in only her smaller, tightening underwear and what remained of her boots!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss stammered, \"Ruby... s-stop growing! You're g-getting too big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I don't know how!\" Ruby exclaimed as she passes 7 feet and to her embarrassment, her bra snapped and fell off her exposing her breasts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing bright red, Ruby covered her breasts as her panties stretched and dug into her thighs before they too snapped off as she passes 7'2\", forcing her to try and completely cover herself! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby then looked down and saw that her feet had finally broken out of what remained of her boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss continued to stare as Ruby kicked off her destroyed boots but continued to grow as they looked at each other in shock.</span></div></div>",

You have to get out here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now 10 feet Ruby looked down at Weiss in confusion, \"Huh? What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough a little intimidated by Ruby looking down at her, Weiss explained, \"What do you think would happen if you keep growing and stay in our dorm?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment confusion was all Ruby could feel until her eyes widened at the implication, \"Oh no! If I stay I could get trapped in here! I have to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at that moment, she suddenly winced and without warning, Ruby's growth suddenly sped up as she quickly passes 12 feet and slammed her head into the ceiling!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" Dazed, Ruby tumbled forward and managed to stop herself from slamming into the floor. After shaking her head, she now finds herself on all fours hovering over her partner who fell on her back and slightly raised her arms. \"Weiss! Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss didn't reply as she looks up at the 14 foot (and still growing) Ruby and her mind raced, <i>\"How much bigger is she going to get?!\"</i></span></div></div>",

Aaa-CHOO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nothing Weiss could do but watch as her partner rose up with each sneeze before Ruby hits her head on the ceiling after sneezing over 9 feet causing her to fall on her butt.

She then noticed that the bathroom wall where the cabinets are had cracked in multiple areas and immediately, Weiss realized Ruby's other foot was likely on the other side. And if she were to make an educated guess when compared to how big Ruby was at around 18 feet tall... then that must mean she may be over 24 feet now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStunned, Weiss stood back up as the reality of the current situation dawned on her, \"Oh my... I-I'm trapped!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Back in the Dorm</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ruby finally sneezed, her eyes were shut closed when she rapidly grew much more than usual due to the added effects of her partner's remaining Dust. All she heard was a deafening explosion quickly followed by the sound of glass shattering and suddenly feeling very squeezed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe groaned as she sniffed in annoyance as the itch disappeared before she shook her head and slowly opened her eyes... she soon wished she had kept her eyes closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby was stunned when she saw how <i>tiny</i> and cramped her Team's Dorm was now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe winced when she realized she was in a bent forward position with most of her back and shoulders pressing against the ceiling, her breasts were pressed against her lower thighs, her butt pushing against their closet, and her left hip and legs had pushed her Team's bunk beds. This resulted in her sister's bunk crashing onto Blake's bed due to the books holding it up scattering due to either the explosion or Ruby's hip and leg slamming into the lower bed when she grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Ruby's own top (hanging) bed... two of the ropes had broken from the ceiling while the other two were somewhat holding it up. Her partner's bed was pushed by her hip and was slightly damaged from the hanging bed's two legs crashing into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby then noticed that her right foot was also through the bathroom door while her left was pressed against the adjacent wall cracking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped when she remembered that Weiss was still inside and soon heard Weiss' muffled cry that she was trapped!

While still asleep the tightening of her underwear caused Ruby face to flush and unwillingly moan as she grew past 7 feet resulting in her bra snapping and falling off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound was loud enough to stir Yang and Weiss but Blake's cat traits caused her to wake up with a startle, \"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>*groan*</b> Blake... it's too early...\" Blake heard her partner above her moaning. She was about to respond when her cat ears picked up more sounds coming from... Ruby's bunk?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough a little cranky at being woken up so late at night Blake rubbed her eyes and thanks to her Faunus trait she was able to see the dark dorm. And what Blake saw when she turned to the source of the sounds shocked her, \"What... the...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't find her words as she stared at a 7 foot Ruby Rose! And she can clearly see that Ruby is growing even bigger! Then she heard a very audible creaking sound making Blake lean out to see where on Ruby's bed is making those sounds only to freeze when she saw the ceiling holding the ropes cracking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" Blake scrambled off her bed rushed to Weiss' bed and frantically shook the heiress, \"Weiss! Wake up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha- Blake? What are you doing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time! Just get off before you get hurt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused Weiss was about to retort when she noticed a rather large leg, as well as an arm, dangling from... Ruby's bunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What-?\" That was all she had to say before Blake literally dragged her off the bed. The noise also woke Yang up as she rubbed her now red eyes in irritation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss stammered as she stared wide-eyed at her growing partner, \"Y-Yang? Take a look at your sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang looked and suddenly she was no longer sleepy, \"What the-?! Ruby?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes widen at the site of her \"little sister\" now over 7 and a half feet tall and completely naked as her tank top had been ripped open exposing her bare chest while her trousers have since broken apart exposing her now exposed lower area after her panties finally snapped off. Her arms and legs are now dangling off to the sides of her bed as her crotch slid closer to the footboard while her head and shoulders pressed against the adjacent wall propping her up. And her growing body's weight causes the ropes holding her bed to groan and creak causing the ceiling to crack!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang scrambled off her bunk bed and ran up to Ruby and shook her larger arm, \"Ruby wake up!

She then reshifted in her bed in a somewhat more comfortable position and continued to sleep unaware of what she and her Team were about to see when they all wake up in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Morning</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n6:00 am(ish)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*beep* *beep* *beep* *beep*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of the Teams clock alarm caused all the girls to groan before Blake shuts it off. Ruby yawned and groaned as she knew that Monday had arrived<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to go to class today!\", Ruby muttered as she pulls on her covers to cover herself up more... only to notice that something felt... off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroggily opening her eyes Ruby sat up and stretched-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*rip*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby blinked in confusion as she heard a ripping sound and then glanced down only to suddenly feel wide awake when she saw her cleavage and the ripped tank top!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh- what the?!\" She stammered before she threw her bedsheet away and gasped when she saw her pajama is now ripped and torn in several areas. That was when she finally noticed that her bed and the Dorm seemed... smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Ruby hopped off her bed. But when she looked down, she suddenly felt dizzy when her perspective looked much higher than usual. This caused her to stumble and fall on her butt causing her to yelp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer yelp stirred her Team a bit as Weiss muttered, \"Ruby... what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously sis, just a few more minutes okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Ruby, now wide awake, slowly stood up and looked around her Dorm in confusion, \"Um... did everything shrink or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit irritated, Yang sat up, \"What on Remnant are you talking about sis? The room is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat every Yang was about to say disappeared when her eyes widened at the sight of her now really tall \"little sister\", \"What, R-RUBY?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby turned to her sister, and that was when she noticed that Yang also looked smaller as well. In fact, everything and everyone looked smaller to her! \"What... what's going on? Why is everything smaller? Why are my pajamas like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, Weiss and Blake had also woken up. At first, they were annoyed and grumpy at the noise the halfsisters were causing, only to freeze up in shock when they saw their now much taller leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruby... it's not us that became small; you're bigger!\" Blake exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! But, how?! How am I so big now?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss said nothing as her mind raced in confusion until she recalled yesterday's incident, \"... there's no way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caught the other three's attention, \"Weiss, do you know why my sister is suddenly this tall?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss shifted uncomfortably, \"I think... it may be because of what happened yesterday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yesterday?\" Ruby parrotted in confusion before her eyes slowly widened. \"You mean, the vial I accidentally dropped? The one that had that strange Dust?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving been told of what happened with the \"Dust incident\", Blake and Yang glanced at each other before Blake asked, \"Weiss, are you sure you don't know what that Dust even is? Or what it was supposed to be used for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Schnee Heiress shook her head, \"I asked my father if he knew what it was, but all he said that it was a prototype that I was to test it to see what it could do. However, he explained that there was supposed to be some information as well as instructions that came with the briefcase, but I told him that I did not see any.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang raised an eyebrow, \"So your dad just forgot it or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss shrugged, \"Apparently <i>someone</i> was supposed to supply me the info and have it in the briefcase, but had been misplaced somehow. So he had to... \"discipline\" the person before they had to either try to find it or just resend another copy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby, having calmed down somewhat, tilted her head, \"Did they find it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Weiss' sigh, the other girls knew the answer was a 'no'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a result, they had to make another copy and it is supposed to arrive sometime today. Where I will likely would've retrieved it after School.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one said anything for a while before Yang of all people voiced her concerns, \"Well, what do we do? I mean, breakfast is about... <i>*glances at their clock*\"</i> an hour away. And we, of course, have to go to class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby went pale at that, \"What?! I can't go to class like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang shook her head, \"Ruby, we probably have no choice right now. But maybe we could ask Pyrrah if we could borrow her clothes for you to wear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Weiss suddenly yelled before she grabs a measuring tape to check how tall Ruby actually is. Only to blink when she read the result, \"...I don't think Pyrrah's clothes can fit on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Weiss? How tall am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are 6 feet 10 inches tall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That's nearly 7 feet!\"</i> Ruby mentally screamed as her situation became more problematic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... she could stay here until we get back. Maybe say that she got sick or something along those lines?\" Blake suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Weiss shook her head, \"I don't know... the whole school is bound to find out about her new height eventually. So, I hate to say this, Ruby may just attend class anyway just to get this over with now rather than later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang glanced up at Ruby, \"Your call sis. It's your decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby looked down and shifted with uncertainty for a few minutes before she decided to...</span></div></div>",

What else am I supposed to do now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ruby pondered on what to do next, her stomach suddenly growled!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess that answers my question.\u201d Ruby said with a blush as she got off the bed and headed out to mess hall and see if there is something to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ruby finally arrived and entered the mess hall she wasn\u2019t surprised that no one was inside at the moment, meaning the few weekend faculty kitchen staff were likely out in the City of Vale for whatever their own reasons were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, Ruby smiled as she skipped to the kitchen and before long she was in front of the refrigerator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see what\u2019s inside.\u201d She said as she opened the refrigerator door and took a look.<br>\r\nInside there were a few different kinds of food neatly arranged but her eyes lit up as she quickly locked onto a plastic container filled with cookies topped with chocolate ships and *gasp* strawberries!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby licked her lips, \"Ooo, those cookies look so good! And they\u2019re topped with strawberries, my favorite!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just as she was about to grab the container, she noticed that there is also a small milk carton with an unlabeled symbol that she has never seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, must be a new brand. And I am kind of thirsty.\" Ruby muttered as she inquisitively analyzed the milk then looked back at the Cookies, and then back at the milk before she shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, why not just have both?\u201d she said before she grabbed both the cookie-filled container and the small milk carton before closing the refrigerator door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExiting the kitchen, Ruby quickly sat down at one of the tables and quickly opened the container and milk carton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby paused, \u201cShould I have gotten a glass for the milk?\u201d she pondered before shaking her head, \u201cNah~, I\u2019ll dip cookies in milk some another time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Ruby set upon the cookies first and instantly loved them the moment the first one was devoured. Then she tried the milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cHmm, there\u2019s a slight taste that I can\u2019t put my finger on it. But all in all, it's not bad!\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take a minute for Ruby to finish eating the cookies before downing the entire milk carton with a satisfied sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPah~! Like I told Yang back on initiation, <u>I don\u2019t need help growing up, I drink MILK!</u>\u201d Ruby declared while raising the empty milk carton in victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter gathering everything, Ruby went back to the kitchen and threw the carton in the trash while placing the empty container on the kitchen counter and leaving a note thanking and apologizing for having the cookies for herself but enjoyed very much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell!\u201d Ruby started as she walked out of the kitchen before stopping before the first row of tables with her hands on her hips, \u201cI\u2019ve had my fill and I suppose I could go into Vale and see if there is anything else to do!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Ruby took a few steps forward toward the main doors, her stomach suddenly growled and bubbled loudly causing her to bend over and clutch her stomach in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby groaned before she thought back to the milk, <i>\u201cI forgot to check if that milk had already past the expiration date-!\u201c</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cGroooooowl!\u201d</b> Her stomached now suddenly <i>roared</i> causing Ruby to fall on her knees as the pain intensified and now spread throughout her body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTearfully, Ruby feebly pleaded for help, \u201cOoh... it hurts!

Confused, Ruby examined her clothes and gasped when she saw her sleeves were slipping up her arms and then she heard something ripping. Looking behind her to find the source, her eyes widened when she saw her stockings stretch and rip in several areas! But she also saw that her feet and knees were sliding across the floor while her boots bulged out as her feet grew.

No sooner had she managed to do that, she winced in pain as her feet continued to be trapped in her now tight boots. She also felt that her bra was now too small as it tightened around her chest. Soon she heard more ripping and saw her clothes being ripped apart as she grew past 6'5\" before the lacings began to snap and her blouse ripped opened exposing a bit of her bra and cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed and instinctively covered it but soon felt her toes finally break free out of her boots and her skirt fell off exposing her now small and stretched panties.

It's not the world that had shrunk... it's me... I'm... so much bigger somehow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby took a few steps backward while letting the note fall out of her hand as she looks around her in disbelief.

Something in it caused me to grow this big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, Ruby walked to the trash bin and rummaged through it before finding the empty carton and examined it to try to figure out where it was from and who made it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to Ruby's dismay, other than the symbol there was no information whatsoever anywhere on the carton. Defeated, Ruby dropped the carton back into the trash and after looking down at herself again, sighed, \"When I said I drink milk to grow up, I didn't mean like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding back up Ruby compares herself to the kitchen and had to make a guess that she is probably over 8 feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I as tall- or rather taller than... what was his name again?

If you were feeling sick, then why didn't you say anything?\" Weiss asked, annoyed that her partner may have been sick the whole day but never said a peep that she was \"feeling odd\" and could've jeopardized the team if she \"felt\" worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby pouted as she slapped her knees in response, \"I did not feel sick! It's just something I can't explain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I'm guessing...\" Yang started and (much to the team's dismay) smirked, \"You're probably having some growing pains. Which means dad's Xiao Long trait must be... <i><b>\"Kicking\"</b></i> in!\" She joked while using one of her legs in a kicking motion to put a little more emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the Team groaned and could've sworn they heard an audible \"Boo!\" from team JNPR's dorm as Ruby threw one of her pillows squarely into Yang's face before removing her sleep mask and hopped off her (hanging) top bunk bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be using the bathroom for a bit.\" Ruby said and walked off to the bathroom while her sister bemoaned why she got hit in the face for her \"masterpiece\", resulting in Weiss and Blake to collectively facepalm and sigh at the blonde before going back to their own devices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter closing the bathroom behind her, Ruby sighed before walking toward the sinks and looked into the mirror. All the while Yang's \"joke\" earlier was still echoing in her head as she examined herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of having a quote on quote \"growing pains\" was something Ruby has some mixed feelings. While becoming a bit taller or maybe as tall as her sister is one thing, she would rather not want to stick out so much if she grew so tall. After all, Ruby would rather be a normal (even if a taller) girl than be the center of attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was soon cut from her own thoughts when her body suddenly started to heat up quickly, causing Ruby to gasp in shock and grasp the sink counter as she started to feel dizzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening t-to me?\" Ruby stuttered as the heat built up more causing her to buckle on her knees while still holding onto the counter and close her eyes tightly, praying that this would all end quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to her relief, it did end and Ruby opened her eyes and raised herself up on the sink counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she tried to regain her bearings, she noticed something felt... off about her clothes. Confused, Ruby looked down at herself and blinked as she noticed that her stomach and legs are showing more skin than usual. She also felt her tank tops straps are somewhat digging into her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Did my pajama's just got smaller all of a sudden...\" Ruby trailed off as she looked back at the mirror and stepped back in shock to see that her clothes did indeed look smaller on her but also that the sinks seemed lower from her perspective!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"D-did I just grew?!\"</i> Ruby mentally screamed as she doubled and tripled checked herself in disbelief going as far as to pinch herself thinking this is all just a dream only to feel pain and see that her new perspective had not changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oww~. Okay, so it wasn't a dream. I actually did grew taller! ...somehow.\" Ruby trailed off as she checked herself out in the mirror in wonder and tried to estimate how tall she is now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I almost as tall as... Yang?\" Ruby guessed as she recalls that her sister is about 5'8\" if she remembers correctly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she couldn't help but be worried as she looked at her hands, \"But there's no way anyone could grow this quickly right? Maybe... there's something wrong with me-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't get to finish her sentence as the heat from before suddenly returned and that was when she noticed that her pajama's started to feel even tighter as the straps dig into her shoulders and her stomach and legs showing even more skin! Moreover, she noticed that the floor seemed to be moving away from her point of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... I'm getting bigger?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was soon snapped out of her shock when the straps snapped and the top half of her shirt fell, exposing her now tighter bra trying to contain her (not) expanding breasts from bursting out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, Ruby tried to raise her shirt back up but soon heard the sound of fabric ripping and saw that her trousers are being ripped apart as her ankles are now exposed.

Understandable considering now that Ruby was the biggest she was now the smallest. That didn't sit right with her, but she elected to keep her thoughts to herself. This was neither the time or place to get upset. Especially since all Ruby had to defeat her now was sit on her. The thought made her shudder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did this happen?\" Blake finally asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" Ruby answered. She then went on to explain her day and what went on in the bathroom. Needless to say the rest of her team was stumped. From Ruby's explanation it was just another typical day at Beacon Academy. So then what could have caused their team leader's growth spurt?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you've told us everything Ruby?\" Weiss inquired. Ruby might have described an average day, but the situation right now said anything but. What was she missing? People just didn't have random growth spurts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear that's it!\" Ruby sighed. If there was something that happened out of the ordinary then she didn't know. A strange day at Beacon Academy was just another day at the office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright sis. Just try to stay positive and... enjoy your new stature. We'll try to figure something out.\" Yang started. \"In the meantime you might want to... uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Ruby asked as she noticed Yang's growing blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What Yang is try to say is, uh...\" Blake paused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiess simply facepalmed. \"They mean you're indecent and in need of clothing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby's eyes bulged as she forgot she was totally naked. She yelped before grabbing Yang's bedsheet and wrapping herself in it. It didn't cover much, but it was just enough to cover her private parts. Even if she had to show a little cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what now?\" Blake asked the mini giantess. \"You're still the leader here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby's team looked her expectantly. \"Right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was the tallest person in Beacon as far as they could tell. Just the mere sight of her would raise questions. Then there was the fear of if she'd grow again. What if she became so big her enormous tushy crushed the whole school? Now that would be a real disaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good plan Rubes. So, any body have any ideas on where we should start?\" Yang asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeis was the first to speak. \"The school's curfew is in full affect so the CCT is locked down.

Weiss, however, looked skeptical at the plan as she voices her skepticism, \"No offense Ruby but, are you sure that is a wise decision? Given that you are over eight feet tall, it's going quite difficult to not be seen. Not to mention, we do not know WHEN you are going to start growing again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... I'll be fine!

Really!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss still looked skeptical but begrudgingly nodded and prayed that her partner/leader will not be discovered. And hopefully not grow bigger anytime soon. The thought of Ruby towering over the whole Academy made her shudder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Ruby did not show it, she is very nervous, <i>\"At least I hope I'll be fine! I don't want to be seen like this!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether it was because of being so tall or the fact that she is naked and only has her sister's bedsheets wrapped around her body for cover. Or likely both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the whole Team got ready to head out. With no way of knowing when Ruby would grow again Weiss, Yang, and Blake remained in their pajamas. The Team also only got their Scrolls to message/call each other if they found anything or wanted to check up on each other on their progress.

Ruby yelped in pain and fell onto her knees as she rubbed her head only to be forced to bend her neck as she reaches the ceiling again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicking, she placed her hands onto the ceiling as she pleaded, \"No. no, no! Why am I growing again so soon?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer Team could do nothing as Ruby passes 13'6\" and inadvertency pushed the bottom bunks with her feet and legs as she continued to grow. Weiss and Blake slowly backed out of the Dorm as Ruby grew past 14 feet and is then forced to get on hands onto the floor with her back pressing into the ceiling. Yang, on the other hand, was frozen on the spot as she stared wide-eyed at her growing big \"little sister\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as Ruby grew, her butt touched the Top Bunks and while her bed creaked as the ropes holding it up started to strain, the same could not be said for her sister's bunk as the books holding it up collapsed, causing it to come crashing down onto Blake's bed. Said Cat Faunus was mortified at the loss of those books (and the prospect of losing the rest if her leader grew too big) but winced when Weiss shrieked, \"Yang! Get out of there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang snapped out of her daze and then looked to her teammates already in the hallway before glancing back at the now 15'6\" foot Ruby. \"Yang get out of here! I don't know how much bigger I'm going to get!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, Yang turned and rushed out to rejoin Blake and Weiss and they all could only watch as Ruby continued to grow bigger and bigger with the sound of their Dorm being turned to ruin as she grew to 16 feet. Though the only things they could see of her through the door right now are her large hands, thighs, and hanging breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Ruby frantically looked at her shrinking surroundings the Dorm got smaller and smaller to her growing frame. She felt her back pressing into the ceiling while the bunk beds still being pushed by her legs and she soon felt her feet touch the bookshelf. There was nothing she could do but lower herself onto her stomach in order to give herself some more room. She stared at her Team still in the hallway and occasionally backing up toward Team JNPR's Dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced at their sister team's closed-door, <i>\"They must have heard the noise right? Oh... I don't want them, or anyone to see me like this!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, like it suddenly reappeared, the heat she felt began to die down!<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"G-guys! I think it's finally stopping!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, even from the hallway _WBY could see that her growth had slowed considerably. But they could not help but worry about a new problem; if Ruby stops growing... how is she supposed to get out? And more importantly, <b>when</b> would her next growth spurt happen? The fact that it happened so soon after her last growth had rung warning bells in their minds. Especially Weiss as her mind raced at the thought of Ruby growing even bigger and whether it would be soon after this growth or happens later. She gulped at the thought that her partner could grow as big as the Beacon Tower or perhaps... even bigger than that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, as Ruby felt the heat almost fade away she...</span></div></div>",

It was an almost Crimson red dust that seemed to resemble muscle fibers. \"What you got there, Weiss?\" Ruby asked curiously as she snatched the dust away from her and moved it away from her. \"Don't touch that, you dolt!\" Weiss protested trying to get it back, but failing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby was able to run away from Weiss, but tripped as she looked at Weiss and not where she was going. The dust got all over Ruby and no where else. Weiss helped Ruby up and looked incredibly angry. \"How dare you! That's a new experimental dust you just destroyed!\" The angry heiress yelled as Ruby started to feel hot. \"Why is it so hot all of a sudden?\" Ruby asked ignoring Weiss. \"I don't know!\" Weiss answered angrily as Ruby looked around. There was nobody nearby. \"We will catch up later. Alright? I'm going to go run and try and cool down.\" Ruby said thinking of washing her face in a nearby bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ruby got to the bathroom, she felt much more colder and bigger than earlier. She looked in the mirror and noticed something odd. Ruby's sleeves had a bump. When she poked the bump, it was rock hard. \"What the?\" Ruby asked herself making sure no one was present and then locking the door. She took her other arm and ripped off the sleeve to reveal a muscle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When did I get that?!\" Ruby asked in shock and in awe as she began to heat up again. This time she saw it. Her bicep expanded and she could hear her clothes ripping. She took off her shirt momentarily to reveal her smoking hot abs. \"I don't even think Yang has a body like this!\" Ruby exclaimed admiring the view as she flexed her biceps. Her arm used to be a measly 3 inches thick, but this new dust caused her bicep to bring that to 8 inches. Her breasts seemed to have increased by an entire cup size and she took off her leggings to check her legs as well. Her legs were longer and 3 to 4 inches thicker than they were earlier. Ruby loved this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby cooled down now and felt as if she was done growing. She put back all her clothes and heard a couple tears. She wore the torn sleeve as a badge of honor to show her newfound strength. On the way out she broke a sink fossit to see how strong she was. It didn't snap off, but she was able to crush it completely. \"I'm going to love this.\" Ruby said to herself with a grin as she broke the door handle off the door and opened it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at her dorm room, she couldn't find anyone. Which, to her, was good so she could push her limits of growth and strength. She saw Weiss's briefcase on her bed and broke it open. There was tons of the experimental dust. But she thought about whether or not she should take it.</span></div></div>",

She injected the dust into her bloodstream this time and felt it a rush go through her entire body. Her body heated up as she began to grow. Her legs were much more toned now. Her arms growing another 4 inches, making them her biceps one foot long. She was now 6'2\" with breasts growing a cup and a half and a butt much more round and firm. Her clothes ripped off mostly, but she didn't mind. Ruby went into the bathroom to check out her new body. \"I'm loving this!\" Ruby exclaimed with excitement as she flexed her biceps and moved her pectorals and breasts up and down. Veins were starting to show on her bicep and she loved it. Just then she heard the door open and chatter. \"That was a good shopping trip. I wonder where Ruby is.\" Yang said as the three stood still in their tracks as Ruby walked outside the bathroom almost crushing the door frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weiss had a new experimental dust and it kind of did this.\" Ruby explained showing off her muscles. \"That dust was just meant to amplify attacks!\" Weiss exclaimed in shock. \"Well, it did amplify my attacks. I'm MUCH stronger.\" Ruby explained with a grin as she lifted the book shelf with ease just to show off. \"Well, can I have some of this stuff?!\" Yang asked excited. \"No. This wasn't meant to happen. We don't know how this affects humans or faunus yet! She could be a completely different person!\" Weiss exclaimed angrily. \"Oh alright.\" Yang said disappointed. \"I feel great, Weiss. I don't think I'm any different. Just stronger... more... powerful.\" Ruby explained as she towered over Weiss. Weiss stepped back in fear and said, \"o-of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what did everyone buy?\" Ruby asked. Blake showed some books. Weiss showed a couple dresses and dust vials. And Yang showed some different looking clothes, but still fitting her usual show off style. \"Can I see those, Yang?\" Ruby asked. \"I just bought these!\" Yang protested. \"Good.\" Ruby said as she grabbed one. \"Sis, let go.\" Yang said. \"A growing girl needs clothes!\" Ruby exclaimed as she let go of the shirt and grabbed Yang by her stomach. The team watched in fear. \"What I say goes. Understand? I'm stronger than you. There is no saying no to me!\" Ruby asserted as she squeezed lightly, which still caused an immense pain for Yang. \"S-sorry sis. Take it!\" Yang cried as Ruby put her down. Ruby patted Yang on the head, \"good girl.\" She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang's clothes fit Ruby alright. They were kind of tight and would most likely rip if she took another vial. When team RWBY quickly left in the morning with Ruby, she thought about taking another vial before class. </span></div></div>",

Ruby flexed her newfound power for a moment as she felt somewhat stimulated. She wondered if she should take more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore acting upon this thought, Ruby went to the beds and crushed them with ease. \"Why do I pretend to be under people? I should take over beacon. No, the world! With the power of this dust, I can become the strongest person... no goddess of all time!\" Ruby plotted. Ruby grabbed five dust vials and took them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby grew to 7'9\" and was about half the size of the room in muscle. \"Yes! This is power!\" Ruby shouted as she punched down the door and walked into the hallway. People ran away in fear as the hulking Ruby destroyed room by room until she got outside. Ruby used her strength to jump 30 feet into the air and then punched the ground as hard as she could. The dormitory building crumbled. Ruby stood above it showing the world her new body. </span></div></div>",

This is her secret she shares with her dad and sister, so everyone else thinks she doesn't have a semblance like Jaune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, she was walking through Vale and a group of three men twice her size walked up to her. \"Hey, look, it's the girl with no semblance!\" One man yelled. The other two men laughed at her. \"It hasn't come in yet,\" Ruby defended. \"Well, you're too weak to even have a semblance, girl. I mean, look at you! You're paper thin,\" the man taunted. \"No I'm not!\" Ruby argued getting a bit angry. \"You can't even be a good leader for your team! How cold you be strong enough for a semblance!\" The man taunted. Ruby started to feel bad. Ever since going to beacon, people have been bullying her and she was beginning to feel depressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night Ruby was alone in her dorm room as the others trained. She then thought of the conversation from earlier and wept. After she cried, she decided she would make herself strong enough. She activated her semblance for the first time since she discovered it and made her the size of the men. Then she made herself a bit bigger. \"Man, people are going to be weirded out by this, so...\" Ruby said as she changed everyone's memories of her to her always having this body. Then she began to look over her new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was huge, over twice her original size!

In her mind's eye she saw herself as a towering behemoth lording over everything she surveyed and making everyone worship every inch of her perfectly sculpted body. She could already feel the changes starting to take affect as a pleasant warmth spread throughout her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she last altered her size she had grown from a petite five feet and three inches to a little over a whopping ten feet tall. Now though? She wasn't satisfied with that. Driven by a new found hunger for power she made herself grow even  bigger until she  doubled ,no, TRIPLED in height  becoming over an incredible thirty feet in Height!<br>\r\nNext she made her already huge muscles Breathtakingly  massive.<br>\r\nHer arms became thicker than a full grown man's entire body and then some. Her legs were like massive shapely  tree trunks that looked as though they could  crush a small group of Beowolfs between with a single twitch. Her back muscles were like a tapestry of impenetrable stone carvings that contained untold strength.  Her abs grew into an impressive cobblestone like  eight pack framed by equally impressive obliques. Her wingspan stretched wider than most people were tall, ending at boulder esque shoulders that looked (and probably could) like they can truly carry the world upon them. <br>\r\nFinally she enhanced her curves to ridiculous levels <br>\r\nBallooned to the size of bean bag chairs made firm and prevented from sagging by the twin stone slabs of muscle that were her pectorals.<br>\r\nHer hips widened to the point that they stretched out further then her shoulders by a good three feet eventually becoming what could only be described as \u201cbrood bearing\u201d hips.<br>\r\nLast but not least, her buttocks inflated to a size and with that complemented her hips , sticking out a good four feet behind her whilst being both soft  and firm from the thick layers of fat and muscle underneath.<br>\r\nDuring the entire process Ruby's entire body coursed with unbelievable pleasure, causing  her explosive orgasms the entire time! When her growth finally finished Ruby couldn't help but smirk. She was quite pleased with herself and especially her body. She likened her new form to some hybrid between depictions of a god of strength and a fertility goddess. She laughed a booming laugh, her voice carrying a rich and deep timbre  while still sounding feminine. This was amazing! Why she ever shied away from using her power was beyond her. <br>\r\nNow that she has embraced her full potential nothing will stop her from  reaching her goals!<br>\r\nIt was at this moment Ruby felt a draft. Turns out her clothes all but disintegrated into scrapes during her growth and now  she is completely in the nude(oops)<br>\r\nRuby  briefly considered just carrying on like this, after all who was going to stop her?  In the end however  she decided against it , there would be plenty of time for that later. Using her semblance she conjured up  a perfectly fitting tank top  and a pair of booty shorts, though given her sheer size they left little to the imagination. <br>\r\nRuby decided to  see what her teammates were up to, It would be fun to play with them for awhile.<br>\r\nWith a spring in her step she stomped her way back to the campus, causing small earthquakes along the way <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ruby thundered onto the campus  grounds, her foot falls leaving visible cracks in the ground. <br>\r\nShe noticed that even though there were many people who were staring at her most still went about their business as though a thirty foot tall  hulked out teen with hyper curves walking around was an everyday occurrence. She was almost insulted until she remembered she made it so that everyone's memories would be changed to her having always been this big. She considered rescinding that change  but decided not to, it might be fun to see how differently people interact with her this way , especially when you factor in how some people treated her before. <br>\r\nRuby scanned  the area looking for any sign of her teammates but could not find them. Using her semblance she was able to pinpoint her teammates exact location. It looks like they were getting some training done in the emerald forest. With almost childish glee  she took off in the direction of the forest , her curves jiggling and swaying dramatically with each step. <br>\r\nMeanwhile  the rest of team RWBY were finishing up with their training exercises. They were testing out some new moves they were experimenting with  on some of the local grimm population and were very satisfied with the results. Yang was especially proud of herself for she had acquired a new level of control over her semblance that allowed her to hit harder and faster for  longer.  Weiss was cleaning off her rapier of any leftover viscera when she addressed her teammates. \u201c shouldn't we have brought Ruby along for this?\u201d Weiss asked as she wiped off an especially stubborn piece of dirt. What  was the point of having team exercises if their leader wasn't present?<br>\r\nThe blond brawler was working out a knot in her shoulders. \u201c She said she had something to do in her room for a while\u201d said Yang. Her  shoulders gave off a satisfying crack as she rolled them. <br>\r\nBlake was  pulling out any stray twigs and leaves out of her hair when she spoke up. \u201c when I last saw her she seemed kinda down in the dumps.\u201d Blake regarded the normally peppy girl. Ruby appeared to have a miasma of melancholy around her when she saw her earlier.<br>\r\nYang had transitioned to doing leg stretches when she answered the cat faunus. \u201c Relax. We know she'd come to us if she had any problems.\u201d The blonde brawler started to do some squats. \u201c Ruby's a big girl. She can take care of herself.\u201d  Yang finished as she got a good rhythm going.<br>\r\n\u201c In more ways than one.\u201d Weiss muttered under her breath. When the Heiress first met their hyper active  team leader  she, like everyone else that day, was completely shocked to see her. The crimson haired teen towered over everyone, even the very trees themselves! She was huge in every sense of the word. Her Titanic muscles and monstrous curves demanded attention. It was almost impossible for her not to be a spectacle. She was so big that the school had to make an entire new building just her!<br>\r\nKnowing that she would be spending her entire school career with such a colossus gave her many weird and confusing feelings. <br>\r\nSuddenly, loud rumbling sound akin to a landslide could heard from a distance , going off at regular intervals and growing louder as time went on.  <br>\r\n\u201cSpeak of the devil.\u201d Weiss thought to herself. She'd  recognize that sound  anywhere. <br>\r\nThe rumbling grew louder  as the giant got closer, they could see the trees rustling and birds flying off in a panic. Eventually  the form of a truly massive girl came into view. She seemed to scan the area for a bit before spotting the group of huntresses and rushing towards them.  Small tremors  could be felt in the ground as minor earthquakes were generated from each step the giant girl took. Weiss and co almost lost their footing, cursing the girl for not measuring her steps more carefully. Eventually the giantess came to a stop in front of the  group. They really had to crane their necks up to see her and even then their sight was obstructed by the immense shelf of her breasts. The mighty teen bent downwards  into her to see her teammates past ginormous bosom , creating another small earthquake as she did.  <br>\r\nRuby had a truly large smile on her face, clearly happy to see her friends, perhaps even a little to happy Weiss thought suspiciously. <br>\r\n\u201c Hey guys! Whatcha been up to?\u201d Ruby boomed her greeting.  She was so excited to see them, especially with what she had in mind.<br>\r\n Yang beamed up her \u201c little  sister\u201c. \u201c We were just getting finished with our training and were getting ready to head back.\u201d  Yang readjusted her gauntlets.\u201d What about you? You seem to be in a better mood than you were in earlier.\u201d Yang said working with the harnesses of her beloved  ember Cecilia.<br>\r\nRuby gave her a knowing smile.  \u201c lets just say I've gained a new\u2026.. perspective.\u201d Ruby  straightened herself up slightly as enthesis.<br>\r\nYang just shrugged. \u201c Hey so long as okay I don't care.  Yang finished putting all of her equipment away  before looking up at her sister.  \u201cSo what do you want to do Rubes?\u201d Yang asked her siste.<br>\r\n\u201c I was thinking we could hang out today.\u201d Answered  Ruby.  She had all kinds of plans for the day, many of which involved a copious exercise of her power.<br>\r\n\u201c sounds good to me. Let\u2019s get going guys.\u201d  As all of  team RWBY  made to leave  Ruby  at that moment  decided to\u2026..<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In the end this power, and the responsibility that came with it,  were hers to bare.  Done with her negative self reflection, she decided to  carry on with the rest of her day. <br>\r\nShe considered taking a stroll through the forest or the campus grounds to take her mind off of today's events but also thought to check in with her teammates. <br>\r\nShe mulled over what to do next.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When she and her Team located the group, they formulated a simple plan to launch a surprise attack and went with the flow afterward. It was going well in spite of some difficulties here and there, but as Weiss activated her semblance an unseen Grimm, possibly returning after scouting the area, appeared out of nowhere and attacked, catching her off guard. Just as Weiss was about to redirect her glyph in an attempt to defend herself the Grimm managed to pounce on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough her Aura would usually protect her to a degree, this time it was too low after being attacked by the other Grimm during the attack and this resulted in the Grimm on top of her to \"break\" through the Aura with a bite into her shoulder drawing blood! As Weiss screamed in pain her partner, Ruby Rose had heard her and at the moment used her semblance to get in close and sliced at the Grimm with her weapon but unintentionally let's some of the wounded Grimm's blood to infect Weiss's wounds!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain was beyond Weiss's comprehension as she somehow unconsciously activating her semblance at random resulting in the infection to spread into her body and her screaming loudly. After dispatching the last of the group, her Team frantically tried to get her back to Beacon as quickly as possible before more Grimm would arrive once they sense their despair and Weiss in pain. As Weiss falls into unconsciousness, she could barely hear Ruby tearfully apologizing for her mistake and begged Weiss to hold on until they make it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Weiss is awake, she sat up in spite of the remnants of the pain as she examines her bandaged shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will happen to me now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a question that made Weiss nervous. Her potential future as a Huntress could very well be over if she was found to be unfit due to her injury and the infection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was the matter of her family... would her father even allow her to succeed him despite her \"condition\", or would he strip her position as the heiress and possibly make her younger brother, Whitley his heir instead?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither were good options when Weiss wanted to be independent of her father, and the thought of Whitley becoming the head of the Schnee Dust Company made her uneasy when she looked back on how Whitley acted more like their father when it comes to the Company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss sighed as she rubbed the bandage, \"I can't think too much about any of that right now. Recovery is my primary-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was cut off when entire body was suddenly in terrible pain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What's happening to me?!\"</i> Weiss mentally cried out as she teared up trying not to scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut unbeknownst to her, this was only the beginning as...</span></div></div>",

Then she heard more ripping sounds, only this time it came from her wounded shoulder as the bandages slowly get ripped apart. Soon it became a little hard for Weiss to breathe as she struggles to try to remove her dress but not before managing to remove her pendant necklace as she noticed it started to get too close to strangling her neck. (Her bolero and Tiara had already been removed when she had been brought into the infirmary.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Weiss felt her bandages finally come off after the last strap snapped off while her dress continued to get tighter and it wasn't long before her equally tightening bra started to get exposed.

Weiss was really panicking. \u201cWhy is this happening to me!?\u201d Weiss thought to herself. Just when she thought her situation couldn't get any worse  she felt the from before grow more intense, specifically around her chest.  Weiss could only stare in disbelief as her once nigh nonexistent breasts suddenly ballooned outward from her torso faster than the rest of her body , straining her bra as they went from the size of  oranges than grape fruit Then melons.  She gawked at how large her boobs had become, they even began to surpass Yang's assets. She was  shocked out of her trance when felt the same heat surge within her again only this time it was heavily concentrated on her lower body, much to her own horror. She felt her already  shapely legs began to thicken considerably as well as  lengthen, becoming alluringly voluptuous tree trunks. At the same time she could also feel her hips begin to widen with great haste, becoming something beyond \u201cchild birthing\u201d.  Her once petite posterior thickened in pace with her hips , growing into perfectly round basketball sized globes of flesh. Weiss  was completely flabbergasted by her body\u2019s impossible transformation. This did not make any sense! People did not just grow for no reason. The only logical explanation for any of this was the grimm blood that infected her wounds but she never heard of such a thing happening before.

But the bane of her anxiety had to ruin her mood once more at lunch in the Mess Hall when Yang had to tease Ruby with a <b>horrible</b> pun about drinking milk and emphasized by groping her own breasts resulting in several boys blushing or having perverted looks on their faces!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when the Team went to sleep for the night Weiss changed her mind and decided to finish what she had started!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so on a Saturday morning with no one else at the Acadamy at the moment, she is once again using the empty class to resume her experiments with renewed vigor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn you, Xiao Long!

My.\" Weiss said in shock as she saw her breasts. They were definitely bigger, but not as big as Yang's yet. Weiss is currently sitting at a C-cup range, which is bigger than her earlier B-cup, and Yang has an E-cup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, so the potion did work.\" Weiss said with a grin as she felt her chests expand more. She watched and felt it happen as well. \"That's more like! I'll show that bimbo who is on top!\" Weiss exclaimed looking at D-cup breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smirk on her face, Weiss put her shirt back on and returned to her dorm room. At this point, her breasts were DD-cups and almost Yang's size and her shirt was slightly ripping. \"W-Weiss, what happened?!\" Ruby asked pointing at Weiss' huge chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Weiss asked as she looked down, \"oh! I just had a growth spurt.\" Weiss concluded. \"We haven't seen you all day, and then you come back with these. Did you get an implant?\" Yang asked. Weiss showed Yang a bunch of notes and said, \"I couldn't. I was too busy filling up notes for Dr. Oobleck's class.\" Weiss said to the belief of team RWBY despite them not checking the notes. With that note, Weiss went to bed along with team RWBY. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Weiss woke up, the team was already getting ready for classes and Weiss's boobs were the same size as Yang's. \"Hey, Yang. It looks like you got some competition!\" Ruby exclaimed pointing at Weiss as she put on a bigger bra. Yang looked furious. \"Cat got your toung?\" Blake asked. Yang gave Blake a death stare as Blake got spooked and left the room and Ruby followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess Ruby is right.

And it's not early at all. Everyone here's waiting for them to open!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss eyed the assembly of large, sweaty, musclebound guys with an equal mixture of apprehension and interest. Apprehension because\u2014well, they were sweaty, and more often than not far too hairy. But she had to admit that the bulging biceps and chest she noted on one particular sunny golden dragon were quite appealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, very well,\" she huffed. \"But I don't want to try anything too rough, though. I .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang scoffed. \"Oh please. You gotta get rough at the gym, Weiss. Or at least work hard at it.\" She grinned and began teasing Weiss by flexing her right arm, her left hand squeezing her massive bicep. \"How else are you gonna get buff like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't want to get 'buff' or anything!\" Weiss snapped while heavily blushing at Yang's tease. \"I-I just want to be a little more in-shape, is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, whatever, Ice Queen.\" Yang rolled her eyes, slightly annoyed at Weiss' complaining. \"But you still have to take this at least a little bit seriously. I mean seriously, who spends two hours straightening their hair before going to the gym?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?! A heiress who takes pride in her appearance is someone who spends two hours straightening their hair before going to the gym, you dolt!\" Weiss snapped, clearly offended by Yang's remark. \"And I'll not have you forget it, Xiao Long!. I refuse to get it all sweaty and messy and dirty, unlike some of these...m-muscleheads!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, sure.\" Yang waved a hand noncommittally, not at all fazed by Weiss' outburst. \"Now c'mon! It's seven\u2014they're opening the doors!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, they were. The heiress only offered a token protest this time as Yang dragged her to the front of the line and then Team WY found themselves entering right through the double glass doors. Once inside, Weiss took a deep breath, and was disgusted caught a whiff of plastic and cheap air freshener. Then again, it was better than the horrid stench of musk and sweat she'd been expecting. An artificial atmosphere was simply marvelous compared to that swill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reluctantly followed Yang down to the lockers, where the two huntresses stowed their clothes and bags away in a shared locker. Weiss accepted a hand-towel with a skeptical look\u2014she doubted that she'd need it, and vowed to leave immediately for a shower if she did\u2014but didn't otherwise comment. After that, she followed Yang up the stairs to the main area of the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be over there at the treadmills.\" Yang jabbed a finger toward a long line of large black machines, where one or two gym-goers were already jogging along at a moderate pace. \"You should probably start over there as well to get your heart rate going, but you can try out any of the machines first, just to give it a try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm.\" Weiss scanned the line of exercise machines around her with a questioning eye. \"What's that one over there?\" she asked, pointing in the direction of a flat, black-leather bench with a barbell positioned above it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the bench pressing area,\" Yang said with a grin on her face. \"Good for tightening up your arms and burning fat around your glutes.\" Yang then slapped her tight butt with an open palm, then grinned when a light blush rose beneath Weiss's cheeks. \"Should be just what you're looking for, really. Not much of a bulk-up machine...unless you wanna have thicker arms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tightening,\" Weiss mused. \"Hm. Maybe having stronger arms COULD be useful for battling Grimm.\" Weiss then had a blush on her face. \"Yes; I think I'll try that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool. I knew you'd come around\" Yang took a gulp of water from her bottle, then screwed the top back on and jabbed a thumb toward the treadmills. \"Like I said, you know where to find me. And the machine should have directions on it, but if you need any help with form, feel free to ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Weiss said smugly. \"But I believe I'll manage quite well on my own. It's just a silly little machine, after all. I mean, these muscleheads manage to use it regularly, and they don't seem to have any problem with it. Even YOU can use it with ease, Yang. How hard can it be for an elegant young lady such as myself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her brief monologue, Weiss approached the bench pressing equipment while Yang went to the treadmills. Weiss sat on the bench, getting ready to start lifting the heavy weight. She suddenly began blushing whilst having a smirk on her face whilst looking directly at Yang and her muscular body, and began thinking to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...I was skeptical about it, but maybe I wouldn't mind getting a somewhat decent muscle mass. In fact, I don't think I would mind ending up being more stronger than Yang, or the rest of my team either. Even better, I wouldn't mind being the most strongest huntress-NO, the strongest living being in the entire world!

Weiss, for the most part, failed to notice them entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she resumed her workout, though, some part of her mind registered that when she let her muscles relax, they stayed the same size as when they\u2019d been bent. She just kept lifting, the sweat on her forehead coming down less and less as her muscles grew and grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the training bra across her chest had grown much tighter, her chest having swelled with muscle as much as her abs had tightened and her hips firmed. Weiss nearly moaned as she made another pull. No proper heiress would have done such a thing in public, of course, but it just felt so incredible to have that tightness stretching across what felt like her entire body. She imagined that this was what after-workout soreness felt like, but failed to realize that her workout wasn\u2019t getting harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anything, that same corner of her mind realized as she stood up from the weightlifting machine, it was getting easier. And she was getting bigger. And she liked it. She felt...turned on by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss blushed heavily while touching and observing her muscular body, as she thought to herself \"Mmm...I don't even look half-bad. I look AMAZING!

Yang's 4 incher is now a 6 incher, and has grown some acorn-sized balls below her clit-dick, soon to be just dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there was her half-sister Ruby, she knew it was wrong but damn she CUTE!  Total moe waifu!!  Ruby has been drinking her milk to help her grow, but all those cookies has been making her butt and thighs grow.  Good thinking about how those soft pillow butt jiggle when she got dress in her pj made her--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ACK!\" Yang's train of thought went blank has she came and some weird gooey substance landed in her mouth has she orgasm-ed.

Glue or is there a fleshy colored string tied around your waist?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, maybe you should reach around my ass and cope a feel to be sure,\" Yang said laughing and moaning little to Blake's unwitting hand job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake could feel Yang's penis throb in her hand and heat radiate off of it.  \"It feels almost like a real penis,\" Blake said feeling a little warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because it is a real penis, maybe you should check to see if it taste's like one too,\" Yang said smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake blushed and Yang's suggestion, but decided to play her game and lowered her mouth on Yang's penis.  It certainly smelled like a real penis, remembering how it compared to Adam's penis.  Blake gave it an experimental lick causing Yang's body to twitch.  \"Oh wow, your tongue is rough just like a cat's too,\" Yang moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang had to be faking it thought Blake, there is no way she felt that.  Blake started kissing the head of Yang's penis.  \"Yes, please kiss my beautiful cock to make it better because of your rough tongue.\"  Said Yang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright that was it,\" thought Blake as she plunged onto Yang's penis, taking the first 3 inches.  Yang's toes curl, feeling happy about her first ever blow job from her best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Blake don't stop!\" Yang grabbed the back of Blake's head and shoved her down to the hilt, with her chin resting on Yang's balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't be real!\" Blake thought, \"There's no way she could have grown a penis, it's not possible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'll make sure you feel good too,\" Yang said has she kept Blake's head pinned down on her cock with one hand, while reaching over Blake's ass, digging her other hand through Blake's PJ's bottoms and fingering her vagina.  Yang could feel Blake's vagina getting wet, the male pheromones from Yang's penis, must be affecting her.  Yang wrapped her legs around Blake's head and started rocking her hips back and forth.  Blake could do nothing to fight, and wasn't she if she wanted it to.  Blake's hands reached under her belly and started rubbing her pussy while trying to match her speed with Yang's thrusts.  Yang's hand left Blake's pussy and switched to having two hands shoving Blake's head back and forth on her cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang's sausage tasted so good in Blake's, but was it getting... bigger?  Yang's cock was getting harder and bigger and could feel herself cumming real soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm cumming!!!\" Yang half-whispered and blew her load down Blake's throat.  Blake gagged with amount of cum entering her mouth and stomach.  After a full min, Yang stopped and her cock softened and her balls deflated.  Yang released Blake from her cock, and glared at Yang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yang, what the *burrrp* hell!,\" Blake yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhh, not so loud Weiss and Ruby are sleeping,\" Yang said giggling a little at Blake's cute burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you done?\" Blake said aghast of what she just done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really, that burp was kind of hot and made me horny again,\" Yang said looking proudly at her semi-hard shaft as it grew from 7... 8... 9... 10... inches of cock!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yang, did your penis get... bigger?\" Blake said looking at the 10 inch monster between Yang's legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, don't ask me how, but I'm think ready to again, wanna try anal before it gets too big?\" Yang said obviously feeling proud about hir new bigger size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be serious.  Aren't you a little concerned of what happened to you?\" Blake said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, I feel excited and awesome.  I hope it gets bigger, can you image me with a full foot of cock.  My package will be a perfect match for my tig o'l bitties!\" Yang said undeterred by her new endowment at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, Yang it's too early for me to deal with your crap, and I really have to take a crap too.  So...\"  Blake shoved Yang out the bathroom door and locked the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang turned away from the door and looked toward the sleeping beauties in front of her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in the mood for at least one more fuck, but who should I pick...\"</span></div></div>",

While the buxom blonde pandered about the case she decided to bring it back to her dorm.She lay on her bed watching videos on the dustnet because Ruby was off on a trip with Weiss and Blake was in her home,Also known as the fort of books she read and studied,so the temptation to open the case was so much more due to the boredom.After staring at the case for 5 minutes she decided to open it and take a peak.She found 2 small glass tubes with a yellow liquid,A label on it saying \u201cExperimental Enhancement  Dust\u201d and it had a instruction manual.#Step 1:poor dust into water #Step 2:Drink the water #Step 3:wait 30-40 mins #Step4:Enjoy the enhancements of your best parts.As Yang sit there reading this the only thing she could wonder was what did it enhance anyway,She said \u201cScrew it I\u2019m bored and hell maybe it\u2019ll make my fighting skills better\u201d.She got a glass of water,Put the mixture of dust in the water,then waited 5 minutes and than drank the concentrated solution.After watching Dustnet videos for 30 minutes and nothing had happened Yang said \u201cWell that was a waste,now all I have is a bad taste in my mouth and I\u2019m still bor-\u201c Suddenly Yang felt a tightness in her chest and she looked down to see her breasts swelling and growing like dough in a oven.She was in shock until she grew 3 cup sizes bigger she had always enjoyed her breasts and loved showing them off or boasting about them at any opportunity.she noticed that her bra as oh so tight due to the 5 cup bigger chest she started to feel her new bussom and had a realization that they were growing more sensitive with there size increase.She couldn\u2019t Stop copping a feel of her breasts her yellow bra had snapped allowing her breasts to flop up in the air and allowing them to not be restricted by the tiny bra.the blonde started to play with her nipples and an explosion of ecstasy came over her,the now mammoth sized blonde had played with her nipples allowing her nipples to drip the steamy white liquids inside her breasts.She started to play with her nipples with her left hand and feeling and patting her breasts with the right enjoying the feelings of ecstasy and the sound of the sloshing in her breasts.At this point she also got the feeling from the almost given out t-shirt restricting and covering only the middle of her bean bag sized breasts when the shirt completely ripped apart.She came to the realization that the rapid growth had stopped and the blonde was desperate for more she needed it when the realization that there was a second vial.She looked over to the vial with a desperate look.She drank straight from the vial regardless of the instructions and her breasts swelled at a even greater rate in 2 minutes she grew to the size that could fit a beowolf in each breast.At this point the only thing Xiao long could care about was getting bigger.She was so sensitive that a gust of wind made her feel lost in ecstasy and a warmth.As they grew she couldn\u2019t help but scream out \u201cBigger,BIGGER!!!! *Pant* I need BIGGGER!!!!! *Moan*\u201d Her screams of pleasure and the sloshing of her ever expanding breasts were all that could be heard Yang\u2019s Whale sized chest was taking up all the room except an inch from the door.The walls cracking creaking and everything consumed by the flesh of her chest.<br>\r\nThen the door knob starting to be played with and it hit the doorframe sized nipple as the door was opened and a stream of milk came pouring from the nipple enough came out to fill a pool,not that it was much different since the breasts were constantly spewing gallons of milk every few seconds. The person coming into the room pushed the door open and Blake walked in as much as possible with the few inches of space available in the 95% breast flesh room <br>\r\nYang realized she came In and went back to moaning and panting, Blake didn\u2019t know why but she saw the fountain of milk coming from Yang\u2019s nipples and couldn\u2019t help but want to drink it she had no clue why this felling was coming over her...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yang Xiao Long is a total babe. That is just a fact and everybody knows it. With the right combination of good genetics, a healthy life style and some DAMN good luck Yang is growing up to be one of the most beautiful women on the planet. Speaking of growing...<br>\r\n\"Come on..ngh..just a little more..*click* Got It!!\" Yang said in triumph as 5 minutes of struggle to put on her bra finally payed off..for about 5 seconds before it burst and went flying across the room.<br>\r\n\"..Damn it not again..\" she huffed in annoyance as this was a common occurrence. So much so that Yang wondered(not for the first time) why she even bothered wearing a bra. Yang had many things about herself she was very proud of. Her gorgeous face with amethyst eyes, her flawless skin with a slight tan, her perfect muscle tone from a lifetime of martial arts training, her thick flowing mane of pure golden hair(touch her hair without her permission and you DIE) just to name a few. But the one thing she hated(if only slightly) about herself was her perfectly round, very soft and HUGE breasts...that just seemed to not know when to stop Growing!!<br>\r\n\"That was a $70 P cup bra you just ruined girls.\" she scolded her breasts as if they were misbehaving children. She glared at them for a minute before sighing\"I love you girls but seriously there is no point in getting so big.\" she said in a more caring voice as she lifted them up. She then looked to her full body mirror for a better look and she noticed that her side boobs were hiding most of her arms and her hands were completely buried under her massive mammaries.<br>\r\n\"It feels like their getting bigger by the day now.\" she said to herself in slight worry.<br>\r\n\"And maybe I'm being paranoid, but sometimes I think I can see and feel them growing.\" she said as she rubs them together and letting out a soft moan.<br>\r\n\"And their getting more sensitive.\" she said softly\"Just how much bigger are they going to get?\" Now isn't that the Million dollar question.<br>\r\nFor almost as long as she can remember Yang has always had the biggest breasts around. She started wearing bra's when she was 10, she had a DD-cup when she was 12 and she passed the legendary 100cm milestone when she was 14. One of the main reasons she trains so hard in martial arts now in days(besides the fact she loves to fight) is to give her the strength, hand eye coordination and balance just to walk straight. But the most important thing to note here is that Yang just turned 16. Which meant that she still had a few more years of growing to do.<br>\r\nThat bra she try to put on earlier was a birthday gift from her dad last week. At the time it fit perfectly, but now was just another on a LONG list of bra's she destroyed.<br>\r\nYang sigh\"Oh well..another day another bra.\"(she is probably the only woman on remnant that can say that unironically) she then looked at her clock to see that it was almost time to head out on her own birthday celebration with a very special someone. <br>\r\nSo with much enthusiasm she put on her best shoes, pants, most loose(but tight on her) tank top and leather jacket to get ready. As she went out the the door to ride on her motorcycle her little sister Ruby cried out\"Say hi to..\"</span></div></div>",

Now you may be wondering \"Jaune Arc!?!? How did that loser score Yang Xiao-Freaking-Long?!\" Well for one thing they had known each other since kindergarten. When they first met Jaune was getting pick on by some Second Graders in a sand box on the school playground. Enraged at the scene and rather eager to put her dad's training to good use Yang charged at bullies and proceeded to pumble one of them in to the ground, but was quickly blindsided and overwhelmed the by other two. Just as they were about to do to her what they did to Jaune if not worse the bullies found their eyes burning as Jaune threw clumps of sand into their faces. This gave Yang the chance to break free and continue her assault.<br>\r\nSeeing as their favorite victim finally found the courage to stand up to them and now had this crazy girl to protect him the bullies decided to flee and never bother Jaune again.\"That's right you punks run!! And if you try this crap again I'll shove my fists up your asses and use you as hand puppets!!\" Yang shouted at them.(quite the mouth on her for 6 year old huh) She then looked to Jaune who had a black eye and dirt all over his face. Yang gave him wide bright grin that showed one of her front teeth was missing.<br>\r\n\"Thanks for your help back there. Even though I totally could have taken them myself you really helped.\" she said with confidence. Jaune just looked at the ground rubbing his arm rather timidly.<br>\r\n\"Not really. You're the one who fought them off. I didn't really do much..\" he said quietly. Yang puffed her cheeks in a pout before walking up to him and bopping him on the head.<br>\r\n\"Oww..why did yo-\" \"Hey you're a man aren't you?\" Yang interrupted. Jaune blinked in confusion.\"Yes?\" <br>\r\n\"Then take pride in yourself!\" she stated boldly\"You just helped a pretty girl kick some ass and stood up to guys almost twice as big as you. I'd say that's something to be proud of. Don't you?\" she finished with her bright grin returning. All Jaune could do was stare at her in awe as her words touched his heart and in that moment the sun was at just right angle to make her hair shine so much it seemed to glow.<br>\r\n\"Yeah..a pretty girl..\" he said completely enchanted.\"Hm?\" Yang tilted her head slightly confused. Jaune snapped out of his trance\"I-I-I mean you're very pretty and.. I-I-I mean I'm proud of yo-me-I-I m-mean-\" Jaune was saved from further embarrassment as Yang put a finger on his lips\"Don't worry I know what you meant.\" she gave him knowing smile and wink. She then removed her finger from his lips and left her hand out for a handshake\"My name is Yang Xaio Long. What's yours?\" Jaune took her hand and gave it a firm shake saying\"Jaune. Jaune Arc.\" And they had been best friends ever since. Yang was always encouraging Jaune to try new things and be more confident in himself. She even started to teach him what she knew about martial arts so he could defend himself when she wasn't around. While Jaune was always there to make sure Yang didn't get into too much trouble and cheer her up whenever she was having a bad day. Plus he was one of the few people who found her puns funny(only slightly). For the longest time Jaune had a huge crush on Yang and she knew about it(he was terrible at hiding it). And while Yang really liked him too she didn't like him in \"that\" way..until one day.<br>\r\nYang(age 13) was sparing with a new member of the Dojo at school with Jaune watching from the sidelines cheering her on as always. Now normally she would dominating the match as she was one of the best fighters in the Dojo, years of training with her dad more then paying off. But that wasn't the case this time as one this new girl Cinder Fall was just as good as her if not better. And two her breasts had been going through another growth spurt(her cup size was almost F) so she was a little off balance. A fact that Cinder noticed and was more than happy to take advantage of. Cinder poked and prodded at Yang's temper calling her\"a fat cow\" or \"slut\" make her angrier and more off balance then before until Yang reached her breaking point and charge with a wild haymaker leaving her wide open for Cinder to sweep kick Yang causing her to fall face first onto the mat and slid across it a couple of inches causing the top of her gi open up. Yang pick herself up to have another go at the bitch when \"Oh my! Miss Xaio Long how indecent of you.\" Cinder said in fake surprise as she pointed at Yang's open top. Yang looked down to see that her breasts were bare for all to see.\"Ahh!!\" she exclaimed as she frantically covered herself. \"Are they too much for you? Or can just not help but exposing yourself to everyone you slut?\" Cinder gave a cruel chuckle at Yang's embarrassment before out of nowhere a fist filled with righteous fury slammed into her face causing her to fly across the room. Yang looked up to see that the fist belonged to her best friend Jaune Arc as he looked at Cinder with eyes full of wrath.\"The only slut I see here is you!! Insult Yang again and I'll gut you like a fish and use you entrails as a fucking jump rope!!\" he roared at the bitch as she pick herself off the floor wiping the blood from her lip.(damn Jaune has got a mouth on him now too)<br>\r\n\"Enough!!\" shouted the Sensei of the Dojo Glynda Goodwitch \"Everyone pack up your gear and leave early for the day. Miss Fall your behavior is most unbecoming of a martial artist.\" she addressed her new student with much disappointment \"If you do not show proper respect to your fellow students then will have to discipline you. Am I clear?\" Cinder gave a half hearted \" ..yes sensei.. \" before heading off to the changing room. Glynda shook her head and Yang as she was back on her feet.<br>\r\n\" Miss Xaio Long do try to keep your anger in check. If used properly anger can be your best weapon, but if not it becomes your enemies best weapon.\" Taking her sensei's words of wisdom to heart Yang gave her slight bow in respect. Glynda then looked to Jaune as he regained his composure \"And Mr. Arc\" he stood at attention with a worried look on his as felt that he was in trouble, but his fear was unfounded as Glynda gave him a smirk and said \"Nice right hook.\" before heading out herself.<br>\r\nJaune breathed a sigh of relief as turned to face Yang \"Are you al-\" he was interrupted by Yang giving him a heartfelt kiss. After a few seconds Yang broke the kiss and said with pride\" Seeing you punch that bitch in the face was the hottest thing I had ever seen!\" Jaune gave her a confident smirk and said \"What can I say? I had a good teacher.\" Yang had a smirk of her own \"Damn right you did.\" And they had been happily dating ever since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yang was happily reminiscing about how she and Jaune got together as she pulled up to Jaune's house to pick him up. She couldn't wait for this date not just because she loved spending time with her boyfriend, but because she had something very special planned for them both at the end. She honked her horn to let Jaune know she was here and ready to go. Jaune stepped out not a minute later dressed for a night on the town with a warm smile for his girlfriend.<br>\r\n\"Hey there sunshine.\" Jaune said as he pulled Yang in for a heartfelt hug. <br>\r\n\"Hey yourself lover-boy.\" Yang responded with a passionate kiss which Jaune happily returned. The kiss lasted until they both needed to breath again and after a minute of catching their breath and being lost in each others eyes Yang then gave her lover a coy smirk.<br>\r\n\"Don't forget to say hi to the girls.\" she said playfully as she looked down on her enormous bosom that smushed against Jaune's chest even though they stood almost a foot from each other. Jaune had a smirk of his own as he leaned forward until his face was buried into her vast cleavage. Her breasts were almost twice as big as his head so Yang almost lost sight of him as rubbed face deep in her ever growing treasures. Jaune blew a raspberry into her cleavage causing Yang to burst out laughing.<br>\r\n\"You asshole!!\" she exclaimed in laughter and giving him a playful shove. Jaune simply smirked at her with smug satisfaction then went back to basking his glorious privilege of being the only man who can stare and touch his girlfriends breasts anytime and anywhere. He the noticed something interesting.<br>\r\n\"Busted another bra honey?\" he said casually.<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" she sigh \"And I really like that bra. I was hoping that it would last longer.\" she pouted.<br>\r\n\"Damn. And it only lasted a week too. I think that's a new record.\" he said thoughtfully.(it's amazing how they can talk about Yang breasts getting bigger like they're talking about the weather huh) <br>\r\n\"Six days actually.\" she corrected him. Jaune blinked in surprise.<br>\r\n\"Really? huh\" he took it in stride. But his comment caused Yang's worries from earlier to resurface. Ever since her breasts started growing she had been keeping a close eye on the rate of her growth. And she noticed that as the years went by the speed in which she went through new bra's had been increasing. And Jaune was right, the last bra she had(O-cup) only lasted 18 days. Which meant that her growth spurts were getting stronger and more frequent.<br>\r\n{If these things don't stop growing sooner or later I'm literally going to be a walking pair of boobs! And Jaune would never marry or have kids with me then!} that thought terrified her. Yang loved Jaune with all her heart. Her dream was to marry him and have a family with him..a big one..bigger then his actually.(including him that's 8 kids by the way) So she summoned all her courage and willpower to ask him the question that she had been meaning to ask him for a while now.<br>\r\n\"Hey Jaune..you love me right..?\" she asked timidly. Hearing her soft voice and seeing her uncharacteristically shy demeanor Jaune grew very worried.<br>\r\n\"Of course I do sunshine.\" he answered sincerely cupping her cheek with tender care. Yang sigh in bliss as she leaned into his warm palm.<br>\r\n\"Why would you think otherwise?\" he asked with much concern.<br>\r\n His reassurance and gentle touch helped calm her nerves. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath to help her finish baring her soul.<br>\r\n\"It's..it's my breasts.\"<br>\r\nJaune tilted his head in confusion. \"What about them?\" Yang gave her dense boyfriend a flat look.<br>\r\n\"Jaune..\" she said in the most unamused voice ever. It took a minute before it dawned on him.<br>\r\n\"Ooohhh! So their getting bigger again.\" he shrugged \"So what? They get bigger all the time.\" he said like it was the most obvious thing in the world. <br>\r\nYang let out a slight chuckle and shook her head in disbelief at what her idiot of a boyfriend just said.<br>\r\n\"Jaune did you even hear what you just said?\" she asked desperate to get through his thick skull.<br>\r\n\"I'm 16 and I have quite possibly have the biggest breasts on the planet. I know I play it up like it's no big deal and while it IS pretty awesome the reality is that if these things get any bigger then I'm not going to be able to live a real life with you!\" tears started to pour down her eyes as she continued to vent all her pent up feelings.\"I won't be able to leave the house. I won't be able to get a job besides being a stripper or hooters. I probably won't even be able to have kids because my breasts would squish my belly!\" she was getting hysterical as her fears started to overwhelm her. \"People will laugh a you for being with a circus freak like me!! And-\" her panic was stopped by Jaune gently but firmly cupping both of her cheeks and kissing her. Giving her some time to calm down Jaune broke the kiss, wiped away her tears with his thumbs and stared straight into her eyes with a look of pure love and devotion.<br>\r\n\"Now you listen to me Yang Xaio Long.\" Jaune said in a calm but powerful voice that caused Yang's heart to hammer in her rib cage and her knees to weaken.<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter how big your breasts are or how big there going to get. It doesn't matter what other people say or think about us. It doesn't matter what life throws at us. I Love You. I love you with every fiber of my being. I want to marry you someday. I want to have an army of kids with you. I want to spend every moment (good and bad) of my life with you. And nothing will EVER change that.\" he meant every word.<br>\r\nNew tears poured from Yang's eyes as the love of her life finished his heartfelt speech.<br>\r\n\"Really? Even if they grow bigger then my body you will still be with me?\" she asked already knowing his answer but wanted to hear it anyway. He nodded firmly.<br>\r\n\"Even then.\"<br>\r\n\"Bigger than Remnant?\" \"Even then.\"<br>\r\n\"Bigger than the universe?\" \"Even then.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh Jaune..\" <br>\r\nThey then shared another kiss, deeper and full of more love and passion then all that came before as it felt like their very souls were now linked. After what seemed like eternity they broke the kiss to breath in some very needed air. Jaune then raised an eyebrow in amusement.<br>\r\n\"Bigger then your body, Remnant or the universe?\" he asked eager to know were she got such a silly(but hot) idea from. Yang blushed and gave a sheepish laugh and smile scratching the back of her head. <br>\r\n\"I may have had a few nightmares about that actually happening hehehe.\" Jaune had a naughty smirk on his face as he playfully groped her breasts causing her to moan in surprise.<br>\r\n\"Nightmare? That sounds like a dream come true to me.\" Yang punched him in the ribs playfully in retaliation.<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up you ass!\" they shared a laugh for a minute before Yang hopped back onto her bike.\"Now get on lover-boy we've got a date to get to.\" Jaune happily obeyed. <br>\r\nThe young lovebirds then spent the rest of the day doing just about everything a couple can do on a date. Lunch at a nice restaurant, played games at the arcade, watched a movie, singing and dancing at karaoke the whole nine yards. They had the time of their lives until finally a few hours after sunset the lovers found themselves in a room at a love hotel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>We now find our young lovebirds on a huge heart shaped bed in the room they had rented for the weekend. Jaune was laying on his back smiling at the breathtaking sight before him. Yang saddled his hips in the cowboy position ready to finally become one with her true love. Ever since they had started dating they had only done foreplay, making out and the occasional blowjob. They were originally going to save themselves for their wedding night, but after baring their souls to each other and the wonderful date they figured \"Why wait?\" Yang took hold of Jaune's 10 inch long and 3 inch thick cock and was about slide it into her soaking wet pussy when her lover asked in a gentle voice \"Yang are you sure you're ready for this?\" Yang simply smiled. His concern was touching but unnecessary.<br>\r\n\"I have never been more ready for anything in my life.\" she said sincerely as a coy smirk went across her face and she lifted her heavy breasts giving them a sexy jiggle. \"I think the real question is..can you handle this much woman?\" Jaune rose to the challenge by firmly grasping her enormous bosom with a smirk of his own.<br>\r\n\"You better believe it sunshine.\" he stated boldly as his hands sank deep into her soft naughty pillows. Yang let out moans of pleasure as he continued to knead her breasts like a professional chef with two huge balls of dough. Even with after all these years of dating Yang and seeing her growth first hand their sheer size never seized to amaze him.<br>\r\n\"I meant what I said earlier you know.\" he said wanting to ease any fear his love had left \"It doesn't matter if you never stop growing. I'll never stop loving you.\"<br>\r\nMore tears of joy threatened to leave her eyes as looked down at her soulmate with a smile warmer then the sun.\"I know.\" and with that Yang gently lowered herself until she felt the tip of his cock enter her. \"AH!! Oh God!\" she gritted her teeth as she lowered herself further until her pussy was filled up to her womb with Jaune's cock.<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!\" she screamed in pain and pleasure as a little blood leaked out from her virginity being taken. She breathed heavily as she gently rubbed her belly\" *pant pant* It's so big..*pant*..It's piercing my womb..\" the tears she was holding back flowed down her cheeks causing Jaune to worry if she was in too much pain.<br>\r\n\"Yang are yo-\" he was interrupted by Yang softly kissing him. When the kiss ended all Jaune could see on her face was pure happiness.<br>\r\n\"We are finally one Jaune.\" she said with a voice full of bliss. For a few minutes they laid together sharing the moment of their union wanting to remember this moment forever. Then Yang's smile morphed into a smirk \"Now then lover-boy..give it to me. Don't. Hold. Back.\" He didn't.<br>\r\nFor 13 hours they made love in every way they could before exhaustion finally caught up with them. Little do they know, but as the lovers laid together in wistful bliss Yang's breasts slowly but surely started getting even bigger. With all the hormones released from the hours of mind blowing sex and the \"nutrients\" Yang ingested was causing all sorts of chain reactions in her body that seem to be perfectly designed to make her breasts as big as possible. Every hour another centimeter was added to her bust, you could almost hear them growing. Yang felt them grow as she slept it was just like in her nightmares only this time it was real. And yet she wasn't scared.<br>\r\nBecause this time Jaune was also there in her dreams. Even as her breasts seemed to grow on forever he was right there beside her just like he promised. <br>\r\nSo as Yang woke up the next morning to see her magnificent mammaries now reaching S-cup levels she had no fear because her love was right there beside her looking at her like she was a goddess. <br>\r\n\"It looks like the girls grew overnight\" she said in sultry voice.\"You know I think I have a theory as to why they keep growing.\"<br>\r\n\"Besides puberty?\" Janue said with a playful smirk. Yang giggled before softly punching him on the shoulder.<br>\r\n\"Quiet you and just listen.\" Jaune raised his hand in surrender \"Alright alright.\" Yang thought for a second as to how to explain her rather crazy theory \"It's you Jaune.\"<br>\r\n\"...Huh?\"(Jaune.exe has stop working)<br>\r\n\"Well to be more specific it's my love for you.\" she elaborated. Jaune just scratched his head in utter puzzlement \"You lost me.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay so here's the thing. You know that I've been keeping track of how much they been growing right?\" she asked Jaune nodded. \"So when they first started I was flat like everyone else and then BAM! I had boobs.\" Jaune chuckled \"What?\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry it's just hard to remember that you were ever flat hehehe.\" Yang was not amused \"Shutting up.\"(wise choice)<br>\r\n\"Anyway..that was my first and strongest growth spurt since that was when puberty kicked in. But when reached I 100cm they started to slow down even stop for a while. But then we got really lovey dovey, you started to touch them all the time and then they grew like crazy again. You see were I'm going with this?\"<br>\r\n\"Iii..guess?\" was all he could say.<br>\r\n\"I have also heard rumors that when a woman's in love, like REALLY in love and her breasts are touched by the man she loves they grow.\" She then cupped her breast and started bouncing them \"And considering I've gone up a few cup sizes after we did a WHOOOLE LOT of loving last night I'd say that is most definitely true in my case.\" This reminded Jaune that they didn't use any protection.<br>\r\n\"Yang I-\" she put a finger to his lips \"Ssshh I know.\" Yang had a warm knowing smile of her face as she rubbed her (for now) flat belly affectionately \"You will take responsibility. You will marry me so our baby won't be born out of wedlock. You will work every god given hour to take care of me and our baby. I know. And I love you so much for it.\"<br>\r\nJaune was amazed that she seemed to read his mind before shaking his head with a chuckle.\"You know me so well. And I love you more for it my sunshine.\"<br>\r\nThe lovebirds then had a big breakfast and called their families to tell them the news of them having a baby and getting married soon. Normally such big news at such a young age would raise a lot of concern but they were actually very supportive and happy for them. Jaune's family and Yang's dad knew that their love was pure and that they would take care other no matter what. Ruby was especially happy that she was going to be an auntie.(they could hear her squeals of joy from here)<br>\r\nSo with all that out the way Yang then looked to her future hubby with a very hungry stare. \"All of this baby talk reminds me of something important.\" Jaune had a pretty good idea of were this was going and was loving it.\"Oh yeah? What?\" he teased. Yang rubbed her belly again in slow suggestive circles with both hands with a smug grin \"Weelll..now that I have your baby growing inside me that means..\" her hands then cupped her breast and gently squeezed them as lifted them up give them both a tender kiss \"That these babies going to be making LOTS of warm milk.\" she said in a very sultry voice and a teasing wink. Jaune's boner shot up so fast that when it slapped his abs it hurt a little and looked even bigger and thicker then before. Something Yang noticed as she continued to toy with her bosom \"Mmm..you like that don't you daddy..the thought of my evergrowing boobies swelling up with milk like a cow..mmm..moo..\"she was getting so lost in the fantasy that she didn't notice that was actually happening. When her body found out it was pregnant her specialized anatomy designed for none stop growth kicked into high gear. Her breast started to heat up as her mammary glands expanded to make room for the flood of milk that was coming.\"AHH!! I could store whole gallons in these bad girls!! More then enough to feed an army of kids like you wanted!! OH GOD YEESS!!!\" All Jaune could do was stare in awe as his fiance desperately squeezed and pulled on her nipples as if she trying to make milk come out. The pressure and pleasure built up in Yang's breasts until finally.<br>\r\n\"MMMMMOOOOOO!!!!!\" she screamed in nirvana as small jets of milk shot out of her nipples onto Jaune's face. Her legs gave up on her and fell back on to the bed breathing heavy. Jaune sat there stunned at what just happened. He absentmindedly licked some of the on his lips \"Delicious..\" he whispered to himself.<br>\r\n\"Glad you like it.\" Yang said breathlessly as she sat back to look at her love with heart shaped pupils in her eyes \"That pretty much confirms it..I'm your baby mama!\" she said in delight as she opened up her legs spread eagle \"Now come here daddy..mama needs some more loving!\"<br>\r\nOh so it's loving she wants huh..well then Jaune was more then to oblige \"YES MA'AM!!\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The blonde bombshell huffed as a thin trail of sweat rolled down her forehead, her muscles coiled with the exertion, tensing as she the bar was lifted until reaching her neck, only to be lowered down once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the physically strongest member of Team RWBY, Yang was no stranger to working out, but lately she felt her progress was not what she hoped for, as in several fights she had found herself in a pitch and required of her Semblance to take rescue her. Yang remembered her father's, and the teacher's, multiple instructions on not rellying on their Semblance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, with that in mind, Yang prepared her a new workout rutine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAura made muscle mass meaningless with its ability to strengthen the body's endurance and power, but its capacity to do so was proportional to the user's own physical fitness. IE; Someone with stronger muscles could increase their strength through Aura with greater efficency than someone with a less fit body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo sum it up; If she made her muscles bigger then she would kick and even greater ammount of ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang couldn't help but grin mid rep, imagening biceps worthy of her fighting style, and maybe her overall body being much more muscular too. Why not? She already had a pretty nice abdominal definition, might as well go for the whole set. After all, she didn't think muscles on a lady weren't unattractive, in fact, watching those motivational posters with those fitness girls sporting those big muscles was kinda sexy. There was an allure to having that strength<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood thing Beacon had top of the line training equipment; Weights enhanced with gravity dust that could increase their weight on a vocal command, endurance machines which could adapt to the user's progress, that sort of thing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing the rep, Yang set the bar back on its rack and let out a long breath. Her yellow workout t-shirt, with the words 'I Burn' written with big black letters, clung tightly to her sweating form, her black workout shorts hugged her nicely defined glutes, showing off her long shapely legs. She walked foward to one of the big mirrors on the wall, her long yellow hair helf up in a high ponytail swaying behind her as she walked, and took a good look at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing her left hand on her hip and lifting her right arm, Yang flexed her bicep and watched as a small mound rose beneath the sleeve, the definition noticeable and the size showing a good gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang for her part...</span></div></div>",

Normally serene as a landscape painting, a small section of the forest shook &amp; rattled across the vista, leaves flying, trees falling, ruining the serene, static image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><b>RATATATATATATAT</b></i>\" In the center of the forest's action, the barrel of Gianduja rotated, expelling high-velocity Dust bullets that exploded on impact against the trunks of the forest trees, causing them to fall to pieces, a black phantom darting from each wooden corpse as it fell to tatters. Coco rotated in place at a steady pace, matching the Geist as it tried to flee, firing into whatever it tried to possess until it was left with no options to run. Tree by tree burst at the combination of Coco's Semblance &amp; her bullets, sending a haze of wooden dust &amp; dirt particles everywhere, creating a coffee-colored fog of war befitting of her team name; the Geist would eventually have nowhere to go, and her gun would impact against its bony mask, sending the Grimm to the great beyond - mission complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"We're done with the stragglers. Have you finished the Geist yet, Coco?\"</i> The thoughts of her teammate, Fox, rang in Coco's mind - a telepathy channel used to keep the team together, even when separated, constantly updating one another on their Grimm quarry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Not yet,\"</i> she replied, <i>\"Little sucker's really moving around fast. Start coming towards the cloud of dust, guys, one of you might be able to get it on its next round.\"</i> The Geist kept making circles around Coco, trying to move from tree to tree for some form of a body to strike back, but the fashionista wasn't having it, she put all of her Hype into each &amp; every round to turn the mighty oaks to mere woodchips upon immediate impact - she was almost toying with it in a sense. \"Ah, ah, ah,\" she mocked, \"Those suits are <i>far</i> out of your value, stud.\" Coco was having fun messing with the Geist on some level, taking joy in blowing up the wilderness, but it had to come to an end at some point, else her professors would be mad at her for defacing one of Remnant's most beautiful forests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Geist couldn't agree more, this had to end. It changed its trajectory, coming in closer towards Coco, risking the bullet hailstorm - it darted towards a couple mid-sized rocks, ones that could do some damage if possessed, but failed to dash quickly enough as it exploded into a gray mist of particles. The Geist wasn't deterred, it dashed towards more stones, closer and closer to Coco, which she quickly destroyed with her gun. The visibility was getting poor at this point, Coco could barely see through the haze as is with her sunglasses, it didn't help the cloud was getting larger &amp; closer to her the more she fired. <i>\"What's it doing? Is it trying to make a tornado or something to possess? I can't see with this- wait a second...\"</i> Coco slowed her firing rate for a moment, taking a moment to think - a wry smile formed on her lips as she figured out the Geist's gambit. She slowly released her finger from the trigger and begun to back up, letting her gun change back to its basic purse form, feigning huffing in a panic - if her intuition was right, the Geist would be coming for her any moment now. As if on cue, a bright yellow light came from behind Coco's field of view - the Geist charged at her with its claws, ready to slice her in two...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Geist felt the weight of Gianduja's purse format press directly into its mask, cracking it in multiple places. The phantasm shrieked in pain and fumbled against the dirt floor, its body dissipating into a black mist. Coco swung her purse over her shoulder and chuckled - those meditation &amp; sensory exercises Yatsuhashi &amp; Fox taught her really paid off. Coco backed up towards where the Geist disappeared, her upper body feeling sore from all the twisting &amp; arm-movement to chase the Geist; she moved her back against a soft, tall forest mushroom, one strange oddity of nature in Forever Fall, and leaned back into it, letting the coziness soothe her muscles. <i>\"The Geist is down.\"</i> Coco shot out through Fox's channel. <i>\"Mission complete.\"</i> Coco sunk to the ground and sat down, she was really going to need a hot bath &amp; nap when she got back to Beacon; CFVY's team leader was quite thankful for the therapeutic shifting the mushroom was doing on her back, almost like a massage chair...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, why's this moving so much?\" Coco tilted her head upwards, and from behind the hem of her shades, she came eye-to-eye with a few surviving sections of the Geist's mask, eye glowing gold in rage. Coco tried to dart upwards, but in an act of revenge, the Geist shook, spraying an orange pollen around its new body, making a new cloud of particles where the old one just began to disperse. Coco coughed in a panic, swinging Gianduja around as she backed up - her eyes teared up and she couldn't see through the stinging sensation, the Geist could've been primed to attack for all she knew. Indeed, it was - a root of the mushroom tore from the ground, and was primed to strike Coco across the face...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coco!\" a female voice with a heavy accent cried from above. The Geist tried to turn and react, but was powerless as a brown-haired girl with rabbit ears fell from the sky, splitting the mushroom &amp; mask in half with a translucent scythe. The Geist let out one final, pathetic cry as the bunny-girl swung the scythe around, spinning on her toes in a kneeling position - the Grimm's black mist &amp; orange pollen dissipated, and as the sky cleared, so did the girl's weapon, disappearing into shining particles of Dust. The girl, the rabbit Faunus Velvet, leapt to her feet and ran towards her team leader, wrapping her arms around the beret-wearing girl for support. \"Coco! Are you okay?! What was that orange stuff it shot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, V.\" Coco coughed out, \"It was just mushroom spores, it stings a bit, but it's nothing that the medical room at Beacon can't deal with.\" As Coco spoke, she continued to cough and clear her throat mid-sentence, rubbing her eyes with her free hand to clear the tears. Coco was putting on a brave front, but Velvet was still concerned for her leader - she looked at the remains of the mushroom the Geist once possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno,\" she replied, \"I've never seen a mushroom that large before, let alone that shape or color. It might be poisonous for all we know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, Velvet, really.\" Coco tried to stand up straight, but found herself fidgeting a little bit, rubbing her hands across her upper body, a chilly sensation pulsing through her muscles. Despite the internal struggle, Coco continued to proclaim she was fine, standing erect and fixing her sunglasses on her face. \"Let's just get in contact with Fox &amp; Yatsu, I want to get home before whatever that was sets into my clothes...\" Velvet looked down her team leader one more time, feeling a little concerned as she watched Coco keep rubbing her hands against her shoulders, like something was a matter with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Fox? Yatsu? It's Velvet, I've retrieved Coco. The Geist is dead, and all other Grimm should be exterminated here for now.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Is Coco alright?\"</i> Fox's voice rang back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"She says she is, but she was exposed to these spores from a strange mushroom the Geist possessed. We need to get her back to Beacon immediately.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Got it. Head north to the forest clearing, we'll rendezvous there while Yatsu &amp; I hail a helicopter.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Roger.\"</i> With the communication line ceased, Velvet got under Coco's left arm and wrapped it around her neck, carrying Coco against her back as the fashionable young woman shuddered. \"Come on now, Coco, let's get you back in bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Thanks, V. But slow down a bit, I have a headache, and- ack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my boots, something's up with them. Damn, I thought these things would've at least lasted me until the end of my time here. I'll have to go get a new pair made...\" Coco shivered as if she was chilly, or her body was fighting off some sort of infection, but to the leader of Team CFVY, Coco was blissfully unaware of the reaction the frenzied spores were having on her body...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Velvet was so sick of Cardin Winchester. He was nothing more than a bully and an oppressor. She just so happen to have the misfortune of being his favorite target. Well... Maybe not his favorite, he did seem to enjoy giving that Jaune boy a hard time. But that was beside the point, he was just an all around jerk that got off on making everyone else miserable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason he had singled her out however, was due to her status as a faunus. Because she was born with rabbit ears on her head, he had taken it upon himself to be as much of an ass as possible. She'd done nothing to him, she'd never even exchanged a simple greeting with him. Yet he still felt the need to remind her that he was someone she should watch out for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelvet wasn't a mean girl, in fact most people who knew her well enough could tell she didn't have a single mean bone in her body. Even when her teammates had offered to rough up the ignorant boy, she talked them down. Her leader Coco wasn't happy, but in the end she and the rest of team CVFY could only respect Velvet's decision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, even the kindest of people can only be pushed so far. Cardin had taken her kindness for weakness, a mistake most people are taught not to make. Because Velvet didn't fight back, the leader of team CRDL thought he could do whatever he pleased to her without any repercussions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrong!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to him, he had finally managed to due the near impossible. Make. Velvet. Angry! He had managed to achieve this great feat during lunch when he had committed the greatest sin against her. He'd upgraded from simple taunts and name calling to physical assault. Cardin Winchester made the biggest mistake of his short life when he grabbed her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven when she begged him to stop, he only laughed in her face. He pulled and pulled until he managed to make her cry in front o the whole cafeteria. It didn't matter to him that he hurt and embarrassed her. It only served to make him feel superior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Velvet knew she finally had enough! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin needed to be taught a lesson. The teachers clearly weren't going to give it to him! So it was all down to her to teach him a lesson he'd never forget. For the first time in her life, Velvet was going to entertain the idea of an eye for an eye. She was going to get even. She was going to make Cardin understand what it felt like to be small... Literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took weeks of planning, but she finally had everything she needed to get her revenge. Unfortunately for the rest of team CFVY, they weren't invited to the party. That extended to the rest of team CRDL as well. It would be just her and her long time oppressor. Velvet lost track of how long she spent shadowing Cardin. Learning his patterns and mannerism. At this point she felt like she knew her bully better than her own teammates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't matter though, today was the day she'd brake Cardin Winchester. Everything was set up smoothly. First she'd lure Cardin away, deep into the Emerald Forest where no cameras would see them, and no scroll signal could reach the academy. Next she'd bust out her secret weapon. She did feel guilty about stealing it from the Schnee girl, but what she didn't know wouldn't hurt her. Then... The fun would begin. All Velvet had to do was wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour of waiting a familiar voice came calling through the Emerald Forest. \"Hello!? Nikos!? You out here!? I got your text!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelvet couldn't help but giggle from behind her hiding spot. As if the 'invincible girl' would ever be interested in him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin heard the rustling of a nearby bush and smirked. \"Hey babe! That you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was showtime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of being greeted by the idol of Beacon Academy, he was greeted by the rabbit of Vale. \"What are you doing here flopsy?\" he asked in annoyance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelvet merely smiled. \"Who? Me? I called you here. Did you really think you were coming here to see Pyrrha? You're not her type.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin growled in anger, he'd been duped. He quickly regained his composure however and gave the brunette a cocky grin. \"So you called me out here? All by yourself? No teammates? That wasn't very smart.\" Yes he came unarmed like the text said, but he didn't need a mace to put this animal in her place. \"I guess I'm gonna have to teach you another lesson, flopsy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to his surprise, the rabbit didn't look worried or scared at all. In fact she was unnervingly calm. Velvet simply shook her head and stared back at her school bully who had yet grasp the severity of his situation. \"You know I'm a year ahead of you correct. That makes me your upperclassmen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your point?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As an upperclassmen it's my duty to look out for underclassmen. So now I'm going to educate you. I'm going to learn you a lesson in respect.\" Velvet declared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin simply cracked his knuckles. \"I've heard enough out of you. Now it's go time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't agree more.\" Velvet then pulled a vial of pitch black dust from behind her back. \"Now I'll educate you.\" Velvet smashed the dust vial on the ground beneath her and Cardin could only look on in confusion as one of his favorite puppies to kick was engulfed by the dark mist. All he could hear was the sound of Velvets frantic coughs and soon broke out in hysterical laughter. He didn't need to do a damn thing. The stupid animal would defeat herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis laughter soon halted when another sound reached his ear. The sound if something tearing. It was then he noticed the coughing ceased and instead the tearing sound continued on. Just what was happening in that mist?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin quickly wished he didn't know. Deep inside the mist Velvet had managed to stop coughing but it still felt as if her lungs were on fire. Honestly her whole body felt as if it was heating up. Then she felt a tingling sensation deep within her gut. The first thing she felt was the tightness of her school uniform on her body. She could feel the very fabric holding it together being strained to the limit as her body began to expand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fabric began to tear in all sorts of places and she could feel her shoes instantly give out as they were torn asunder. Her uniform tore completely now, leaving her as bare as the day she entered the world. Thankfully she thought to not wear any underwear in preparation for today. She could soon see over the black mist as everything around her seemed to move farther and farther away. She just kept climbing and climbing until the trees could barely reach her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin stood wide-eyed, mouth agape at the sight. That puny little rabbit faunus just underwent one hell of a growth spurt. When she finally did stop growing, Cardin for the first time in his life felt a sense of real fear around the rabbit faunus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. I didn't think I'd get this big.\" Velvet said in awe of her new size. She could see over every tree and almost over the mountains. As she looked around marveling at the view, a small little 'bug' came into her field of vision. That bug was none other the whimpering form of Cardin Winchester who had fallen flat on his backside. That was when she remembered what she was here for. \"So tell me!\" her voice boomed. \"How does it feel to be so small?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin couldn't answer, he was far to scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then! Let the lesson begin.\"</span></div></div>",

One minute flopsy was miniscule and the next she'd grown into a giant. It was too much for his tiny mind to handle. His fight or flight instincts took over and flight seemed to win out. Cardin scrambled to his feet and began to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeacon! All he had to do was make it back to school and he'd be home free. The teachers could deal with this monster. That was the plan. Too bad no plan survives first contact with the enemy. Cardin didn't get very far before a giant bare foot cut off his escape route. He slammed into it hard and was sent sprawling to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going somewhere?\" Velvet asked with barely hidden amusement. She couldn't believe how easy it was to stop her bully dead in his tracks. She didn't really have to do anything except take a step forward. Seeing him fall back the way he did gave her a warm feeling in her chest. Was this how Cardin felt when he messed with her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe downed leader of team CRDL quick shook off the cobwebs and got to hi feet again. He looked up a the giant foot which to him seemed as big as a bullhead. Fear tore through him as he tried to make a break for it yet again. Velvet saw this and cut off his escape for the second time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the second time that day, Cardin was sent crashing to the ground by giving Velvet's foot a face high five. Instead of getting right back up, Cardin propped himself up on his elbows and watched as the giant rabbit faunus giggled as his expense. A part of him felt angry, but the more rational part of his mind felt terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelvet saw her pray wasn't attempting to escape again and took this as her que to move things along. She knelt down to her 'bug' of a bully and asked him with hard eyes, \"Are you going to try and escape again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took everything he had not to piss his pants. \"N-no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" Velvet smiled. \"If you did I would've caught you, you know. You wouldn't want that because at your size you look mighty tasty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin blanched when he heard that. He didn't want to become some rabbit's dinner. \"P-please don't eat me! I'm sorry, okay?! I am so, so sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's really sweet and mature of you to apologize, Cardin. It's just a shame I don't forgive you.\" Velvet answered. She really didn't either. He could apologize from now until she graduated from the academy and she still wouldn't accept his apology. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin felt his heart sink. \"Please just let me go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you let me go when you pulled my ears at the cafeteria or when I tried to walk away when you hurled slurs my way?\" Velvet said with righteous anger boiling to the surface. \"No you didn't! You treat others how you want to be treated and it's high time I taught you your actions have consequences!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelvet took a seat in front of Cardin. A simple action for her that caused a miniature earthquake for him. His eyes soon went wide when the giantess extended her foot towards him. Was she going to crush him flat?! The smaller boy began to whimper but stopped when he soon realized that wasn't the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ever since you arrived here in Beacon Academy you've gone out of your way to target me and make me feel lessor. Well it's my turn to feel superior and for you to feel lessor. You, Cardin Winchester, are going to massage my feet. Today you are not a huntsman in training or even a human being. Today you are a 'toy' and nothing more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin's mind could barely process what was happening now. Velvet just told him he was a toy and he was to massage her feet. What?! She couldn't be serious, right? He looked at the massive foot and toes presented before him and winced. She'd flatten him. He needed to get away, but all his attempts so far have been futile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what I-if I refuse?\" he dared to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have a choice!\" Velvet said firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now bow and get to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Knowing there was nothing he could do at the moment, Cardin bowed his head and complied. This seemed to appease the giant rabbit faunus and she eagerly awaited for her bully to service her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orange-haired could feel his fear and nervousness rise to an all time high as he cautiously made his way closer to Velvet's giant digits. They were slightly taller than he was and the sight truly put into perspective how small he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please do hurry up Cardin, you wouldn't want me to get bored.\" Velvet lightly threatened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin got the message loud and clear. The giant toes of the vengeful huntress in training began to scrunch, signaling him to get a move on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader of team CRDL did just that and carefully put hand to Velvet's big toe. Surprisingly enough her skin was silky smooth and ridiculously soft. The only thing that ruined the rather bizarre moment was the smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelvet's foot had the distinct stench of sweat and coconut lotion. If she were still her old 5'6\" self then the smell wouldn't have even been noticeable. But at her new stature then odor merely grew in strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin hated it, but chose not to comment out of fear of being punished. Honestly, being in rabbit's presence now reminded him of the time he and his team got on professor Goodwitch's bad side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to make situation any worse, the average sized teen got to work massage the toe. Again, the skin was surprisingly soft against his own. That coconut lotion stuff must be something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelvet on her part hummed in amusement. She could just barely feel Cardin's tiny hands against her toe. She was far too big for him to really do anything, but it was the dominance she held over him that mattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is pathetic.\" Velvet teased with mock annoyance. \"I can barely feel your hands again my skin. Press harder before I decide to just crush you outright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reaction was instantaneous as her fellow academy student began to press harder. Surprisingly enough she actually began to feel it. Perhaps he just need a good threat to make him work harder? Why he hadn't earlier baffled her. Her did have muscles after all. Her was literally built like a brick-shithouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile down below Cardin was massaging like his life depended on it. In a way it kind of did. He'd never given a massage before, let alone to girl the side of a small mountain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed to press harder, squeeze harder. If she didn't feel him working hard then she'd know he was half-assing the job. And that meant nothing good for him. How could he have let himself be reduced to a mere foot servant? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis father would be so disappointed in him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Faster.\" Velvet ordered. She was actually starting to enjoy this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Cardin seethed under his breath and worked his hands fasters. Thank goodness he had enough speed to go along with his strength. It's what made him a good Beacon candidate. He never once thought that speed and strength would be used to massage a vengeful giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began working his way around the toe and in between the big and second. As he did the smell grew stronger. It made him want to gag. It reminded him of the time Dove tried to cook for the team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good god! Doesn't she know how to wash her foot!\" Cardin said without thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh... oh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard that, Cardin!\" Velvet growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin's eyes widened as he looked up to meet the angry giant's glare. Those chocolate brown eyes burned like an inferno that threatened to swallow him whole. How on earth had she... oh, right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn rabbit ears.\" he whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelvet was practically snarling now.  This kind of disrespect would not stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They might've been friends but he wasn't Cardin's keeper. \"What? He owe you money or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. He just left this morning and didn't say where he was headed off to.\" Russel explained. It was strange, Cardin always told them where he was headed off too, and sometimes he even invited them to tag along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you mention it. That is wired.\" Dove said as he looked away from his scroll. Currently the group of three where just lounging around in the school's courtyard. Normally they'd be in town or ribbing a few of the other students, but without their leader they just seemed a bit lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you tried calling him?\" Sky asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did, but it went tight to voice mail.\" Russel replied.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At an abandoned laboratory complex, Team JNPR was on a scout mission to see if there was anything that in the area that would be worthy to report. So far, other than either trying to sneak around or taking out some random Grimm that were wandering near the area it was a fairly quiet mission. At the moment Nora was checking another area by herself while humming a tune along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she arrived at a very open room filled with different slightly dust covered computers and some exposed wires. Overall it was surprisingly intact as Nora wandered around the area before randomly flipped a switch not realizing that there was some power left causing the room to light up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in the center of the room was a podium with a massive machine that honestly looked like a giant ray gun with multiple wires and pipes connected into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora then walked up to the podium and looked at the machine in wonder, \"What the heck is that thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she stares at the \"Ray Gun\" a portion of the ceiling gave way and managed to hit some controls that connected to the machine causing some steam and other sounds to emit from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Nora could react, the machine paints a small red laser light into her chest momentarily confusing her before it suddenly lets out an electric beam hitting her in the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, due to Nora's Semblance, she could've easily absorbed the electric energy and use it to enhance her strength. But this time though, the machine somehow caused Nora to shake uncontrollably as the energy coursed into her body before the old machine overloaded and explodes causing Nora to be thrown onto her back and lose her weapon, Magnhild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDazed, Nora slowly sat back up while not noticing her body was covered in electrical arcs from the beam. Unknown to her though, the machine had made an unexpected change to her Semblance where instead of enhancing her strength, it instead spread throughout her body causing Nora to gain an increase to her height initially but also absorb her now malfunctioning Scroll's energy giving Nora another two more inches resulting in her height going from originally 5'1\" to now 5'3\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she opened her eyes, the arcs had disappeared and only tiny remnant lights from the beam fell from her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh! Sparkly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLess than a few seconds later, the rest of her concerned Team burst into the room after hearing the explosion and immediately bombarded Nora with questions before she simply waved them off and answered to reassure them, \"Relax~! It was just some electric beam thingy. My Semblance can absorb an electric current and make me stronger so it's nothing it can't handle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs J(N)PR glance at what remained of the machine and back at her, they all collectively sighed before Jaune said, \"...Alright, we get it but try to be more careful the next time we go out on a mission. Okay, Nora?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora simply grinned as she gives a mock salute, \"Aye aye fearless leader!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of her Team chuckled (a small smile and shaking his head in Ren's case) while Nora retrieved her weapon before Pyrrha commented that it looked like the room they are in was the only one left, meaning that they had likely finished exploring everything in the abandoned complex and that they should return to Beacon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone agreed but before they left the room Ren thought he noticed something was off about Nora, \"Nora?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Ren?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure if I'm wrong but, do you... look different?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat question caused Jaune and Pyrrha to examine their orange hair team member as she checks herself and...</span></div></div>",

And that\u2019s where Neo, and more specifically her semblance, came in. Roman had tasked her with using her illusion-based semblance to alter her appearance so she could get inside this estate during one of their wealthy get togethers, so she could get information on the place. Neo had considered her options, and having no idea who was attending this party to assume their identity, she figured her best approach would be to attempt to get in using other methods. As Roman had told her, the usual bodyguard was a guy, so Neo decided upon using the art of seduction. However, being mute herself, Neo has to rely on body language, something that could be easily accomplished using her semblance. She got up and stood in front of the slightly cracked mirrior.

But when the package arrived, and Weiss took out a small vial of dust, Ruby playfully snatched it up. Weiss tried to catch her, but Ruby was always one step ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious, that dust vial is incredibly expensive! Not to mention crucial for my project.\"<br>\r\n\"Wait what?!\" Blake was startled out of her book when she learned their young leader was carrying something deadly. \"Ruby, give it back to Weiss right now!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh relax, kitten,\" Yang said, eating a bag of popcorn on Blake's top bunk, \"Ruby's just having fun! Plus, it's a pretty good show.\" Yang laughed and pointed at Weiss' tripping over a chair. \"See!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock on the door caught the red girl's attention, giving Weiss a chance to tackle her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jaune and Pyrrah walked in, their first view was Weiss flopping on Ruby as the bumblebees watched.<br>\r\n\"Uh... hi.\" Jaune said, very confused, \"we'll just come back another time. Just wanted to offer all of us walking together to the Vytal festival, but you look busy so another time maybe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Blake, isn't it ironic how you're not the one CAT fighting right now?\" Blake slapped the grin off of Yang's cocky face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss was desperate at this point to take back the dust Ruby refused to let go of. This dust was the key to fufilling her lifelong dreams, and Ruby wasn't going to ruin it. Weiss opened her mouth, and brought her teeth down into Ruby's arm.<br>\r\n\"Ow ow ow ow, no biting! No fair!\" Ruby's arm jerked upward from the pain and let go of the vial. The whole of Team RWBY watched as it crashed and broke, the dust filling the whole room. Weiss was wide mouthed as one of the only vials of that dust in existance was coughed up and sneezed out by the whole team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruby! Look what you did! You broke it!\" Weiss was furious.<br>\r\n\"Me!? You're the one who bit me!\"<br>\r\n\"Well maybe if you hadn't stolen my special dust formula I wouldn't have NEEDED to bite you!<br>\r\n\"Yeah? Well-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys!\" Blake interrupted their fight with a stern tone, \"Weiss, what was the dust we all just breathed in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The dust? Oh it was just specially modified crop growth dust.\" Weiss said calmly, letting herself rest up before her next tyrade at Ruby. <br>\r\n\"Why did you need farmer's dust?\" Yang asked, patting some off of her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss blushed at the question. \"Um...\" Weiss was always jealous of everyone always being taller than her, even her child-like leader, so she commisioned a modification on a growth dust to work on people. But Weiss didn't want a few extra inches, she wanted so much more, she wanted to tower over everyone. But she was too embarrased to admit it. So she lied. \"I was going to start growing, uh, cherries?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will it hurt us?\" Ruby asked, picking up the broken glass off the floor.\"<br>\r\n\"Not as much as I'll hurt you, dolt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, guys, calm down. Let's just blow off steam at the Vytal festival,\" Yang said, keeping the peace for once, \"We can meet up with JNPR there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. But I'm still mad at you.\" Weiss poked her finger into Ruby's chest, emphasising her point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all grabbed their things and left, Ruby trying to stay as far from Weiss as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss was sad to see one of her vials break, but was relieved to see no one injesting it directly, assuming just breathing it in wouldn't do much at all.<br>\r\nShe was wrong, and she'll find out soon enough that the growth dust is in all of their systems. But when will it all kick in?</div></span></div></div>",

She was still upset with Ruby for breaking her growth dust and new it was going to be a pain to secure some more but at least nothing happened with the current supply. Maybe it wasn't meant to work on people at all and this was just a waste of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked ahead at her team and felt something was...odd...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang had begun to move her shoulders around a bit as though she felt some kind of discomfort, Blake was tugging at her neck wear trying to be nonchalant about it but was clearly feeling it was a bit tight, and Ruby kept pulling on her skirt as if it had ridden up. Weiss shook her head and believed she was just imagining it, fueled by her desire for growth, until she herself felt a bit tight in the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Weiss? You okay?\" Yang turned around to see if she was still following the group and noticed a hint of horror in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, I'm fine. Just thinking about how mad I am.\" This was only half true but it got the group to roll their eyes and keep walking. Weiss was concerned that the dust HAD worked and really hoped that this was the extent of what would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the girls arrived at the Festival, Weiss estimated that each girl had grown an inch and a half and filled out their uniforms a little more than what they could hold as Yang asked Ruby to help her with something in the restroom, the latter followed her whilst holding down her dress forcefully, while Blake seemed to have torn the collar at this point to not drive herself mad clawing at it. Meanwhile, Weiss herself felt her breasts pressing against the fabric of her dress trying to escape.<br>\r\nNone of them seemed to have noticed anything was weird as far as she could tell. Maybe her team really was that dense.<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nAs Ruby and Yang entered the restroom the blonde furiously began pulling off her jacket and shirt, startling her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yang, what are you doing?!\" She looked around the empty room for peeping toms and the like, not that Yang cared at the moment as she was in a lot of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just help your sister with her Bra. I dunno what happened, it must have tightened or something cause they are squeezing my babies way way to hard.\" Ignoring the weirdness of what she said, Ruby carefully undid the bra and-<br>\r\n<i>crack</i><br>\r\nApparently there was a lot under pressure. The Bra, as it was unhooked, flung itself at high speeds towards the mirror breaking it. Yang's \"Babies\" fell out and and hung there. While she felt much better, both sisters were staring at the broken glass and projectile bra that had broken it with a mixture of emotions.<br>\r\n\"I didn't realize I had gotten so big...\" Yang hefted a breast in each hand, the soft flesh spilling over her fingers.<br>\r\nIn the silence, there was another noise, though this was more of a ripping and tearing sound, as Ruby's leggings began to fail. The soft curves of her legs had begun to strain against the fabric before her thighs snapped the tops. After the moment passed, each girl looked at each other extremely confused.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then it began...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby felt her body tremble as the sound of her clothes straining and tearing began again with a vengeance. Her legs began to stretch up and up, her thighs filling out more and more. Her chest forced its way out of her top, shooting buttons into the mirror with a similar crack to Yang's bra. Each of her breasts began to form out, bigger and softer with each passing second. By the time her head hit the ceiling, she was already sporting a set of G-Cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yang watched in horror, a similar sensation filled her body as she began to grow out of her clothes. Her breasts began to swell past Ruby's new assets into J-Cups, her hips began to break free from the confines of her pants as she grew bigger and bigger. The two growing girls were taking up nearly all the space and their growth didn't seem to be stopping anytime soon...<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nOutside, Weiss began to notice Blake started to breathe funny. With each breath, she seemed to swell up and up and up. Her breasts began to tear open her shirt as she herself seemed to rise up into the air. People began to take notice as this girl started to literally GROW right in front of them. After a second, her breasts exploded out, revealing two very perky DD-Cups. But it didn't stop there. Soon they were E, F, G-Cups. She was rising up above the Festival Stands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Weiss watched this, she didn't quite realize her body was doing the same until she felt her necklace pop from the pressure. Her own cleavage had expanded out and was filling out to F-Cups. She felt a mix of embarrassment that she was exposed, jealousy that Blake was still bigger than her, and fear that this was now going to get out of hand. As her clothes began to shred more and more she heard a noise from the restroom. The sound of bricks starting to crumble as a 13-Foot Ruby followed by a 15-Foot Yang burst out of the roof. The two began looking around as the rose higher and higher, Weiss keeping pace but still behind by about a foot. Eventually the team stopped growing at around 25-Feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang's Milk-Tanks were now the size of literal Milk-Tanks.<br>\r\nRuby had gained a nice, firm butt with killer thighs that could crush a man.<br>\r\nBlake wound up with an hour-glass body with not too much on either end to out-do the other, but enough to turn heads from both interested parties.<br>\r\nWeiss found herself with a New set of Breasts that filled out her frame nicely and long legs to die for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone who wasn't petrified in fear or taking risque photos were running for their lives. As the girls looked around, the RBY of team RWBY realized that Weiss' Dust must have done this and Weiss realizes she might be in trouble...however...</span></div></div>",

Thankfully Ruby noticed this and offer to lend Weiss a hand stating that the two should work out together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How exactly?\" Weiss asked still a bit puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Ruby paused as she scanned the area around the two of them.</span></div></div>",

A brave, strong, disciplined, sophisticated woman. She had slipped away from the bonds of their father, and managed to forge her own path with the Atlesian military, regardless of their father's wishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinter was all Weiss wanted to be, so whenever Winter had free time the heiress would take every opportunity to spend it with her. That included training, her sister was responsible for building the foundations of what would become her fighting style, teaching her in the craft of their family's hereditary semblance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss loved her sister dearly, ever thankful for all she had done for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you dare stop now you daintly little girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...That is not to say that sometimes her sister didn't make it easy sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heiress watched as the ground grew close and furthered away, only to grow close once again. Breathing with effort as she pushed her arms up and down. Weiss sincerely hated physical training, but she knew it was vital for any Huntsman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss was sure Winter was currently channeling all that experience from the training she recieved at the military academy at Atlas. The same type drill Sergeants subjugated the students to. Winter watched her with a heavy critical gaze, donning a military white coat, arms crossed behind her back, as Weiss continued with the pushups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heiress was currently wearing not her usual white dress, but white yoga pants along with a white sports braw, her body sweat until there was a small puddle under her face, her arms were starting to protest in agony. She had lost count how many she had done so far, well, she did not count at all to begin with. Winter had not set a required number of pushups, she had just ordered her to do them until she said it was enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Winter finally decided to be merciful. \"That's enough, take five\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss collapsed on the ground, gasping for breath. To merely remain still for a moment was a blessing after this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinter harrumphed in disappointment. \"Your physical fitness leaves much to be desired, Weiss\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heiress managed to find the strength to sit down. \"I'm not a physical fighter like Yang... I'm built for agility and casting\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both which means nothing if your body can't handle the pressure of combat\" Her sister repriminded. \"You need to build up your stamina and body strength, develop those paltry muscles of yours\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss didn't dare roll her eyes, but she definitely wanted too. \"I'm not sure I want muscles\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whether you want them or not is irrelevant. You need to be in better shape\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I'm the type to build that type of body anyway\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinter's eyes narrowed, making Weiss wince, thinking she had said something wrong. \"Not the type huh? Then by that logic neither should I be\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Weiss' eyes, Winter began removing the upper parts of her attire. Her younger sister could see a black sports bra as she unbotted the coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt soom came off, leaving Weiss gawking.</span></div></div>",

But at the sight of her sister's body there was only one word that came to mind (one that Yang herself would use no doubt)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinter was <i>ripped</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her military coat off, and left in a simple black sports bra that hung tight around her chest, along with strentched yoga pants, Winter's oustandingly developed body was in full display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer forarms were corded and thick, leading the way to bulging inches of unflexed biceps and protounding triceps. Her deltoids were large balls of flesh split into the different muscle groups in a noticeable way. Her torso managed to blend perfectly a curved womanly figure while possessing a wide musculature, Six abdominal muscles of amazing definition, and several visible muscle groups around them, protected her stomach like a steadfast shield. Where her abdomen ended and her upper body started, her lats flared somewhat with her arms relaxed at the side, her prodigious chest (something which Weiss has always been secretely jealous of) was supported by two thick pecturals, corded muscles with shredded definition in the middle.Though her legs remained hidden, the yoga pants did little to conceal their size. Wide thighs and diamond carved calves filled out the fabric and pushed it to its limits, her rear standing out nicely due to the iron-like glutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinter took a deep breath, and brought her fists closed to her hips. Her lats spreading as her chest heaved, her abs tightening as she flexed her upper body. Her biceps bulged a few inches foward, the skin tightened to show off greater definition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss simply had her breath stolen. She had never imagined her sister could look like... this. There was no sense of grotesque at her figure, no manliness about it. Winter blended feminity and raw strength, granting her still an air of elegance and authority about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I adquired this body through my own efforts, do you consider still consider the task of building up yours impossible?\" She asked and without waiting for an answer continued. \"Or is it that you see a woman with this physique to be an embarrasment? Foolish notions of society, my body has nothing to do with appereances, I honed my muscles to serve me better on the field\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No no it's nothing like that!\" Weiss vehemently denied, though secretely she had been worried about appereances, something she didn't dare confess to her sister. \"I'm just... surprised. You look so... so strong\" Those were the only words that came to mind, she didn't know what to say. Compliment her sister on her figure? Say how amazing she looked like that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss could admit that, yes, her sister looked <i>incredible</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A strong body for a strong mind. Here\" To the heiress' surprise, her elder sister grabbed a hold of her hand and placed it on her abdominals. \"Feel this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Winter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're sisters, there's nothing to be ashamed of. Do you feel how hard my abs are?\" Winter let Weiss press her hand on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her fingertips hesitantly touched the bags of muscles, growing more and more bold as they fulley reached out to feel, yes, Weiss felt how amazingly hard they felt underneath her sister's flawless skin. It felt... good. She blushed in embarresment, and something else she couldn't fully describe. But touching Winter's muscles felt... intriguing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now feel this\" Winter bent to the side and her up her bicep, flexing it with all her strength, forcing the muscle to rise and tighten. Her skin showed flawless definition as Weiss saw a few veins rising along the length, continuing forth all the way to her forarms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss slowly reached foward with both her hands this time, feeling the mound of flesh of the bicep while her other hand cupped the tricept, her palms tenderly running over the hard flesh. The sheer strenght in that muscle, the hardness, the... the beauty. Yes, Weiss realized as the heat gathered in her cheeks and she let out a nearly silent but shaky breath, Winter was beautiful. Her amazonian body was making her feel things she had not experienced before, perhaps things one should not feel for a sibling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved her lips to utter one simple question, a desire that was steadily building up strength inside of her that she just needed to satiate.</span></div></div>",
