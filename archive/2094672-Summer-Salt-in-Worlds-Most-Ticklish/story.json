She knew that a loss meant a tickling punishment from the victor and a push down in the ranking of the tourney. She knew know that all sorts of costumed and non-costumed characters: heroes, villains, no-names, rogues, and other miscreants from across the town and the country had come to win the nondescript Grand Prize, which she just had to have to aid her in her adventures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the contestants had specific themes, some were vageuly supernatural, and many she had even encountered before on an investigation or a case. By now Summer Salt had picked up some context on how to wrestle or dodge in a tickling match, and how to use different tools (though she'd pretty much learned that in her previous mishaps). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went up to the entry desk and told them to enter her name in the tourney. The woman there gave her a list of other eager participants to choose from for opponents. The other players each looked threatening in their own way, and many had a theme or a motif which they based their tickling around. Summer had decided by now that she would be entering as a snoop styled contestant who made the most out of whatever she was given. She then took a look at the four contestants she was provided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was<br>\r\nConnie, a maid themed villainess who utilized feather dusters, soap and brushes, and other cleaning equipment to wipe the mat with other contestants<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErick- a teenage magician who might just have more than parlor tricks up his sleeve (uses innocuous or not so innocuous magic)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley- a peppy, bratty, acrobatic cheerleader who goes to Summer's rival high school. She entered the contest to tickle others and boost her own ego. Ashley uses pom-poms, her pink hairbrush, and her own dextrous strength<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKusu- a ninja in training who has helped Summer on previous adventures, can be good or an antagonist, uses tickling shuriken, calligraphy tools, and martial arts<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer chooses to fight...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her small skirt and colourful cropped top left a ton of pale ticklish skin out in the open, and although the pom poms she held looked mighty tickly, Summer felt pretty confident she could get the jump on her if she played her cards right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young detectives eyes moved onwards down the list until she came again to Kusu. Her and the ninja-in-training had been spending a lot of time together recently on various adventures and as such Summer had gotten to see how she worked first hand. Kusu was a fairly impressive pupil of the martial arts and was learning fast, but Summer had noticed on many occasions just a few slips in her training that left her vulnerable, and had seen just how ticklish the ninja really was when she let her guard down. It would be risky, but in Summer's mind it was a done deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer motioned to Mouse and the two walked toward the entry desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've decided I'm going to challenge Ashley and Kusu with the help of my sister here.\" declared Summer to the woman behind the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent,\" she replied, \"Your match will begin in 30 minutes.\"</span></div></div>",

They hadn't really thought ahead to bring weapons, but Summer did find a feather for herself and a hair brush which she gave to Mouse, as well as some rope she thought might come in handy. As they walked out towards the center of the stadium, they saw their opponents enter from the opposite door. Summer eyed Ashley's pale exposed midriff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You rush the cheerleader,\" Summer said to Mouse under her breath, \"get under her arms and go for that bellybutton. I'll distract Kusu.\" Mouse nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two pairs reached the center of the arena, stopping only 10 paces away from each other. The crowd cheered enthusiastically from all around them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kusu.\" greeted Summer jeeringly. Kusu didn't reply, but just kept staring directly into Summers eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CONTESTANTS AT THE READY\" boomed a voice over the PA.

Just as she reached the ninja, Kusu dropped in an instant, kicking Summers legs out from under her and causing her the fall flat on her chest. Before she could even realize what had happened, Summer felt the weight of the ninja appear on her back. Kusu looked down at her now pinned victim and noticed the rope tied through Summers belt loop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, this is too easy.\" muttered the ninja, quickly unravelling the rope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe expertly went to work and within an instant had hogtied the detective. As Summer felt the binds tighten around her limbs, her stomach dropped. How had she been so stupid as to bring that rope with her? What did she think was going to happen? She then felt her sneakers being slowly removed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse really wasn't doing any better. She had followed her sisters advise, lunging towards that very ticklish looking midriff, but it was immediately apparent this was just what the cheerleader wanted. The moment Mouses hands grazed her sides, Ashley slammed her own arms down, immobilizing her limbs. The cheerleader then quickly fell backwards, using her strong legs to kick Mouse up into the air and slam her down on her back. Mouse was stunned and for a moment could only blink at the ceiling, a moment Ashley used to twist around and sit on Mouse's waist with her powerful legs pinning down her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what do we have here?\" teased Ashley, her voice high pitched and full of glee, \"Have I managed to pin a ticklish little Salt sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then both sisters realized just what they were in for. They knew that if they gave now, they'd face ticklish torment at the hands of the victors and would lose out on a vital clue to one of their adventures. But perhaps if they held out for just a bit, they could find a way out of this and turn the match around. Neither option sounded ideal, but they had to choose.</span></div></div>",

Ticklish signals immediately began to flood into her brain, causing giggles to pour out of her mouth and making it extremely difficult to concentrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehehehehehehehehehehehhe NO nononononoonononononono\" Summer giggled, her foot twitching rapidly against the ninjas soft fingers. The light teasing tickles flowed along the length of her foot and started to creep up towards the base of her toes. <i>This is not looking good,</i> she managed to think over the sound of her own laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Mouse was experiencing a similar situation, pulling her arms as hard as she could against the cheerleaders legs but to know avail. Ashley was starting to roll up Mouse's shirt to just under her bra, revealing a smooth pale tummy of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if you want to tickle my tummy so bad, why don't you try it yourself first.\" said the cheerleader in a sing-song tone, simultaneously reaching behind her and pulling out her pom poms. \"I bet you'll love it! I know I do\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking with dread at those soft frilly pom poms, Mouse struggled harder than ever, trying to buck her hips to throw her off, but the girl was surprisingly sturdy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhhhhhhhhhh little Mouse,\" cooed the girl, \"Just stay still while I tease your little tummy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley then slowly descended her poms on Mouse's belly, dragging them slowly in little circles. It was extremely ticklish for little Mouse and she immediately lost control of her giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehehehehehehhehehehehehehehe stohohohohohohohohohohohp iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit\" Mouse begged as each little fibre of the poms caressed her smooth stomach, sending shocks that made her arch her back and rock on her shoulders against the ground. Ashley took great pleasure in watching the squirming mess underneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwwww you're so cute!\" she teased, \"Coochie coochie cooo! Who has a ticklish little belly?\" She then began the shake her poms, causing them to dance across every square inch of the exposed tummy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EEEEEEEE NOOOOOOOOOOOOO NONONONONONONO\" squealed Mouse as the poms picked up their pace. Her extremely sensitive stomach was being stimulated by the little fibres in ways she could not have imagined. It was as if each was a soft little finger with a mind of it's own, searching out and exploiting every ticklish inch of skin on her slightly chubby belly. Some would even glance inside the rim of her bellybutton, eliciting a huge response from the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my my,\" said the cheerleader, slightly slowing the dance of the ticklish poms, \"It looks like someone has a tickly bellybutton!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hehehehehehehehehehe nononono hahahaha pleeeeeeease nooooohehehehehe\" was all Mouse could manage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no amount of begging could stop the cheerleader. She slowly set one pom aside and began lightly spidering her fingers around in a spiral surrounding Mouse's helpless navel. Mouse started outright laughing at the new addition of ticklish sensations, pulling desperately with her arms as her tormenters fingers circled the deathly ticklish hole and the soft electric pom wandered up and over the top of her belly, just underneath her bra. She clenched her eyes shut as she felt the digits drag closer and closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here it comes little Mousey,\" teased her tormenter, \"I'm going to get that bellybutton!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse almost couldn't handle the tension. She considered crying for uncle, even if it were just for a momentary break, when of a sudden all the ticklish sensations were gone. A few residual giggles fell out of her lips, but the touch of the fingers and the pom pom had vanished. Mouse was just about to open her eyes to investigate, when she suddenly felt Ashley's index finger plunge into her bellybutton, followed by the cheerleaders left hand pinching in between her ticklish ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAANONONONONONONONOHEHEHEH EHEHE\" screamed Mouse at the surprise. She was violently shaking her body as hard as she could under the weight of her tormenter. She could feel the finger twisting and vibrating inside her sensitive navel, shooting waves of ticklish energy throughout her body. Mouse didn't know how much longer she could take of this.</span></div></div>",

Kusu was now digging between each of Summer's toes, eliciting huge belly laughs from the detective, while Ashley was going to town on Mouse's belly, constantly switching between tickling the edges of her stomach and exploring her navel with her finger. Nevertheless, neither Salt sister had any intentions of quitting. They had held out in ticklish situations before and they could do it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that doesn't mean it was going to be easy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOOOOHMYYYYYYGOOOOOOOODHAHHAAHAHAHAHAH\" screamed Mouse, the cheerleader now pinching her hips while she spidered her fingers along the expanse of smooth tummy infront of her. The ticklish sensations swirling around her belly flooded the young detectives mind, her laughter reaching new heights. Each pinch to her hips sent a jolt of ticklish electricity through her spine, while each trace of Ashley's fingers on her midriff sent spasms through her tummy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, it was at this moment that Mouse managed to catch a break. Whether it was by innate training or dumb luck, the petite girl managed to buck her hips so hard underneath her opponent, that the cheerleader was knocked off balance. The girl fell forward and had to hold out her arms to avoid falling directly onto Mouse. With the intense tummy tickling temporarily suspended, Mouses head cleared long enough to see the opportunity she had been presented with. In one smooth motion, she pulled her arms from underneath the cheerleaders thighs and plunged them right into the exposed armpits before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EEEEEEEEEEEEEK\" squealed Ashley, clearly surprised that Mouse had managed to find a way to fight back. Mouse had no intentions of waisting this surprise either,  as she began tickling the cheerleader with animal-like ferocity, rapidly switching from scribbling her fingers in her smooth shallow armpits to pinching up and down her exposed sides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahahahehehehehehehehehnoohohohohehehehehe\" Ashley giggled. The surprise onslaught had made the girl retract her arms to her sides, causing her to lose her balance and, with some help from a struggling Mouse, topple over sideways, releasing the young detective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving a quick look around, Mouse saw she had a choice to make. Should she help her struggling sister, who was now crying laughing as Kusu scribbled her fingers all over her soles, or should she double down on Ashley while she had the chance?</span></div></div>",

But if she tried to save her she would have to give up her shot at taking Ashley out and its not like she would be able to undo the skilled tie that Kusu had placed Summer in before Ashley recovered. Mouse flipped herself onto Ashley, forcing her arms above her head then pinning them with her legs at the elbow, allowing Ashley to only move her arms at the elbow up. She planted herself at the top of Ashley's chest facing her stomach so that now Ashley couldn't repeat the trick Mouse had used to free herself. She smiled to herself and taunted at the still stunned Ashely, \"I bet I'll love tickling your stomach just as much! thanks for the suggestion.\" while she positioned her self to have her face directly over Ashley's still heaving stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wish I had my inks right now...\" Kusu mumbled to her self as she shifted on Summers back. \"I know... I'll just ghost write on them!\" Kusu said with an oddly peppy tone as a hand grabbed onto Summers ankle, \"Keep still Summer, I'd hate to have to start all over again!\". Summer took the moment of peace to brace herself against the inevitable tickling on the foot that Kusu had grabbed when suddenly Kusu changed which foot she was holding and began furiously writing on it, completely catching Summer off guard and making her practically yell out, \"Ku- Nahh! Ch-e-ater! Ah-hehheheh!\". \"Stop yelling so loudly, you knocked me off focus!\" Kusu tutted as she started her writing at the top of Summers foot again. \"Plleasss-ah Ku, Not a brush- hahaha\" Summer giggled out as she tried to work against her bodies demand to buck her feet away from the ticklish brush. \"One last flick there, anndd...\" Kusu let go of Summers foot and leaned back, \"Perfect! Now, what else to do..\" Kusu giggled as she gently spidered her fingers across the flat of Summer's foot, preventing her from getting a break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"lelelelele!\" Mouse voiced out loud as she swirled her tounge in the bucking Ashley's navel while also sliding her nails up and down Ashley's ribs, occasionally stopping to pinch them. Ashley was hopelessly attempting to buck her stomach away from Mouse's experienced tickling and ever present tounge, kicking out her unpinned legs instead when that turned out to be hopeless. \"Off- My- Stomach! Kusu! hahaha... Kusu get over! ha...\" Ashley struggled out from the constant tickling, but Kusu was hyper focused on taunting Summer and seemed to not even hear her. Mouse slowed down till eventually she was just teasing around Ashley's belly button with the tips of her fingers, she leaned back and examined Ashley for where to attack next, before pulling her top back so she had access to her ribs and taunting, \"I hope your ribs aren't any more ticklish then your stomach Ashley!\" which got a even more desperate, \"Kusu! Get the hell over here!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mouse was getting ready to attack her exposed weakpoint Ashley realized that Mouses feet were in range of what little her arms could move and she could attack, hopefully allowing her to escape.

However, out of the corner of her eye, Mouse saw that the shuriken that had glanced off her bra had fell at her feet only a small distance away. If she were able to get it, maybe its intense tickling powers were enough to subdue Ashley. She would have to act fast, as she knew that is Ashley got to her belly again, she wouldn't be able to hold out for long.</span></div></div>",
