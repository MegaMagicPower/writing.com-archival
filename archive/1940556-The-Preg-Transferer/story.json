It was a good, perfect beautiful day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Brandon drove back to his home where he was staying for the summer, with his parents, he wondered if life could get any better.<br>\r\nWhat Brandon should have been wondering is if life could have gotten any weirder, and the answer to that, is about to be a resounding yes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon Page was twenty two, finishing up college going for his degree in engineering. He loved it, building things, designing things, watching them take shape and stability. It gave him a thrill he couldn't even describe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stopped at the stop sign, flicking his turn signal to left, to head home like he's done a dozen times before during this summer back in his home town of Smallton, he noticed a large sign hanging from the stop sign: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGARAGE SALE. THE STRANGE AND MYSTERIOUS! TURN RIGHT.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, what the hell\" Brandon thought to himself, turning the turn signal to the right instead of left, and executing the turn.<br>\r\nHe drove down the road a little bit, music blaring on the radio, as he saw the sign that read \"GARAGE SALE. HERE!\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned into the driveway, and was surprised to see a large number of people parked in front of what appeared to be a large plantation style house, which was odd since no houses like that existed in Smallton to his knowledge. Parking his car, he got out and surveyed the scene, with dozens of long wooden tables laid out of the fresh green yard of the house, scattered with bizarre looking objects. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon moved amongst the crowd, looking at some of the strange objects on the table before him: Odd sinsister looking dummies, a monkey 's paw, odd books with titles like \"Easy Spells 4 You\", \"Life Changing Spells\" amongst other things. A large wooden box with no seems with what appeared to be Hebrew written on it, a map to a mysterious \"Lost Island\" in the middle of the pacific, a small hand mirror with the words \"True Beauty Is Within\" engraved on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't mystical. It was all junk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Brandon looked over the items, he was approached by a tall, gaunt, pale man, wearing a long black trench coat, a large black fedora, long black pants, and slick black shoes. Underneath the black trench coat, Brandon could see a thin black T-Shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings. Welcome to my Garage Sale. I am Yaral. I have just moved here and am selling my things. Would you like to purchase my things?\" Yaral said, his speaking manner was off, almost like someone was learning to speak it for the first time, slow and methodical. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hi. I'm Brandon. Nice to meet you. I didn't know anyone lived down this way. I've lived in Smallton almost my whole life, and usually it's just a long forest path down here.\" Brandon said, looking over the stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have just moved here, including my house. I have purchased this land and now I am selling my things to pay for it. Would you like to purchase my things?\" Yaral said again in his strange manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what have you got?\" Brandon says, looking back over the strange objects. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have things for the darkest corners of the Earth, where man and woman alike fear to step foot. Places where magics and monster still thrive  in your - - - I mean our - - world. \" Yaral said. Brandon noticed that ever since he had started talking to Yaral, Yaral hadn't blinked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh. Well, I'll just look around some more\" Brandon said. He poured over the tables while Yaral seemed to be watching him. On the table he saw a camera that supposedly saw the future, a \"wishing stone\", and some strange coin with two pregnant people on the front of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip Me Brandon</span> a strange voice seemed to command Brandon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon picked up the coin, looked at it, gave it a flip, and looked at some random passerby at the garage sale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Buy Me Brandon</span> a strange voice told him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meh\" Brandon said putting the coin back on the table, and continued to look. Moments later, he was bumped into by someone who ran past him, holding their mouth, looking like they were about to be sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonder what's there problem?\" Brandon asked looking at the person who just ran past, before picking up some strange round amulet. <br>\r\n\"Ah, an excellent choice.\" Yaral said to Brandon. <br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Brandon asked looking at the amulet. It was round with six round stones dotting along the edges of the amulet. Below each stone  were the numbers 1 through 9. In the middle of the stones was a giant \"X\" that looked like it could be pressed. The top stone was odd. Half of it was colored blue, the other half was colored pink, and had the number 8 light up under the stone. <br>\r\n\"This was supposedly a device that when used allowed a person to transfer a pregnancy from one person to another.\" Yaral explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From one person to another? You mean from one woman to another.\" Brandon said, correcting Yaral's mistake. <br>\r\n\"No. From one person to another, male or female.\" Yaral corrected Brandon's corrected. <br>\r\n\"Oh come on.\" Brandon said, disbelief in his voice. <br>\r\n\"You doubt this item? This item has a long history. Supposedly it was old when the world was young, it was used by those who possessed it to ease the burden of child-bearing. A husband could carry the child for his wife, or a mother for her daughter. It could be used to take a pregnancy away from a tavern wench who was bearing a royal heir and transfer it to another woman. Supposedly when the pregnancy is transferred, whomever it is transferred into, that child becomes there, in blood and in spirt. \" Yaral explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does it work?\" Brandon asked, his curiosity peaked. He's never heard of anything like this.<br>\r\n\"I do not know. When I found it, it hadn't been used in ages. But as you see here, it looks like there are two children waiting for a new home\" Yaral said, pointing at the pink/blue stone with his overly long, thin, boney finger. <br>\r\n\"How is that even possible?\" Brandon asked looking at the stone. <br>\r\n\"They say once a pregnancy is taken from one, it awaits here in these stones, perfectly safe, waiting to be put into someone.\" Yaral said.<br>\r\n\"Some said it's magic from a time where magic still ruled this world, other says it's technology that fell from the stars\" Yaral finished. <br>\r\n\"This thing is weird\" Brandon said. <br>\r\n\"This weird thing can be yours for just five dollars.\" Yaral said.<br>\r\n\"Five bucks?\" Brandon thought about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would he even use this thing for? There's no possible way it could work. It's just some odd looking necklace with a bizarre story this guy cooked up. Still, Brandon was a lover of the strange and unusual, and it was only five bucks. He spent more money on worst things. I mean, it's just a necklace, there's no way that it could work...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, what the hell. Here\" Brandon said, pulling out five dollars from his wallet and handing it to Yaral. <br>\r\n\"Excellent choice young sir. I'm sure it will serve you well. Now before you go, take this\" Yaral said, reaching into his pocket, pulling out a small thick book about the size of a paperback novel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\" Brandon asked, grabbing the small hefty book. <br>\r\n\"The instruction manual. I would be sure to read it over\" Yaral said before walking off to other parts of the yard sale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon was standing there, mystical necklace in one hand, a small paperback novel of instruction in the other. He wondered what he just got himself into. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brandon stood at the garage sale, wondering what to do next, when his watched beeped at him, reminding him that it was now 5 PM, and that he was in fact, going to be late for dinner with his family. <br>\r\n\"Oh man, I'm going to be late for Spaghetti Night!\" Brandon said, hurrying back to his car. He through the novel sized instruction booklet and the amulet in the passenger seat, put on his seatbelt, turned the key and drove off towards home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon didn't seem to notice that as he left the garage sale, the path behind him seemed to shift back to the wooded path that he talked about, the signs of a garage sale almost nowhere to be seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen to fifteen minutes later, he pulled into the driveway of his home in his small neighborhood where he grew up. It hadn't changed much since he was a kid, only that the houses had new owners with small children running around. He noticed that both that his father and mother were home, (his mother being home early wasn't surprising. She always got home first to cook), as he saw their cars in the driveway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe noticed his older sister Sarah's car was also parked nearby, her car littered with logo's of Page Software, the small computer software company that his sister ran out of the rooms of the house. It was going surprisingly well for her, and when her parents retired in two years, his older sister Sarah was going to purchase the house and turn it into a complete home office, in order to continue save some money in a bad economy then renting out an office space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out of his car, and taking his newly purchased amulet and instruction manual with him, he headed inside. Once inside, he was hit with the delicious aroma of his Mom's world famous (at least according to Brandon) Spaghetti. <br>\r\n\"Mmm\" Brandon said, his mouth practically watering at the smell. <br>\r\n\"Oh hello honey. How was your day?\" His mother Ashley asked, preparing the dinner. Ashley Page was 46, and she was starting to show it. Her golden blonde hair was starting to grey a little, she was starting to get tired more easily, her looks began to fade. Still, she was one of the kindest nicest people that many would ever meet, and she was a good mother, balancing the act of being a mother and a teacher at the local High School for more than twenty years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was fine. Did some odd jobs around town for extra cash\" Brandon said heading up to his room. <br>\r\n\"Don't mess around up there for too long! Dinner will be ready soon!\" Ashley said, shouting up after her son. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading up to his room, he saw his father coming out of the master bedroom, getting changed over from his job at the office. <br>\r\n\"Heya Brandon, how's it going son?\" Tanner asked his son. <br>\r\n\"Good Dad. How as the office?\" Brandon asked. <br>\r\n\"Fine, we're still busting our humps for the big account, but I'm confident we'll get it. I have a big presentation tomorrow.\" Tanner said. <br>\r\nTanner Page was 50, but never let age slow him down. He's physically fit for a man his age, which is impressive considering how often he's sitting around the office. <br>\r\n\"Where's Sarah?\" Brandon asked. <br>\r\n\"She's in her office. I wouldn't disturb her. Sounds like she had a rough day.\" Tanner said, heading downstairs to help his wife cook dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon snuck past his sister's office and into his room, which was just the way he left it when he went to college. His stack of movies rested in the corner, next to his bookshelf. His models and legos which got him interested in engineering lay strung about his room, on shelves and on tables. His laptop lay resting on his desk, some plans he drew up for something tucked neatly behind the screen saver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing the amulet and book on his bed, he kicked off his shoes and screwed around for a little bit on his computer, checking email messages, chatting with friends, and playing a game. Eventually, his eyes went back to the amulet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking it up off the bed, he looked at it, wondering what the hell he was going to do with it. He finger traced each stone, stoping lastly at the one that supposedly held a twin pregnancy waiting to be transferred. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the hell did I buy this?\" He asked himself, suddenly wanting his five dollars back. <br>\r\nHe threw the amulet back on his bed and picked up the instruction manual. Brandon loved books, but as he started glossing over this small novel, it wasn't written like a book, it was written like stereo instructions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon decided to... </span></div></div>",

Please ensure that any pregnancy transferred between one party and the next is thourghly agreed to before using said device. Creators of the Preg-Transferer are not held responsible for any child support payments or other force of legal action caused by proper misuse or agreeing contract by person or persons using The Preg-Transferer. If properly used and maintained The Preg-Transferer will be your go to device for all matters maternity and paternity related. Please consult a physician before transferring a pregnancy into a male or female to ensure proper health of new child-bearer and child. The makers of Preg-Transferer do not make paternity clothes, any men who agree to use Preg-Transferer as way to ease the burden of a female agree to - - - \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it just went on like that for pages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so freaking boring!\" Brandon says skimming the book so more. \"Isn't there a way that this thing just tells you how to use it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning some more pages, he sees a page called \"Proper Usage Of The Preg-Transferer\" and begins to skim it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuttering to himself, he gets the idea that all he needs to do is wear the amulet, point at someone, and think about it, and the person will either have a pregnancy transferred out of them or into them depending on the person's current \"state\". All pregnancies that are stored in the stone will be perfectly safe and healthy until transferred into a new person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce a pregnancy is transferred into a person, the person and persons around will always believe the person to have been pregnant, but reality will not reflect this. If a pregnancy is transferred into a male, a healthy temporary uterus is transferred into the male as well ensuring a happy healthy pregnancy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf at anytime the user wants to undo a pregnancy, or set everything back the way it supposed to be, all the user has to do is press the giant \"X\" in the center of the amulet, and all pregnancies revert back to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a load of crock\" Brandon says reading over the instructions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were hundreds of more pages, each dedicated to troubleshooting and what to do in each situation. Brandon threw the book aside, picked up the amulet, looking at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh. What the hell. It's not like it's going to work\" Brandon said putting it on. As he put it on, he felt a low hum that seemed to rattle the fillings in his teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kids! Dinner!\" His mother yelled from down stairs. <br>\r\nNot bothering to take off the amulet, he headed downstairs to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sister Sarah was waiting for him at the table. She was a lot like her mother, long pretty blonde hair, a beautiful face, a killer body (or at least that what her mother kept telling her). Women wanted to be her, and men wanted to get with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat at the table, typing something out of her tablet computer, as her mother served the bowls of piping hot spaghetti. <br>\r\n\"Hey dork, what's up?\" His sister said playfully, not actually meaning the name dork behind her words. <br>\r\n\"Nothing much.\" Brandon replied taking his seat.<br>\r\n\"Nice necklace. Where'd you get that thing?\" His sister asked. <br>\r\n\"Garage sale not far from here. Supposedly it has some kind of powers or something.\" Brandon said. <br>\r\n\"The only power that thing has is chasing women away, and good knows you don't need any extra help with that. Hope you kept the receipt.\" Sarah said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks sis\" Brandon said. <br>\r\n\"Alright, eat up!\" His mother said, putting the last bowls on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Brandon watched his family move around the kitchen, he got an idea. Why not test this thing out here? It's not like it's going to work, so why not just mess around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at his mother Ashley, his father Tanner, and his sister Sarah, Brandon decided to use the amulet on.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Pfft, it's not like it was going to work anyways) </span></div></div>",

Brandon remained silent, as the amulet began to glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe oven went off, and his mother began to slowly back away.  \"Ugh.  I'm getting way too old for this!\" she said.  She opened the stove and attempted to bend over but she just couldn't.  Brandon, sweetie, do your mother a favor and get the bread out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon got up from the table and approached his mother, who's appearance had changed.  She now had a stomach the size of a woman over nine months pregnant, and had bigger breasts.  She began to rub her newly-exposed stomach.  Brandon retrieved the bread from the hot stove.  \"Thank you so much, dear.  Your brother and sister have really been giving me difficulty lately.\"  \"No problem.\" he replied.  He brought the bread to the table and took a seat, while his mother waddled towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, honey, you should really get some new clothes soon.  You're nearly nine months pregnant with twins for Christ's sake\" his father said.  \"I know, I know.  Maybe tomorrow.\"  They continued to eat (Ashley ate the most, obviously), and soon finished.  Brandon went to use the restroom, and when he finished, he found his mother on the couch eating pickles and ice cream whilst watching TV.  In between bites, she rubbed her twin-filled belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon walked to his room, and decided to use the computer whilst listening to the local Alt Rock station.  Hours had passed, and it was nearly midnight.  \"...and that was Ready to Start by Arcade Fire.  We've got some Daft Punk and The Strokes coming your way so be sure to stick around.\" the DJ said.  Brandon turned off the radio as his mom opened the door, her belly bared to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Brandon.  Do you think you could take me to the mall tomorrow?  Your sister and father are both working, and I can't drive with this belly in the way.\"  \"Uh-Yeah, sure, mom.\"  \"Thanks, sweetie.\"  Her mother approached him.  \"I know it's difficult for you to adjust with having to have new siblings soon, but it means so much to me that you help out so much.\" she continued, kissing his head.  \"Um, mom...do you mind it I felt?\" he said.  \"What, of course!\" she said.  Brandon slowly drew his hand to his mother's large stomach, feeling around her popped-out belly button.  He could feel movement inside, which slightly amazed him.  \"Okay, get some sleep, dear.\" she said as she exited the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon fell into his bed, his hand around the amulet as he fell asleep.<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------<br>\r\nThe Next Day<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon rose from his bed and walked towards the kitchen.  His father had already left for work, and his sister was sitting at the table eating.  He opened the pantry and grabbed the half-empty box of cereal, placing it on the table.  Grabbing a bowl and some milk, he then turned back to the table, and saw his mother waddle down the hallway.  She was dressed in pajamas, but the button-down shirt was two small, as she could only get the top two buttons buttoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ashley began to prepare a breakfast for herself, her two children ate breakfast at the table.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He sat in the driver's seat, as his mother was adjusting the passenger's seat to accommodate her pregnancy.  Brandon began to adjust the mirrors, giving it full attention.  \"So, Mom, what's it like to be pregnant?\" he asked, gesturing to her swollen stomach.  Before she could reply, a sound similar to a balloon inflating could be heard, grabbing Brandon's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced at Ashley, and saw her pregnant belly slowly expand.  She seemed oblivious to the fact, and by the time that it had stopped growing, she looked well overdue with twins.  \"Well, it's difficult at my age, especially with triplets, but I'm really loving it!\" she said, rubbing her belly.  <i>Triplets...</i>, he thought, before driving to the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon pulled into the mall's parking lot, and quickly exited the car to help his mother get out.  After a few tries, he heaved her up and entered the mall.  \"So, at this yoga thing, do I have to, like, help you or anything?\" he asked.  \"No, sweetie.  It's just a few stretches to help us stay in shape.  This isn't Lamaze class or anything like that where you need a partner.  I just needed a ride, and I decided to give Sarah a break.  Speaking of which, I can't wait until Sarah finds someone to have children with!\" she said, excitedly.  <i>Well, I think you'll be a little disappointed, Mom.</i> he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon was lead to a store with a sign reading 'Mamaste: Prenatal Exercise for Mother and Child'.  Inside, the room was filled with pregnant women of all shapes and sizes, but none bigger than his mother, who was talking to a woman with blond pixie-cut hair and blue eyes.  She appeared to be six or seven months pregnant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brandon, come here!  I'd like you to meet Janice, the class instructor.\" Ashley said.  \"Hey, Brandon it's nice to meet you!  Your mom talks about you a lot but I've only met Sarah.\"  Brandon noticed that his mother had left to talk to other women in the group.  \"So are you excited to be a big brother?  I think it's pretty amazing that your mother is able to carry triplets at her age!\"  \"Yeah, it's pretty amazing...I don't really know how I feel about being an older brother, though...How far along are you?\" he finished, changing the subject.  \"I'm almost seven months!\" she said, giving her belly a rub.  \"I guess your husband must be pretty excited, then...\" he said.  \"Oh, I don't have a husband.  My boyfriend ditched me after I gave him the news, so I guess I'm going to raise my little girl on my own...Anyways, I should probably start class.\" she said, turning away from Brandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon grabbed a seat as Janice began class.  After nearly 10 minutes of watching the women do exercises, which oddly turned him on, Brandon dozed off, waking up to his mother approaching him.  \"All done?\" he asked.  \"Yes.  Did you get bored?\"  \"A little bit, yeah.\" he replied, stifling a yawn.  \"Where to next?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Though to Brandon's surprise the store was packed, or it seemed that way with how big and pregnant all the customers were inside. You couldn't go two feet without bumping into someone or being bumped into. You would figure a store like this would provide its customers more space to move.<br>\r\n\"Oh!

It wasn\u2019t just the size or her age or the clothes she was wearing, each of these would attracted quite a few stares by themselves, it was all of these things together that seem to draw everyone\u2019s gaze. Whilst it was uncommon to see a woman Ashley\u2019s age pregnant it was just seeing one as pregnant as her, the clothes she was wearing only seem to increase the attention, as the athletic shirt was already too small before she gained the third child. Brandon felt slightly embarrassed about all the stares his mother seem to be attracting with her gravitational mass, but soldiered on. \u201cI there anything you particular you feel like?\u201d asked Brandon.<br>\r\n\u201cAs it so happens I am craving a burger, but don\u2019t know if that will be filling enough.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ll guess I see how a feel when I order.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon ended up getting a burger with fries, whilst his mother got two and a large chocolate desert, \u201cI thought I would have a light meal,\u201d said Ashley jokingly after seeing Brandon surprised glance at her meal. Despite the fact that she was eating more than twice as much as her son Ashley finished her food about the same time as Brandon and might of finished before him if it wasn\u2019t for the fact she had to use her belly as a table as said belly was preventing from using the table, this in turn meant she had steady the food with one hand so that an errant kick from an unborn child didn\u2019t send it falling to the ground.<br>\r\nAshley gave a short but distinct burp after finishing the last of her meal, \u201cThat hit the spot.\u201d She went to get up, Brandon rushed over to help and after what felt like more effort than earlier that morning got his mother to her feet. \u201cThank you sweetie, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll will be able to get back into shape after these little guys come out,\u201d said Brandon\u2019s mother wiping her face with a napkin with one hand whilst settle her belly with the other, \u201cthe amount they have made me eat has ruined my figure, I swear my backside has doubled in size since I have become pregnant,\u201d she slapped her rear to emphasize the point. \u201cWell time to get those clothes now, though that would probably be a lot of money for some clothes I\u2019m only going to wear for a couple a weeks and never again, it not like the expenditures are going to down soon,\u201d she said now caressing her globular stomach, \u201cand I doubt I can give them to some else to use, I doubt I will ever meet someone as big as I am now,\u201d she said with a laugh.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well, let's go!\" Ashley said enthusiastically, reaching out to her son to help heave her up. Brandon walked around and put his mother's arm over his shoulder, helping her stand up with him. It was no easy task, as anyone could see from looking at her. Ashley's belly was the size of a ripe watermelon and her clothes couldn't even begin to cover its size. As Brandon helped his gravid mother up, he couldn't help but think that her recent meal had made her even heavier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay?\" Brandon asked as he got his mother up on her own two feet. Ashley let out a long sigh and bent back, her belly jutting out a extra inches in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, thank you dear,\" Ashley smiled, wrapping her hands around her belly. \"Standing up also woke up the little ones inside me, so I'm getting some nice kicking that way! Now, onto the maternity store. I can't be walking around with my belly hanging out all the time, can I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hopefully not...</i> Brandon thought, accompanying his mother to the next store. Eyes were all over her as she walked, and plenty of people were snapping pictures of his mother with their phones and cameras. He felt weird about this, but he wasn't too surprised. His own mother had one of the biggest pregnant bellies he'd ever seen and was waddling around with it out. It was, of course, rude for people to take pictures, but it was certainly a rare sight. Plus, it was his own mother. He didn't like the idea of people gawking over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the maternity clothing store, things weren't too different. Even pregnant women who looked full term were giving Ashley plenty of attention. Ashley looked around for some clothes that would fit, not having much luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look like I'm 13 months pregnant...\" Ashley chirped to herself as she compared a rack of \"37-41 week pregnant\" clothes to her own immense frame. \"I need to find a clerk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk, a small, cute girl with short, brown hair and a big hair clip, had been curiously watching Ashley from around a rack of clothes when she heard the big mama-to-be talking to herself. \"I-I can help you, ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley beamed and turned to face the clerk, her entire belly now dead-center with the petite woman. Brandon saw that the look on the clerk's face was as surprised as his when he first saw his mother pregnant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, we do have some special multiples outfits, but we usually just keep those in the back. I can help you find something,\" she said back, face starting to blush. Ashley smiled and got closer to the clerk, her belly only inches away now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, show me what you've got,\" Ashley said. Brandon followed his mother to another corner of the store, where the clerk grabbed some outfits off the racks. She guided Ashley to the changing room and paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can help you with these, unless you-\" The clerk began before Ashley cut her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's alright. My son can come in and help too,\" she smiled at Brandon. Brandon turned pale as his mother beckoned him to follow her into the changing room. Inside, she flipped off the flimsy shirt she was wearing, as well as her sweatpants, to reveal her bare, pregnant body. Save for her bra and underwear, of course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try this first,\" the small woman said, a deep blush starting across her face as she handed Ashely the first outfit. <i>Thank you thank you thank you for this job</i>, she silently prayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshely pulled the outfit over her body, taking another pair of expanded maternity jeans from the clerk. Surprisingly, it ended up covering her belly pretty well, although it was incredibly tight. Her belly button was clearly visible. There were some frills on the front that accentuated the curve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is nice,\" Ashley said. \"What else do you have?\" The clerk began to happily hand her outfit after outfit, now taking more initiative with helping Ashley put the clothes on, including running her hands down her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you don't mind,\" the clerk said as she first rested her fingertips against the round, tight, pregnant skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not!\" Ashely grinned. \"I love to let people feel my big ol' tummy.\" The clerk looked like she was almost going to pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter plenty of changes, Ashley decided on a few choice outfits. \"I don't expect to be spending that much time outside, so this is probably all I need now,\" Ashley said. \"These babies aught to be coming soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, please feel free to come back whenever,\" the clerk said, happily packaging Ashley's new clothes. \"Even if it's not for c-clothes, you can just visit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley laughed. \"Well...thank you! You're so helpful.\" She leaned over and gave the small woman a hug. With her belly and breasts, Ashley almost crushed the petite clerk, but she looked like she was in heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon couldn't help but notice all of what happened nervously. He moved his hand around his neck, wiping away beads of sweat. As he did, he stroked the chain of the necklace. As he did, a massive pregnant woman who was walking by felt her belly as it suddenly shrunk down and Ashley's doubled in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I might be coming back,\" she said, running her hands over her ballooning belly. \"Now that I think about it, these outfits might not be able to handle the belly of someone pregnant with five babies.\" Ashely giggled again and thanked the clerk as she and Brandon headed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five babies, mom?\" Brandon said, checking to see if he heard her right. Ashley smiled sweetly at her son and caressed her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I know, I can hardly believe it myself somedays, but it's true...thank you so much for your help lately, by the way,\" Ashley said, planing a little kiss on her son's cheek. \"I really appreciate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no problem,\" Brandon said, a little stunned by his mother's sudden show of affection. She had never been like this before the, well, the sudden pregnancy. Just what was in store for him now?</span></div></div>",

Brandon went and looked at the seat, indeed it was too far forward for his mother to sit in, it was quite far back a woman pregnant with triplets could triplets could sit there but Ashley was\u2026well bigger than a woman with triplets. Brandon slid the seat as far back as it could go and helped his extremely gravid mother in, even with the seat set back as it could Ashley\u2019s belly still was jammed up against the dash board. \u201cMaybe I should sit in the back,\u201d said Ashley, she went to get up but she was wedged in there so tightly that after another couple of minutes of struggling Ashley said, \u201cmaybe it would be better just to go home and try and get I will try and get out then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride home was uneventful, getting Ashley out of the car and to her feet on the other hand was quite difficult, in the end Brandon had to go and get Sarah from inside, who obviously didn\u2019t like being called away from her work to help get their very pregnant mother get out of a tight spot. They managed to get Ashley out, to her feet and into the living room. Sarah was just leaving to go to her room when Ashley said, \u201cwait don\u2019t you want to see me in my new clothes?\u201d <br>\r\nSarah gave a loud sigh, \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of work a need to do, but if you want my opinion, I think those clothes are way too small for you,\u201d she reached into one of the bags and withdrew another piece of clothing, \u201ceven without you putting this one I can tell it is much too small,\u201d said Sarah tossing the clothing aside which hit Brandon in the face, who stumbled back his hand brushing against the amulet, through two undefined holes in the piece of clothing (which Brandon was severely hoping wasn\u2019t an under garment) he could see his mother and sister, there was a strange sound, like one of a balloon deflating and inflating. When Brandon had remove the piece of clothing (which turned out to be a shirt) Sarah was now the one pregnant with quintuplets, her shirt too busy containing her breast to even try covering her belly, her hips and backside also had increased to match the rest of her gravid body. Ashley was still stand where she was before wearing the maternity clothes, though she had to hold the pants up to prevent them falling down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee they\u2019re too big for you and way too small for me,\u201d said Sarah holding a tank top up against her swollen body, \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know why I couldn\u2019t have gone and got them instead of you, I mean I am the one having the babies.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you to strain yourself sweetie,\u201d said Ashley going over to her daughter and rubbing Sarah\u2019s belly with one hand whilst holding up the pants with the other, \u201cyou are carrying half the family inside you.\u201d This was an understatement, Brandon did some quick maths and realized that Sarah and her unborn children together outnumbered the rest of the family two to one. \u201cBeside I was already near there as needed to go to the gym to get rid of this rear,\u201d said Ashley, this was true whilst the pregnancy in its entirety had been past to her daughter the amount of food that Ashley had consumed in the past day would have a longer lasting effect on her figure. \u201cYou can\u2019t complain,\u201d snapped Sarah angrily, \u201cI can\u2019t sit down too quickly in even my largest pants or I risk tearing them, tomorrow \u2018I\u2019 will go and get some clothes that fit, hopefully I can get the money back from these clothes before I\u2019m accused of stretching them out.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd how are you planning on getting there?\u201d said Ashley raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n\u201cBrandon will drive me.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Brandon.<br>\r\n\u201cYou heard me,\u201d said Sarah turning around (this took quite a bit of time and revealed a white pantie clad backside visible through a tear in the jeans she was wearing) and leaving for her room this time via the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Sarah had climbed the stair which creaked nosily under the immense weight of her and her unborn children, Ashley turn to her son and said, \u201cBest if you help her get there, she is having five after all and is rather emotional what with the father leaving.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was his name again?\u201d asked Brandon.<br>\r\n\u201cShe never said, besides if you don\u2019t help her she will end up trying to go the place by herself and that\u2019s not good for her this far along with so many. I\u2019m sorry you have to spend your holidays rushing around after us instead of relaxing or spending times with your friends\u201d said Ashley, she turned to go, \u201cI should put some clothes that fit on now, oh and if that nice young clerk is there tomorrow say hi to her from me and see if you can find out her name.\u201d</span></div></div>",

He only intended to glance into Sarah\u2019s bedroom as he made his way past but he found himself staring at the sight that met his eyes. Sarah\u2019s room was part bedroom part home office, from which she ran her software company, since it had an ensuite she only had to leave the room to get supplies from the basement (the other room in the house used for her business) and to have meals by looks of it though she was trying to achieve the latter without leaving as well. No one was really aware, Sarah had been pregnant for less than a quarter of an hour and already her room bore the hallmarks of its recently enlarged inhabitant. Food packets, both full and empty, were strewn around the room whilst the floor was littered with items that had fallen on to it or more likely knocked on to it and unable to be picked up. In the middle of all this sat Sarah who had wedged herself into her office chair, which must have been no easy feat, on her gargantuan belly rested a computer keyboard upon which her hands moved across as she worked, occasionally one hand would reach into a nearby packet transport some of its contents to Sarah\u2019s mouth before going back to the keyboard. Brandon stood, there staring at his heavily gravid sister, \u2018why?\u2019 he thought \u2018why out of all the women that I know the one that gets pregnant with quintuplets is her?\u2019 a moment later  Sarah, some how noticing she was being watched, turn to see Brandon looking at her. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you staring at, dork?\u201d she said, even though she had said similar things to him before it sounded different to how she had said it before she was pregnant (which in reality was less than hour ago but to the blurry memory of everybody was several months ago). Before she was pregnant the half insults sounded joking and playful but now she sound irritated and as though she really meant them.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat oh nothing,\u201d said Brandon and continued to his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe threw himself on to the bed and laid there staring at the ceiling, after a while he found that something was jabbing into his back. Brandon fished around a bit and pulled out the manual for the amulet, \u2018if the thing really worked then it would allow him to transfer Sarah\u2019s pregnancy to some else\u2019. He flicked through the pages idly wondering if he should read the instructions properly.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He got up and walked to the bathroom, brushed his teeth, had a long pee, and stretched back in his room. For some reason, he felt exhausted, even though all he did was help his mom shop for clothes for Sarah at the mall. With the level of stress he felt like he was under, it was like his mom had been the pregnant one instead...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he felt sufficiently limber, Brandon took off his shirt and shorts and tossed them into his hamper. His shorts were thrown a little low and knocked the amulet off of the bureau and right onto the heavy \"manual\" that came with it. There was an audible *crunch* as it hit and Brandon picked it up with concern. Just looking it over, he couldn't see any obvious damage. Then, the four bluish gems on the sides of the amulet (it was eight when he first bought it. Odd...) almost appeared to flicker, then fade in and out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must just be exhausted,\" Brandon thought, putting the amulet back on his bureau and crawling into bed. It felt like hours passed before he could actually get to sleep, errant thoughts of the day and pregnancy running through his head. As he felt his body start to relax, there was a light knock at the door and he heard it  slowly push open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brandon?\" Sarah's voice asked. Jack sat up and blinked a few times, reaching over to his lamp. Flicking it on, he squinted to adjust to the sudden light to see his sister standing before him, in a non-maternity tank top that revealed pretty much all of her quintuplet belly and a pair of short athletic shorts. \"You're awake, I guess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...yeah. I couldn't really get to sleep,\" Brandon said, scooting up in his bed. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm having really bad Braxton-Hicks contractions,\" she said, rubbing her belly. Brandon could tell she was starting to blush. \"Do you think you could...*sigh* help rub my belly to make the pain go away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon felt his heart flutter. \"O-of course,\" he said. Sarah took a few ungraceful steps to his bed and sat down, legs spread, belly prominent. \"Just like this?\" He began rubbing both hands side to side around her gigantic belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that feels much better,\" she said softly, resting her hands on her thighs. \"Th-thanks for this. Mom and Dad are both asleep so-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's okay,\" Brandon said, rubbing her belly much more gently. He couldn't believe how big she was! And to think she'd been carrying this many babies for almost nine months now. \"What do the contractions feel like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, like my skin just gets incredibly tight, stretched to its absolute limit,\" she complained, taking a deep breath as another contraction made its rounds. Sarah looked down at her massive dome of a belly. \"It's a miracle I don't have stretch marks yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon's face turned red as he continued to look over his sister's huge belly, seeing how it was indeed smooth and soft, but as he rubbed he could feel the tightness of her full womb. Sarah saw his blushing but decided not to try and figure out what it could mean. Instead, she looked around his room before her eyes caught his manual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pregnancy Transfer?\" she said, reaching in the direction of the book. Brandon looked over and handed the heavy manual to her. \"What's this all about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, it came with this weird thing from a garage sale,\" Brandon said, handing her the amulet. \"It's dumb but at least this amulet looks kind of neat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have such weird taste,\" Sarah said, shaking her head. As she took the amulet from his hand, it sparked and shocked her a bit. \"Yeouch,\" she hissed, dropping it onto the bed. \"I think I caught a sharp edge or something.\" Sarah turned her attention back to the book, flipping through the pages. \"Huh, this is really detailed. It's written as if this 'pregnancy transfer' thing really worked. Man, some of this illustrations have pregnant women as big as I am...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Brandon asked. Maybe he should have given it a look after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you don't secretly have a thing for pregnant chicks, do you bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-I-uh...uh,\" Brandon started to stammer. Sarah flashed him a little smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, I'm just teasing you. You can be a goof sometime but you're over all a good kid,\" she sighed. Flipping through a few more pages, Sarah tossed the book back onto the floor where it made a heavy *bang.* \"But man, I wish this was real. I'm planning to give my babies up for adoption when they're born, but it would be nice to not have to carry them at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and Brandon and Sarah's mom walked in, awakened by the sound of the manual hitting the floor. \"Are you both okay in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we're fine Mom,\" Sarah said sarcastically, picking up the amulet again. Her fingers traced its shape as it started to spark again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, try not to be too noisy at night. I need a lot of sleep with these little ones,\" Ashley said, rubbing her now-enormous pregnant belly. \"It's hard to get five babies to keep quiet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Mom,\" Sarah said with another eye roll, patting her own flat, baby-less tummy. \"Geez, I guess that's another reason to wish pregnancy transfer was real: so if I ever get pregnant, especially <u>that</u> pregnant, I could get out of it as soon as possible.\" Sarah chuckled and got off of Brandon's bed. \"Thanks for letting me chat, bro. Like I said, you aren't so bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon just blinked and didn't respond. Because while the amulet's magic or alien technology was intended to re-write reality to make everyone believe the pregnancy transfer occurred naturally, since it was damaged, it didn't quite work out.

His computer, movies, models and Legos were all still there, which were really the only important things, there didn\u2019t seem to be anything extra, there might have been an extra unwashed sock on the floor somewhere.Everyone seemed to be wearing the correct clothes, well Sarah\u2019s tank top was stretched out and all but the very top buttons of Ashley\u2019s pajamas were undone as her enormous belly prevented otherwise, other than that nothing seem to be glaringly obvious.<br>\r\nBut no matter how much he told himself otherwise Brandon couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that something was not quite right. Both his sister and mother had left, Sarah ducking back into her room whilst Ashley waddled noisily back to hers and Tanner\u2019s room. Even though his parents\u2019 room was at the other side of the house Brandon could clearly hear his mother\u2019s progress until she got into bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Why?\u2019 he thought \u2018why out of all the women that I know the one that gets pregnant with quintuplets is her?\u2019 Brandon picked up the manual and flicked through the pages to see if Sarah was telling the truth, if there were pictures of women as big as\u2026her? Brandon was quite sure that was what his sister had said, but why? There were pictures of women as big as her, which was to say not pregnant at all, quite often with the word \u2018before\u2019 or \u2018after\u2019 written underneath it. It was the picture of the women next to these with the corresponding word underneath them which would be cause for comment as many of them were as big as Brandon\u2019s and Sarah\u2019s mother currently was, their bellies immensely distended with what could of only be multiple babies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon put the book on his bedside table next to the amulet.

She tippy toe'd back to his bedroom whilst Amander waddled slowly to her room. Picking the item up behind Brandons closed door, she looked over to her mum who was just entering her room. Rubbing off some of the dust on the new amulet, she thought to herself, \" man, having 5 baby's must be a huge tole, I can't even trying to imagine having 2-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" 2 is enough, but having triplets, that just one too far.\"  Sarah looked down At her belly, thank god Brandon rubbed it earlier, cause those two were nicely off to sleep. Speaking of sleep, it was time she got some. Sarah waddled tiredly over to her bedroom, opening the door she placed the amulet between her EE cup breasts. It was hard navigating through her bedroom, getting past files for her business, old packets of chips and piles of over stretched and over worn bras. Landing on the bed with a light thump she fell off to the land of slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in Brandon's dream,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon was in a big city, something between the looks of Chicago, and Sydney, but in the near future, he walked pass a bunch of guys when he saw 3 women heavily pregnant, they looked over due with twins, and what's more is that they were outside a bar, drinking margaritas! He continued walking and buss stopped infront of him, and a sea of pregnant women came out. H crossed the street only to bump into his friend, Riley. \" Riley! \" Brandon panicked, \" why is everyone pregnant?\"<br>\r\n\" pregnant? What is pregnant?\" Riley replied quizzically.<br>\r\n\" come on! Don't play stupid, why has everyone got  huge bellies?\" Brandon sternly said to him.<br>\r\n\" hey hey hey, don't say that out loud\" Riley told him cautiously, \" you are allowed to talked about them, women love the fact they have them as much as they have their breasts or butts! But don't be a pervert about it!\" Riley walked away, leaving Brandon in a mess, he walked pass a gym where women with bellies the size of beach balls were cycling and working out. A billboard on top said ' embrace who you are, support your curves', as his eyes were gazed upon the sexy model on the billboard he bumped into a small pregnant woman in business attire. He accidently knocked the sheets from her hand, \" oh I'm so sorry\" he said helping the somewhat blonde petite woman( if you excluded the size of her breasts and belly) out. \" I'm so sorry he said handing her the papers, looking at her woman's clothes he saw the logo on the blazer, it looked just like the one for Jessica's business but said PregTech, the way of the future!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon woke up in a flush, he was both worried and excited. He came down stairs and saw his breakfast made, his father was just getting ready for work and his mother was just drinking a glass of orange juice whilst rubbing her triplet belly. \"Hey son!\" Said Tanner \" what's on the ropes for today? Gunna take care of your sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some thought, Brandon said</span></div></div>",

Even with the reality change, Sarah was too focused on her work and too annoyed with her pregnancy to bother buying any clothes that met the needs of her present condition. But, Brandon also wanted to show his sister that he cared about her. He felt bad when Sarah treated him badly and was happy when he could make her feel better with last night's belly rub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah walked down the stairs slowly, one hand under her belly. As she walked, there was another big belly pushing against her head and upper back. \"Sorry dear,\" Ashley said with a chuckle. \"It's hard to maneuver this thing around.\" Brandon and Sarah's mother rubbed her belly and beamed as Sarah only rolled her eyes and scowled. It was bad enough being pregnant at the same time as her mother, but did Ashley have to carry her pregnancy so much better than Sarah? I mean, she was twice her age and carrying more babies than her! <u>She</u> should be the one who's grumpy and exhausted!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, we made you some breakfast,\" Tanner said, sliding a big plate toward Sarah, who sat down with a huff. <br>\r\n\"Just because I'm pregnant doesn't mean I have to start pigging out,\" Sarah said with an angry tone, gesturing at the huge meal on her plate. Despite her initial protest, Sarah ate with apparent gusto. Brandon watched on in awe, slowly drinking the last of his orange juice.<br>\r\n\"So, your brother tells me you two are making a trip to the mall,\" Tanner smiled, washing off the dishes. \"It's nice to see the two of you finally bonding.\"<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Sarah said, turning to Brandon.<br>\r\n\"Oh, I just told Dad that...since I took Mom to get maternity clothes yesterday, maybe I should do the same for you today.\" <br>\r\nSarah sighed heavily. \"I can take care of myself,\" she said, before looking away and mumbling, \"b-but, some more comfortable clothes would be nice...<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">thank you</font>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, a trip to the mall?\" Ashley said, coming back down from the staircase. \"Mind if I tag along? Some friends of mine said there's a little boutique opening there. It's not maternity things, but I wouldn't mind looking around.\"<br>\r\n\"S-sure,\" Brandon said, nervous about another day at the mall with his heavily pregnant mother. He cocked his head slightly as Ashley turned and walked. Her belly looked...smaller to him. And, come to think of it, so did Sarah's. He shook his head. No, he was just imagining things. His mom was pregnant with triplets and Sarah was pregnant with twins. Everything was the way it should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive over to the mall was as uncomfortable as Brandon expected. Ashley talked about how much she enjoyed her new maternity clothes and how much Sarah would like hers, and how she remembered being pregnant with both of them, and how much they've both grown up. The whole time, Sarah looked out the window, occasionally looking down at her belly, and her hands never left her glowing bump. At the mall itself, the family got a fair amount of stares, possibly more than when Ashley was last there because now there were two huge pregnant women walking around together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the maternity clothing store, the Page family was met by the same clerk as yesterday, Katie. \"Welcome t-\" she started, her jaw dropping as Ashley and Sarah inside. \"Oh, y-you're back.\"<br>\r\nAshley grinned. \"Yes, but nothing for me this time,\" she motioned to Sarah's exposed belly. Sarah pulled her shirt over her belly tightly and blushed brightly.<br>\r\n\"Mom...\" Sarah complained quietly.<br>\r\n\"W-well, let's see what we can get you,\" Katie said, shaking nervously, walking Sarah over to a long rack of clothes. As Sarah and Ashley looked through the selection, Katie walked over to Brandon. \"So...the woman from last time is your mom, right?\"<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Brandon said, blushing a little himself. This clerk was pretty cute. \"And the other one's my sister.\"<br>\r\n\"Two big pregnant women in the same house...lucky you,\" Katie mumbled, stroking her chin.<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n\"Nothing!\" Katie said quickly, walking over to Sarah as she held up one outfit. \"This one is perfect for 'professional' moms-to-be. What do you think?\"<br>\r\n\"This could be good...\" Sarah said, looking it over. \"But I should probably...get a few more outfits, right?\" Ashley smiled, giving her daughter a little hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some browsing, Sarah settled on some new clothes that she could tolerate and was checking them out. As she reached into her purse, Ashley waved her hands. \"No no no, this is going to be my present for you. You wouldn't let me buy you any baby supplies and you won't have a baby shower. Let me do this for you.\"<br>\r\nKatie smiled a little. \"You are the most interesting family to come here that I've ever seen.\" Ashley smiled back at her.<br>\r\n\"And you are so nice. You know what: you have to have dinner at our house. I insist. You've been so nice to us, we should do the same for you.\"<br>\r\n\"O-oh, I don't know about-\"<br>\r\nBrandon cleared his throat. \"I-I think that would be a good idea,\" he said. Ashley, Sarah, and Katie all turned to him. Ashley had a big smile, Sarah gave him a perplexed look, and Katie just looked shocked, her face bright red. \"I mean, you know, whatever,\" he mumbled.<br>\r\n\"A-alright, I'll do it,\" Katie said, laughing nervously. \"Um, heeeere's my number and email,\" she said, writing out her contact info on one of the store's business cards.<br>\r\n\"Great, see you tonight!\" Ashely said with a smile, waddling out of the store.<br>\r\n\"T-tonight?\" Katie whimpered as the three of them left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm going to go see my friends now,\" Ashley said, stretching her back out, jutting her huge belly. \"What about both of you?\"</span></div></div>",

Due to the angle and the size of her own belly this was not possible, when this became apparent to her Ashely settled by giving her own belly a brief pat before saying, \u201cwell I know where to meet you guys when I\u2019m done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon tried not to watch his mother\u2019s swollen figure sway as she waddled away and instead turned his attention to Sarah, which wasn\u2019t much better. \u201cDo you want to go get something to eat?\u201d Sarah, whose face was still slightly pink, was silent for a moment before saying, \u201c\u2026yes.\u201d<br>\r\nThey started making their way to the food court, \u201canything in particular?\u201d asked Brandon.<br>\r\n\u201cWell I do feel like chicken,\u201d replied Sarah.<br>\r\n\u201cLike a craving?\u201d<br>\r\nSarah\u2019s face went red again, partly from embarrassment and this time from anger, \u201cI never said that, don\u2019t ever ask that me that again.\u201d<br>\r\nClearly Sarah didn\u2019t like to be thought as a pregnant woman, despite the physical evidence, maybe she didn\u2019t like the idea of being a mother as she felt it meant the end of her career or youth, thought Brandon, or maybe it was just a mood swing he added as an afterthought. He didn\u2019t say any of this of course, partly as he didn\u2019t want to upset his sister even more and he didn\u2019t want to have a burger two days in a row. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ordered there food and sat down at one of the uncomfortable table and chairs arrangement that seem to in every food court. Unlike that morning, where she had eaten the food presented to her with great gusto, Sarah ate her purchased food with furtive looks around her like a cat, to see if anyone was watching her, this behavior probably attracted more attention than her being pregnant with twins. Despite finishing her meal Sarah was still hungry, as could be told by the occasional groan made by her belly and the way she squirm around as though having an internal battle with herself. The outcome of the battle became apparent when she got up without a word and went over to the counter again, she came back again a couple minutes later with another meal, same as the first, still not saying anything but giving Brandon a stern look warning him not to comment before consuming this meal in the same furtive fashion. She did this one more time and after consuming this third coarse did Sarah seem to be satisfied as she lead back and started stroking her belly.

Brandon thought about waving to her, the bags that she was carrying showed that she had finished her shopping at the boutique (and had not surprisingly bought something, even if they did have anything her current size to buy it would be too big for her in a couple of months) and was now looking for them, but Brandon somehow felt embarrassed to acknowledge to the world that forty something lady who was immensely pregnant with triplets was his mother. It was strange because she would see him (or more likely Sarah) and come over any way, not to mention they were all we leaving the mall together anyway, but at least he could be sullen and show the world that he was not happy with the state of affairs. He looked away from his mother and at another place so he could not see his sister either, \u2018why\u2019 he thought to himself, \u2018out of all the woman I know why do they have to be the ones to becomes pregnant with multiples.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley arrived about two minute later, \u201cThere you two are,\u201d she said sitting down heavily in a vacant chair. Neither of her children (including the ones inside her) said anything, Sarah was still rubbing her stomach absentmindedly and Brandon was getting a head start on being sullen. \u201cI suspect you two want to go home?\u201d Still no verbal answer but Brandon did give a vague nod to show that it was what he wanted. \u201cOh I bought a really fetching \u2026\u201d began Ashley reaching into one of the bags from the boutique, but she was cut off by both Brandon and Sarah hurriedly saying, \u201cNo!\u201d  <br>\r\nWhilst Ashley hadn\u2019t actually said what kind of things she had bought from the boutique both Brandon and Sarah knew whatever it was that they didn\u2019t want to see it, especially in public.<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go home then,\u201d said their mother resignedly, but they had not gone a few steps after getting up when a loud rumble emitted from Ashley\u2019s swollen middle, \u201cSorry, I haven\u2019t had any lunch yet would you two mind waiting whilst I got something to eat?\u201d She posed it as a question but the tone of her voice made it clear that she had already made up her mind; Brandon made an effort never the less. <br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t you just get something at home?\u201d but his mother had already started waddling over to the burger outlet that she went to yesterday saying, \u201cI just have a craving for a burger\u2026or two.\u201d<br>\r\nWith a sigh Brandon and Sarah made their way back to the table they recently vacated, Brandon remembered there once was a time when his mother would make him go home for food instead of getting junk food at the mall, \u2018how times have changed\u2019 he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley ended up coming back with three meals, one of which she proffered to Sarah, \u201cI got one for you too?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMom I\u2019m not hungry,\u201d whined Sarah.<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure? You\u2019re eating for three now.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI had a lot to eat before.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIf you say so, more for me, I\u2019m just looking out for the health of both my daughter and my grandchildren,\u201d said Ashley unwrapping the first of her burgers, \u201cat least some of my children are accepting the food I give them,\u201d she said in a loving yet immature voice to her stomach. Brandon endured another quarter of an hour whilst his mother devoured more food than he had ever eaten in one sitting. He was at least grateful of the fact that Ashley wasted no time and ate a fast as possible, though it did attract some stares.<br>\r\nAfter finishing the last drink Ashely gave a belch, like yesterday, to signify the end of her meal. Brandon without waiting for conformation stood up, with Sarah following suit after a fashion. Seeing that her all of her children that weren\u2019t currently occupying her womb wanted to go home Ashely went to get up.<br>\r\n\u201cOof, sorry to ask again but can you help me up Brandon,\u201d she said placing her hands on her belly, \u201cmommy\u2019s a bit heavy.\u201d Brandon gave a sigh and for the second day in a row had to help his mother, swollen with babies and food, up in public, he definitely was not taking any member of his family shopping tomorrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive back was much the same as the drive over, though Brandon had felt the worst for the day was over, both he and Sarah were silent whilst their mother gabbled on about the boutique the importance of eating enough whilst pregnant (which was directed at Sarah) and the upcoming dinner that evening. The only thing Sarah or Brandon said was another insistent \u2018No!\u2019 as Ashley tried to show them what she had bought at the boutique again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got home Brandon\u2026 </span></div></div>",

Something about pregnant women was starting to get to him. Was he feeling something different? Like his panicking feeling was changing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah collapsed onto the lounge. She was exhausted from shopping she realised she didn't have enough to eat. \" Stupid mum\" she annoyingly whined. Her stomach growlings intensified. She looked around. Damn! She thought, nothing in the room, she looked down and saw the amulet in her cleavage, it's red rubies glistening again. \"Heh, thank god I am only having twins, if I had one mor-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Quads can be such a belly full!\" The amulet she was wearing appeared to have twice the power as Brandon's, though no one noticed a thing because it changed reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a great feet of strength she brought herself up. Slowly she waddled into the kitchen, past Brandon and up to the cupboard. After grabbing a jumbo sized packet of corn chips, a box of donuts and a roll of cookie dough she waddled back to the lounge. She looked down and saw a note. \" Brandon, it says here you need to help with Louise's pool, remember, say nothing about her condition, she doesn't like people knowing about her being 50 and pregnant\". Sarah told Brandon as she carefully got back into the couch. Sigh Brandon grabbed his swimming trunks and made his way down the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouise Parker owned a mansion near the end of the street. Her husband was known for owning the biggest book company in America, Books, books and books. Brandon worked in one of their stores for a while until a mysterious event happened and they moved to a different city. They had 4 kids, however with 2 moved out that left Brody, their hyperactive 5 year old boy and Erin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh god Erin. She was a stunning red head with unbelievable curves. She had a fondness for books and literature but unbeknownst to am and pa she was also a sly vixen. She could charm a muscular body building giant into a lovable scamp in 5 minutes. Alas that wasn't the way she was with Brandon. They had been friends for a couple of years now. And things were going smoothly. However he did know her weaknesses. She loves spicy foods and fears slimy and creepy crawl insects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Louise opened her door Brandon tried not to look at the large belly she was bearing. After exchanging hellos, she lead him to pools maintenance equipment. \" thank you soo much for all this, we haven't swam in days!\" Louise said rubbing her large middle. \" I would try to find a way to fix it but, you know\". She stood there and put a cap over her red hair. Brandon manuvered rough the pipes  and bars, trying to figure out the cause.\" muuum\" a familiar voice called from inside. Stepping outside, Erin walked down stairs, her red hair flowing and her large DD cups bouncing in her stripped bra. Brandon  saw the problem, it was a loose power coupling. Connecting the power, the pools pump started again. Realising Erin was in a bikini, he went straight up and banged his head on the bar above his head. He was knocked out stone cold. \"ERIN! Come here quick!\" Louise worryingly cried out as she struggles to pull Brandon out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Brandon woke up, he saw</span></div></div>",

This itself would have normally been great for Brandon as Erin already had looks that made him weak at the knee and with addition of her being pregnant, but living in a house hold that was about to double in number changed Brandon\u2019s perception appearance in pregnancy. Whilst Erin had grown immensely from her pre maternal shape and became just as ungainly, in comparison to the women of the Page house hold she was as agile svelte as a gymnast. He was rather jealous as she was having a baby with someone else granted no one, even Erin herself, didn\u2019t know who was the father, all that Brandon knew was that it wasn\u2019t him and that grated him slightly. Besides he wasn\u2019t allowed to see the Parker\u2019s maybe his mother did want them stealing her chore helper, which what Brandon felt he had become. \u2018That\u2019s it,\u2019 he thought to himself as he got to the bottom of the stairs, \u2018tomorrow I\u2019m going out, either to see a friend or go shopping for some computer games hell even go to the library just not to be around pregnant women.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile down the street at the Parker\u2019s residence, Louise opened the door to guest bed room but instead of it being set out as the normal guest bed, with the second hand or cheap furniture in it, it was set up as a nursery. Why this was the case Louise did not know, Brodie had his own room, slept in a bed not a crib and was too old to require the use of some of the other furniture found in there such as the change table. The only people that she knew were expecting were the Page family and whilst were probably going to need the extra room soon she wasn\u2019t going to help them not after the way Ashely had spoken to her. Then why had the guest bed room been converted into a nursery?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was she thinking about it was it was Erin\u2019s baby, how could she forget.<br>\r\nAfter an embarrassing few minutes of getting Sarah unsteadily to her feet Brandon made his way to the kitchen, where he found his rotund mother working feverishly over tonight\u2019s dinner. By looks of it nearly every appliance was being used; with mixing bowls on the bench, empty bar a few dregs, several pots and pans, boiling and frying on the stove, something turning in the microwave and with pride of place a large roast in the oven. Over this factory of culinary production was Ashley wearing an old shirt and sweat pants both covered in stains of one description or another, sticking out between these two items of clothing was her gravid belly with the size, roundness and apparent weight of a medicine ball, it had a shine across its surface where its owner had absentmindedly rubbed it without bothering to wash the oil or grease off her hands first. \u2018She really is cooking a lot,\u2019 Brandon thought, but then reminded himself that she was cooking for eleven most of which were herself and Sarah. <br>\r\nIt was at that point that Ashley noticed her son was in the kitchen, \u201cFeeling a better sweetie?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cA bit.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCould you clear the table for me then, your father isn\u2019t home yet, Sarah isn\u2019t physically able to do it and I\u2019ve got my hands full here.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d said Brandon, there was no point in arguing, what she said was true and clearing the table wasn\u2019t that bad a task. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was whilst he was doing this Brandon wondered, not for the first time, why Katie was coming over for dinner at all, they barely knew the woman (though she about Brandon\u2019s age and the term girl might be better at least in comparison to Ashley), they hand only met her twice and whilst she was nice and had taken a shine to them and vice versa, at least in Ashley\u2019s case, it still was weird to invite her to dinner. What was just as strange was that Katie agreed to come instead of being suspicious that a group of strangers invited her over to their place for dinner especially as two of them looked like they had eaten the last few. There were several strange things that made Brandon uneasy such as why hadn\u2019t Ashley and Sarah bought any maternity clothes earlier on, both of them were having multiples and were pretty far along an yet only in the last two days did they buy clothes that actually \u2018fitted\u2019 (even then half of them seem to be too small), it wasn\u2019t like they both ballooned up overnight. Something was not quite right and he couldn\u2019t get his mind to focus on the idea, it was like trying to keep a dream in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he had just finished up Ashley said, \u201cYou\u2019re finished?...good, now get cleaned up and dressed in some good clothes for this evening, tell Sarah to do the same, After that come back here keep an eye on the cooking whilst I get ready and dressed for this evening.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The words \u2018looked like\u2019 had to be used as a sheath dress goes out at the top and the bottom and in in the middle, and whilst Ashley had a lot of out  for the top and the bottom she had a lot more out in the middle and so the dress stretch in directions that it wasn\u2019t meant to. Brandon assumed that this was what she had bought at the boutique as it had frills and lace and stuff that made it look like it was from a boutique and he didn\u2019t remember seeing her try it on at the store where Katie worked, Brandon wondered if the dress was made /adjusted to fit his mother\u2019s current figure or had bought one that was meant for rather large woman. Either way it hadn\u2019t worked and the dress didn\u2019t fit, well it did fit in that it covered what it was meant to reaching down over her rear part way down Ashley\u2019s thighs and even managed the impressive task of covering her bulging belly but it was a near thing, and if she ate like she had in the last few meals it might not, but it still looked taxed in places that it wasn\u2019t meant to be.<br>\r\nAshley looked around from the task she was doing, which was trying to do the zipper up on the upper back of the dress, it looked impossible for her to do, in fact Brandon was surprised she managed to get this far by herself, given her size. \u201cAh there you are,\u201d said Ashley, \u201ccould you help me get this troublesome zipper done up?\u201d she said turning around giving Brandon a view of the \u2018V\u2019 shape exposed flesh of her back. Knowing that he had no choice in the matter Brandon wordlessly crossed the room and started to try and do the zipper up, he did an internal groan as he saw her bra strap which frilly and lacy enough to tell him that the dress wasn\u2019t the only thing his mom had bought at the boutique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe managed to get zipper done  up but that was after a few minutes of trying as the zipper slider was one of those small fiddly ones that was difficult to use at the best of times.<br>\r\n\u201cWoo, that was difficult,\u201d said Ashley when her dress was finally \u2018on\u2019 \u201csorry about that but it just looked so nice in the shop and I thought I could adjust after I had the babies.\u201d<br>\r\nIt was at that this point that Sarah\u2019s voice drifted up from down stairs saying \u201cDad\u2019s here.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNow he comes,\u201d muttered Brandon to himself.<br>\r\n\u201cI think everything you can help with is done,\u201d said Ashley, \u201cjust don\u2019t mess yourself up before dinner tonight.\u201d<br>\r\nTaking the opportunity to hide in his room, Brandon walked as fast as he could to the door without causing offence. \u2018Why does she care so much about impressing some girl she recently met who works at a maternity store?\u2019 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sarah eating sullenly like she did at lunch whilst Ashley brazenly consumed food and occasionally tried to strike up a conversation, but since she didn\u2019t stop eating all it achieved was to occasionally spray crumbs across the table.

Brandon sat there looking around at the table to see if anyone else had notice, both his dad and sister seemed unaware of the imminent new family member, not like it sticks out with all the other imminent new family members on the way. That was another thing how many of the multitude that his mother and sister were expecting were natural? Brandon still couldn\u2019t quite remember if either of them had originally been pregnant or if so with how many, all he did know was that after he knocked the amulet his mother\u2019s belly grew right in front of his eyes. And he couldn\u2019t help but continue to look at it, her belly button now an outie (it had been since the amulet was first used on her) stretch noticeably past its normal size,<br>\r\n\u201cAre you all right sweetie?\u201d asked Ashely, Brandon opened his mouth but nothing but an indistinct noise came out, \u201csweetie?\u201d she repeated with a bit more concern.<br>\r\nBrandon regained control of himself, well some of it, enough to blurt out \u201cYou\u2019re bigger.\u201d<br>\r\nHis mother seemed to relax and said in a joking babying tone, \u201cYes because mommy has five babies inside her and soon you are going to be a big brother.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd an uncle,\u201d said Sarah dourly under her breath, but no one heard her.<br>\r\n\u201cBut you\u2019re bigger just now,\u201d said Brandon recovering some more of his dictation since the shock.<br>\r\n\u201cBecause the babies make mommy very hungry and I just ate a lot,\u201d said Ashley in the same voice and to Brandon\u2019s horror (and another feeling that he tried to quash down) she pulled up the dress to reveal her belly in all its glory. Her fair skin stretch over a bulge the size of a beach ball free of stretch marks but with one or two freckles from her youth.<br>\r\n\u201cI-I-I\u2026I need to lay down some more,\u201d said Brandon standing up abruptly, \u201cstill a bit dizzy from that bump on the head earlier.\u201d<br>\r\nBrandon went to his room as fast as he could, he was so shocked with the growth of his mother\u2019s belly he didn\u2019t notice the only other person that was aware of it, Katie patted the book in her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon frantically looked around his room for the instruction manual of the amulet, it was on his bedside table and now it was missing, he should have read it properly before even if it just was for the pictures. After exhausting himself looking for it, with no avail, Brandon collapsed on his bed and fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile down stairs everyone else had their desert, \u201cWoo, that enough,\u201d said Ashley finishing off Brandon\u2019s desert (as it was apparent that he had turned in for the night by the time she had finished her own) \u201cIf I have any more I burst,\u201d she continued patting her still bare belly.<br>\r\n\u201cYou look it,\u201d said Sarah to herself, getting up, \u201cI going to bed now,\u201d she said to the room as a whole.<br>\r\n\u201cGoodnight Honey,\u201d said Ashley.<br>\r\n\u201cI should go home too,\u201d said Katie \u2018accidently\u2019 brushing Ashley belly as she stood up.<br>\r\n\u201cDo you need a lift home?\u201d said Ashley.<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be nice I don\u2019t think the train I caught here isn\u2019t running at this time, could you?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell I can\u2019t obviously,\u201d said Ashley and gave a brief laugh, \u201cTanner should able to.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI live on Oak road.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI know where that is,\u201d said Tanner Page, \u201cI\u2019ll just get the car out of the garage; I\u2019ll see you in about half an hour.\u201d <br>\r\nThis last bit was directed at his wife who said, \u201cI be waiting,\u201d in coquettish tones that Tanner failed to register otherwise he would have taken a lot longer to get back in the hope Ashley would be asleep by then. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame we didn\u2019t get a chance to more but the babies can\u2019t be ignored,\u201d said Ashley pulling the dress back down over her belly before standing up, with Katie\u2019s assistance before walking out toward the front door.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll sure there be another time we cou\u2026\u201d began Katie but trailed off at the sight of the amulet that Sarah had and now left on the desk next to the front door, Katie knew it to be the same as the one pictured on the cover of the instruction manual and that Brandon had used on his mother at dinner.<br>\r\n\u201cOf course like when the babies are born,\u201d said Ashley.<br>\r\n\u201cUhuh,\u201d said Katie looking at Ashley and nodding whilst really focusing on picking up the amulet, she needn\u2019t of tried so hard as Ashley was unable to see her own feet little lone Katie reaching for the amulet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Katie\u2019s fingers grasped it and rammed it into her pocket Ashely\u2019s belly gurgled and swelled for the second time that night, the dress riding up so far it was fast becoming a shirt, a sliver of pale skin could be seen as it rode up her belly.<br>\r\n\u201cWell Tanner has probably got the car ready, \u201cI should get ready for when he gets back,\u201d she said giving Katie a wink before waddling up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Tanner Page got home, as he said about half an hour later, he was looking forward to going to bed he had a long day at work and he was going to have to take Ashley and Sarah to their fitness or yoga class or whatever it was called. He entered his and Ashley\u2019s room and saw it lit by mood lighting, Ashley was lounging on the bed as best she could, given her current condition, wearing a frilly bra and panties. \u201cBrandon and Sarah are both asleep and so are the rest of the children,\u201d she said patting her belly, \u201cwe\u2019ve got the night to ourselves.\u201d Tanner wanted to go to sleep he really did, but his wife not going let him yet and he dared not refuse and provoke a mood swing not whilst she was pregnant especially this pregnant. Whilst Ashely had fewer wrinkles since becoming pregnant and had fuller breasts and hips Tanner Page didn\u2019t share his son\u2019s attraction to pregnant women and the fact that his wife appeared to have double in size and weight since become pregnant most of which was in the belly (which seemed a bit bigger to him since he dropped Katie home) was a major turn off to him. But since she was taking up most off the bed, he wasn\u2019t going to get to sleep until he satisfied her. <br>\r\n\u201cUh yeah, let\u2019s get started then.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ashley woke up slowly, stretching and rubbing her belly. She couldn't exactly roll over with her massive belly, but she was in a good enough spot that she could see around her room. Ashely had taken to sleeping on her back because if she slept on one side, her sextuplet-filled belly would hang off the side of the bed and if she turned the other way, her husband wouldn't have enough room to sleep. Sure, with six full-grown babies inside her, lying on her back added a lot of weight on top of Ashely that wasn't entirely pleasant, but with some well-placed pillows, she did alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scooted up so she could sit up in bed, both hands on her belly, looking over at her husband disapprovingly. He was still asleep, clutching as much of the bed's covers as he could. Ashley put her hands on her hips and pouted. Last night was the first time in many months Ashley even had an opportunity for sex and it was the first time she'd had sex while pregnant. And Tanner couldn't have been less interested. It was like her pregnant body disgusted him. Ashley sighed and stroked her wide curves. She'd never thought about adultery before but...things were different during a pregnancy. Especially one like this. Hell, Ashely was still surprised camera crews weren't over her 24/7, asking about her impressive pregnancy. She thought at least TLC would want to make a reality show about the house with a mother and daughter who are both pregnant with five or more babies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanner grumbled in his sleep and rolled over a little, bumping against Ashley's belly and quickly turning the other way. She pouted some more, returning her hands to her big bulge. <i>You would have enough room to sleep if you'd spoon with me like I suggested</i>, Ashley thought to herself. <i>Seems adultery is going to have to be the way to go. There must be </i>someone <i>nearby who's attracted to pregnant women. And for that one person, I must be every Victoria's Secret model and superstar actress rolled into one...</i> Ashley chuckled to herself at the prospect of finding someone, anyone, who was that attracted to her belly and stroked her hugeness more sensually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the little ones inside her started kicking and Ashley groaned softly, heaving herself out of bed, one leg first, then the other, sitting on the edge of the bed as she caught her breath. Her movement shook the bed and woke her husband up. \"Oh...g'morning, Ashley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning,\" Ashley said through her teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...I think that until the babies are born, we should think about sleeping in different beds,\" Tanner said. \"You know, I don't want my tossing and turning to keep you awake. You need all the sleep you can get at this point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sleep isn't what I need</i>, Ashley thought, cursing that she was too big to turn around and stare daggers at the man who put these six inside her. \"Maybe that's for the best,\" Ashely said, pretending to smile kindly. \"But I get this bed. You can take the guest room. Downstairs.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanner nodded. \"That's fair. Well, what do you have planned for today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one big push, Ashley heaved her huge pregnant body off of the bed and waddled to the bathroom, scratching and stroking her proportionally-inflated ass. \"I need to help Sarah buy some maternity clothes at the mall and I like to spend time there too,\" she said, wondering if she could pick up any handsome men at the mall. Maybe Sarah would steal away all the pregnant fetishists. \"I'll drag Brandon along too. He hates it but he's helpful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanner rubbed his eyes. \"Sounds good, sounds good,\" he said, conflicted between his desire to see Ashely and Sarah wear clothes that cover up their gross big, round bellies and his knowledge of how much those maternity clothes were costing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie woke up in bed suddenly, looking around before seeing the book and amulet in her hands. She grinned nervously. It wasn't a dream. Somehow she'd really come across some kind of magical artifact that let her control pregnancies in people. Reading through the guidebook and thinking about the things she could do to pregnant women, Katie got so aroused it started to drain her energy. When she got to the handy illustrations of women with up to 8 and more babies inside them, it was too much for her to handle and she fell asleep right there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now, Katie was eager to test it out on the people around her, especially at her job at the maternity clothing store at the mall. She giggled and looked at the strange and beautiful amulet in the sunlight. Truthfully, she'd read enough of the manual to know how to use it on herself, but it was either fear or greed, but she only wanted to watch pregnancy spring forth in another woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd only woman came to her mind: Ashley Page. That's probably why she was as big as she was in the first place: for some reason, she had this amulet with her and it doubtlessly gave her the fertility goddess belly that she had. Her daughter had a nice big belly too, even bigger than Ashley's when she came in the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie quickly got showered and dressed, hoping that she might get to see some members of the Page family again and see if her reading of the amulet's manual was accurate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah woke up as she normally did: grumbling, rubbing her belly and hoping that today was the day she went into labor and wouldn't have to carry this load around anymore. But, with any luck, she'd last another month or so with a huge quintuplet tummy, getting glaring looks when she tried to walk around, not being able to do the things she used to, not even fitting in some doorways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she tried to get up, another round of sharp kicking resounded throughout her swollen womb. Sarah groaned and rubbed and rubbed, trying to quiet her brood to no avail. \"Ugh, the only thing that calmed these brats down was a belly rub from Brandon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah stopped and thought about it. Yeah, come to think of it...that did calm them down and let Sarah have the first good sleep in a long time. But no, she couldn't ask him to do that again. Besides, Brandon was a total dweeb! Three kicks, one in each kidney and one in the bladder, made Sarah bend over and want to run to the bathroom all at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No choice, I guess,\" Sarah groaned, looking in the mirror and making sure she was in a good enough condition. She had on a grey woolen sleeveless top that just managed to conceal her swollen, F-cup breasts, but at least allowed enough padding to leave a lot up the the imagination. Her belly, on the other hand, had no mystery surrounding it, aside from maybe \"how does she stay upright with that thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround her also-growing ass was a pair of black booty shorts that ironically still fit, miraculously. Sarah sighed and figured this was good enough. Waddling down the hall, she knocked on her dorky brother's door, looking nervously over at the door just a few feet down the hall where her even more-bloated mother slept. After a few moments, Brandon cautiously opened the door, looking at his sister surprised. \"Sarah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hi Brandon,\" Sarah said, looking away and trying not to blush as brightly as she was. \"Um, the...babies are kicking a lot and I was wondering if you could try and...rub and quiet them down? You have a...knack for this, it seems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon started to shake nervously, wishing he had pajama bottoms that did a better job to conceal what may become an erection. \"S-sure, come inside,\" he said, opening the door as widely as he could to let Sarah squeeze inside. One hand was already rested on her belly and she could feel the kicks staying strong. \"Um, sit on the bed, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could sit next to me,\" Sarah said. \"Y-you know, if you want. I think that would be easiest.\" Brandon nodded and sat down beside his pregnant sister, moving one hand to her belly and rubbing in slow circles. Sarah hated to admit it, but it felt great and the kicking quickly died down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon looked over his sister's belly as she closed her eyes in bliss. When he saw that she was just breathing rhythmically, he gulped and took a look at her chest too. It was true: pregnancy made everything bigger. But no! This was his sister! His sister who was always mean to him, might he add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doing okay?\" Sarah asked, opening  one eye curiously. \"You stopped rubbing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah,\" Brandon said. \"Everything's fine.\" He moved both hands to her hugeness and rubbed slowly, which forced Sarah to let a little coo sneak out. \"Um, Sarah, do you know about something called...PregTech?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PregTech?\" Sarah said, opening both eyes and looking at her brother curiously. \"No, why? Is that some kind of maternity brand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I dunno,\" Brandon said, turning red. \"I just keep having this dream where you're involved with something called PregTech and it's related to the work you're doing now. I thought it was a weird coincedence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're around two huge pregnant women all the time now so something's probably going to seep in there,\" Sarah said with a tiny grin, tapping Brandon on the forehead. \"But you can tell me about your dream on the drive to the mall. Something tells me Mom wants to go back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably,\" Brandon said, smiling, glad to have a nice talk with his sister. \"So, feeling better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looked down at her belly and stood up, flustered. \"Y-yeah, fine! I mean...thanks. Whatever,\" she waddled out the door as quickly as she could, leaving Brandon to blush as well, embarrassed at his dumb question about a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I hadn't found that damn necklace, none of this would have...wait a minute,\" Brandon said, looking around the room. He knew he lost the manual, but he couldn't have sworn he still had the amulet. He looked and looked but something deep down inside him told him it was gone. \"Well..this isn't good.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He could imagine her in the morning sun, bathing in the light, rubbing sun tan oil on her huge be- \"SSTTOOPPPP\" Sarah shouted at Brandon, causing him to push down on the breaks. Brandon noticed he had almost ran over Arcee, Ms Strong's cat. The cat scampered over to 76 trimesta lane. Sarah almost slapped Brandon over the head, but then thought against it. He has been better lately, she thought, I should cut him some slack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brandon!\" Ashley said in her harsh tone \" when we get back you are going to go and apologise to ms Strong, she may be Sarah's age but she is very anxious, oh I'm sorry, I shouldn't be yelling\" Ashley's mood swings were starting up again, and it was all Tanner's stupid fault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they came close to the mall, Brandon's phone started going off like crazy. \" Sarah, can you see who is messaging me?\" Brandon said turning into the car park. Sarah picked up the phone and saw the list of unread messages. Two from rick, one from Joel and 7 FROM ERIN? \"Uh you have a couple of messages from your work mate\" she said casually scrolling \" Joel your 'bro' wants to know if you are coming to tonight's premiere of kick-puncher and I think Erin is stalking you.\" Halting the car Brandon snatched the phone from her, an objective \"hey!\" Coming from his pregnant sister, Brandon saw in big red alerting letters &lt;EMERGENCY, PLEASE COME, IM STUCK&gt;. \" okay, I need you guys to head out the door now\" Brandon anxiously said trying to heard them off. <br>\r\n\"I'm afraid it will take a bit more than that\" Ashley stated pointing to her large belly as Brandon parked the car. Getting out Brandon helped Ashley heave out of the car, by try three they were successful. Sarah was disappointed, she was hoping to get to know her brother a bit more today. Coming over to her side, Brandon couldn't help but gaze upon his gorgeous sist- no, he couldn't think like that, it was wrong. Opening the doors, he closed his eyes as he helped the pregnant beauty out of the car. \"Hey!\" She protested \" I'm not a monster, you can open your eyes\".  Brandon opened his eyes to see a large amount of cleavage with something familiar stuck in there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Sarah,\" Brandon said curiously\" did you by any chance get an amulet of your own?\". Sarah looked down to see the red gems shining in the light of the parking lot. \" oh yeah, I found this one after yours accidentally broke, did you want it?\" She asked.<br>\r\n\" No it's cool, I just can't find mine that's all.\" Brandon replied as he returned to his car. \" I'll catch you guys later.\" He said driving back to Erin's, leaving them 2 feet from the malls entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA security camera had captured the entire conversation. A man in a black turtle net and pants walked up to a shadowy figure sitting drinking a cup of tea. \" it's as you suspected master, every time the amulet breaks, the energy seeps out and forms a replica close by. Are you sure the energy is stable?\" The figure used their left hand, giving a serious of hand gestures. \" okay master, phase 2 will begin in 4 days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie was had just started her shift when Sarah and Ashley waltzed in. Shoot! She thought. I need more time to prepare!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Erin's text was accurate. She was stuck. Brandon stood in surprise, looking at Erin in between the door frames in her bedroom, her belly pinning her in there as she stood sideways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought that if I tried anything, it could hurt the baby,\" Erin blushed, phone in hand, luckily, so she could text someone to help her out. \"I guess I still can't get used to being so...big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not that big,\" Brandon said, trying to think of a safe way to slide Erin out. It didn't help that she was wearing a thin grey t-shirt that covered about half of her belly and a pair of cute, frilly blue underwear with no pants. The shirt showed off her wide maternal curves. While Erin was \"only\" pregnant with one baby, she could have passed for twins easily, her belly an impressive 44 inches around, her popped-out belly button showing under the shirt too. \"Compared to my mom and sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin gave a little laugh as Brandon cautiously put his hands around her belly, turning her gently until she was no longer stuck. \"Thanks,\" Erin said quietly, her eyes welling up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I hurt you?\" Brandon said, not sure how to console her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no you're great,\" Erin said, her voice wavering. \"I just...I'm huge, I ache, and I'm going to have to take care of a baby when this is all over.\" Now the tears started to really stream and Erin put her arm over her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon gulped, unsure what to say. He wanted to wrap his friend up in his arms, tell her he always had a crush on her and tell her how smart, fun, and amazing she is, plus how good she looked pregnant, but he knew that wouldn't make things better. \"Erin, you...you're one of the smartest and coolest people I know and you're incredibly strong. If anyone can handle taking care of a child, it's you. And any kid you raise is probably going to...I dunno, grow up to be a superhero or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin let out a little laugh as she wrapped Brandon up in a big hug, her belly pressing against him, getting dangerously close to his growing erection. \"Thanks, Brandon. You're always so nice to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCautiously, Brandon wrapped his arms around Erin too. \"H-hey, anytime. And besides, you won't exactly be alone with raising a new baby. I'm sure my mom or Sarah would give you help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin squeezed the hug a little before leaning back, giving a sniffle but still smiling. \"Good idea. At least I'm not pregnant with quintuplets, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah,\" Brandon laughed, imagining his crush with a belly the size of his mother's and turning even redder. Erin's shirt was covered in tear strains that matched the contours of her swelling breasts. \"So, still want to go to the mall and pick out some maternity clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin nodded and put her hands on her hips. \"Yeah, definitely. As you can see, I don't really have anything that fits.\" Brandon looked over her half-naked pregnant body at her direction until she crossed her arms over her belly and crossed her legs. \"Well geez, don't look too much to confirm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\" Brandon blushed, looking up squarely at Erin's face, which was clearly smiling mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just teasing you, although you should step out while I change into my clothes for walking around outside,\" Erin said, gesturing to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. I guess this is what I deserve for catching you in your pajamas,\" Brandon said, walking into the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, I just wore these to stay covered up while I waited for you. With this big belly and how hot it makes me sometimes, I just sleep naked now,\" she said, just as she closed the bedroom door, leaving Brandon with a very vivid image in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the maternity clothing store, Katie was looking at the amulet in her hands, tracing its design with her fingers. Unlike Brandon, she'd read over the instructions pretty carefully and committed as much as she could to memory. The possibilities of letting women trade or accumulate pregnancies at Katie's discretion was a very appealing ability, considering Katie's own healthy interest in pregnant women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how to use it? There was a limit to how many times Katie could just \"make\" a woman pregnant. Eventually, she would need to start \"borrowing\" from other pregnant women, although working at a maternity clothing store, that wouldn't be too hard. Katie also didn't want to make herself pregnant, at least not yet. It would be more fun to give herself some pregnant \"eye candy:\" women of all different ages, races, looks waddling around her store with four, five, six full-term babies in their wombs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katie!\" the manager, Laura Moore, barked, making Katie stand on-end. \"Stop daydreaming at work. You do that all the time.\" Laura was, appropriately, a full-term pregnant woman, actually carrying twins. Normally, Katie would be gawking at her all the time, but Laura was a mean, grouchy boss who yelled at employees constantly. Well, she'd been tolerable before, but as her pregnancy progressed, Laura got grumpier and grumpier. This turned Katie off, making her prefer to stare and attend the nice, smiling pregnant customers the store had. Still, there were plenty of nights where Katie fantasized about a dominatrix Laura, belly and all, chastising Katie and making her work at Laura's beck and call to make up for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry,\" Katie said, hiding the amulet back under her shirt, bumping against it accidentally. Laura's belly suddenly vanished as the amulet began to glow some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's alright,\" Laura said calmly. \"It's a slow day today after all. And when customers are in, you're always so helpful and personable with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Katie said, feeling like something changed but she couldn't quite put her finger on it. And why did she have this distinct image in her head of Laura with a big pregnant belly in a leather bikini and fishnet stockings?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't have to search her mind for answers as her new favorite customer came waddling in: Ashley walked into the wide mall store, a big smile on her face, with Sarah following her closely, obviously and clearly less enthusiastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katie!\" Ashley said, her arms open but not reaching beyond her massive belly. \"Good to see you again. As you can see, the clothes we picked out before don't exactly...fit as well as we thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes, I see,\" Katie said, stroking her chin nervously as she saw the mother and daughter bellies, both straining their designer maternity clothes. \"To be honest, we don't have many clothes that could probably fit you too. Although the clothes we got you, Mrs. Page, might fit your daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley and Sarah both looked at one another. \"That's true,\" Ashely said. \"Weird, it's almost like I bought clothes exactly for a quadruplet pregnancy instead. May we duck into the changing room quickly to test that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" Katie said. \"I'll be waiting right here for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, come with us so she doesn't make me run back and forth between the dressing room and the rest of the store to ask you what you think,\" Sarah said, Katie shuddered and followed the two into the changing room, moving one hand to her amulet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ashley and Sarah undressed, both letting their bare bellies hang out as the rest of them was squeezed into maternity underwear that was starting to not fit either, Katie made her move, pressing the right parts of the Preg-Transferer. Right before her eyes, Laura's twins were transported into each of them, their bellies swelling gracefully, as did the rest of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah pulled her mother's top over her head, looking down at the strained fabric that she tried to pull all the way over her belly, unsuccessfully. \"Just as I thought. Too small for a quintuplet pregnancy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you definitely won't have anything for a six-baby belly,\" Ashley sighed with a smile, rubbing her hugeness. \"Do you, Katie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie didn't respond, still shocked that the amulet really worked. The damage to the Preg-Transferer was starting to show and memory was no longer being rewritten for Katie quite the same was as it used to be. In that moment, she could definitely tell that their bellies had grown and it was thanks to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I'll just own it,\" Ashley said with pride. \"I'll wear clothes that show off the belly. But I still want to try and buy from you. Show me your cutest clothes for a woman with a more typical pregnancy, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhmm,\" Katie said dumbly, the possibilities the amulet could allow her piling up in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDriving Erin's car, Brandon looked over as he saw his friend clutch her belly, rubbing it slowly. \"Something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure,\" Erin said, looking off toward the mall, which was just a block away at this point. \"It feels like something...changed. I can't put my finger on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird,\" Brandon said, unaware of just how weird the changes in his life were about to be.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Katie was in shock, she gazed upon the 2 heavily pregnant women after their recent expansions. Sarah was trying her best to put the shirt on to no avail. Amanda resided to just leaving to sitting down in her maternity pants and incredibly large bra. \"Damn it!\" Sarah grunted in struggle, \" I feel like a Tagrem in this thing\". Katie shook her head at the mention of the word Tagrem. \" what was that?\" Katie asked in confusion. \" I said I feel trapped in this thing, do you have anything larger?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I um, I will go check\" Katie answered leaving the nearly half naked pregnant bombshells in their compromising positions. Katie had read in the history section of the Amulets instruction manual about the 4 original pregnant women of Tagrem and the 3 warrior men of the plateau. As she reached up for the XXXL shirts she recalled the abandoned son and death of the traitor. Returning to the stall she remembered the time wave and how women in the times of legend cried on the day of the vanishing. Walking in Katie was crying heavily as she handed each of the women the bright blue maternity shirts. \" honey! What's wrong?\" Amanda said slowly getting up and waddling over to the crying employee. \" nothing, I-I just, I don't know why I am crying!\" Katie cried, with the quiver of her lower lip and tears rolling down her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Erin and Brandon drove closer to the mall, Brandon looked over to Erin sitting there rubbing her belly. \" I swear this shirt fit this morning\" Erin stated trying to bring her sleeves down \" I was meant to grow taller during puberty, not in my early twenties.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" maybe your dads smoking stunted your growth\" Brandon joked, Erin looked at him smugly. Jokingly she punched him, However Brandon screamed in pain as she made contact. \" oh my god! Are you okay? I only tapped you!\" Erin said in concern<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" you kidding me?!\" Brandon winced, \" it felt like my arm was smashed by the hulk\". Erin looked at Brandon, he did exercise a bit, he wasn't overly muscular, but he should be able to take a punch. She looked at her guns to see them normal and slender. \"Hmm, maybe that was what's wrong\" she said as the car entered the parking lot. 10 minutes later they were walking towards the maternity store, when Brandon's friends Joel and Grant  came out of no where. \" So this is why you can't go to dnd night huh?\" Grant said adjusting his glasses whilst looking at Erin's belly. \" Congratulations, I'm Grant\" he charmly said whilst shaking Erin's hand gently. \" nice to meet you\" Erin said as the short tanned man shook her hand. \" I do remember Joel though, who can forgot what you did at Brandys birthday last year\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel's eyes lit up at the name 'Brandy'. \" well, Brandon has forgiven me for that, but I still think his mother liked it\" Brandon grunted at his pale tall mate. \" I was gunna see if you are busy to come to Grant's and play some more of the game, but I can see you have to take care of Erin, her womb, I errr mean, her hands are full\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" keep it in your pants Joel.\" Brandon joked \" I might come tonight\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" okay have fun picking out clothes 'Brandy' \" Joel came back laughing as they left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naw you okay?\" Erin asked very lightly patting him on the shoulder. \" you shouldn't let Joel get to you like that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Erin and Brandon came closer to the store, Erin's amulet started to hum. Erin had forgotten about picking it up after it slid off the bathroom sink earlier that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Amanda saw Erin's breasts vibrating through her shirt as they walked out, \" um, Sarah, I think someone's calling you\" Amanda concernly whispered to her daughter. Sarah looked down to her large assets and reached in the v neck hole to pull out the amulet, \" oh it's just this gizmo I found in my room, looks like that thing Brandon had, I just wish I remembered it's name...\" She replied putting it back into her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Katie could feel the same vibration in her pocket. \" oh no, it's about to start! \" Katie worryingly said to herself, as Amanda went back into the change rooms Brandon and Erin waltz in. The vibrations got larger and larger, strangely enough Erin and Sarah weren't noticing it, however Katie could. \"Erin!\" Sarah called as she waddled over to her friend. Erin saw her friend and started waddling to her too. As they made contact a the amulets illuminated, Katie saw all this happen, she could see something was about to happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to leave but seeing those two hug each other was making her weak in the knees. Slowly she walked over towards the two, almost against her will. Sarah looked over and saw Katie heading towards them, \" come Katie, join in the magic\" Sarah said in monotone. Katie couldn't resist, she went in for the hug. At that instance there was a flash of light that surrounded the store.  When all was finished.......</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Katie\u2019s mind was still spinning with the possibilities that she could do with the amulet, she could just keep taking babies and putting them into the Page women, there was something about the them it was the way the two women had completely different reactions to their extremely gravid situation; Ashley was sunny excited even though she was currently pregnant with more children than most women have in their lifetimes, whilst Sarah was bitter and sullen with the brood she was carrying. She could give all of the babies from one of them to the other, Katie wasn\u2019t sure how many they were each carrying but she was sure together it was double digits, or she could store them up in amulet and give them all at once to a woman free of child and watch her burst out of her clothes. Whatever she decided to do she needed to keep taking the pregnancies of the other women who came into the shop and preferably keep both the Page women around. Katie was unsure how easy it would be to keep Ashely and Sarah in the shop, Ashley seemed like she would stay until natured called or she was hungry, whilst Sarah looked as though she didn\u2019t want to leave her room little lone the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie came back from the store room (despite Ashley\u2019s wishes that she didn\u2019t rush back and forward) and gave some boxes to Ashley, \u201cThese are some maternity shirts from\u2026 a typical pregnancy they should cover up the important bits,\u201d Ashley gleefully took the boxes and went to try on the contents. \u201cWe don\u2019t seem to carry stock to cover a women as\u2026advanced as you and your mother,\u201d continued Katie picking her words carefully, \u201cbut if you are looking for something to cover you up we do have a variety of dresses.\u201d Katie couldn\u2019t tell which negative emotion flashed across Sarah\u2019s face; anger, sadness, embarrassment or all of them, at the news that her belly was so big that she had to start using dresses as shirts, but she nodded none the less. Katie stalled as long as she dared, without arousing Sarah\u2019s suspicion, watching Ashley get changed before going to collect the clothes for Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon and Erin pulled into the mall\u2019s car park, whatever seemed to have unnerved Erin had past, for now.  Erin sat in the seat that had been vacated by Sarah, whilst Erin was running a bit big for a women with one, looking like she was expecting twins, her size in relation to his sister became apparent when Erin sat down in the seat, at the start of the journey, with over a foot distance between her belly and the dashboard. \u201cI take it your mom was the last person in this seat?\u201d said Erin.<br>\r\n\u201cActually my sister,\u201d said Brandon sheepishly.<br>\r\n\u201cI expect you must get tired of them complaining about their size, and must be really annoyed at me complaining about my size when I am so small in comparison to them.\u201d<br>\r\nBrandon instant when into condolence mode, \u201cNo you\u2019re not small you\u2019re\u2026\u201d he stopped as he realised what he was saying, \u201c\u2026I mean I\u2019m not annoyed at you.\u201d<br>\r\nErin gave a  laugh, \u201cI know I\u2019m huge, but I should happy that I\u2019m not having as many as you mother or sister, it\u2019s going to be hard enough raising this one without a father.\u201d Brandon started getting the grating jealously feeling again at the fact someone was the father. <br>\r\nThen it faded as he realised that Erin pregnancy was probably caused by the amulet, \u2018it would explain why no one, not even Erin herself, knew who the father was,\u2019 he thought to himself. \u2018If only I had the amulet and manual I could make her think I was the father and then we could\u2026\u2019 but both the amulet and manual were missing. Brandon knew he saw the amulet or one very similar somewhere else but he couldn\u2019t think where unaware that Erin was wearing one right next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you go, they\u2019re mostly pale neutral colours,\u201d said Katie returning from the store room with the dresses for Sarah, it was at that point Ashley turned around. Katie was right in that the shirt covered the important bits, and it was also was what Ashley had asked for in the form of being something cute that showed her belly off. The shirt was a light pink and tautly covered her breast, that had begun to get ready for breast feeding, then the shirt in contrast got scrunched up between her breasts and belly, on the shirt was writing in garish fluro pink letters that clashed with shirt\u2019s main colour suggesting that it was meant for someone much younger then Ashley, this was further supported by the word \u2018princess\u2019 which was the only word visible. It was probably meant to be a midriff bearing shirt for someone still relatively early in their pregnancy and it still was midriff bearing, it was just Ashley had a lot more midriff than a full term women. Her belly stuck out proudly as large and as round as a beach ball including her popped navel as the nozzle, still devoid of stretch marks. Katie had to stop herself from reaching out and touching it, it was pretty likely though that Ashley would be ok with it, she seemed to like attention to her current gravid shape.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d said Ashley cradling her stomach as best she could and checking herself out in the mirror.<br>\r\n\u201cMom I think you look ridiculous,\u201d said Sarah.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think Katie?\u201d asked Ashley pointedly ignoring her daughter\u2019s comment.<br>\r\n\u201cI-I think you look very\u2026nice,\u201d said Katie nervously, \u201cvery youthful,\u201d she said with more confidence.<br>\r\nThis seemed to hit the right note with Ashley who beamed and said, \u201cYou really think so?\u201d so happily it was almost gleeful.<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGreat, in that case I\u2019ll take the lot, how about you Sarah found anything you like?\u201d<br>\r\nKatie was shocked, \u2018they can\u2019t leave yet\u2019, \u201cdon\u2019t you want to try the rest on first?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t they the same size?\u201d asked Ashley.<br>\r\n\u201cYes but don\u2019t you want to see if they\u2019ll look as good on you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI trust your judgement.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about shorts, dress and other clothes?\u201d said Katie desperately.<br>\r\n\u201cHmm I suppose you\u2019re right not point only half of me looking new and refreshed. Besides it\u2019s not like we can go until Brandon comes back, I can\u2019t believe dumped us here and went off to spend time with Joel?\u201d said Ashely a cloud crossing her otherwise sunny personality.<br>\r\n\u201cI think he actually went to spend time with Erin,\u201d said Sarah.<br>\r\n\u201cI thought I told him not see her or any member of that family,\u201d said Ashley, the clouds darking, \u201cdo you know that it was helping them fix the plumbing to their pool that he hit his head, why couldn\u2019t that woman fix it herself? And why does he spend so much time with their daughter?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cProbably because she\u2019s pregnant,\u201d said Sarah but Ashely wasn\u2019t listening too caught up in her own dislike of the Parkers. Katie heard it though and made a mental note of Ashley\u2019s dislike of the Parkers who had a pregnant daughter and that Brandon apparently had a liking for pregnant women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that point that\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Katie needed to see if the amulet could affect someone else, unfortunately for her the only other pregnant women in sight were Ashley and Sarah.

Again the amulet failed to work, there was no sparking or flashing lights that gave any indication that it was broken or anything and it didn\u2019t have a sound that normally heralded its use. \u201cuh\u2026Why don\u2019t I get those things to the check out for you,\u201d she said before hurriedly grabbing the clothes\u2019 boxes and dumping them on the counter before continuing on to the back room where she kept the manual in her bag.<br>\r\nAs Katie headed off Ashley turned around to see what she had been looking at and saw her son and Erin which caused her eyes to narrow in anger.<br>\r\n\u201cBrandon can I talk to you for a second,\u201d said Ashley in icy tones, again pronouncing a question as a statement.<br>\r\nBrandon not wanting to causing a scene\u2026well any more of a scene than his mother and sister pregnant with nearly a dozen babies between them getting changed caused, walked over to Ashley who turned herself slightly putting her belly between Erin and the rest of her so she could talk to her children (who weren\u2019t currently occupying her) without Erin hearing.<br>\r\n\u201cI told you not to hang around members of that family,\u201d said Ashley crossly.<br>\r\n\u201cBut mom, she\u2019s pregnant and needs my help,\u201d protested Brandon.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m expecting at least three times as many children as she is, and your sister isn\u2019t far behind, and \u2018we\u2019 need your help, she\u2019s got her own family to look after her.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut Mom\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo buts, now take her home before coming back here to pick your sister and me up.\u201d<br>\r\nBrandon was furious, \u2018he wasn\u2019t a taxi\u2019 but he didn\u2019t say anything as his mother looked like she would explode (more so than usual) if he answered back, he nodded before heading off.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m all done now mom, I\u2019ll pay for my clothes and go with Brandon,\u201d said Sarah.<br>\r\n\u201cNo no I\u2019ll pay for them when I purchase mine,\u201d said Ashley, she turned to Katie, who just came back with some clothes in her arms and the manual in her pocket, and asked, \u201cthat\u2019s ok isn\u2019t it?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d said Katie, it wasn\u2019t but as along as the money was paid before Laura found out Katie saw no harm. <br>\r\n\u201cWait up,\u201d said Sarah waddling after Brandon and Erin.<br>\r\n\u201cI sure hope these little ones are better at doing what their told,\u201d crooned Ashley rubbing her belly, she turned around to Katie still carrying some pieces of clothing, \u201cWhat do you have for me?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cJeans,\u201d replied Katie passing them over, where upon Ashley set about trying them on.<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of struggling with the denim Ashley said, \u201cAre they meant to be so tight?\u201d<br>\r\n Katie, who was too busy paying attention to Ashley\u2019s body to notice what she was saying, took a second before she realised what Ashley had said \u201c\u2026what?\u2026oh yes tight fit jeans are all the rage.\u201d <br>\r\nTight jeans were all the rage, it was just that the jeans that Katie had given to Ashley to try on weren\u2019t tight fit jeans except that they were. They were labelled as loose fit and this was still apparent by the cuff at the bottom, but Ashley\u2019s upper thighs and particularly her backside had stretch the fabric of the upper jeans taut and made it extremely difficult to do up even under her belly. \u201cHow do I look?\u201d said Ashley giving her rump a slap and trying the best she could to look at herself from behind in the mirror.<br>\r\n\u201cVery nice\u2026very youthful,\u201d said Katie. It was true, whilst the clothes still looked too young for Ashley they did take at least a decade off her appearance.<br>\r\nAshley beamed at Katie\u2019s words, \u201cfantastic I take two pairs, then I\u2019ll go grab a bite to eat.\u201d<br>\r\nKatie would have tried and stopped her from leaving before but she needed time to sort out what was going on with the amulet, so she packed up all purchases which came to a pretty hefty price and not for the first time Katie wondered how Ashley was able to afford all these clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was back in the front passenger\u2019s seat much to Brandon\u2019s dismay as this meant he was unable to see Erin as she was sitting behind him, because Sarah\u2019s seat was pushed so far back that she was closer of being level to Erin in the rear seats. It was a quite trip but Brandon did say after they left the mall\u2019s car park, \u201cI\u2019ll drop you back off home first Sarah?\u201d he said to her or more accurately the part of her belly that was next to him. Sarah gave a committal noise, had it been Ashley she would of made sure Erin was dropped off first but Sarah wanted to get home the sooner the better even if it was just a minute.<br>\r\nThey pulled up outside the Page\u2019s house a few minutes later and Sarah, despite her size, was able to get out of the car and was on her way to the front door before Brandon was able to get around to the other side of the car and open the door for her. He instead  put himself to opening the door for Erin, and leading her around to the seat vacated by Sarah.<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, I can walk home from here,\u201d started Erin.<br>\r\n\u201cWe could hang out for a bit before you go home can\u2019t we?\u201d asked Brandon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley finished off her lunch, she had gone for a large burger meal again, several large burger meals, Ashley wasn\u2019t sure how many but their packets now littered the table and surrounding floor, needless to say her \u2018bite to eat\u2019 cost quite a bit of money, currently her wallet seemed to be shrinking almost as fast as she was growing. She had attracted quite a lot of stares from people around her, obviously a woman of her age, pregnant with half a dozen eating the same amount of food in one sitting that some families eat in one day is bound to attract stares, but to Ashley\u2019s delight she could see that some of the stares had something more than disgust or shock in them.<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me Mrs could I ask you something?\u201d Ashley turned her head to see a man in his thirties standing next to her, and to Ashley\u2019s delight a vague hunger in his eyes.<br>\r\nAshley put on her most sultry voice and was surprised about how easy it came. \u201cThat depends, on what you have in mind?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Rodney Franklen, reporter for The Local Globe, the city\u2019s best newspaper, (he said with the conviction that only a dedicated employee could) and I was wondering if I could take a picture of you and ask you a few quick questions for an article?\u201d<br>\r\nAshley\u2019s heart sank, along with her hormone levels as she realised what the hunger in the man\u2019s eye was really about, but she quickly recovered.<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d she said turning around in her chair and sticking out her belly the best she could from a sitting position, which was quite a lot given her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie Flick through the pages of the manual to the amulet, 'why didn\u2019t it work before?' it was able to take Laura\u2019s unborn children and give them to Ashley and Sarah moments before hand why wasn\u2019t it able to take the babies off Sarah or that Erin girl. The best she idea she could come up with was that Laura\u2019s pregnancy was natural and the other were created by the amulet. It didn\u2019t explain why Ashley babies had been shifted around before but it was a theory and one that she could test out.<br>\r\nIt was that point two women entered the shop bellies clearly laden with child and wearing pit stained lycra and sweats suggesting that they just finished some sort of work out. Both of these women had attended Mamaste: Prenatal Exercise for Mother and Child, in fact one was Janice the class instructor.<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t really think getting new clothes are going to help Sasha,\u201d said Janice as she and her friend waddled between the racks.<br>\r\n\u201cIt will really help bring you out more.\u201d<br>\r\nKatie took aim and pressed the amulet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha\u2019s belly deflated just as Janice's ballooned, her lyrca tank top retreating over the surface of her belly leaving the bulging pink orb visible to the world.<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to be brought out more,\u201d snapped Janice, the extra occupant not helping her demeanour, \u201cI\u2019m already very out, I just want that jerk to accept his response abilities.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t take it out on me,\u201d said Sasha slightly disgruntled herself.<br>\r\nKatie then tried to use the amulet to remove Janice\u2019s unborn pair, but there was no ping and Janice remained swollen with twins. Well she did waste a pair of babies to give the Page women but she now knew something more about the amulet, now to see to the customer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTruly Amazing,\u201d said Rodney scribbling down in his note book, \u201cSomeone at your age taking a pregnancy with so many so well. It\u2019s a shame your daughter wasn\u2019t here to be in the picture as well.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she would of like that,\u201d said Ashley, \u201cshe would probably do the best she could to hide herself in the picture.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut what could a women with quintuplets use to hide?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThis,\u201d said Ashley giving her own prodigious belly a light slap.<br>\r\n\u201cTrue,\u201d said Rodney, \u201cWell Mrs. Page...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPlease call me Ashley.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell Ashley just keep an eye out for this article in the local globe,\u201d and with that he left.<br>\r\nAshley was vaguely disheartened she really felt that she had something going with that reporter but he left without so much of a goodbye. Though it did seem easy, to flirt, to bat her eyelids and to put the right harmonics in her voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that point...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You're becoming a bit of a celebrity with that belly, aren't you?\" Ashley turned around at her table and saw a tall, red-headed man smiling at her. It was Joel, one of Brandon's few friends, but Ashley didn't recognize him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose so,\" Ashley smiled, rubbing her belly with one hand. She was curious about this stranger who would go up and start talking with a massively pregnant woman. \"Do you think I should start letting people take pictures with me, like Mickey Mouse at DisneyWorld?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if you'd want that,\" Joel smiled, sitting down next to her. \"But I'm sure you'd be a popular attraction if that was the case. Not many women carry pregnancy quite the way you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley laughed softly, raising one eyebrow curiously. This was turning into a very interesting conversation. \"Well thank you, young man. I assume you want a photo with the belly now too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel shrugged. \"If we just talk more, I won't need a photograph.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley blushed softly as she began to feel some movement in her womb, pressing against her ribs and pelvis. With six babies, there wasn't many places left for them to go that were totally comfortable. \"Mmm, they're getting anxious,\" Ashley said, moving both hands to her belly, looking up at Joel. She made eye contact as she rubbed small circles around both sides of her pronounced bump. \"Want to feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Joel smiled, placing his hand on her belly. While Ashley was starting to enjoy his flirting and Joel maintained his confident persona, inside his head he was jumping for joy and crying out loud. <i>Oh my god, I can't believe she's letting me feel her belly! She's the biggest pregnant woman I've seen in my entire life! And she's not like a lot of big pregnant women and is a butterface! She's so hot! What do I do next what do I do next what do I do next</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you could calm them down more if you felt them directly,\" Ashley said, rolling up her shirt with both hands. Plenty of her belly skin was already showing with her limited selection of clothing for her constantly swelling belly, but now her whole bare belly was on display for Joel as he moved his hand to her smooth, taut skin. After her own husband, Tanner, had no interest in her pregnant body, Ashley knew she had to find sexual satisfaction somewhere else and right now Joel was looking like a promising candidate. And besides, she was probably going to have these babies pretty soon, so it would just be a short affair. No harm, no foul, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feels nice,\" Joel said softly, looking from the belly's soft, glowing form to Ashley's eyes, fixating on them when suddenly-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bastard!\" a loud voice said. Joel turned around and saw Janice, still in her tight yoga outfit, which showed off her belly prominently, waddled up. \"You get me knocked up and then you spend your time flirting with another pregnant woman? Don't tell me you got this one pregnant too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'd better go,\" Joel said, standing up. \"It was nice talking to you.\" Joel hurried away, his frame letting him move far more quickly than Janice could, thanks to her belly. Although she was dwarfed by Ashley's occupied womb, it was still a constraint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you'd better stay away from him if you know what's good for you,\" Janice said, rubbing her belly before turning away in a huff. Sasha was standing nearby, looking away uncomfortably. \"I can't believe that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry, Janice,\" Sasha said, trying to calm her friend. She used to be a calm, serene yoga practitioner. So why was she getting so angry lately? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine,\" Janice sighed, taking her phone out of her exercise bag to send a quick text to some of her other friends to complain. As she put the phone back in her bag, her hands touched some metal. Curious, she reached in and pulled out some sort of bizarre amulet. \"Huh I...guess I forgot I had this.\" She slipped it over her neck, feeling a slight shudder that traveled all the way to her belly, making her twins (previously just one, but thanks to Katie, that was different now) kick and squirm inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie was back behind the desk at the maternity clothing store, taping her fingers on the desk, totally bored. There hadn't been any other customers coming in and if there weren't any more pregnant women inside, she couldn't experiment with her amulet. Looking at it in her hand, Katie thought she might have gotten the short end of the stick and gotten it when it had been \"used up\" by its previous owners: the Page family. The fact that the Page family had it at all was something she was also curious about. They must have used it a lot to get the mother and daughter that...big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I'm not the only one who likes pregnant women,\" Katie remarked to herself with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you say, Katie?\" Laura, Katie's boss, said, poking her head from out of her office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" Katie said, rolling her eyes. Laura may have become a lot nicer since Katie took her pregnancy and gave it to Ashley and Sarah, but she still resented her deep down. Katie might have only taken this job to gawk at pregnant beauties, but as she'd worked here, she saw that she could run this store far better than Laura. She could turn this place into an enterprising business. The thought of bringing in all that money made Katie feel...strange. A twinge went through her that she couldn't explain, but she liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" a woman said in front of the counter. Katie let out a yelp and dropped the amulet, startled by the customer. She had to do a better job not daydreaming!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was shopping for a friend of mine who's having a baby,\" the woman said. Katie nodded along, hand slowly moving to her own firm pregnant belly. \"Do you sell any baby supplies, like cribs or mobiles?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, here on the left,\" Katie smiled professionally, waddling a few steps to motion to a small display of equipment for a baby or toddler. \"And all of those come with shipping, so talk to me about what options you might want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" the woman smiled back, walking over. Before she came in the door, she was expecting twins, but now those twins were growing inside Katie, thanks to her mishandling of the amulet. But as the amulet dropped, it became damaged and sparked a bit, as it had so many times already. Reality should have been rewritten and Katie was questioning whether she had always been pregnant or if it had suddenly appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katie, can you sort the new shipment of belly bras?\" Laura said from her office. Katie scoffed again and instead went over to help the customer. <i>Why are you still running this place? If it wasn't for me, this store would be bankrupt. If I ran it, we'd have money flowing in. Besides, I'm the pregnant one. A maternity store should be run by a pregnant woman</i>. Katie's thoughts were swirling around in her head, amplified by the evil dwelling inside the amulet that all our characters are just beginning to realize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe customer smiled when Katie struggled over, her work shirt barely managing to contain her belly. \"Goodness, I didn't realize how far along you were behind the counter. How many weeks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Katie searched for the answer, the amulet sparked some more. The reality rewrite didn't work! \"Oh...I feel like I've still got a long way to go,\" Katie smiled, patting her belly, thinking about getting a belly as big as Ashley's and winning her heart. \"A long way to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah tore off her clothes and sat in front of her computer in a huff, groaning as her swollen belly bumped against her desk. \"Why does it always seem like this room was set up for someone with a smaller belly?\" Sarah complained, rubbing her naked belly as she opened her email.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah: we got some more investments,\" Neera, one of her partners in some technology ventures, said to her in an email marked with top priority. \"Some scientist from Europe likes the P-Tech idea and is exploring it with me right now. I'll send you details when they come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah leaned back, only in her bra and underwear, and those were probably going to come off soon too. \"P-Tech?\" Sarah pondered. She didn't always know what she was working on for Neera or her other partners since she was in her home office and lately was constrained by her over-occupied womb. Brandon mentioned something about \"Preg Tech\" but...\"naw, just a coincidence,\" Sarah said, heaving herself up and waddling to the shower, snapping off her bra and slowly slipping off her underwear, both clinging tightly to her swollen breasts and rear. She rubbed under her belly and turned on the water, groaning. Waddling around with five full-grown fetuses made her sweaty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon sat with Erin on her bed, the two not really looking at one another as Erin ran her hand over her belly. Finally, she was the one to break the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thanks for always being so nice to me, especially since 'this,'\" Erin said, patting her belly to show what \"this\" was. \"You're reacting a lot better than my parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we have different priorities,\" Brandon blushed, looking intently at Erin's belly. It was nice to have a belly to look at that wasn't attached to one of his relatives. \"And I'll always help you out. That's what friends are for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin giggled and turned to Brandon, her eyes looking over his face. \"Well, then what can I help you with?\"</span></div></div>",

Sure, he was a fool here and there, but man he was something... \" I, um\" Brandon barely got out, tension rising \" I have to go to the bathroom.\" Like the fasted mouse in Mexico he bee lined for the bathroom, hiding his erection. Erin was left dazed and confused. \"Damn it Brandon\" he said to himself infront of the mirror. \"You may be a page, but right now you are more like an awkward paragraph.\" Erin  and Brandon had been friends for a while, and she knew how his mind worked. She got up with little struggle and waddled over to the cabinet. Grabbing her iPad she put on some smooth jazz, then placing it back down she opened up her draw of lingerie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hot, relaxing water streamed down on Sarah's face as she soaped herself up. she couldn't help but think about the past few days. Going to the mall, Brandon rubbing her belly, getting changed at the store, Brandon's muscles as he rubbed her cl- Sarah shocked herself out of it. She was mere inches away from pleasuring herself in the shower. Shaking her head she tried getting her head out of that zone, she had to get ready for an interview, she didn't have time for all this other stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she carefully waddled out of the bathroom, using two towels to cover her body, she heard her phone buzzing. Picking up the phone she saw 3 new emails from the interviewers at Baxter Industries<br>\r\n&lt; Dear Ms Page<br>\r\n Due to time constraints we will need to move forward your interview to 2pm. If there are any problems let us know.<br>\r\nBaxter Industries&gt;<br>\r\n&lt; Dear Ms <br>\r\nBecause of your current \"situation\" we will come to your place. We are impressed that you are still up for this interview while in this state&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;Dear Ms Page<br>\r\nNigel Baxter, founder of Baxter industries has seen the blue prints you have sent us, and will be overseeing the interview, see you in an hour&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looked up at the clock and noticed it was ten to one. \"Oh god no!\" She yelled looking for a clean suit to wear. Looking through her clothes pile she grabbed a relatively clean yet unironed shirt that she could only get the first 3 buttons done, but her belly was on complete display. Grabbing any pants she could find she struggled to pull them up, sadly these were for pants for someone pregnant with a single child, not 5. Struggling to get them up, she couldn't find a blazer. She waddled out of her room and down the hall. \"Hmmm, maybe Brandon has something\" she said to herself as she peered into her brothers bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking her way in she saw a glint of gold from behind the bedside table. Quickly she made her way over. Picking it up by it's chain, she noticed it was a golden version of her amulet. \"Wasn't that the thing Brandon was reading about the other night?\" She thought as she grabbed her amulet from her bossom. They looked almost identical, except hers was silver with 5 red gems and his was gold with 7 green gems. She decided to tap the two amulets together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPONG!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" meh, piece of junk\" she said as she threw the gold amulet on the bed. The pants slacked a little, so she finally managed to pull them up to her quadruplet belly. Grabbing a blazer she left. What she didn't see was one of the green gems violently glowing as smoke escaped it. The smoke formed the number one, then dispersed. Hearing a car pull up, she did up another 2 buttons, pulled on a blazer she found and went to answer the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the mall a short, curvaceous  Asian woman in business attire walked past the food court where Janice and Katie were eating, past Ashley who was just making her way out, over to the elevator. Eventually after a series of visually entertaining spy scenes she made it to the boss's office. Walking into the circular room she saw the artworks of pregnant women, artifacts, sculptures and rugs portraying the pregnant figure. Past the table was someone known simply as the man of the present. In the past he was known for many different names, but for this story, let's call him PETE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rebecca Quo reporting for duty.\" The woman called out in command. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh please, put yourself at ease, our latest station is a mall, not a Russian art museum. How was your trip?\" PETE asked casually. \" Um, okay. The trip was excellent, thank you for the first class tickets\". <br>\r\n\"It was nothing for the best agent in the business.\" PETE said scratching behind his ear. He handed Rebecca a file \"so basically I want you to follow these 6 people, if you can get rid of number 5's boss and do something about number 1. I have studied his family members, they are on the list too, he may pose a problem and is in need of a distraction.\" After exchanging goodbyes Rebecca left the room. PETE went back to his desk, pulled out what appeared to be a remote and started tinkering with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie had continued her adventures in spying. Rubbing her belly she brushed some of her short brunette hair out of her face as she watched Janice the blonde fit pregnant lady waddle back to the gym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Janice got back she decided to put in a couple of miles into the treadmill. Usually a woman who's as pregnant as her shouldn't be able to handle that, but Janice was filled with pure white hot rage. The father to her kids, with her yoga student?! It was driving the poor woman insane, almost literally. As Katie looked at her from the window of the gym, she couldn't help but watch her perfectly toned, fantastically shaped behind move in a hypnotic way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe she could be helpful\" she said as she waddled into the gym, unbeknownst to her the monster she was about to create.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next half an hour, Sarah had made a presentation to the company that were interested in her invention. Sarah was sweating heavily. She was almost finished presenting to the three smartest heads in technology(as far asshe knew) and was awaiting their response. She had made several mistakes, her pants tore open when she bent down to pick up a pen. Sadly this meant presenting her not so fashionable \" kiss me\" panties. Nigel sat there disappointed, the same for his colleges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-in summation, I present to you the Phwatch, b-b-basically it is a tablet strapped to your arm, it's a universal remote, c-can track things from your keys to your pre-\" Sarah stammered, only for Nigel to stop her there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Sarah, I am sure a lovely kind girl, you have presented some interesting things here too.\" He said delicately\" but, we need someone more, business intelligence, more ready for a situation such as this. You just won't be taken seriously in the technology world. I am very sorry to say, we will not be accepting your invention into our company\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother rejection. Another god damn bloody rejection! Sarah was on the verge on crying, this was the 6th failed interview this month and it was getting too much for her. Just because  she has blonde hair and was heavily pregnant doesn't mean she is an idiot! It was one stupid mistake! Everyone else was doing fine, dad was working really well, the businesses in the mall were booming, yet she couldn't get anyone to fund her projects. The Baxter people thanked and left her whilst she was still in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled upstairs. Her shock changing into envy, changing into an urge to change. In her madness she went into her mothers bathroom, opened up the cabinet and saw her mothers dark brown hair dye number 4. \"Think I'm a bimbo do they? Well when we will see what they say after this!\" She madly laughed as she read the instructions. By the end of it all not only did she feel confident, but also felt like she could take anything on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Katie looked around the gym, happy to see more pregnant women in there than just Janice. They were mostly walking at a leisurely pace on the treadmill or doing light weight work, but a few curvy moms-to-be were grunting with larger weights. <i>I'd love some toned arms around me while I rub my belly against theirs</i>, Katie thought greedily, stroking her exposed belly, <i>but I've got to get Ashley first</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice had a strong sweat going, her breath coming out in quick, sharp pants as she ran, consumed with a wrathful energy over the scene between Ashley and Joel. Here she was, a sexy, strong woman in her 20s and the guy who gets her pregnant flirts with another woman! In her 40s! And even more pregnant to boot! Janice kept hearing a crunching noise and looked down to see that she was running faster than the treadmill and had broken off a little of its plastic. Groaning, she hit a button to start the cool down and wiped off her forehead and chest with a small towel. Lying next to it was the amulet she found in her gym bag, which she picked up too. <i>Ashley's carrying sextuplets</i>, Janice thought to herself as she slipped the amulet over her neck, accidentally touching its jewels as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe if I was carrying three more babies, he wouldn't show other women attention</i>, Janice thought, rubbing her now-triplet belly, totally exposed now as her athletic tank top just sort of rested on it. As she tried to calm down and drink some water, Katie waddled up in front of her. \"What do you want?\" Janice barked. \"I'm trying to exercise. I don't need someone staring at me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, I want to talk to you personally,\" Katie said, not expecting Janice to be so angry. \"I know you run the pregnant yoga classes here at the mall gym. I work...I run the maternity clothing store here in the mall and I want to expand our operation. I was thinking you and I could...team up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Team up, huh?\" Janice thought, her anger calming down. \"You think this would be a profitable venture?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! Look at all the pregnant women in this mall,\" Katie smiled. \"But it's about more than just profits. You and I,\" Katie said, getting closer, rubbing her belly, \"are pregnant and we know that we pregnant women need someone taking care of us. And who better to do that than pregnant women?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting,\" Janice said, stepping off the treadmill. Now it was clear just how much she outsized Katie, both in belly but also in height, muscle, and overall confidence. The personality change that accompanied Katie getting her amulet made her less shy and sheepish, but in the presence of a strong, angry, pregnant woman like Janice, Katie began to revert to her old self. \"I have been...less trustful of men lately. They can't be trusted with anything, let alone a gym or a business. Let's talk some more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-Katie,\" she said, blushing as Janice walked beside her, the triplet-filled belly close to Katie's eye level. \"I'm Katie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura was sorting through some inventory documents when she heard a woman's throat being cleared. She looked up to see Rebecca standing in front of her, smiling sweetly, arms crossed behind her back. \"Hello, are you the manager of this maternity clothing store?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am,\" Laura said with a little nod. \"And you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rebecca Quo,\" Rebecca smiled, nodding back again, \"And I am representing the business interests of the community.\" She produced a set of papers stapled together, sliding it toward Laura. \"We feel it would be best if you gave up ownership of this business and gave it to one of your employees.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ex...cuse me?\" Laura said with a raised eyebrow, picking up Rebecca's papers. \"Why should I give this up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The mall is undergoing some changes and has a new direction in mind. You, unfortunately, will not be able to bring that vision to fruition, but one of your employees has shown promise in this area,\" Rebecca said, trying to sound reasonable and kind with Laura. \"But, if you sign these documents, you will be given a stable pension in place of your ownership of this business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura flipped through the pages, and \"stable\" was too small a word for the money she'd get in exchange for no longer owning this place. \"This is a...nice proposal, but I'm sorry, I can't accept this,\" Laura said. \"I built this business myself and I have some pride. I should at least be able to meet with the people who are asking me to leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca sighed and stretched out her arms before flexing them, the size and tone of her muscles showing even underneath her clothes. \"I'm sorry, Mrs. Moore, I should have been more clear.\" Rebecca took a stapler off of Laura's desk and in one quick motion, smashed it between her hands, the flat metal disc falling to the ground. \"We aren't <u>asking</u> you to leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura couldn't find a pen quick enough, signing every form she saw and handing it to Rebecca quickly. \"N-no problem, no problem!\" Laura said, grabbing her things and running out of the store. Rebecca looked through the documents, making sure everything was fine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad that's done,\" Rebecca sighed, not looking forward to doing any more work today. She just wanted to sit at home, watch some TV, maybe eat some frozen yogurt. \"Alright, next up he wanted me to look into some kid.\" Rebecca slid her hand into her pocket, finding a piece of paper. \"Brandon Page and his two pregnant family members.\" Putting the paper back, Rebecca found something else in her pocket. \"What is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur mysterious man paced around his room in the mall, admiring the pregnant sculptures and paintings he had, all specially commissioned, thanks to his vast wealth. \"Finally, after all these years of searching, I have found the final amulets,\" he chuckled to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitting his remote, the various computer screens on his wall lit up, each showing Brandon, Sarah, Ashley, Katie, Janice, and Erin. \"When the Page women met the store clerk, enough of the amulets were brought together that their power started to be released,\" he smiled. \"They've finally found compatible hosts in these women.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe intercom buzzed and our mystery man put his finger on the button. \"Mr. Greene, Ms. Corazon is here. Should I send her up to meet with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, send her to the conference room,\" Mr. Greene said, not wanting anyone but his most trusted employees in this secret sanctum of his. \"I will be in soon.\" The voice on the other end clicked off and Mr. Greene smiled to himself. \"One more piece comes into place. Now would be a good time for an evil monologue:\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Many years ago, I came across the chaotic spirit Yaral, who spread unrest through his various pregnancy-causing tricks: a magic coin, a potion sold as an 'energy drink,' some other devices I don't remember, but the most powerful of all was an amulet he gave a woman in my city. It led to my mother, my sisters, even my father becoming pregnant. While everyone else was horrified, I realized that there could be something useful with this amulet. Whoever controls pregnancy controls the market and could become wealthy beyond belief!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I got the amulet, but then I heard rumors of another one. And then another one! And I've been tracking them all over the world until now, when this Page boy found the last one and it seems to be the most powerful one of them all! Yaral has tried to put obstacles in my way and trick me, but our goals are more similar than he knows. I don't know the whole story behind these amulets or how they work, but for their full power to be released, certain kinds of people need to have them. And for my next step, I need a very 'prideful' woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina Corazon was a highly successful model in her early 20s and was trying to get her acting career started. While she wasn't a monumental celebrity yet, anyone who saw her knew she was destined for greatness, with her intense beauty and radiant energy. Catalina knew it herself and gave off a powerful ego. She lived in the city and Mr. Greene asked her to do a promotion for the mall, with the intent of giving her the \"pride\" amulet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I will be one step closer to my goals,\" he laughed, walking to his desk and opening the drawer. To his surprise, only one amulet was in there. \"Yaral...you struck again,\" he said to himself, shaking his head. \"The pride amulet is still here so...seems my assistant is about to get much more sluggish. And pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin waddled quietly, or tried to be quiet, as she headed for the bathroom door, wearing ill-fitting maternity lingerie. Brandon stepped out and his jaw dropped. \"E-Erin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think of the clothes I picked out at the store?\" Erin said timidly, moving her hips back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-they look good,\" Brandon said. \"Maybe a little...tight?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin's eyes opened wide at Brandon's careless words when his phone buzzed. He quickly picked it up and turned around. \"H-Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brandon, sweetie, it's me,\" Ashley said. \"I'm going to need you to pick me up after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing. Are you alright, Mom? You sound upset.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, just somethings didn't exactly go my way,\" Ashley sighed. \"See you soon, dear.\" She hung up and started stroking her belly, sitting on a bench in the mall parking lot, watching a strong, short Asian woman walk out of the mall. Just when Ashley was close to finding someone to romance her pregnant self, she ended up alone again. But what was going on with Brandon's voice? He sounded nervous and...aroused. Ashley felt her own face turn red. He was probably with that Erin girl again. <i>You don't think he...likes her belly</i>? Ashley thought, her thighs rubbing together as her amulet burned. <i>Then what must he think of me</i>?</span></div></div>",

Level 4 was welcome to the finest fashion brands. From Bucci to Tyler Jones,this was the most expensive area in the state. In fact the cheapest suit costs 2 grand here. As the man walked past the eager girls wanting to try on next years clothes, he saw who the eager girls were really looking at. Inside was the tall, the heart throbbing model, with her big lips and incredible body stood Catalina Corazon at the counter. With her high heels on she towered around everyone else. She picked up her bags she walked out. Immediately she was swamped. Even with all the chaotic scene, she powerfully strode through the crowd, shaking hands here and there. She walked straight over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I wouldn't have to deal with those people, Antonio.\" She whispered  into the mysterious mans ear.<br>\r\n\" come on, this just boosts your popularity, and when this is over, you will become the spanish Marilynn Monroe. But if you ever say my name in public again, you will deeply regret it...\" Antonio sternly replied. Catalina may have a big ego, but in comparison to Antonio was nothing. \" just call me PETE in person.\" <br>\r\n\" p-please forgive me\" Catalina asked, her ego being compromised. \" Alright, look maybe that was a bit rough, here\" Antonio pulled out the amulet from his pocket. Concentrating, he pulled out the centre gem. \" here, try wearing this, it's a necklace for confidence\" Catalina put the amulet on around her \"thank you PETE, I will do my best\" Catalina walked up on stage to do the presentation. As PETE watched her perform on stage A man in a white lab coat came up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jobson, test this gem, I want to see how much power it holds, I want the info by 5.\" Nodding the silent scientist left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Janice moved from the treadmill to the pool. The rage was causing so much blood flow to the head, if she didn't cool down she would have fainted. Katie sat at the side lines, by both arousal and intimidation. \" so, what would this business adventure entail?\" Janice asked, her long, toned legs flowing in motion. Katie wiped the sweat from her forehead. \" well, I would say with the way you look, act and behave, I am sure you know that, uhh\" Katie started to struggle. <br>\r\n\"Hey, don't worry about it, I'm not always a hot head\" Janice said swimming up to the sideline. \" but you were saying, how I acted, behaved, looked...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um yeah, well, I was wondering, with my skills, working with clothes, and clothing design plus your understanding of how to be you-you know, sexy.\"  Katie was really trying not gaze upon her figure as she just managed to climb out of the pool. Waddling over,she reached into her locker and pulled out a swimming outfit. \" here, you need time in the pool too, you look like a squirrel in heat.\" Katie was shocked, sure she served Janice regularly but now she  is going swimming with her? \"Thanks\" she said waddling to the change rooms. Janice couldn't help but look at Katie's big, wide bottom. Before she became pregnant Katie was quite petite, but she packed on a couple of pounds after several cravings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking her way through to the change rooms, Katie looked over to the tv screen. It was an interview program with a gorgeous pregnant writer being interviewed.\" And we're back on Afternoon Tea. So tell us Jessica, how did you go from working at a book store, to being permanently pregnant?\" The interviewer asked intriguingly. \" well\" the brunette began, it all began with my fantastic out her half Jack finding this coin\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie was mesmerised by this woman, especially the words 'permanently pregnant' grabbing out the amulet, she thought about receiving her pregnancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie received an extra occupant in her womb, but Jessica's belly hadn't reduced. \"Well, maybe I should check out her book.\" Katie said waddling into the change rooms. After changing and readjusting the wedgie that the swimming outfit gave her, she came back to the pool area. \"Woo!\" Janice called out \" and you thought I was sexy\". Katie made her way over to the pool and took a step in, the water was ice cold! It wasn't until her third try she managed to acclimatise to the pools water. Swimming around they relax before getting back into business conversation. \" so I think, we could open a shop selling sexy, lingerie that I design, and you model\". Janice nought about it, this could be her opportunity to get back at that bastard ex of hers. \" alright you have yourself a deal!\" Shaking hands they didn't realise their bellies were touching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon hung up the phone and turned to Erin with a look of shock on her face. \"Tight?!\" She exclaimed obtusely. \"Sight! I mean I say, what a sight\" Brandon burst in recovery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, nice save, but that comment is going to cost you...\" She said advancing on him. \" Do you realise, as a pregnant woman how long it has been since I have had the opportunity to embrace someone?\" This was getting out of hand, Brandon liked Erin, and this new, dominating side to her was even better. Her bare belly bumped into his. Brandon's erection  was at full mast he couldn't help it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe embraced her there and then. Locking lips with the incredible pregnant woman, he started taking his clothes off. Erin moaned as the sheer weight of her breasts broke from the prison of her lingerie. Her breasts free, she slipped the rest of her clothes off as Brandon did the same. Grabbing hold of his member, she led him to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir hands explored their naked bodies, slowly. Sensually. Brandon started making out with her, his hands flowing through her long red, hair shining in the afternoon sun. He moved down to her H cup breasts. Suckling upon them Erin gasped in pleasure when he bit them. \"Harder\" she whispered back to him. As he suckled, his hands gently caressed her massive middle. He was in complete and utter heaven. Moving down further Erin bit her lower lip as his fingers rubbed her tip slowly. She moaned harder as he went in... Breathing heavily, Brandon rubbed her faster and faster. She was finally getting a release after all this time. Faster and faster, he picked up pace. She was panting, coming closer and closer to nirvana, she pushed him onto his back and lowered herself onto his member. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was on the verge of cumming as the throbbing member penetrated her body but with almost a struggle she barely made it through. She started riding him, faster and faster her motions were almost hypnotic. She picked up speed, gasping as pleasure encapsulated her. Shaking her hair around, she pushed Brandon down further onto the bed, she wasn't going to finish yet. Brandon was in pure bliss. As the red headed beauty rode him into the sunset, he was overcome with pleasure. As the sun touched the horizon they came in unison. Erin, screamed out in orgasm, her entire body trembling at the sheer impact of their sexual deed. Brandon, was leg-less. He was paralyzed for the waist down from so much pleasure. If it weren't for what happened half an hour ago, his mother would have called him up in pure hatred. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nHalf an hour ago<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley sat as best she could on the bench, her thighs seemed to be heating up for some reason. \" I bet he isn't going to come, he is going to pay!\" She said grumpily. First she was flirting with this hot ginger man, for some reason he looked familiar. Then when she though he would say his name her yoga instructor came out barraging her with anger and chased her chances of getting to know the guy out the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYaral was having a hard time figuring out how to give Ashley her amulet. Sadly her dress had no pockets and her bags had literally no space. He didn't want to damage the amulet so he tried putting in between her thighs. Sadly she started rubbing them, so he teleported it from destruction. \"This woman is one tough catch, for her to get such a gift like this, she will need to earn it...\" Yaral said to himself as he flew around the area in a ghostly fashion. He turned to see Rebecca walk towards Ashley. \"Thank god I took care of that threat\" he said as he flew to observe his next target. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" The short strong Asian said, waving to Ashley. \"Is it okay if I sit here?\" \"Sure I guess\" Ashley said, smooching over  a couple of inches. Rebecca couldn't help but see the massive expanse that was Ashley. She needed to think of something to talk about, and quickly. \" so having triplets?\" She asked ponderously. \"Nope, try doubling that\" Ashley said brushing some over long hair out of her face. \"Whoa, I myself came from a mother who had quintuplets. I know what it's like to live with a family of multiples\". That caught Ashley's attention, she might have someone to talk to about this, finally. \"would you like some gum?\"<br>\r\nRebecca couldn't stop thinking about Ashley's belly as her hand searched for the gum in her bag. Then in a second of accidental contact<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly inflated whilst sounding like inflating balloon. Her tight spy like clothes broke under the bellies pressure. \"As you can see I only have one baby coming, but I have to say I'm almost envious of you\" she said looking upon Ashley's revealing midsection. Then it hit her. She came with an idea just there and then. \" I just remembered, my company pays for my coffee! How about we go over to the cafe across the street, I'll buy you a drink and we can swap pregnancy stories!\" Ashley thought it over, she had been a bit rough on Brandon lately, maybe he needs a break. \"Sound great!\" She said getting up, she texted Brandon to relax, she was coming home later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile around town....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yaral had been around for over one thousand years, maybe more. His origins were forgotten even to him. Was he a malevolent spirit always in search of chaos on the Earth? Was he a demon freed from the shadows by unsuspecting peasants in the Middle Ages? Was he a pregnancy-obsessed human transformed into something else? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever his origins, Yaral was a being of complex and mysterious power now, limited to giving out his tools every now and then and leaving them to the people they fall into. But the Preg-Transferer was perhaps one of his most clever devices, because when all seven of the amulets came together, incomparable power would be released and he would absorb more chaotic energy in a short time than any of his other tricks could provide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, seven of eight amulets. Yaral\u2019s first attempt at creating the Preg-Transferer created a \u201cmaster amulet\u201d that could ruin his plans. Yaral wasn\u2019t strong enough to interfere with events too much now, but he could go and watch the owners of the amulets to see what they were up to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYaral traveled to a local suburb where two owners of the amulet were lying in bed together. Brandon had his cell phone to his ear as he stroked Erin\u2019s belly with his other hand, resting against her back as she held his hand with both of hers, smiling as he caressed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry I forgot, Mom,\u201d Brandon said, trying not to sound too \u201cout of breath.\u201d \u201cBut you don\u2019t need my anymore? Well, that\u2019s lucky. Have fun at the mall.\u201d He hung up, letting out a long sigh as he did. \u201cThat was a close call. I swear, she spends so much time at that mall, she\u2019s more of a teen than I ever was.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s got the looks,\u201d Erin said. \u201cSeriously: your mom is like a model.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I don\u2019t see it,\u201d Brandon blushed. Erin grinned and rolled over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven with her big belly, you don\u2019t feel anything?\u201d Brandon looked away uncomfortably as Erin took his chin in her hand. \u201cC\u2019mon, I know you like pregnant bellies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the only reason I like y-\u201d Brandon protested, cut off as Erin put a finger to his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I know,\u201d Erin smiled, looking down at herself. \u201cI\u2019ve\u2026suspected for a long time. I should have acted on those feelings too. Then maybe I wouldn\u2019t be knocked up with the babies of some guy I don\u2019t even like who chickened out on me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon wrapped his arms around Erin\u2019s belly. \u201cHey, I\u2019m here now. And you\u2019re here for me. That\u2019s all that\u2019s important now.\u201d Erin looked back up and kissed Brandon, their lips staying in place for a few moments before opening up to accept the other\u2019s. After a few soft kisses, a loud gurgle went through the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops,\u201d Erin blushed, sticking her tongue out cutely. \u201cSounds like I need to fill the tank. You really took a lot out of me.\u201d Erin heaved herself up, letting out a grunt as she held her belly, sitting on the edge of the bed. \u201cHand me my bra, will you? I think it\u2019s on your side of the bed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon reached over and handed Erin some of her underwear, turning to see Erin slipping a necklace over her head, settling it between her breasts. \u201cWhere did you get that? It looks like one I have but\u2026a little different.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin shrugged. \u201cJust found it. I can\u2019t totally remember where. Must be some cheap, mass produced stuff they make at souvenir stores. Looks pretty real, though,\u201d she said, examining the jewels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s go to my kitchen. I\u2019m starving. You must be too, huh?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I guess I could eat,\u201d Brandon said, furrowing his brow as he looked at Erin. She looks fantastic: a huge belly, incredible breasts, a wide ass (none of which were bigger than his sister or mom\u2019s \u2013 an observation that pained Brandon to make) and her red hair looked even silkier, falling across her mostly naked pregnant body. But\u2026was she always that pregnant? Something in his head said otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYaral saw the scene and cackled with evil thoughts. Looks like this girl was bonding well with her amulet. And the boy\u2026the boy could become a problem. He was bonded with the \u201cmaster\u201d amulet, so Yaral couldn\u2019t take it back. And with that amulet, he might have the power to stop all of these pregnancies and seal away the seven amulets for another few centuries. But luckily, this one seemed to \u201clike\u201d pregnancy. Yaral traveled back to the mall. He was safe with the \u201cmaster\u201d amulet in this foolish boy\u2019s hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina stood on the stage, putting on her most striking face as she popped her hips to pose for the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen of\u2026what city is this?\u201d she whispered off stage. \u201cWhatever. Welcome to the unveiling of the newest addition to this mall, quickly becoming the center for the most trendy clothes in the state, rivaling the fashion centers of New York City, Paris, Milan!\u201d The audience didn\u2019t seem too enthused so, with an eye roll, Catalina turned to walk across the stage, letting her rear stick out a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis new section of the mall will continue that trend and we are not going to settle for the next cheap Macy\u2019s or JC Penny-style knock-offs to come along and put up shop here. We are in talks with dozens of competitive designers and investors to sell their merchandise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone in the audience shouted out. \u201cCatalina! Will you be modeling any of the mall\u2019s new lines?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina\u2019s lips turned up in an excited smile. Finally, a chance to focus the attention on her and not pretend to care about this dumb mall run by that psycho Antonio. \u201cI can\u2019t share too many details just yet, but as long as I\u2019m here, there are some new clothes I picked up on my trip around the mall today. Would you all like to see it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audience cheered as Catalina went off-stage, a mob of assistants and make-up artists quickly taking her simple (well, simple for Catalina) dress off and slipped her into a shimmering silver dress, tight-fitting and with a long d\u00e9collet\u00e9 to show off her heaving chest. She paraded around on stage, getting hoots and cheers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, thank you,\u201d Catalina smiled. \u201cGlad you all like it. Honestly, I think it\u2019s a bit too conservative. Maybe if the dress was shorter,\u201d she said, lifting it up to show more of her smooth, brown thighs, whistles coming from the gathered audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure this was a good idea, getting her?\u201d one of Antonio\u2019s assistants whispered to him as he watched from afar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d he grinned. \u201cShe\u2019s perfect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, for my next outfit, I want to do something special,\u201d Catalina smiled, winking as she went offstage. Again, a flurry of hands got her out of her dress, but this time, she was put into a pair of baggy camouflage pants and a tight black t-shirt that left about half of her stomach showing. Putting on a green baseball cap, Catalina walked out on stage. \u201cAnybody like me like this?\u201d Some more cheers, which Catalina drank in happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is what I\u2019ll be wearing in my upcoming blockbuster movie,\u201d Catalina said, strutting on stage, wearing big combat boots her assistants put on her. \u201cIt\u2019s an action-packed adventure movie where you\u2019ll all get to see my acting chops and my action skills.\u201d She put her hand on her hip, showing off her tight midsection, still in shape and gorgeous thanks to the grueling fitness regiment she forced on herself to make sure she stayed good-looking. \u201cI\u2019ll have the hunky Chris Evans as my co-star and romantic partner on-screen, but I see plenty of guys here who are just as cute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoots grew in the audience as Catalina smiled, surveying the audience for any guys she might actually want to hook up with after her appearance. Thankfully, there were plenty of babes, but to her surprise, a lot of pregnant women too. This mall seemed to attract them like moths to a flame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe that explains why she was there. \u201cIt\u2019s about a pregnant commando, the daughter of an ex-Marine who learned everything he knows in secret who needs to sneak through the jungle to save him,\u201d she said, hand on her huge belly, the tiny black t-shirt she had on unable to hide any of it. Her baggy camo pants were very accommodating to her newfound size, on the other hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she talked and smiled, Catalina couldn\u2019t help but feel\u2026not exactly d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Almost the opposite. Being pregnant feels weird and all but I should at least be able to remember being pregnant before now, she thought. It feels new but also\u2026familiar. Must be pregnant brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntonio chuckled to himself, arms crossed. He could see the confusion in her eyes from where he was. Removing the gem from her amulet reduced its power some, but it also sped up the \u201cpregnancy transfer\u201d process, wildly grabbing pregnancies and shifting them around. He\u2019d fix it soon, sure, but now that it got Catalina pregnant, another domino was falling into place. He was still able to know when the amulet struck and wasn\u2019t affected by the reality shift because of an interesting little paradox with the amulets: if you know how they work, they don\u2019t work for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSoon this new addition will be raking in more money than this whole building ever did,\u201d Antonio smiled to himself. \u201cAnd that will be another step to total market domination.\u201d He walked to his private elevator, laughing as it went to his office. Even Yaral can\u2019t stop me this time. He wants to make the world pregnant? So do I! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYaral chuckled as well as he watched Antonio\u2019s expression. \u201cBe glad for now, my old friend, but know this: I do not like to be manipulated and I always have my revenge\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Rolling off the couch, she turned to see a brown smudge on the couch. \" crap!\" She said throwing some pillows on it.\" I guess that will work\" she said in her wake, shaking her drier hair she stumbled to the kitchen. She looked over the prototype to her designs. It was working pretty well, but there was one problem. She would need to find a power source, to power this devise would need something out of a sci-fi movie. It buzzed and an email appeared on it. &lt; Dear Ms Page--- Bzzkt. The entire set turned off after 5 seconds. \"Damn it!\" She angrily yelled, grumpily she waddled over to the stairs. Sighing as she was still waking up, she began the ten minute struggle up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Brandon's mates Joel and Grant sat in the cafe across the street from the mall. Looking over Joel saw Tanner Page casually leaving with a drink in one hand, and a scantily clad woman in another. That casual stride turned into a speed that broke the sound barrier when he saw the globular flesh that was his wife. \" what's up Joel?\" Said Grant, his short bearded friend asked \" oh nothing, I just think I saw the quickest escape in my life, from Brandon's dad. Do you think we should tell him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not our place to tell him. If we can confront him before any dastardly deeds happen, maybe we can end it though\" Grant replied as they drank. Whilst they talked about video games and comic books, Rebecca and Ashley approached the cafe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank god it's only across the street, otherwise my feet would be killing me\" Ashley joked casually waddling to the door. She was too busy in conversation to have noticed Tanner. <br>\r\nEntering the cafe, Ashley saw the attractive red headed man from before, then noticed the line. \"Do you think you could get the drinks? I just saw someone I remember\" Ashley said to her shorter counterpart. \"Oh come on, I have been walking all day, why can't you wait?\" She said, her hands rubbing her belly. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm look, how about you wait, and I'll give you the cash\" Ashley said pulling out her purse. Seeing his chance, Yaral put amulet in it's place. \"I guess that's okay, what would you like?\" \"Green tea thanks, that'll help me relax\". Handing her a twenty, Ashley tried to put the wallet back in, after 2 unsuccessful attempts, she stuffed it in her bra. Rebecca waddled over to the line whilst Ashley walked in her sexiest way over to the two geeky guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be right back\" Grant said getting a call from a friend, he walked out. As he left Joel saw the incredible woman from the mall, the saucy woman with the incredible body\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" fancy seeing you here\" Joel smirked at the heavily pregnant woman. \"Is it too soon to ask for an autograph?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows, you may get a little more than that.\" Ashley joked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if I am going to get anything, I should at least ask for a name\" Joel proposed back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can call me Ashley, or the lioness\" she said picking up Joel's drink and taking a big sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" well, if you are the queen of the jungle, then you can call me tiger, or Joel, I-uh, just make it Joel, I don't want the poachers after me again\" Joel said stumbling in his flirtatious remarks, but recovering quickly. Ashley did her best to do a cute laugh, like she had seen whilst teaching. \"Oh stop it, you will make me blush!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they continued to flirt, Grant was talking with his back to the cafe. Turning around he noticed that Joel was hitting on a heavily pregnant woman. Doing what any good friend would do, he had to save him from a big mistake and a crushed pelvis. Walking in, he saw her writing her phone number on his wrist. \" call me\" she whispered in his ear. Suddenly a phone came flying out of no where and knocked Ashley's bag over. \" oh god I'm sorry! Butter fingers\"Grant said picking up all of her belongings, and shoving them into her bag, shoving the amulet down further. \"Thanks\" Ashley said annoyed at the short man who handed her bag at her. She waddled over to the couch on the other side of the cafe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, what the hell!?\" Joel said slapping Grant over the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! Didn't you see that?\" Grant sternly replied \"haven't you noticed, she is  heavily pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Come on, haven't you ever been attracted to a pregnant woman before?\" Peter questioned his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" What on earth? No!\" Grant shrugged, \" you don't butter the bun when it's in the oven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you don't know about the pheramones that they give off?\" Joel questioned \" or about how wild the sex can be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" No!\" Grant said with distaste. \" this is a pregnant person with a baby inside, that's disgusting\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Firstly, they aren't, they are fetuses. Secondly, if you don't think that's hot, fine! More for me. Sigh, if it's all that important to YOU I tell you what, I can't promise I will fight off the urge, but I will promise that there will be no promises.\" Joel said, picking up is frappacino. \" Wait, what?\" Grant profoundly said, amazed by the stupidity in Joel's comment. Ashley and Rebecca got their drinks and sat a reasonable distance away from Brandon's friends. \" I couldn't help but notice the ginger boy you gave your number to, bravo\" Rebecca softly applauded, putting down her muffin. Ashley slowly lowered herself on the chair. \"Aaahhhh you know how good it is to have a conversation with a woman that wants to talk to you?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why would anyone not want to talk to you?\" Rebecca asked, acting like she was shocked.\" Well you see that ginger guy, well his ex girlfriend used to be my yoga teacher until I flirted with him today.\" Ashley exclaimed, her joy starting to go sour \"Then there is my husband who let's face it, has been avoiding me for the past few days. Sigh, I'm sorry, I just met you, you don't need this\" Ashley, starting to get upset, waddled over to the bathroom. \" Man, her pregnancy has really given her some mood swings\" Rebecca said to herself \" this might come in handy.\" Getting up she made her way into the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears trickled down Ashley's face, as she grabbed some towels to dry herself and prevent her make up from being ruined. \" hey, it's alright.\" Rebecca said, making her way over to Ashley. \" I used to be a psychologist, I like taking care of people. You don't have to worry about those idiots.\" Ashley wiped the tears and her ruined make up off her face. \" hey, let's get that beautiful face of yours fixed up.\" She said, dipping her hand into her bad and pulling out her own mini kit. Fixing her up, Ashley looked like a million bucks again. \"Thank you so much\" Ashley compassionately said hugging her. \"Hey, it's alright. You can trust me, you have nothing to fear...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the bathroom, Joel and Grant were relaxing with their drinks. Joel grabbed a napkin and started writing. Giving rough estimates, he would have Ashley has six babies, he remembered Brandon talking how his sister had four. Then there was the bride of satan, his ex Janice with triplets and that cutie at the pregnant store has, twins? Or Triplets? With all these pregnant women, he could play bingo he thought to himself. Stuffing the napkin in his wallet and punching Ashley's number in his phone, Joel thought it was time to go home. \" okay Grant, I'll see you and Brandon at yours tomorrow night for DnD. Do you know if he has found a third adventurer for your campaign?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll call him tomorrow about it, maybe we will finally have another woman! Unlike the time you brought Kendra along\" Grant answered with attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, my dear friend I had no'eth clue the difference between a brew of glutenation and a brew from freeglutenhime?\" Joel said in a mystical sense<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was alergic to gluten! We had to drive her to the emergency room!\" Grant  retorted loudly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah now who isn't 'role playing'! See you tomorrow night\" Joel said leaving the cafe</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Antonio fingers brushed through his silvering hair. Looking through the glass elevator, he saw the beautiful Catalina on stage, and the amulet doing it's work. There about 15 pregnant ladies there, including several ladies with multiples showing support for the pregnant celebrity. The amulet was about to change that. In a matter of seconds female bellies started shrinking and growing. Clothes were tearing at the seams and  dresses were being lifted by the sheer expanse of belly. No one seemed to care though. By the end of the show every woman in the audience had become pregnant from her amulet. Several women decided to travel down to '9 months and beyond', the rival store to the one that Katie works at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Catalina was on board he could start working on the plans second phase. \"Jobson, Walker, I'm coming to the lab. Make sure you have that gem locked in securely\" Antonio said into his headset, \"yes sir\" a feminine voice replied. Ending the call he noticed his hand, the tips of his fingers were different, almost a deep red. Heading up to his office, he grabbed his gloves, his tablet and his secretaries arse for good measure. Antonio and Zoe had a \"special\" relationship....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill wearing the gloves he was wearing when he talked to Antonio, Bill Jobson stored the gem inside the glass safe. \" Can you take that away? It's nauseating\" Wendy Walker said, feeling sick. \" Sorry, Wendy. I am still wondering why we needed this, I feel fine to be honest\" he said, being affected to the gem's energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntonio entered the giant underground lab. As large as a football field and nearly half the size of the mall, it was filled to the brim with technological goods.  There was nearly a hundred people working on specific tasks. They were paid well to do their jobs and paid really well not to ask any questions. At the centre was his right hand man and left hand lady. \" Are the mechanical corsets ready?\" Antonio asked Wendy. \" yes sir, I'm just about to put mine on. \" you better, otherwise who knows how he gem has affected you are already. Putting his cyber gloves on, Antonio brought up a  holo screen. 6 strange gadgets came up. A pair of goggles was  the first thing to show, then a gun, a remote and so on until all of them were showing. \"Now that we can harness this gems unlimited energy, we can finally start making sure these gadgets work properly. Walker, please get team delta to work on project RT65, Jobson, get team Trion to work on project PG18\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah made it to the final stair and up to the closet. Grabbing a broom she waddled over to her room. Opening the door, an awful smell wafted and she saw the pig sty. Stained bras, packages of food and clothes were everywhere. \" Better deal with this first\" she mumbled sweeping up the food packets. Lowering her quadruplet belly down she picked them up and threw them into the guest room. Then with gravid belly, she somehow collected all the dirty clothes and threw them in the laundry basket. Unbuttoning the rest of her ruined shirt she sat down and pulled herself up to the computer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt; Dear Miss Page<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI Doctor Schultz have taken a look over your emails, research and blue prints for your mentioned devices. I am interested to see what you mean by devices that help pregnant women. I am actually coming over from Germany to visit a medical conference in a city not too far from yours. If you would like, we can meet and discuss me funding your said projects. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI should also state that I would need to see all prototypes in action before I exchange any money of course. I should be over there in hopefully 5 days time, I hope you don't mind putting up with a rich old German for a night or two, just to see how I may help with your inventions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look forward to your reply<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor Schultz&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, oh my god, oh my GOD!\" Sarah excitingly, her legs kicking in the air, well as far up as they can whilst sitting with a huge belly. Her stomach started growling. \" oh I shoulda had something to eat before going to sleep\" she said throwing her brunette hair back. Grabbing her mobile she dialled the pizza company. After ordering enough pizzas for a family she looked around for what could only be said to be a robotic spine. Switching to a tank top, She attached it to her back she walked out of her room like any regular woman, especially not someone with 4 babies in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanner parked a block away from the Page house, making out with the black haired bimbo she stuffed her number in his hand. \"Call me\" she said, exiting the car. He watched her ghetto booty as she walked to the double storey house. Driving over, he was starting to relax after a wild afternoon with one of the local ladies. Driving up to his house, Tanner sprayed himself over with deodorant then smoked a cigarette in the car to remove any wafting scents. Walking in he noticed a deserted house, then came the gentle steps from upstairs as Sarah walked up to the divide. \" hey dad!\" Sarah said, his overly pregnant daughter waved. Tanner was disappointed with Sarah for her getting pregnant, but was quite proud by how incredibly passionate she was, the brown hair was a nice change though. \" your new hair du looks nice, how did the interview go?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you were right, they didn't want some blonde bimbo. So I decided it was time for a change. But I have some great news! But let's wait for the rest of the family to come in.\" Tanner and Sarah walked over to the kitchen where one of her projects worked. \" so, here is the Phwatch, or armlet\" says Sarah showing him the strange looking watch on the bench. \" it works just fine, but I have a problem with the power, I'm better off trying to walk into mordor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Hold on, lemme see what you have here\" Tanner said, opening up the prototype's contents. Detaching a few wires, he grabbed his toolbox located under the kitchen bench. Taking out one quarter of the contents he fitted the device with a much larger battery from an old tablet. \" there, that'll give you some extra hours of power.\" Turning it on, it started up pretty well, then after a spark or two the batter launched itself across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night...</span></div></div>",

But in his absence, Ashley moved her eyes around the store, getting a tingling sensation at nearly every other face she saw. <i>Since when was this town full of so many handsome men</i>? Ashley thought with a grin. She reached into her purse to see if she had anything to improve her appearance some and, instead of any makeup, found an amulet instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This looks familiar somehow,\" she said to herself, tying it around her neck, hoping it would bring attention to her cleavage. As she adjusted her chest, Rebecca scooted into the seat across from her. \"Sorry about that,\" Ashley chuckled, passing Rebecca her drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. I'll make sure to pay you back using my discount,\" Rebecca said, groaning as she reached over for the tall paper cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You work for this coffee chain?\" Ashley asked, drinking her smoothie, making sure to lick her lips obviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I-\" Rebecca began, deciding not to reveal that all of the property surrounding the mall was owned by one man, \"I work for a lot of different businesses. I'm a...lawyer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must be nice to get benefits for work, especially in our condition. I remember when I had my first baby, I was grateful for any help I could get. Is this your first pregnancy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca nodded. \"Yep. How about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Number two, but it's quite a bit different than last time,\" Ashley laughed, running her hand all around her enormous belly. \"It really is nice to have another pregnant woman to talk with about these sorts of things. My daughter's pregnant too but she...doesn't like to spend much time with me.\" Ashley threw her hair back to get it out of her eyes, taking another drink to hide her sad sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the mall is starting some more programs for pregnant women,\" Rebecca said, leaning forward a bit. \"Maybe you should stop by more often.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be nice,\" Ashley smiled, \"although I think I'd stand out even among other pregnant ladies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca chuckled, familiar with the plans Antonio had in store for the mall. \"Somehow, I think you would be surprised how many women close to your...size you could meet.\" Rebecca reached into her purse to see the list of assignments she'd written down, but as she wrapped her fingers around her amulet instead, she felt increasingly lazy. \"You can look up details on the mall website.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh,\" Ashely said with a raised eyebrow. \"You don't have a schedule with you now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca shrugged and groaned a little. \"It would take too long to look up now. In fact, I'd better be going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women got up, Ashley having to struggle far more than her new friend. Ashley might have given a lot of care to her appearance, but it was nothing like the physical athletic training Rebecca had undergone over her life and career. As Ashley tried to settle herself, she gave Rebecca a wobbly goodbye hug, their amulets touching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, hopefully I'll get to see you again soon,\" Ashley smiled, rubbing her belly, which was now totally exposed. \"I've got to get these seven home before they kick so hard my water breaks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that feeling,\" Rebecca chuckled, patting her own belly. \"I just want to lie on the couch and quiet my twins down while I watch TV.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon sat nervously at Erin's kitchen table as she finished off her third helping of her family's leftovers. \"I should probably be getting back home soon. They're going to be sitting down to dinner soon and if I'm not there, they'll start snooping around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner? You're not full yet?\" Erin asked, mouth full of microwaved pasta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, I haven't really been eating,\" Brandon blushed. \"Just you. Aren't <u>you</u> full yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pregnant, remember?\" Erin said, leaning back and patting her bare belly. \"I'm eating for four now and we each need a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so,\" Brandon said, looking around the house. \"Still, I should get out of here before your parents get back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin rolled her eyes. \"You think they'll get mad at you? Their daughter is pregnant with triplets. Believe me: you're the least of their concerns.\" She got out of her seat and waddled with a catlike gait over to Brandon, sitting down in his lap. \"Still, it's cute that you're worried.\" Erin handed her possible boyfriend the Tupperware container and wrapped one arm around his neck. \"Feed me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this turn you on?\" Brandon asked with a little smile, scooping up some noodles to slide into Erin's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, a little. Also, my fork-holding arm is getting tired,\" she said, gulping down the food before giving Brandon a kiss on the cheek. \"But we can pick up any time. Maybe you should get back home soon. I'd hate for this-\" she gave him another peck \"-to be stopped by either of our families.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither do I,\" Brandon said, putting the food down and wrapping his arms around Erin's belly. \"If you knew how long I've wanted to be with you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin shushed him quietly as she bent down for a kiss. \"You don't need to say anymore. Just get dressed and I'll see you...soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon nodded and the two balanced Erin's belly to get her off of Brandon's lap as he went back to Erin's room to get his clothes. Inside his pants' pocket, Brandon pulled out his phone and saw that his mother had sent him another text.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;got a ride with someone else. you don't have to pick me up&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good,\" Brandon sighed. \"Now I just have to beat her home before she suspects anything between me and...Erin.\" Little did Brandon know that his father was thinking the same thing when he made it home with his new \"plaything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll draw up some paperwork for you to sign tomorrow,\" Katie said in the locker room, a grin permanently affixed to her face as Janice, in all her pregnant glory, undressed and redressed in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good,\" Janice nodded, pulling her top down tightly, struggling to get it over her belly. Her veins popped out of her neck as she gave her clothes one strong pull, tearing it so her belly was exposed anyway. \"And by the way...you might want to try out some of the other training the gym offers. You're a little...scrawny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scrawny,\" Katie repeated back, looking at herself. Her triplet-filled belly, plus the new ample chest her pregnant gave her, made her look anything but scrawny. But before her pregnancy, Katie had been an exceptionally small, mousey woman. \"I see what you mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to be a businesswoman, you need to show some strength,\" Janice said, flexing her arm. \"Believe me, the guy who runs this mall? He shows off all the time when we have to negotiate our contracts with him each year. And he can be a real bastard.\" Janice threw a punch at her nearby locker, leaving a clear fist-shaped dent. Katie gulped and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'll look into some fitness programs,\" she said, giving Janice a reassuring smile. Janice smiled back and nodded, waddling away, hand on her belly. Katie finished changing and headed out of the mall. <i>Janice has a lot of benefits if I'm starting a pregnancy-centric business, but she's a little risky with these bursts of rage</i>, Katie thought, looking at the stage in the middle of the mall, currently surrounded by cheering people, many of whom were pregnant. On stage was Catalina, still parading around in her \"pregnant commando\" outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Now someone like Catalina Corazon would be a much better face for this project</i>, Katie grinned, looking Catalina over. <i>The three of us together...we could take over this entire mall</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDollar signs flooded her head as Katie cackled to herself, the amulet's energy pulsing through her. But as she made it to the malls' entrance, she saw something that blew away all of her other thoughts. \"A-Ashley?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley turned around, her belly swinging and jiggling around. \"Katie! Long time no see,\" she laughed, waddling slowly over to Katie. \"Oof, you might need to come over here. Moving around is tough with seven babies, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Katie said, hugging Ashley tightly, her face smushed against Ashley's full bosom. <i>Something's not right...I only brought her up to six. Maybe...I don't have the only amulet</i>. \"What are you still doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I chatted with a friend, but now I don't have a ride,\" Ashley chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can give you a ride!\" Katie blurted out, face turning bright red. \"I-I mean...it's the least I can do after you had me over for dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley beamed. \"That would be great, Katie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She knows my name. Every time she says my name, it's like a feather slides down my spine</i>, Katie thought, trying not to ooze too much love. \"Well, then follow me. I think you'll be able to fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Katie walked through the parking lot with Ashley, everyone staring and gasping at Ashley's nearly-naked enormity, she realized that she'd never driven pregnant before. She only used her amulet at work today. Looking down at her amulet, Katie saw the big button in the center that the manual said let her \"undo\" her pregnancy. <i>Should I</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katie?\" Ashley said, looking at her salesclerk curiously. \"Aren't you going to get in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, right,\" Katie thought, nervously hitting the big X on her amulet. In a flash, her belly went back to its same, flat appearance. One look at her car and Katie had to sadly realize that Ashley wouldn't easily fit either. <i>I can make her smaller for now and then bring her back to her...oh god...septuplet belly later</i>. Katie tapped her amulet a few times but...nothing. Ashley stayed wonderfully, enormously pregnant. \"W-well, let me adjust your seat and we can get going.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Opening a window, Erin moved to the couch, her bare belly alone testing the strength of the furniture. She popped open a bag of crisps with her legs then started chowing down.  Pulling up his pants, Brandon walked out to see the sexy sight before him. \" Well, it seems you have things wrapped up here, I think I'll head home. \" Brandon said, scratching his head. \" alright fine, if it matters so much to you, head on home, but here's something for next time.\" Getting up easily, she seductively walked over to the timid and skinny lad, touching his chest gently she moved her hands up and placed her arms on his shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning in she sensually made out with him, her hands gliding through his hair. Brandon's legs became weak. Slowly he collapsed onto the reclining chair  behind him. Rachel took off her shirt and threw her bra behind the couch. Getting on the chair she pulled the recline lever. Brandon flew back, his erection showing through his pants, Erin started grinding her massive belly up against Brandon's body. Reaching up, Brandon's hands moved along the fantastic, pale belly, that huge fleshly orb. Moving up Erin grabbed them and brought them up to her lactating chest. Plunging into her cleavage Brandon was on the verge of pure nirvana until- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ERIN? We're home!\" Mr Parker called from the lower level \" fuck!\" Brandon  said removing his hands from her bossom, Erin threw on the shirt, she already had her short shorts on. As her parents started walking up stairs Brandon decided to take the express way out. Grabbing his shirt He jumped out the first story window and dived straight into the family's pool toy collection. Getting up, he snuck around the front and got in his car across the street. \" hey mum and dad! \" Erin said, doing her most innocent impression of running up and hugging them both. She quickly headed to the bathroom to change out of her milk stained shirt. Doing his best, Brandon quietly drove down to his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few blocks away Katie was driving Ashley home. Katie kept switching between looking at the road, and looking at Ashley as she was seductively, massaging that fantastically large belly of hers. \" So Katie, now that the weekend's over what have you got planned for the up coming week?\" Ashley casually asked. It was becoming harder and harder for Katie to turn her eyes away from her. \" I, uh, have work, I only have one week of holidays left before I go back to uni, so I'm sure I'll get some beach time in there too. How about you?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't know. I guess I could go back and see how things are doing at St. John's high, but the question that really lies is, how do I get there with this?\" She said pointing at her large midsection. The rest of the trip was filled with a somewhat awkward pause, every now and then they would try to talk, but to no avail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling up, Brandon managed to get back inside, just as Katie pulled up. Katie ran around the car to help Ashley out of her seat. With a heave and a pull, Katie slipped and fell on Ashley's wide expanse with an almost BOING effect. \"OOFF\" Ashley winced as Katie made her impact. \"I'm, I'm, I'm so sorry, are you okay?\" Katie panicked. \" I am fine, it's just, no one has ever gotten this close to me lately,\" Ashley answered, putting her hand on Katie's arm. \" if you aren't too busy tomorrow, maybe you would like to come over.\" <br>\r\n\"That sounds great\" Katie happily said, as she climbed off of her. With a more stabilised pull Ashley was out and started walking to the door. Katie got in the car and squealing, drove off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pizzas arrived ten minutes after Ashley made it through the door, if it weren't for left overs their hunger wouldn't have been satisfied. After dinner Brandon and Sarah watched the latest season of Deserted, a drama about a desert chef in the Middle East. Ashley had gone to bed and read whilst Tanner finished typing up reports for work. Closing his laptop he went upstairs. Sighing he opened the door to see the very pregnant partner of his. Sure she looked younger, you could say early thirties, but there was just that gargantuan belly connected to her. Tanner was a catholic man and believed that there were babies growing inside, not fetuses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rubbed her massive middle whilst reading that great sexual sci if hit 'Fifty Shades of Green'. Putting down the book she looked back up at the man who denied her pleasure. Why did he keep getting hotter and hotter? This was confusing. But she needed to get something off her chest. It was time they brought up Brandon's secret. \" Tanner we need to talk about Brandon.\" Ashley said putting the book down.<br>\r\n\"Seriously? You know what I said to Carl\". Tanner replied knowing exactly what she was talking about. He pulled out his pyjamas out of the cabinet. \" I mean come on, Carl and Sally were our favourite friends, and their will did say we shouldn't 't tell him. End of story\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sighing, Ashley shifted the pillows from behind her back and collapsed  over the bed, her limbs taking up as much space as she could. \"Are you sure you don't want to come to bed?\" Ashley said, trying to do her best sexually alluring voice. Tanner tried his best to look at her sexually, but with that incredibly large midsection it wasn't helping. Even with the image of his girlfriend, he couldn't bring himself to saying no. \" I'm afraid so, I'm  starting fairly early in the morning, I'll go in the guest room again. Exiting the room Ashley sighed going to her \"special\" bedside drawer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking down the dark hall, Tanner forgot to switch the light on as he entered the room. CRASH! Burrito wrappers and ice cream containers went flying as Tanner fell upon the trash pile that Sarah had shifted into the room. \"SARAH!\" Tanner screamed down to the kids downstairs.  \" oh crap\" Sarah panicked as she  tried to hide in the cupboard. \" Brandon, cover for me, I'm hiding out here tonight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some cleaning up and stern talking, everyone was in their own separate beds and asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night in the Page household was filled to the brim with complete and utter silence. Everyone was sleeping like a log, mainly because logs don't make noise, but they don't sleep either, go figure. Ashley was scratching her belly, sleeping on her side. In her dreams she saw curtains. Over to her left she could see several pregnant women in lacy, heart throbbing costumes. She tapped a head set, \" Joel, I hope the dancing ladies are finishing up, we may be partners, but I run 'the Pink Pearl'. A pregnant Laura, that woman who used to own the maternity store in the mall came over handing her some large feathers. She took the headset off of you and that's when you looked down. Minus some pasties you were practically nude! Suddenly everyone ran away from you and the curtains opened to a huge hall. She swore  it looked like a brothel. Covering her figure with the giant feathers, she started seductively showing parts of her sexy body. As she danced people were hooting and hollering. As she approached the end of her dance something came flying from outside the window. BANG! She woke with sweat dripping from her, that's when she felt it. \"Damn it, can I have one bathroom less night?\" She grunted as she slowly got up and waddled to the onsuite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah managed to wrap her blanket around her. With a slight snore and a smile on her face she had a very different dream. \"Mmmm, faster....\" She murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarly that morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brandon opened his eyes slowly as the sunlight came through the blinds. Today was one of his days to work during the week so he needed to wake up his body quickly. Putting on his shorts and white t-shirt, Brandon went for a run around the neighborhood while it was still early. He had to get up early because, with a hugely pregnant mother and sister, if he saw them, his erection would be obvious under his thin shorts. Brandon tied his necklace close to his body so it wouldn't bounce around too much. Strangely, he couldn't bring himself to go without it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Brandon was making his way out the door, he could see his father on his cellphone sitting on the couch in the living room, talking quietly. \"Of course I want to see you again today,\" he said. \"Another pair of heels?...sure, I can bring that. And some jewelry too? As long as you bring your sexy ass, I'll get you anything.\" Brandon frowned slightly, long suspecting that Tanner and Ashley weren't getting along since the pregnancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon ran up and down the sidewalks, only a few people out and about. Every now and then, Brandon's amulet would bounce against his chest a little too hard and a woman he'd pass by would grow a prominent belly. As Brandon ran, he passed by Erin's fancy house, which only made him smile. Inside, Erin was slowly waking up, stretching her arms and legs out before curling them back to caress her belly. Erin rolled over slowly, feeling her triplets kick with complaints as she moved, rubbing the space on the bed next to her sadly. Being hugely pregnant and alone was bad enough, but...she'd never realized how hard it was until Brandon came into her life and then left. Gripping the sheets, she knew she wanted to wake up and see Brandon holding her belly lovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly growled and Erin knew the other thing she wanted was breakfast. A big breakfast. Changing into a loose tank top and shorts, Erin tucked her amulet between her breasts and made it downstairs. To her surprise, her mother and father were already up and dressed. Her father, Douglas, was at the table, reading the newspaper, drinking coffee. Erin's mother, Susan, was cooking, filling the room with a scent that drove Erin wild. \"You're both up early,\" Erin said, looking at the stove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you remember? It's the annual golf exhibition at the country club today,\" Douglas said. \"But you'll be staying here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Staying here? Why?\" Erin protested, putting her hands on her hips. The golf exhibition always had the best catered, free food: something Erin never cared about until she got her amulet. As she turned back to her mother, her amulet slapped against her breasts and Susan's belly grew out considerably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because having a daughter, unmarried, in your condition is...harmful to our reputation,\" Douglas said in a low growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then again,\" Susan sighed, putting one hand on her belly, covered by her apron, \"if I'm pregnant, it's silly to keep Erin from going too. It's up to you, dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I bring a friend?\" Erin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Susan and Douglas said in unison. Erin sighed and shrugged, deciding to go along with it. \"Now go upstairs and change. Preferably something that covers your <u>entire</u> belly, young lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon made it back to his house, wiping the sweat off of his face with his t-shirt as he opened the door. When he brought his shirt down, he saw Sarah and Ashley both sitting in the living room, looking at him. Ashley had a kindly smile on her face while Sarah was trying to hide her blushing. Brandon blushed too, trying to move quickly so his shorts wouldn't give him away, as he feared. \"H-hi Mom, hi Sarah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi sweetie,\" Ashley smiled as Brandon got some water. \"Looking at you work out makes me feel so fat and bloated.\" Brandon opened his mouth to protest but Ashley cut him off. \"I know, I know. I'm not bloated. Your sister and I are just big pregnant ladies.\" Ashley patted her belly. \"Who would have expected my second pregnancy would be octuplets?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Octuplets?\" Brandon said. He could have sworn it was sextuplets the last time she talked about her pregnancy. Something strange was definitely going on. \"Wait a minute...second pregnancy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Third, sorry,\" Ashley blushed. \"Pregnant brain. What are you up to today, Brandon?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Internship stuff,\" Brandon said, drinking from his water bottle. \"It'll be nice to get out of the house and mall for the day. W-what about you two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a big invention to work on,\" Sarah said with a hint of excitement as she slowly stood up, running her hands over her belly. She glared at her mother, upset she didn't say anything about her dyed hair. <i>Why does she still get all the attention? I'm...I'm just as beautiful as she is</i>. She turned her eyes to Brandon. <i><u>He</u> pays more attention to her too</i>... \"Excuse me.\" Sarah headed up to her room, gripping the stairs' railing tightly as she struggled with her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm going to have a day of relaxation,\" Ashley smiled brightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-haven't you always been doing that, since you hit the eight-month mark?\" Brandon gulped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, they wouldn't let me teach at the high school when my belly was much smaller than this,\" Ashley said sadly, stroking her enormous orb of lovely tight skin. \"But today, I'm going to travel around with a friend, try and find some adventure. I love sitting around and rubbing cocoa butter on my belly, but it can get a little boring sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I don't think I'd get bored</i> Brandon thought, gulping nervously again and heading upstairs to shower off. When he got into the shower, Sarah was in there, shirt off, attaching a device to her back. \"S-S-Sarah! I'm so sorry!\" Brandon flustered, but not moving as his eyes were fixed on his sister's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah rolled her eyes. \"It's fine. Not like I'm naked.\" She looked down and ran her hands over her belly slowly. \"But check it out: this is an invention I'm trying out to make it easier for pregnant women to walk around.\" Sarah took some steps forward and back, twirling around. Brandon had enough of a gap in his gawking to appreciate that she was far more nimble than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's impressive, sis,\" he nodded. \"I guess you're working on p-p-pregnancy inventions now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. Who better to know the needs of modern pregnant women than someone carrying four little brats?\" Sarah turned and gave Brandon an odd look. \"And does saying 'pregnant' still make you nervous? You're so weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, I guess so,\" Brandon gulped. \"And why did you...change your hair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You noticed?\" Sarah said with a smile, turning back quickly. \"I mean...no reason. I just wanted to look different. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks good,\" Brandon nodded. \"Although, it sort of makes you look like Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah didn't know how to take this, so she walked quickly out of the bathroom: much more quickly than before, thanks to her spinal invention. \"Shower's all clear for you, Brandon. Have fun at your internship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Brandon said with a sigh. He was lucky his internship was paid, but it was incredibly boring. He'd much rather spend time at home or at the mall...or with Erin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few neighborhoods over, Katie woke up slowly, then bolted awake. Today was the day: Ashley promised them a day together and here it was. It was like something out of a romantic movie. Katie fell on Ashley's octuplet pregnant belly and Ashley asked her to spend the day with her. Okay, it wasn't like any romantic movie that existed, but it should. Katie grabbed her cellphone and amulet from her bedside and felt thoughts of greed flow through her again. Once she got enough money, she'd invest in a romantic movie about a shy, cute clerk and a hugely pregnant dominatrix. It would be a sleeper hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie lived in a pretty small, crummy apartment, but at least she didn't need a roommate. She was free to cover the walls in business sketches, which she started yesterday, and look up pictures of pregnant women on her computer whenever she wanted without fearing someone walking in on her and judging her. Katie made herself a fast breakfast, looking between the frying pan and the amulet's manual. There had to be some clues in here about ways she could get Ashley to like her more...or how to make Ashley even bigger. Honestly, Katie didn't know if she should make Ashley any bigger just yet. She'd try to appreciate the belly she had now, and later, she'd go for higher stakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA piece of hot grissle from the frying pan jumped up and burned Katie, causing her to drop her amulet on the floor. \"Damn, damn, damn,\" Katie cursed, picking it up and inspecting it. \"Does this thing still work?\" Katie didn't want to test it on herself, so she opened the door cautiously to see one  of her neighbors, Kim: a seedy, gossipy girl who, despite all of this character flaws, was unbelievably sexy. She also happened to be Tanner's current \"fling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was leaving her apartment with another shallow, sexy friend and Katie pointed the amulet at them, activating its power. The amulet sparked a little and Kim's friend's belly blew up until she was full-term with one baby. \"Sandra, hurry up!\" Kim said. \"Don't let that fat kid in your stomach keep you from going shopping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, as long as your man is paying, I wouldn't stop if I was in friggin' labor,\" Sandra said, clumsily hurrying after her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent,\" Katie cackled, going back into her apartment, not noticing that one of the gems on the amulet was badly damaged.</span></div></div>",

Her hands were slick with sweat and her mouth was dry as a bone as she drove her way over to the Page residence for her fun day with Asshley, err, Ashley.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Dammit Katie, focus on the road. You can fantasize when you get there.\", she thought to her herself. But try as she might, the image of that amazingly plump rear, and more importantly, that titanic stomach and heaving breasts kept entering her mind, sending sexually charged chills down her spine. She was starting to sweat so bad, she was close to ruining the lovely blue blouse she had worn just for this day. She had even rented a car with extra space to accommodate the belly of a woman pregnant with octuplets. The best part? There was space enough to grow, and Katie planned to fill as much of it as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I may only have one day with this Ashley, so I will make this the best day possible for me.\" she thought. \"And with this\", she held the amulet up to her face,  \"it will be a very good day.\"  She placed the amulet back around her neck, still failing to notice the damage as she pulled into the driveway of her destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Katie walked up to the door and was about to knock, but hesitated, anxiety creeping in.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Is this really a good idea, should I really be trying to force this many children on one woman?\", she thought, \"It has to be difficult enough.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The thought of seeing that glorious belly even bigger, and having it all to herself for a day, pushed all doubts out of her mind forever, with a little help from the amulet. She firmly pressed the doorbell, and smiled with the thought of having such a pregnant woman so close to her all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What opened the door knocked Katie's breath away. Ashley was standing in the doorway, well part of Ashley was anyway. All that greeted Katie at the door was a vast expanse of flesh, flawless and round. The belly soon started to move on its own, and it marched towards Katie, followed a few seconds later by Ashley as she waddled onto he front porch. Her bare stomach was on display, and Katie realized that she was wearing the outfit she had picked out at her maternity store, although it fit even less than it did when she came into the shop. The maternity jeans were barely able to be lifted up over her posterior,  and the top of her cheeks were out. The shirt got the worst deal though. While it had tautly covered her breasts last time, now, the light pink shirt was definitely straining to contain her expanded chest. In fact, that was all that it was covering. Her octuplet belly was so big, the shirt was incapable of even reaching it. It now worked as a makeshift bra, As Katie could see, past the heavily distorted floury \"princess\" text, and the thinning fabric, that Ashley was not wearing a bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I told you I could own my belly\", Ashley said, \"I figured If I can't hide my octuplets, I might as well show them off, and boy, can I show them off!\" she said with a wink. \"I honestly couldn't believe I had gotten this on. At least this fits, somewhat, unlike any of those maternity bras and panties I foolishly bought too small. It's probably better that I don't have either on anyway, this outfit is already pretty tight, no need making it more uncomfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Katie's breath came in choppy gasps, too overwhelmed too trust herself to speak. But luckily, she didn't have to just yet.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"If the outfit is tight, why would you wear it?\" Sarah said in an exasperated tone, waddling down the stairs not helping Katie, \"Expectant mothers are encouraged to wear loose fitting clothes to help circulation, especially in your case!\" she said, rubbing a spot where one of her for occupants kicked. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Katie saw Sarah again and still couldn't believe how lucky she was! Right next to two of the most heavily pregnant women she had ever seen! She still wished that there was a way that she could transfer all of their babies into one woman, but knew that apparently was not possible with the amulet. Still, something just made her want to try it, one more time, to see if it truly couldn't be done. so, almost jokingly, she grazed the amulet and wished two of Sarah's babies would enter Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All of a sudden, Ashley's belly surged outwards, even further than before. Katie could see that her maternity jeans slid down a bit further, showing more cheek, and Katie guessed if the now colossal stomach wasn't blocking the view, Ashley would probably be indecent \"downstairs\". Her shirt stretched even further, The text now unreadable, and a rip was starting to work its way down the middle of the garment. Her middle stretched so far, When it stopped, it touched Katie, and she was two steps away from her at first!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I wore this outfit because I look good in it, young woman, and I want to show off to the world my decaplet pregnancy, then that is my choice, and I will not have you chastise it!\" Ashley said. Sarah only, grunted compliance, still upset that her mother, 20 years her senior, was handling a pregnancy that was literally five times bigger than hers, better than herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ashley turned her head back to Katie and smiled, \"Ready to go?\" she asked.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Katie only nodded, which was enough for the heavily laden woman to begin a slow waddle to the rental. Katie was ecstatic. It had actually worked! She didn't know why but it had actually worked this time, and she certainly wasn't going to argue about it. She ran to the rental, greedy thoughts of having her all alone filling her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As she entered the car, Katie looked over to Ashley, belly now spilling over lap, and pulled out of the driveway for a fantastic day, completely unaware of what she had truly just done.</span></div></div>",

Well, Katie was walking, Ashley was snow too pregnant to \"waddle\", and now resorted to widely swinging one leg around in front, and then swinging the other in front, causing her belly to sway back and forth, and had actually hit Katie a couple times now , causing the poor girl to stumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ow!\" Katie said, as the colossal belly struck her for the forth time, sending her sprawling to the ground and awakening her triplets, who proceeded squirm inside her crowded womb.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm so sorry!\" Ashley apologized again, \"This thing is hard to control, Sometimes I feel like a wrecking ball.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's ok\", Katie said, still thrilled to be touching a belly that big, even if it was bowling her over. \"Why don't we take a break and sit down over on that bench over there and let me and these little guys heal?\" she said.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sounds perfect\", Ashley replied, \"we have only been walking for a couple minutes, but I am already exhausted!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The two women sat down, and Katie could hear the bench creak and strain to hold their massive maternities. As Ashley sat down, her, now ten, children seemed to awaken inside of her, and her stomach seemed to take on a life of its own. Katie was mesmerized, the whole thing shifted and undulated to the time of their tiny kicks, making it almost seem alive. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wow\", was all Katie could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I know\", Ashley commented, rubbing the mountain of flesh, \"I'm amazed by it every day too. I never expected this, being in my late forties and have this happen. It got even weirder when I managed to carry these to term. My doctors say it is nothing short of a miracle.\" She looked down at herself. \"I don't feel like a miracle, I haven't seen my feet in six months. Heck I haven't even seent the end of my own belly either. Look\", Ashley wrapped her arms around her stomach, her hands not quite able to grasp each other, \"I can't even feel the end of my belly anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She smiled across the bench, \"Would you like to?\" she asked. Katie had taken to staring at her wonderful maternal body, it took a second to register she was being talked to.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What?\" She asked.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Would you like to feel the parts I can't reach?\" Ashley inclined, giving her stomach a nice pat. Katie was throught the roof.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"O-Of C-Course\", Katie stammered, unable to believe her sitiuation. She slowly went tothe front of Ashley, and placed a hand on her massive stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ashley's stomach surged out yet again, Bumping Katie once again and the fall masking the small spark that came off her amulet. The orb of flesh, now actively spilled over the mother to be's lap, and started to hang down a bit. Katie could hear massive ripping noises coming from above, and looked up to see that the shirt now had a massive teardown the middle, as the breasts they, barely, contained grew once again. The shirt was now showing off almost dangerous levels of cleavage, and becoming so threadbare, Katie could clearly see Ashley's nipples poking through the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Katie was completely caught off guard by this sudden growh spurt. She got up from the ground while Ashley apologized again.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sorry\", she said, \"one of my thirteen in here may have accidently knocked you down. They do that, well, certainly to my bladder.\" She said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thirteen?\" she thought, \"She only had ten before.\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But a quick look down revealed where the extra children had come from. Her triplets were gone! The maternity blouse now hung loose fitting around her torso, not having any sort of belly to give it form. Somehow, she had transfered her pregnacy to Ashley by mistake!<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I don'think so\", Katie thought, grabbing the amulet, \"you don't get to have all the pregnancy fun.\" She pressed a gem down, and widened her eyes in horror when nothing happened.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What? Why won't it work?\" She thought, panicked and several more gem presses, to no avail. The chlidren in Ashley's womb, were there to stay.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was then that something truly troubling hapened. Before Katie could process what had happened, another person came jogging down the trail. Sandra, Kims friend. As she passed, her pregnant stomach began to deflate, and once again, Ashley's grew once more. Katie watched in awe as her belly grew outwards once more. Ashley could no longer even touch anywhere close to the front of her belly, and the shirt was hanging on by a few threads in the middle of her even greater breasts. Katie couldn't see her maternity pants, but had a feeling they were faring just as badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Lucky girl\", Ashley said, \" She is able to go jogging and probsbly has no idea what a gift it is to be able jog, let alone walk or get up on your own. Being pregnant with fourteen kids tends to put things in perspective. Speaking  of which, weren't you going to rub it. I can't reach, and it would feel very nice.\" she said, completely unaware she had just gained four more occupants to her womb in under a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Katie's eyes widened as the realization of what happened, what was happeneing, dawned on her. She looked down at her amulet, and for the first time, noticed the damge. \"Shit\" The main thought going through her mind at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ashley was greedily stealing pregnancies of other women just by being near them, and Katie couldn't shrink her down.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This probably started when I used it on her the first time this morning, while it was damaged. Hell, I bet the only reason I COULD do it was because it was damaged.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0While The thought of seeking out pregnant women and pushing them near ashley just to watch her grow popped into her mind for a second, Katie knew that this could be dangerous, and she had no Idea how to handle it. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright\", Katie thought, \"priorities.  First things first, she needs new clothes, or if she will be stark naked in public in the next couple of minutes.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hello? Belly rubs?\" Ashley said quizzically. Katie's focus came back to the goliath of a belly in front of her. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"While I would love to\"' she said, and she really would.\"Why don't we go shopping instead? while you may own your belly, you have to admit that it \"Doesn't fit well.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ashley looked down at herself and sighed. \"I guess you are right. Let's head to the mall! A little help?\" She said, and held out her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After a half hour of grunting and pulling, Ashley was on her feet and the two moved to the car. Ashley's sidestep waddle was now even more pronounced, and she had to keep a hand under her stomach at all times just to lift it up, it was so heavy. Sadly, they didn't make it to the car unscathed. A pregnant woman waddled by and, sure enough Ashley grew again, confirming Katie's hypothesis. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The shirt finally gave in and ripped in half, luckily falling over her breats and still covering them, but Katie could see that they no longer even covered her breasts as a little underboob was visible. Her pants were almost destroyed as well, and almost all of her butt was gloriously on display. One more kid would probably get her charged with indecent exposure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The two women made it to the car and, upon seeing that all the \"Extra room\" Katie was so proud of earlier still coudn't fit her in, Katie had to fold dow the back seat and Ashley had to get in through the trunk. she took up almost all the space in the back.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thanks  again for getting a special car for me.\", Ashley said, \" Not many vehicles can fit a woman pregnant with fifteen babies.\" She chuckled.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No problem\" Katie chuckled back nervously. \"To the mall!\" she cried as she pulled out from the park, wondering just how this day was going to go.</span></div></div>",

She knew that she made the correct choice, but that didn't meant she had to like it.<br>\r\n*******************<br>\r\nIn the park<br>\r\n*******************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie was resting on a bench she always frequented, from there she could she many parts of the park, the amount of preggos that came to exercise didn't hurt either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Why did that had to happen today\u2019 Katie thought, remembering what happened earlier in the morning. She was seriously excited about spending the day with Ashley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalking about pregnant woman, there was one jogging down the trail. The woman had dirty blond hair held by a ponytail and her generous breasts seemed like they were wiggling for freedom from the tight top she was using. But what attracted her complete attention was the white orb in the middle, her stomach heaved up and down with every step she took and the drops of sweat falling on it made it more attractive to her. She continued staring as her target got closer, she already had big sunglasses over her eyes so no one would notice her unless they were really near. If Katie was right the woman should have been pregnant with triplets. As she passed, her pregnant belly slowly deflated. Katie meanwhile felt a tingle, looking down she saw her belly expand until it took the same size the other woman had. Grabbing her belly(partially covered by her new big breasts) to see if it was real. \u2018OH SHIT!\u2019 She thought, \u2018I have to get out of here before I end immobile\u2019. Getting up in alarm she jogged/walked as fast as she could to her car, her belly making it impossible for her to run. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't even one third of the way to her car when she stopped to recover. \u2018Damn\u2019 she thought, \u2018I didn't get the muscles to move\u2019. \"clap, clap, clap\" she heard behind her, twisting her head she looked and felt the blood draining from her face. For the group of women at least 50 meter in distance it could be said that the woman from before was part of a group of heavily pregnant women that reunited in the mornings to run together and that she was the tiny one of the group, seriously the smaller one she could see from the distance looked like she have 5 or more, and THEY WERE GETTING NEAR FAST!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing all the strength she had Katie ran like the devil was behind her but those women were looked like they have been doing this a lot because they were gaining ground really fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question is: did she made it? </span></div></div>",

She somehow managed to fit on her mothers pregnant clothes from the previous time Louisa was pregnant, 2 days ago. \"Don't be stupid\" Douglas said driving up to the valet. Getting out they walked into the building to see an open, pearly white hall way. There were stairways going to all kinds of different places and a large variety of colourful and exotic plants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked through building and up to the veranda on the back. Instantaneously Douglas headed to the polo guys at the bar, Erin waddled quickly to the buffet and Louisa was left with Brody. \"Mommy, mommy!\" Brody called tugging at Louisa's hand. \"What's wrong Brody? Do you want your animals?\" Holding his hands and giving the best cutesy wutesy look, Brody gave a large, toothy smile and nodded to his pregnant mother. Pulling out a giraffe, an elephant, a lion and a zebra, Louisa handed them to him. As fast as a cheeta he ran off, to play near the trees that were dangerously close to the golf course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the book club Louisa made her way up stairs to the 8 cougars with various delicious cocktails in one hand, and to compensate for their lack of reading books, another alcoholic beverage in the other hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDriving into the parking lot, Brandon grabbed the lunch on the passengers seat and walked into the large 7 storey building. As he walked into the office he saw his creepy boss hug his unfortunate wife and daughter. \"Geez, he is seedier than the prime minister of Australia.\" Brandon said as he walked over to his desk. The morning was fairly boring, Brandon made coffee and worked on data entry. Around 11 Brandon noticed that the boss's mother and daughter were still there. The mom had aged gracefully, her greying brunette hair in a neat bun. The daughter however had a more country girl vibe with her flannel jacket, jeans and lightly freckled face. Looking down at his amulet he could see one of the gems glowing intensely. Tapping the gem nothing happened. So he tried rubbing the gem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPIPIPIPIPIPIPIIIIINNNNNNNNGGGGGGGG<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of seconds every woman in the building had become heavily pregnant. It was almost as if an invisible bomb went off in the building. After dispersing the energy the gem started to fade until it's glow was faintly brighter than the other 6. For some reason everyone carried on, as if nothing happened. \"Hmmm, must be nothing\" he said putting the amulet back in his shirt. \"Brandon\" his boss tony called, \"the lovely ladies here have some cravings, go down to the corner store and grab these things\" he passed him a sheet of paper listing no foods whatsoever. Instead the list had consisted several kinds of alcohol. Sighing Brandon got up and headed to the elevator. As the doors started to close, a feminine hand flew out and stopped them. It was the daughter of the boss. She walked in all tomboy like and rested her hands on the rail. \" sorry, I hate taking the stairs, for obvious reasons\" she said, pointing at her 8 month pregnant belly. \" it's all good, I'm Brandon, who might you be?\" Brandon said extending out his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina woke up slowly, holding onto her 9 month pregnant belly. She yawned, giving her middle a good scratch. Normally she would get up around 7 but after yesterday's performance, she needed a good rest. She waddled over to the bathroom, after getting the wake up call from her uterus, she was gunna need it. Turning on the hot water she picked up her phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;good morning Catalina<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemember you and I have a lunch appointment at 1 today to discuss your contract and I would like you to meet someone who will be working with us. See you then!&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the phone down next to the amulet she stepped into the warm, relaxing shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the sun shining on her back and the water flowing beneath her, Janice's body glided through the Olympic size swimming pool. Unlike the pool at the gym this pool was much, much more public. Finishing her 10th freestyle lap, she swam over to the ladder and slowly climbed out of the pool. Her muscles helped her bring her triplet filled belly up first with little stress. Then with some kind of yoga magic she brought herself out of the pool in a matter of seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to her bag she saw a bunch of 13 yr old swimming punks making fun of her body. Putting on the amulet, she became filled with rage. \"You think this is funny, you acne faced dicks!?\" Janice called out infront of several families. Storming back over to the pool she jumped back in. Waves flowed as she swam over to the 3 douches. \" if you guys think you are so great, I dare you to a race, three laps, if I win, I get your cash, you guys don't return to this pool, and you wear ladies bathing suits out of here! You win, I won't press charges.\" Chuckling they agreed, it wasn't like they were going to lose. \" don't do this Janice.\" Janice's old swimming instructor said. \" I know you used to be an Olympic candidate, but you are in no shape to race!\" Janice ignored  her, the rage burning harder inside her than a forest fire<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant walked down the grass hill to the public pool, a day like this was perfect for swimming. He heard a whistle come from the far end of the pool. Looking over he saw Joel's heavily pregnant ex shoot like a rocket, feet thrashing as she swam at an incredible speed. The three teens were catching up behind her, but she wasn't going to give them any space. Rolling around her feet made contact with the pools wall and WOOSH, she was gliding through again. One of the punk kids realised he had no chance and quietly swam quickly over to exit the pool. By the third lap Janice was starting to loose breath. The punks saw their chance and caught up. It was neck and neck, with a final burst of energy Janice sped to the finish line. Fist in the air she roared in victory. Several mothers and people there applauded and Grant stood in shock, melted Ice cream in one hand, towel in the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three punks fled the public pool, embarrassingly wearing women's bikinis. People laughed as hey ran to the turnstiles. Running as quickly as they could they couldn't hide their shame.Janice climbed out and waddled over to her towel again. That was close, she needed to improve. Grant walked past her trying not to be noticed. Fat chance. \"Hey! You!\" Janice called out to the bearded geek. \" You're Joel's friend! We need to talk...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMeanwhile around town<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah bent back, letting her belly jut out as she took deep, slow breaths. Her hands were kept on her hips and her feet close together as she concentrated on letting her breaths in and out and bending back further. Just as she was getting her belly higher up in the air, some more kicks inside her womb threw her off-balance and Sarah groaned, straightening herself back up and rubbing her belly to quiet her quadruplets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, you're always making things hard for me,\" Sarah complained, looking over her notes on her bed. Sarah's \"office\" was essentially just her bedroom, which had to be used not only for sleeping and getting dressed, but for contacting investors, selling her products, and even putting together her inventions. As Sarah looked over her papers, it was clear that the spinal flexibility of her pregnant mobility device was performing optimally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll be a load-off for this Dr. Schultz guy,\" Sarah said, removing the device and tossing it onto her bed. The benefits of a non-invasive machine that made movement while pregnant easy were obvious. Sarah wondered if she should even bother with further testing, considering putting the device on her mother Ashley, who was near full-term with octuplets. But as Sarah gently caressed her amulet, envy continued to well up inside her heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I don't need to make life any easier for her. For once, I have the upper hand over that woman</i> Sarah cackled inside her head. She gripped her amulet more tightly, feeling its power flow through her. More so than usual. Sarah took the necklace out from between her breasts and studied the brilliant jewelry in her palm. It was beautiful and strange and there appeared to be lights moving throughout it, although very faintly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's inventive mind began churning and Sarah went to her work desk, looking for a meter to detect electric current and energy. Touching the metal rods to the amulet, she studied her readings and was confused. \"It's not electricity, but there's some sort of energy coming from here,\" Sarah said. She sorted through her devices until she found a somewhat consistent reading. Still, it wasn't enough. \"Time to do some work, I guess,\" Sarah said, wiping her forehead and sitting down at her desk, grabbing a screwdriver and a magnifying glass. \"Let's see if we can make something to figure out how you tick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownstairs, Ashley was sighing to herself, leaning back on the couch as she watched television, waiting for Katie to come pick her up. Her amulet rested on top of her swollen womb, its power filling Ashley - literally, by the look of her gigantic belly. Lust continued to pound in Ashley's head and she reached her hand down slowly to try and reach her lap, her fingertips barely making it to her shorts. Her octuplet-filled belly was in the way, but Ashley also decided to hold back for other reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Ashley, not while your daughter's still in the house and you're in the living room,\" Ashley grumbled, shaking her head. \"But damn, I didn't think it would take this long to get...anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley had a dry spell with her last \u2014 and unbeknownst to Sarah and Brandon, only \u2014 pregnancy, when Tanner also refused to do anything with her. And during that time, Ashley had built up a modest stock of toys and gadgets to keep herself satisfied, but with this pregnancy, Ashley felt like it wasn't going to be enough. Ashley wanted sex. Real, honest-to-goodness sex with another human being. And almost as much as that, she wanted to be appreciated, even if she looked and felt like a beached whale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in her room, Sarah had managed to detect the energy coming from the amulet. It was...peculiar, to say the least. Sarah couldn't even put her finger on it. It was biochemical, but it also wasn't. It had some similarities to body heat, but in other ways, it differed wildly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this is worth some investigation on its own,\" Sarah said, putting one hand on her expanded hips as she looked her device over. One of its measuring tongs slipped off and landed on Sarah's belly and the readings grew. \"Now that's strange,\" Sarah nodded, looking between her belly and the device. \"It's almost like this energy signature is specific to...pregnancy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhipping something up, Sarah built a slightly fancier version of her meter, putting the amulet in the center. \"Now I should be able to measure the readings...like this,\" Sarah said, turning a knob to adjust the waves of the strange energy. As she did, Sarah felt her belly get tighter as it swelled out until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping her device, Sarah put both hands on her belly, looking at it in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God!\" Sarah said in a screamed whisper. \"I'm even bigger! It feels like...there's another one in there!\" Sarah looked down at the amulet, thinking about how Ashley had one too. \"This...this amulet is somehow holding onto some sort of primordial 'pregnancy' energy.\" The door downstairs swung shut and Sarah let out a little yelp as she snuck out to the staircase to look down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie had just entered the house and was giving Ashley a very eager hug. \"I'm so happy you made it,\" Ashley smiled, loving the touch of someone on her pregnant body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-of course,\" Katie grinned. \"We've become such good friends so quickly, d-don't you agree?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do,\" Ashley smiled, breaking the hug to look Katie over. \"Well, why don't we start our little adventure together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie's heart nearly leaped out of her chest as Sarah watched the scene from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>My mother would rather spend time with this little mousey woman instead of her own daughter?</i> Sarah steamed. <i>Why does she get these things? Why does my mother get all of the attention?</i> Sarah's eyes narrowed on Katie's amulet and Sarah got curious. Aiming her device at Katie, she turned her knob violently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie stopped in her tracks, looking down at her belly. Once again, she was pregnant, this time full-term with triplets. She didn't remember using her amulet, but what else could it be? She turned back to face Ashley, still smiling like nothing had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong?\" Ashley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, it's fine,\" Katie said, rubbing her belly slowly. \"I just wondered if...you'd had breakfast yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little bit, but it takes a lot to feed this momma-to-be nowadays,\" Ashley laughed, stroking her hugeness. \"Let's get brunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-good,\" Katie said, waddling back out to her car, happily helping Ashley inside. Sarah hurried back to her room, jaw agape, wondering what she could do with her new, amazing invention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley and Katie got plenty of looks as they ate. Well, Ashley did most of the eating, although Katie's own triplet-pregnancy cravings made her a honorable contender. <i>Maybe I should open up a restaurant catering specifically to pregnant women</i>, Katie thought, her greedy mind peeking through the haze of affection she had for Ashley. <i>I'd make a ton</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo obnoxious but gorgeous women were in the booth next to theirs, laughing and talking loudly. As Ashley's meal slowed down, she started to hear what they were saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He buys me whatever I want. It's great,\" Kim smiled as her newly-pregnant friend Sandra ate with gusto. \"And the sex isn't too terrible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lucky you found such a great sugar daddy,\" Sandra grinned. \"All of our friends have such creepy guys. But this guy's married with kids so he has to be careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he only has time for sex. No talking, no cuddling, just money,\" Kim laughed out loud. \"He said it's because his wife's a big fat preggo. Like, way huger than you, Sandra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Octuplets,\" Kim cackled. \"And those babies aren't going to have a lot of money left. All of my clothing for the last nine months has been paid for by Mr. Tanner Page.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley gripped her table angrily before taking a deep breath and heaving herself out of her booth, waddling up to Kim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now I know why my husband doesn't just masturbate in the house instead of fuck me,\" Ashley purred, running one hand over her belly. \"He's got you to play with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God,\" Sandra said, looking Ashley over. \"You were right, Kim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim didn't say anything, her face frozen in shock. Ashley scoffed and bent down, belly and breasts hanging down as she gave a cruel smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better make sure he wears a condom. You can see how big he makes 'em,\" Ashley said, slapping her belly. \"And a young, fertile girl like you...shit, he could get you knocked up with 12 of his bastards.\" Ashley turned around and walked back to her booth, ass swaying back and forth on purpose. Kim and Sandra paid their bill quickly and hurried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they left, Ashley's tough exterior fell away and tears welled up in her eyes. \"I can't believe it...no, I can believe it. What a scumbag,\" she began to growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashley, I'm so...\" Katie reached out a hand and took Ashley's. The hairs of the back of her neck stood on end when she felt how soft Ashley's palms were. \"I'm so sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Katie,\" Ashley sniffed, wiping one tear from the corner of her eye. \"You're a good friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm always here for you,\" Katie said, gripping Ashley's hand. \"For anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley raised one eyebrow. \"Anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie felt her face flush. \"Y-yes...anything.\"</span></div></div>",

Rubbing the side of her belly with one hand and she rested against the elevators side. Brandon couldn't stop looking at the taut pregnant belly in front of him. A petite belly like that looked 'cute'. \"So how long have you worked for dad?\" Kristina asked, looking at Brandon's lips. \" I'm just here for another week and a bit.\" Brandon replied. \" what's going on, shouldn't we be at the bottom now?\" What Brandon didn't see was that Kristina had pulled the emergency stop lever. \" you're right, that is odd. You know it's funny, we have seen each other around the office soo much but never talked. I wonder why\" Kristina said, putting her left hand on the wall. \"So, what do you do outside of here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Not much, I take care of my mum and sis, they're pregnant\" Brandon answered, leaning against the right side of the elevator. \" trust me I know how they feel\" Kristina joked rubbing her belly. She hadn't had sex since she got pregnant, and she needed a good fuck, she had to have it. NOW. This guy was perfect, he waspretty weak willed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they are incredibly pregnant with more than 4 kids, each\" Brandon said starting to sweat thinking of Sarah's big, alluring belly. Shaking it off he looked down to see that the short brunette was closer. \" I'm guessing that means you aren't dating then\" she softly said, tracing her fingers around her sides. \" Technically no, I mean there was this one thing, but I-uuuhhh\" Brandon's mind was racing, his erection poking through his pants, Kristina had him right where he wanted him.  Their lips came closer and closer, they could feel their breath, a bolt of pleasure came through as they locked lips, Brandon had become more vicious after Erin, his tongue acted like a fierce snake. Kissing harder and harder they undressed. Brandon ripped the flannel shirt off the petite lady, buttons going flying. Groping her small breasts Brandon was shocked as he was pushed against the wall. \"Down\" she commanded with great valour. Brandon did what he said getting down on his back and taking his pants off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cute slutty woman took of her jeans and ripped open her flannel shirt. Buttons flew everywhere as she  lowered herself down. Grinding her lower belly up against Brandon's member, Brandon was on the edge of nirvana. Slowly She placed Brandon's member inside her, biting her lower lip as she felt every inch of him going inside, tickling her clitorus. \"AAaaaahhhHh\" Kristina cried, she starting riding him, faster and faster. They were in complete and utter ecstasy. Kristina cried in orgasm as Brandon continued to lay in nirvana. He was so incredibly close to cumming he could hear gears. Wait, gears moving? The elevator was in moving again! In a matter of seconds they were trying to get up and getting their clothes on. The pants were easy. The real problem was her shirt. Nearly all her buttons had flown off in their primal state. Brandon tried to stop the elevator again, to no avail. \"Give me your shirt\" Kristina said, Brandon saw no other option, he threw over his shirt and then did his best to put the flannel shirt on. He resided to just having his singlet showing as they left the building together. What they hadn't realised however was the video camera in the corner of the elevator that recorded EVERYTHING.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina walked down the street of restaurants, after passing some delectable restaurants she came to 'Aquarius' . Walking into the empty restaurant she saw Antonio and a pregnant Asian woman sitting at a table near the bar. Antonio sipped his scotch with his very red fingers holding the glass. He placed down his glass to look up at the very beautiful Spanish actress. \"Ah Catalina, a pleasure it is that you were able to come, I would like you to meet-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Renee, lovely go meet you\" Rebecca said yawning as she shook Catalina's hand. Why did she have to be here? she just wanted to be at home eating marshmallows and watching CSI. \"So, I am sure you  2 are wondering why I brought you 2 lovely pregnant ladies to this fine establishment. Well this restaurant is owned by me, so lunch is on me. 4 French waiters came out with rolling tables. There was a large variety of foods, stacked 2 feet high. The first plates went down and Rebecca chowwed right in. Catalina was shocked, \" Antonio, you don't expect me to work with this woman do you?\" She whispered to the tall older fellow, \" I'm supposed to be back on set tomorrow morning, where will this, woman come into the mix of things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" you know, you shouldn't talk in front of someone who reads lips.\" Rebecca said, putting her knife and fork down. \" well you should learn to breathe between bites!\" Catalina retorted back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I'm eating for 3 here, I don't see you feeding your only child.\" Rebecca called back wiping sauce off her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BOTH OF YOU STOP IT\" Antonio demandingly called, his sheer voice bringing them to complete and utter silence. \"you two are adults not children, I will not deal with petty arguments. Now to talk about why you two are here. \" one of Antonio's assistants Wendy  came out with a map of Smallton. Thanking the lady scientist he pulled the map out on he table. \" Now as you may know I now own the mall at the centre of the city, plus most of the businesses around it. Now if we, we, Wendy, are you ok?\"  Antonio turned, annoyed by the clicking he was hearing. It was Wendy, she couldn't stop adjusting her bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" yeah, ugh I'm so sorry, this fit me yesterday, but after my stomach bug nothing fits.\" Wendy grunted fidgeting some more. \"Can I go?\" Antonio nodded and let her leave. \"Okay, if there are no more distractions, let's continue. Directly north is where we are in the restaurant district. Down south are the schools and town hall plus all those government buildings like the court house, police station, blah blah blah. South East is where all the sporting stuff is located,  swimming pools, the running and race tracks plus the fitness centre. And East is entertainment district, with your cinemas, bowling alleys, bars and clubs. So, why am I showing you this? I'll tell you soon. Now I understand you two want nothing more than power and cash, trust me I want that too. We could always try the suburbs, but I'm not looking to invade peoples lives, all I want to provide them with the best energy source known to man. Life.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on earth are you talking about?\" Catalina said, confused with his pontificating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I'll tell you. Do you two know what 'entropy' is?\" Antonio asked them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" it's a lack of order or predictability, the gradual decline into disorder\" Rebecca said, nibbling on a chicken wing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct Renee, now, let's take the origami favourite the crane for example. Now that is work energy, put into something to make it look beautiful.\" Antonio said, walking around the table. \"Now let's say someone puts it under a flame. In seconds the energy spent on that crane is gone. No more. But, if we apply the right materials to it, that crane can live for a long time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay so, we have a paper bird and something about energy, but where are you going with this?\" Catalina said, neither intrigued nor annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now life is an amazing thing, but technically we are always dieing. I myself am on the verge of passing my prime, in twenty years I'll need a cane to walk and will need new teeth. A sad problem about life is that we don't die after we peak, but what if we could retain the energy we once had? No wrinkles, no flame to our crane, just an evolutionary second win and all it will cost, is your loyalty.\" Antonio walked to the bar to grab a jug and poured himself a glass. \" lemme ask you about your pregnancies, what are some of the problems you have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm always tired, hungry, my feet hurt so much and I never get a good nights sleep\" Rebecca said whining as she rubbed her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I can't help but go after my cravings, my back hurts so much, I miss having wine, cocktails and I pee so much it's like I'm a freaking fountain\" Catalina said shamefully in defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, firstly I'm so sorry women have to go through this, I wish there was something I could do. Secondly there IS something I can do. Now I understand you two are in very demanding jobs, babies would absolutely ruin your lives, am I right?\" Antonio asked, as delicately as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" well yes, but this is a human life growing inside of us, there is nothing more special than that!\" Catalina stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" ah yes, but hasn't your celebrity status become larger since become pregnant?\" Antonio said, taking a drink from his glass. \" imagine, if you remained pregnant, how much of a role model you would be to pregnant women everywhere. Your face would be on bill boards, adverts for everything, get the Catalina maternity lingerie, the Catalina breakfast cereal, the Catalina chain saw! Well maybe not the chain saw\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina thought about it, this was her opportunity to become larger than life, all she needed to do was say yes. \" two questions, what will happen to my belly and the baby growing inside? And secondly is whatever you are providing to do reversible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" well for the former i have to say that the fetus would become pure energy, you would still retain the pregnant firgure, but you could do anything you wanted to do when you weren't pregnant. Anything that changes the pregnancy will either give you more or less energy. Secondly I have the best scientists in the country, if you want a baby, I'm sure we will help you have one\" Antonio said in a very convincing matter. \"Look, cards on the table, my plan is  to create immortality from foetuses. The only problem is, artificial foetuses or test tube babies don't hold the key, pregnant mothers however do hold the key. The energy they produce in their nine months in unbelievable, imagine what we could do with that energy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" okay, what do you need me to do?\" Catalina said in great confidence<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

I am loyal to Joel, I can't bad mouth the guy\" Grant stammered, his gasps coming quicker and quicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The pregnant woman took a moment to breathe. She was not going to get through to this man by yelling harder than Gerard Butler. \" Okay, Grant, maybe I came off too forcefully. All I wish to know is how the man of my children is, and I just want to know why he won't see me.\" The calm talking worked, Grant came out of hair shell. \" Well, if you put it that way, he is actually not too bad.

As she passed the canteen she saw on the pin board with a couple of ads. Amongst them was one for a jazz bar called Hayden's.

As he passed the several different businesses he saw a familiar face upset with a pregnant friend. Ashley wiped away her tears, she had to regain control, she had a day out with a sexy petite friend.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ma'am?\" the cashier repeated. \"Ma'am?\" Katie was still staring out the door of the Mr. Tucker's Chicken, having just watched Ashley, the gorgeous, fun pregnant woman who just started to warm up to Katie, walk out the door with the first moderately handsome guy she saw. Or maybe he was actually attractive for a guy? Katie could never figure out what made a man good looking. Women were always her thing, and specifically, pregnant women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey lady! I'm on a lunch rush!\" a construction worker behind Katie yelled. A sizable line had formed behind her. Katie slowly turned back around to the bored cashier who gave Katie an expectant look. Katie was heart-broken, but not enough to undo her hunger. The gears inside her mind started to turn as she formed her order and the new \"greed\" part of her brain snapped into action. In business terms, Ashley was a resource that would yield very, very \"profitable\" returns and if she was being lured away by another interested party, what Katie needed was to start a hostile takeover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take two to-go orders,\" Katie said, an angry grin spreading across her chipmunk cheeks as she rubbed her belly pensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown the street, Ashley was waddling slowly alongside Joel, smiling wide. Joel had a more composed smile, trying to act cool, despite his inner voice jumping for joy and screaming wildly. \"It's lucky that I ran into you so soon,\" Joel said casually, his gaze darting from Ashley's big eyes to her even bigger belly in a split second. <i>Ohmygod she looks even bigger than she did yesterday</i>! \"I was actually planning on seeing Brandon later tonight and I didn't think I'd get a chance to talk to you then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, Brandon,\" Ashley said, rubbing her belly slowly, her palms filling with plenty of bare skin. \"I have to admit, that makes things...complicated between us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So there's an 'us?'\" Joel said, grinning as he raised an eyebrow. Ashley giggled and looked down, which meant looking down at her cleavage and belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm also glad we met up now,\" Ashley continued, ignoring Joel's fishing. \"I just found out that...my husband's been cheating on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm so sorry,\" Joel said in his silky smooth voice. <i>Oh, thank God! I just keep getting luckier and luckier</i>! his less delicate inner voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it's with a money-grubbing skank. I guess no one's beneath his standards except for his fucking life. Never mind that I gave him a child and I'm carrying eight more of them for him,\" Ashley pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>E-eight</i>? Joel thought, getting weak-kneed just at the number. \"He must be crazy,\" Joel said, trying to regain his persona. \"You're beautiful. One of the most beautiful women I've ever seen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley blushed and smiled softly, the lust emanating from her amulet preparing to flair up again. The more fetuses inside the amulet-holder's womb, the stronger the amulet's affects were, and as an octo-mom, Ashley was on the receiving end of a monumental amount of \"lust energy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie had been cautiously following the two on their walk, not yet discovered. She didn't stop to think about why she hadn't been seen, but the truth was a few feet above her. Yaral's disembodied spirit was following Ashley as well, keenly aware that she was currently the \"most pregnant\" person affect by his amulet. And as the mother to the owner of the \"master amulet,\" he could benefit from checking up on her. Unfortunately, his ability to affect the real world was weakening as the amulets were bonding to their owners. But he saw an opportunity coming up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie looked at her amulet and back at Ashley and Joel. She needed to do something to make Joel less...appealing to Ashley. Remembering the amulet's manual, it was clear that the amulet didn't only affect women. It could make men pregnant too. \"Alright Ashley, how about I make the weight on your back a little lighter while your new friend gains a few pounds?\" Katie cackled to herself, pointing her amulet at the pair and activating it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing happened. Katie tried again and again, but no luck. \"I guess I can't reduce anyone's pregnancy if they already have an amulet,\" Katie said. \"I need to double-check that manual. I don't even remember seeing anything in there about there being more than one amulet...and I need to find a way to fix this flickering.\" One of the jewels on the amulet was sparking slightly ever since Katie dropped it at her own apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Katie fiddled, Ashley and Joel stopped on the sidewalk to face one another. \"I've felt so...alone ever since I got pregnant,\" Ashley said, rubbing both sides of her belly rhythmically. \"I love the feeling of my children kicking and moving inside me and getting bigger every day but I'm not just a mother...I'm also a woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a few steps forward, her belly beginning to press against Joel. \"I can tell,\" Joel said, moving one hand to one of the few parts of Ashley's belly that were covered by her shirt. \"Even if your husband can't tell what you need...I think I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie's amulet sparked violently and Ashley's belly swelled suddenly as another baby was added to the mix. Her new size, combined with her proximity to Joel, knocked the tall schmoozer over, his head hitting against the cement with a loud thud. Ashley couldn't see what was going on too well, thanks to her size, but she could tell he was not doing too well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joel?\" Ashley said, worried, waddling around to try and look down at Joel, never getting a good vantage point. Joel's injury gave him a light concussion and caused him to lose consciousness for a few seconds. And that was just enough time for Yaral to take control of Joel's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm alright,\" Joel said in a sinister voice, slowly standing up as Yaral got adjusted to controlling a mortal body. The last time he'd managed to control a human body, he went into a comatose man in the Smallton hospital. The man's illness rendered him pretty gaunt and ghoulish-looking, so Yaral blended in with the occult garage sale quite well and no one questioned who he was or why he was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you need to lie down?\" Ashley said, getting closer to Joel/Yaral, rubbing her belly and breasts against his side. \"Maybe we should go back to your place and rest in bed.\" She wanted to add \"and cuddle a little\" but bit her lip instead, waiting to see how Joel felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel fine,\" Joel smiled, Yaral's supply of arcane magic fixing up any serious damage to Joel's skull and brain. \"But I think I should go home and prepare myself. Good day.\" He bowed slowly before walking away, right through the street, not even flinching as cars abruptly stopped in front of him and honked their horns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, just great,\" Ashley sighed, crossing her arms under her now H-cup breasts. \"Maybe Tanner isn't the crazy one. Who'd ever want to have sex with a big lady pregnant with nine babies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashley?\" Katie said, smiling innocently while her crafty businesswoman persona laughed triumphantly inside her head. \"You left before we could eat. I figured, from one pregnant woman to another, that you were still hungry so I brought you something to eat.\" Katie held out a paper bag filled with Mr. Tucker's Chicken brand chicken sandwiches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, Katie was smothered by breasts and belly as Ashley hugged her tightly. \"You're such a good friend,\" Ashley said, her voice choking up as she was on the verge of tears. \"And you're right. You know exactly what a pregnant woman like me needs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do,\" Katie managed to muffle out, looking up at Ashley, her \"hostile takeover\" eyes still glaring. \"And I know exactly what it takes to please a pregnant woman...all the ways to please a pregnant woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the street, Joel was walking directly toward his apartment, Yaral able to pull some hints of memory from Joel's brain. \"He said he was going to see the owner of the master amulet tonight,\" Joel said out-loud, not paying attention to the people staring at him as he climbed over bushes and fences to walk in a straight line to his apartment. \"Hopefully he wrote down some notes in his home to make it easier for me to send him there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at Brandon's internship, Kristina was walking happily down the hallways to the large office her father worked out of. Even his office had several sub-offices in it for assistants, conference rooms, and the like. In one of those conference rooms was Kristina's mother Clara, resting her own pregnant body, unaware that a few hours ago, her womb was utterly unoccupied. Her daughter's too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem cheery,\" Clara scoffed, looking Kristina over. \"What happened to your shirt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever do you mean?\" Kristina said in a sarcastic voice, smiling and looking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you don't even own that shirt you're wearing now. It looks like a boy's shirt...I know that look.\" Clara heaved herself out of the chair, holding the underside of her belly as she approached her daughter. \"You had sex, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jealous I found a guy who likes the belly?\" Kristina giggled. The mother and daughter had a very complicated relationship. Kristina knew that Clara only married her husband for his money. The baby she was carrying now wasn't even his. She couldn't bare to have sex with him. But Clara found that finding flings on the side while pregnant was not too easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was it? Tell me now, young lady,\" Clara said in an angry whisper. \"I can make things very unpleasant for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristina sighed and rolled her eyes. \"One of the interns here. Dark, short hair. A little doughy. He's the one wearing my shirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara glared at her daughter before smiling a bit. \"Thank you...I'll be right back,\" she said before heading out the door to find Brandon.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Honestly, it's not all that bad,\" Louisa said, stroking her belly near the country club's veranda as the other wives chuckled, sitting around, working their way through the club's supply of gin. \"Strangely, I haven't felt any of the sickness I felt with Erin or Brody and I feel far less sore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it must be difficult to be pregnant at the same time as your daughter,\" said Joyce, the leader of the country club's \"book club\" and probably the closest out of all the women to Louisa's friend. The book club was a complete front for the women of the country club to make it seem like they were doing something productive while their husbands played golf or otherwise got together in ridiculous macho ceremonies that they set aside as \"men only.\" The \"book club\" usually consisted of drinking, gossiping, and the occasional flirting with one of the club's more attractive young male employees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouisa flashed back a calculated smile, spreading her hand more openly on her belly. \"Not at all. We all look forward to having grandchildren and it's wonderful to be able to share the experience of pregnancy with Erin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't all look forward to grandchildren,\" Barbara scoffed, finishing off her martini. Barbara was the youngest of the \"book club\": a 38-year-old ex-model who could still pass for a woman in her mid-20s. She had platinum blond hair tied up with a pink scrunchy to make a ponytail that went down to her wide hips. She had on a spotless white polo with the top buttons opened to give her chest just enough room to poke out while not causing a scene, with a pink sweater tied and slung over her shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worried it might give the game away?\" Joyce smiled evilly at Barbara. Barbara married a wildly wealthy real estate tycoon so she'd never have to work again. But somewhere in that sham marriage, Barbara also had a baby, which was far from her plans. \"When your little girl has her first little girl, people might start doing some rudimentary math and figure out your real age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara scowled and walked away, refreshing her drink, which meant Joyce could refocus her shade-throwing on Louisa. Louisa knew she had to run interference quickly. \"Sure, I could have been like <b>some</b> other women and passed off my daughter's children as my own, but I'm a bit classier than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Joyce's eyes, and the eyes of most of the \"book club\" moved to Debra, a severely conservative and externally dull woman in her late 40s, with short, straight brown hair and an unimaginative beige dress. \"I don't know what you're talking about,\" Debra said before bringing her glass back to her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it could be much worse,\" Louisa grinned. \"Imagine being like that woman in town and being our age, pregnant with nonuplets. Full term, no less.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And her daughter too, from what I've seen,\" Barbara said, shaking her head. \"They're hard to miss, even though I don't exactly try and patron the same...businesses that people like they do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wasn't your daughter friends with that blimp's son?\" Debra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They rarely see one another anymore,\" Louisa chuckled. \"That woman has some sort of problem with my family. Imagine that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownstairs, Erin was making a third pass through the buffet, the gluttonous energy of her amulet working on overdrive. Erin was oblivious to just how much she was eating, thanks to the amulet's influence, so she couldn't pick up on the perplexed looks the rest of the club's guests were giving her as she she made her way back to her table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite the appetite you have there,\" a voice said. Erin turned to see a man in his early 30s sit down beside her, moving his sunglasses off as he looked at her. \"I like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do I,\" Erin laughed sarcastically, resuming her meal. But the man persisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve seen you here before, but you weren\u2019t\u2026expectant then,\u201d he said. \u201cYou carry it very well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what they tell me,\u201d Erin said, her voice muffled with rice and rolls. \u201cEspecially my boyfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man didn\u2019t let up. \u201cWell whoever he is, I\u2019ll bet he doesn\u2019t have the resources to give that child\u2026those children the proper life. Coming here, I\u2019ll bet you\u2019re used to a certain kind of lifestyle,\u201d he said, slowly moving his hand across Erin\u2019s arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin groaned, getting really annoyed with this guy\u2019s constant hitting on her. \u201cLook, you see this necklace?\u201d Erin said, gripping her amulet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy boyfriend and\u2026the father of these babies gave this to me. It\u2019s made of rubies, pressed-gold, diamonds, pearls, and all that good shit. He\u2019s got more money than you\u2019ve ever seen in your life. Now leave me alone. I\u2019m starving.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man stood up, adjusted his collar, and marched away. Erin sighed with relief and went back to eating, not noticing the man talking with some of the country club\u2019s staff. As she stood up to return to the buffet line, a few waiters approached her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry ma\u2019am, but the buffet at the golf invitational is only good for three go-throughs,\u201d one waiter said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut my family are members here,\u201d Erin said, her desire to eat more forcing her to turn to giving the waiter puppy-dog eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen just give us your club card and you can continue,\u201d the waiter said. Erin bit her lip, watching as the rest of the club\u2019s patrons went through the buffet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, fine,\u201d Erin said, waddling toward the stairs to the \u201cbook club.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re not exactly in club dress code,\u201d the waiter said, motioning to Erin\u2019s exposed belly, courtesy of her amulet\u2019s latest surge. Erin turned back around, looking at the waiter with a skeptical eyebrow. \u201cB-but I suppose in your condition\u2026we can make an exception.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Erin heaved herself up the stairs, not remembering getting up the stairs in her house being this tough before, she could hear the rest of the women in the \u201cbook club\u201d hush one another and try to stifle laugher as she waddled in. \u201cMom?\u201d Erin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Erin,\u201d Louisa fussed, trying to pull the rest of her daughter\u2019s top down to cover her wide, round belly. \u201cYou always have to make a scene and go against dress code.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI try my best, <u>mother</u>,\u201d Erin protested, feeling her cheeks turn red with embarrassment. \u201cWhen you\u2019re pregnant with more than just one baby, you can dictate how I dress.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s something I\u2019d like to see,\u201d Joyce chuckled, taking a slow sip of her manhattan. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry, is this hard for both of you to watch us drink?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d Louisa laughed with an obviously fake cheerfulness. \u201cErin Burke Turner,\u201d she said to Erin, her voice turning to a hiss. \u201cI let you come here because I didn\u2019t think it would be fair to ban one pregnant woman in our family while the other went but\u2026do you have to be so rude?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I only come off as rude because I hate this stuffy life!\u201d Erin yelled back. \u201cI hate having to act prim and proper while creepy guys hit on me. I hate having to be ashamed of being pregnant around these women you don\u2019t even like. And I hate that we\u2019re so snooty that\u2026that Brandon\u2019s mom won\u2019t let us hang out together!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDear,\u201d Louisa said, trying to make her voice sound more composed. \u201cJust calm down now. What\u2019s all this about? And where did you get that amulet? I certainly didn\u2019t buy it for you and I know your father wouldn\u2019t have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis?\u201d Erin said, feeling herself shaking with frustration as she gripped her amulet. \u201cBrandon gave it to me because\u2026because he loves me and I love him!\u201d Erin gave her amulet one last aggressive squeeze before turning around and heading back downstairs in a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPIIIIING<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLosing control of your daughter, Louisa?\u201d Joyce asked, her grin never fading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s just hormones,\u201d Louisa sighed, rubbing her twin-filled belly. \u201cI\u2019m sure we all know what that feels like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the \u201cbook club\u201d chuckled and nodded in agreement, each stroking their own pregnant bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin stormed back through the main part of the club, trying to find a secluded section where she cold fume or maybe text Brandon. She also continued to have a gnawing hunger, thanks to her gluttonous amulet. As she searched with no luck, Erin did come across the promotional sign for the golf invitational.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmateurs: top prizes include leather signed golf bag. Other prizes include pro shop credit, spa tickets, club meal credits, and more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin felt herself start to drool already. Waddling out to the field, she caught up with her father as he was waiting his turn at Hole #4.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOut stretching your legs, honey?\u201d Douglas asked gruffly, hoping she\u2019d leave soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething like that. Any one of these clubs old or useless?\u201d Erin asked, looking through his bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe seven-iron is from my college years. I don\u2019t know why I even keep it around,\u201d he said, watching the drive in front of him and wincing as one of his business rivals made it onto the green. \u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI figure you won\u2019t miss it,\u201d Erin said, taking the club and making it back to Hole #1. Douglas was about to protest before the club games-keeper called his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErin Turner, amateur section,\u201d Erin said to the scorekeeper at Hole #1, taking a scorecard and a ball. \u201cMy father\u2019s a member.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you\u2026sure you want to do this?\u201d the scorekeeper said anxiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. Nothing to lose, everything to gain,\u201d Erin smiled, shifting her hips and taking a big whack. The ball arced perfectly before landing on the green. \u201cBesides,\u201d she said, patting her belly. \u201cLow center of gravity. I\u2019m the perfect player.\u201d</span></div></div>",

He even snuck in a little bit of time to buy a shirt at the mall. Walking in, he saw Kristina talking with her mother in the meal room. His preg-sense was tingling, he was going to be fired and he knew it. With his back competing against the weight of the bags he bee lined for Tyler's office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" hey boss, here's your stuff. I was wondering, seeing as how my last week is next week, can we get our review done? I can give you a chance for me to tell you about the women I have sleeping with\" Brandon said, as he grabbed the bottles and went to place them in the cabinet. \" you know what, you have been doing really well for me this past month, you have a true engineers mind! Why don't we just chat?\" Tyler said showing him the lounge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara left Kristina while she scratched her belly and walked to her husbands office. \" so there is this blonde gal, her name was Alexandra. She had the tightest body you ever seen, oh and her boobs? Done up like the best flotation device, you could use her as a life raft.\" Brandon said to his boss. Sometimes Brandon had a way with words. Actually he knew how to suck up to his boss, it was how he got the paid internship in the first place. Tyler was almost drooling, getting up to pour a glass of scotch he said  \" damn man, to be in my twenties again, and how about her belly, she wasn't like my two whales, were they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" oh no, as flat as your desk, minus for those giant breasts of course. \" Brandon chuckled, he was ashamed of what he said, but he needed this job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst holding a bottle of blue label  Tyler eagerly banged his hand on his finely polished wooden desk. \"HOOO-AH! That's what I'm talking about, you have to introduce me to these girls, It could get you some cash when you are back at uni.\" He was eager to hear more of Brandon's imaginary women \"All you would have to do is find places that would need the help from a building business that need some work done and I'll give you a bonus if the women are ho-ho-honey! \" as he continued to ramble on, Clara walked in. In mid ramble he blurted out \"Great to see you, what are you still doing here? Shouldn't you be at home relaxing and making sure the baby is okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara gave the both of them a slightly disgusted look, sighing she politely asked\" yes fine darling, Brandon, might I have a word with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" honey, look, you are currently pregnant. Being in this current situation you are going to have all kinds of crazy emotions, just don't take it out on the intern. Okay?\" Tyler commented, trying his utter best to get her out of the room. It looked like Brandon was in the clear. \"Go home, and put your feet up.\" He got up and gently moved her out of her room. \" So, what do you say? Up for the job?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making some adjustments and tweaks Sarah decided to take her 'amulet gun' and 'armulet' out on the town. Maybe she could do some good with this device. She walked past an older upset couple outside a maternity store, on closer inspection she found out she couldn't have children. Pulling out the gun, she was ready, aimed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 40 something woman's belly expanded. Their tears disappeared and they walked in like nothing was the matter. \"Hmm, interesting\" Sarah said as she walked into a shoe store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over, she saw five twenty something bitchy sluts. With plantnium blonde hair, enogpugh show able cleavage to make any man sweat and enough fake tan to make them look like Oompa Loompas, they were talking about how stylish their high heels were. Sarah could see they were wearing the latest clothes from the high priced level in the mall, not to mention the shortest of mini skirts, as one spun around, Sarah got a glimpse of her derri\u00e8re in a lacy deep red. Sarah sighed as she gazed upon the group of girls having fun in their outfits. Living in upper middle class in an upper class city Sarah didn't have many friends, most of hem had moved away for college or didn't remain in touch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tallest of the bimbos whispered something to one of her friends whilst pointing at Sarah. A look of shame fell upon her as the five ladies laughed at her. \" well, I guess it doesn't always have to be 'good'.\" Sarah said pulling out the gun as they started to turn away, turning the energy dial up, she fired like a trigger happy cowboy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women's bellies surged out, getting larger and larger till the point where they were all looked 1 month over due with triplets. Their high heels broke under the sheer pressure. \"Whose idea was it to wear high heels in our condition?!\" Called one of them, as the large, wobbly cat fight began Sarah decided to leave the store. Taking the amulet out of the gun piece she attached it to the gadget on her arm and placed the platinum blue gun in her hand bag. Opening up the screen to the radar, she could see there were two 'magical' energy signatures a couple of streets away. She went to find out, she was just hoping she didn't bump into her mother and that Katie woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" all I need is for you to come with me.\" Antonio said, guiding Catalina away from the empty restaurant, past the busy kitchen into something from a <br>\r\nSteam punk/ Lovecraftian story. Rebecca slowly made her way to the large machine in the centre. Placing her amulet in a slot provided the sloth like feeling drifted away from her. Catalina put in her amulet in the slot next to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntonio directed Catalina over to the chair directly under the energy source. \" I don't know, this seems unsafe, have you tested this before?\" Catalina said, looking at the cannon with great concern. \" darling, why do you fret?\" Antonio said reassuring her. Something buzzed in Rebecca's ear piece and she left the room quickly. \" hmm, she must have noticed something. \" of course I tested it, only an idiot wouldn't test something like this.\" He said, comfortably resting his hand on her shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah waddled quicker and quicker to where the device was Bwooming. Bwoom, Bwoom it <br>\r\nwent, leading her to a closed restaurant. Pressing her face against the glass she accidently pushed it open. Stumbling face first into the place a feminine hand grabbed her. Looking up she saw an Asian agent. Without a word to be said she was taken to Antonio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina was just about to sit down when Rebecca came barging in with a largely pregnant woman(Sarah). \"Who are you? What are you doing here?\" Antonio interrogated to the twenty something woman. In shock, Sarah was speechless, words literally couldn't come out of her mouth. This didn't help her situation. \" You know what? Never mind, Catalina, I'll show you how this works, Renee, strap her to the chair.\" Rebecca did as she was told, without her amulet she was back in the game, not that anyone knew that. In a matter of seconds, Sarah was shoved down into the seat, strapped in and Antonio FIRED THE CANNON. A beam of light struck Sarah straight in her belly. An overwhelming sense came over her, like a thousand orgasms a second, her legs spammed, she moaned, cumming in complete pleasure, then blacked out...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well?\" Rebecca asked, looking between Antonio and the now-passed out Sarah. \"Did anything happen?\"<br>\r\nAntonio nodded slowly, grinning, as he put his hand on Sarah's bare belly. \"There's a little jolt when I touch her now. It makes sense: she's got a power station in there. But now, it's time for the real test.\" Antonio snapped his fingers and Wendy walked in from the corner of the room, a long transparent cable in her hand. With one end, she secured a suction cup to Sarah's belly, right above her popped-out navel, and attached the other end to Antonio's arm. Almost instantly, Antonio's withered hand began to fill out until it looked completely healthy. Antonio took in a deep breath, feeling energy flow through his body as his muscles began to swell slightly and any traces of grey hair on his body turned the same illustrious dark brown shade he had in his youth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incredible,\" Wendy breathed, holding a small monitor over Antonio's chest. \"There's no sign of the genetic disease in you at all.\"<br>\r\n\"Not for long,\" Antonio said, removing the wire from his arm. He looked at his now-healthy hand as he clenched and unclenched it. \"It's already starting to get stiff again. The device is incomplete. Even for our guest, her energy levels are only temporary. Inside her womb, it will revert back to her fetuses soon.\"<br>\r\n\"But that's your plan?\" Catalina said slowly. \"You can make that a permanent state? We can generate energy, remain healthy and youthful, and won't feel any typical pregnancy discomfort and be able to drink and do other things regular women can do?\"<br>\r\n\"Exactly,\" Antonio said. \"But to make this plan work, I'll need...capital. That's why I need you to help make the mall even more popular.\" Antonio moved close to Catalina, with her belly the only thing between them. He placed his degenerating hand on her shoulder, while holding her amulet in the other. \"Take your place as the superstar you were born to be.\"<br>\r\nCatalina put the amulet back around her neck, its prideful influence flowing through her once again. \"Of course. I can't pass up a gig like this. And you'll go ahead with my latest request too, won't you? I've got a lot of movies coming out.\"<br>\r\n\"Absolutely. The new movie theatre in the mall will only show Catalina Corazon movies,\" Antonio smiled. \"I'm impressed you were able to have so many made so quickly.\"<br>\r\n\"The studio wanted to capitalize on the bump while I had it,\" Catalina said, rolling her eyes and patting her belly. \"Pregnant commando, pregnant spy, pregnant ninja, pregnant undercover cop, pregnant superhero. I guess there's a market for it.\" Catalina's eyes moved to Sarah, who was still moaning in her sleep. \"What do we do about her?\"<br>\r\n\"She'll need to go,\" Antonio said, motioning to Wendy. \"And so do you. There's a lot of work to be done.\" Catalina nodded and waddled out of the restaurant, followed later by Wendy, wheeling Sarah out in a wheelchair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going to tell us your true plans?\" Rebecca said, taking her amulet back from the machine. Antonio grinned evilly as he turned back to face his top agent.<br>\r\n\"Just do your job, Ms. Quo, and you won't need to worry,\" Antonio said. \"But I would like to know how that woman found us and why she was snooping around. She's one of the Page women that I've been gathering intelligence on. Look into it.'<br>\r\n\"You've got it,\" Rebecca said, putting her amulet back on. Immediately, the sloth energy began to flow back into her body and her eyelids drooped. \"I'll get started...eventually.\"<br>\r\nAntonio turned his back on Rebecca as she left, taking her time, and gazed at his device. He sighed deeply and looked back at his hand, back to its original state. He knew he needed all seven amulets to make the machine work at its full potential, but now that they'd all bonded to their \"hosts,\" he couldn't take them. They had to be given voluntarily. Unless other conditions were met. After one last pass over his device, Antonio headed back to the restaurant and ordered a driver to take him to his mansion to further plan out his ideas for the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim was walking down the street, swaying her wide hips around gleefully, her dress hugging her body tightly. Kim had just dropped Sandra back at her apartment so she could prepare for lamaze later in the day. Kim didn't envy her friend. She had no intention of having children or ever being a mother. Some of her other friends had told her to get pregnant so a sugar daddy will marry her and keep her well financed, but Kim knew she could find the right guy to keep her bank account happy and she found just the man in Tanner Page. Money and gifts in exchange for sex every now and then, and best of all, Tanner was as opposed to Kim getting pregnant as she was.<br>\r\n\"No wonder,\" Kim chuckled to herself, thinking about Ashley and how grotesquely huge she looked at the diner. How can anyone have a belly that big? <br>\r\nChecking her phone, Kim huffed and put her hands on her hips. Tanner was late. To pass the time, she looked through her phone to see what other appointments with wealthy, horny older men she had scheduled. Tanner was definitely a big catch but he wasn't her only source of party funds.<br>\r\nHis car pulled up on the sidewalk and Tanner opened the passenger door. \"Kim! Sorry, get in.\"<br>\r\nKim smiled sweetly, hiding her irritation, as she backed into the car, ass first of course. Just as she was about to give Tanner a peck on the cheek, she saw his other passenger in the back seat. \"Oh my god!\"<br>\r\n\"Don't be too loud,\" Tanner said. \"That's my daughter, Sarah. I found her asleep on a bench in the middle of the city driving from work. A police officer was there and I got her away without any report being written. I'm not sure what happened to her.\"<br>\r\n\"Being pregnant can be exhausting, I guess,\" Kim said, looking at Sarah's enormous belly. <i>It really does run in his family</i>, she shuddered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why pregnant women should stay in the house,\" Tanner grumbled. \"People call me 'traditional,' but those are traditional beliefs for a reason. They work.\"<br>\r\n\"Well I know one pregnant woman who didn't stay in the house today,\" Kim said, leaning close to Tanner. \"Your wife. I met her today at lunch.\"<br>\r\nTanner looked back at Kim in horror. \"You mean...you told her?\"<br>\r\n\"She figured it out,\" Kim said. \"So what? We're not going to see each other anymore? You're going to go back to the big belly?\"<br>\r\n\"Don't be obscene. It's wrong to have sex with a pregnant woman,\" Tanner said, glaring at Kim. <br>\r\n\"But it's not wrong to cheat on your wife?\" Kim giggled.<br>\r\n\"That's different,\" he said, reaching one hand to Kim's lap, rubbing her thigh while he drove with the other. \"Men have needs. It's natural.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't mind,\" Kim smiled, kissing Tanner. The kiss startled him and he hit a speed bump particularly hard, jolting the car and shaking Sarah awake. She didn't quite know where she was, but listened quietly to the conversation going on around her. \"But now that I've seen your wife, I think we need to be more careful with keeping me baby-free. I'd like to be able to fit into my apartment, let alone my clothes.\"<br>\r\n\"We're plenty careful,\" Tanner grinned. \"You can't make a baby the way we like to have sex.\" Kim chuckled in response. \"But it's not like Ashley always gets that...big when she's pregnant. When she was pregnant with Sarah, it was a textbook pregnancy. One baby, no complications.\"<br>\r\n\"What about with your son?\" Kim asked.<br>\r\nTanner paused. \"Brandon's not our biological son. A few friends of ours got into a bad accident and they had a baby son back at home. It was in their will that if anything happened, we'd take care of him. We've never told him about it, though. Or Sarah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah squinted a few times, the rest of her body waking up. Did she hear her father correctly? Brandon's not her biological brother? Then those feelings she had when he rubbed her belly, the ways she thought about him...weren't too unnatural? <br>\r\n\"Anyway, that's why I told you to come see me,\" Kim said. \"I thought you should know. You can just drop me off at the mall.\"<br>\r\nSarah felt the car slowing down but still had questions. Taking one of the gems off of her amulet, she dropped it into Kim's purse, sitting just out of their cone of vision. It registered faintly on Sarah's radar, so she could find her dad's mistress later on.<br>\r\nWhen Kim stepped out of the car, Sarah decided to make herself known. \"Mpf, dad? Why am I in your car?\"<br>\r\n\"Good, you're awake,\" Tanner said. \"I found you asleep on a bench out in the middle of the city. What on Earth happened to you?\"<br>\r\nSarah remembered tracking her radar, but not much else. \"I'm not sure...can you take me home?\"<br>\r\n\"That's where we're going,\" Tanner grumbled. \"Text your mother to see if she's home too.\"<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n\"...no reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the parking lot, Joel, still possessed by Yaral, was walking toward the mall. Controlling a body took a lot of energy and Yaral needed to meet Brandon at his appointment with Joel tonight. That meant absorbing some chaotic energy to stay strong. As Joel walked into the mall, he was grabbed by the collar and pulled into a service alley by Janice.<br>\r\n\"You bastard! You finally decided to show your face here again?\" Janice smirked, tightening her grip on his collar.<br>\r\n\"You're angry...good,\" Joel said, breathing in her wrath. \"There's enough chaos here. I can use my limbs much better now.\"<br>\r\n\"Hold on a damn minute,\" Janice said as Joel tried to move away. \"Nothing about your children? About you hitting on one of my students?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm bored with this,\" Joel sighed, looking at one of his hands. \"I wonder what powers I maintain in his form?\"<br>\r\n\"Bored? Look pal, if I see you with another woman again-\"<br>\r\nJoel moved out of the way, part of his shirt ripped off in Janice's hand. He turned to her and tapped her on the belly. Immediately, she started to swell up, her spandex yoga clothes rolling all the way up until her belly was totally exposed. She was now pregnant with sextuplets.<br>\r\n\"That took too much energy,\" Joel panted. \"I'll try not to do that again.\"</span></div></div>",

We had a really busy morning and it's pretty much dead here, I'll call in one of the new employees so you can get some rest.&gt; <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm looks I have some more exploring to do\" Yaral said, walking over to the most populated place in the mall, the food court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley and Katie sat down at a bench that groaned  underneath their combined weight. As Ashley ate her chicken Katie pulled out a tissue for her to use. Ashley wiped away the tears and took another bite into the deliciously fried chicken. \" I know things may seem a bit down, but at least your kids still love you.\" Katie said as she took a sip from her drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" heh, you know, I am not quite sure. \" Ashley replied sighing.\" Sarah think everything is a competition and Brandon, Brandon isn't even in my son!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course he is, you two look so alike!\" She said knowing that was incorrect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" you're kind, but a bad liar. Brandon's true mom, oh she was something. Sure Tanner is cheating on me, but I guess I was the first one to do anything like that.\" Ashley confessed, she hadn't talked about this to anyone, but Katie was someone safe, she had been helpful throughout the past week, now she could confide with her. \"Just after having Sarah I was feeling incredibly alone. I remember that August night, her short black hair and the glass of wine too many. She showed me things that night that no man could ever do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I really like you\" Katie blurted out. All that talk of lady love sent her mind into meltdown. \" Ashley, I have liked you since the first day you came into my store\" Ashley was shocked, apparently all the attention she was getting, and her story about one of her bi-sexual life had out it's toll on her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Katie, I don't know what to say\" Ashley said looking at her. Being with her over the past few days, when she came over to have dinner to now, in this park. There was an older couple walking past with a cot, the mother was cradling her twin filled belly as the walked past the park. Ashley reached into her purse and grabbed her amulet, rubbing it slowly. \" Katie, I can't believe you, such a hot 20 something woman pregnant with-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"5 babies, would be interested in me?\" Her lust was growing. Katie breathed out as her belly gained another two foetuses. They went in for a hug, embracing each other. Tilting heir heads, they could feel each other breathe on their skin. Ashley's big luscious lips made contact with Katie's slightly smaller ruby red lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah waddled to the front door. As she walked in she felt the strangest sensation in her belly, it was like a washing machine in there! It wasn't painful, but  her belly was vibrating. Sure kicks would be normal whilst pregnant but no pregnant woman vibrates. Something was going on inside her belly, the energy that Antonio put into her was acting strange. Calling 911 she asked for an ambulance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 minutes a gorgeous paramedic came to help her out the door and to the vehicle. Sarah started breathing heavily as they raced to the hospital. \"It's going to be okay\" the paramedic said as he placed his hand on Sarah's belly.  Instantaneously the vibrating calmed down and Sarah's panicking stopped. \"Thanks! That helped so much\" Sarah said looking at the rugged man. \"I'm Sarah, What's your name?\" She asked looking up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Hank \" the paramedic said, shaking the pregnant woman's hand. \" I have never seen anything like this. Let's take you to the hospital to see what's going on in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was around 3 when Grant left the local pool. On the way out he grabbed a large pretzel. Munching down on the pretzel he noticed two women walking by holding their bellies and talking. \"Huh, I guess there are a few pregnant women here. But where are the normal women?\" Grant questioned himself. Taking a bite out of the delicious food he saw in the packed car park a bunch uni students, pregnant uni students... Walking down the street to his car he saw two very large pregnant women making out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was getting too weird. Shaking his wet hair he drove off stopping at a red light. A tourist guide was guiding a series of touristy expecting couples walk to the museum. A twitch was starting to form in his eye. What, was he the only single guy there? He sped down the road only to hear sirens. Pulling over he was going insane, he had to see a flat belly somewhere! Looking around he saw women pregnant in their fifties and other preggers in their early twenties. They were in all races, it looked like every woman was going to give birth until he saw 4 incredibly sex geeky girls walk into The dragons den, the local board games store. Breathing out he said \"finally-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" do you know how fast you were driving?\" The cop said outside his car. Looking around he was impacted with a large blue sphere. \"God damn it!\" He said going into full panic attack!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He made up stories about having sex with attractive young women to keep Tyler bemused but now he was asking Brandon to find him university students to fuck? That's a big leap.<br>\r\n\"C'mon, what do you say?\" Tyler said, smiling expectantly at Brandon. \"It sounds like you get enough to spare. Maybe getting some tail off of your hands will make it easier for you to hold onto your paycheck.\" Tyler winked at Brandon knowingly.<br>\r\n\"But this is an internship. You can't just give me a raise,\" Brandon said, his mind racing trying to think of a way out of things.<br>\r\n\"I can move things around so the bean counters don't notice,\" Tyler said. \"Just text me a name and a phone number sometime today.\" His boss stood up and straightened out his shirt and pants, which were tucked into his pants sloppily. \"If you can, that is. I hate men who are greedy with sluts, but I hate empty boasts even more.\"<br>\r\n\"N-no worries!\" Brandon said, backing toward the door. \"Next time I'm inside one of the girls, I'll try to remember to get her name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon closed the door behind him, cutting off Tyler's laughter. Brandon felt like he needed a shower. How the hell was he going to find a sexy woman who'd be willing to have sex with his boss? As Brandon got his things off of his desk and made his way to the exit, he was flanked by a big belly. Looking up, he saw the belly's owner: Clara, Tyler's wife, who was giving him an intrigued smile.<br>\r\n\"Hello...Brandon, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, hi,\" Brandon gulped. She wasn't anywhere near as big as Erin, Katie, Sarah, Ashley, or really any of the pregnant women now in Brandon's life, but she was still superbly gorgeous. And he'd had sex with her pregnant daughter less than an hour ago. \"How are you?\"<br>\r\nClara chuckled and wrapped an arm around Brandon's shoulders as soon as they left the building. \"Let's not be cute. I know you had sex with Kristina and I already downloaded the security footage from the elevator.\"<br>\r\nBrandon felt sweat pour down the back of his neck. \"M-m-ma'am, I can explain. She-\"<br>\r\n\"She is like me: pregnant, horny, and exhausted,\" Clara said. \"That's why you're going to pleasure me every night until I can find someone better than you. Or I'll show my husband the video.\" She chuckled. \"I wonder what he'll be more upset by: that you fucked his pregnant daughter or that you're so much worse at sex in real life than you are in your little stories.\"<br>\r\nBrandon gulped. \"S-so, should we go to your house?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm a little older, dear,\" Clara said, resting her hand on Brandon's chest while her belly pressed against him. \"I need some romance too. So you're going to take me out to a nice mid-afternoon lunch, then we're going to fuck. Now, you have a car?\"<br>\r\n\"Y-yes,\" Brandon blushed brightly.<br>\r\n\"Perfect. I know a discrete place,\" Clara said. \"And don't worry. I've only got a few weeks of this left.\" She rubbed her belly slowly and sensually. \"After that, I can go back to my usual young friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the hospital, Sarah laid back on the examination table while her doctor ran the ultrasound wand over her belly a 3rd time. \"Very strange,\" he repeated.<br>\r\nSarah sighed. \"Look, can you just tell me what you're seeing? I can handle it.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, it looks like all five of your fetuses formed in the past few minutes and are still reforming,\" the doctor said. \"And there's some strange fluid inside your uterus that it appears to be forming from.\"<br>\r\n\"Let me take a look,\" Sarah said, grunting as she tried to reach over her belly for the ultrasound controls. The doctor pulled them away from her cautiously, which only made Sarah roll her eyes. \"Trust me, I know more about how this machine works than you ever will. Gimmie.\"<br>\r\nThe doctor let Sarah use the ultrasound, shaking his head as he left the room. \"A patient with quintuplets calls an ambulance and when I show up, she shoos me away. What a day.\"<br>\r\nSarah struggled to move the machine over, her belly weighing her down in this position. It was huge and round and now that it was no longer a source of pure energy, Sarah didn't have the strength to maneuver it easily. Looking at the display, Sarah moved the wand around while measuring herself with her own homemade pregnancy devices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was right about one thing: it looks like my fetuses were transformed into something and they're gradually reforming. That laser probably did this,\" Sarah said, shuddering as she remembered the orgasm the laser made her feel. \"But, looks like whatever it did was temporary. What was the point of it, then?\"<br>\r\nAs Sarah scanned with her own \"pregnant energy\" scanner, she analyzed the material her fetuses transformed into. \"Wait a minute...this is like the energy I found coming from my amulet...the same energy I used to make all those women pregnant with my ray gun but it's off the scales.\" Sarah hit a few more buttons, further dissecting the readings. \"If one pregnant woman had her baby transformed in the womb, she could power a city with this level of energy. Imagine if Mom...\"<br>\r\nSarah trailed off, her envy boiling back up. \"Mom...well if I can figure out how the tap into the energy potential in here, I'll be able to do things she could never dream of.\" Sarah looked at her machines, smiling wickedly. \"And if I wanted, I could use these to become as big as her and generate even more energy...and stay pregnant forever.\"<br>\r\nNow Sarah had a conundrum. The only way for her to generate this power was to continue to be pregnant permanently. \"Well, I was starting to like this look anyway,\" Sarah said, heaving herself off of the examination table. \"And I'll always have Brandon around to give me belly massages when I get uncomfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Sarah began to blush. Was she really thinking about Brandon so familiarly now? Was it because she learned they weren't blood siblings or were those feelings always there? Or did they start when he was the only one nice to her when she got pregnant, even when she was mean to him? Sarah waddled out of the hospital, pushing past her doctor.<br>\r\n\"Hey, we're not done testing you!\" the doctor called out.<br>\r\n\"I'm fine,\" Sarah said. \"I've got insurance and I'm free to go if I want to!\" Sarah grit her teeth angrily, looking around the hospital. <i>They're all morons when it comes to pregnancy but they get all the funding. If I got the attention and the research money that they did, I could do even more amazing things! Why do they have to get all the good things...</i> Sarah texted Brandon to pick her up as she left, her excited amulet stealing some pregnancies from nearby patients, storing them inside its gems for later use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-it's been a while,\" Ashley said, taking a few slow steps away from the bench, fingers to her lips. \"I know I need someone else in my life, but I didn't think it would be another woman, let alone another pregnant woman.\"<br>\r\n\"You deserve it,\" Katie cooed, pressing her belly against Ashley's back, reaching her hands around Ashley's nine-fetus belly, rubbing the sides slowly. Gradually, Katie moved her hands down the wide slope, inside Ashley's loose jeans, letting her hands trace the lace underwear it found. \"We both want it, don't we?\"<br>\r\nAshley nearly cried out, moaning and biting her lip. \"I-I do. I feel like I'm going to explode.\"<br>\r\n\"You look like it too,\" Katie giggled, wondering if she should make Ashley's belly any bigger. \"But there's a cop right over there. A pregnant cop too, but a cop none-the-less. We should go somewhere...more private.\"<br>\r\nAshley nodded, the lust from her amulet welling up inside her. \"My place,\" she squeaked out.<br>\r\n\"Are you sure that's a good idea?\" Katie asked, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\nAshley nodded. \"He cheated on me, so I'll get back at him by going one step further.\" Ashley turned around, holding onto Katie's now very-moist hands and holding them against her huge belly. \"I'll have sex with another person in our own bed.\"<br>\r\nKatie felt her cheeks flush. \"Then...we're really doing this?\"<br>\r\n\"I've never had sex while pregnant,\" Ashley said, running her hands over her towering womb, \"but the night I spent with Brandon's mother...she was actually pregnant with him at the time.\" She moved her hand to Katie's own impressive belly. \"It was amazing.\"<br>\r\n\"I'll bet,\" Katie smiled, waddling back to her car with Ashley, wondering if she needed one more compliment to seal the deal. \"B-but Ashley...I'd want to spend the night with you even if you weren't pregnant.\"<br>\r\nAshley bend down - which took a few long seconds - to kiss Katie on the cheek. \"Be grateful I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the street, the pregnant Officer McCulley drove back to the station, her bladder killing her. Unfortunately for her, after she finished off a thermos of coffee, Catalina Corazon walked by her parked squad car. Antonio's fiddling with Catalina's amulet made it a highly volatile piece of mystical equipment and pregnancies were being shuffled around wildly. No one noticed as reality was scrambled along with it. But Catalina's belly was holding steady at a full-term-with-twins size, sticking out of her like a cinnamon watermelon, as she huffed and puffed, hands on her wide hips.<br>\r\n\"He creates this fantastic invention and he expects me to sell mall stores? I'm Catalina Corazon! I should be the face of this whole pregnancy technology enterprise he's creating!\" Catalina complained. \"Look at me: I'm walking down the street, pregnant belly and tits spilling out of my tanktop and hardly anyone is taking pictures! I should be reaching a much higher level of fame.\"<br>\r\nIt went against everything she knew about Antonio, but Catalina made up her mind then. \"I need to find another business venture in down...one that can even out-do Antonio. I will become the star I know I can be.\" Catalina bumped into another pregnant woman on the sidewalk, her amulet absorbing her pregnancy, giving her a huge triplet belly. \"The star that I know I am!\"</span></div></div>",

I'm sure you've never been.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Brandon said, shaking his head as he pulled toward the massive parking lot around the Smallton mall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I wouldn't think so. It's a high-class establishment. VIPs and all that,\" Clara chuckled, leaning over to Brandon as he parked. \"You're just...well, you. A very plain young man.\" She moved her hand to his bangs and ran her hands through his matted black hair. \"But, you're willing to have sex with pregnant women, so you'll do just fine for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you know, I think you can find other people in town who'll have sex with pregnant women,\" Brandon said, flustered. \"I m-mean, you're so good looking, it should be easy for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're trying to be cute to get out of this,\" Clara chuckled, stroking his cheek. \"But no. I've got too much of a leg-up on you with that video. You'll be willing to do <u>anything</u> and I like that.\" She moved his hand to her belly. \"But tell me again about how I'm good looking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon looked away, his whole face bright red. \"Your big belly is really sexy. And you...well, it's clear why Tyler married you. He likes busty, sexy women and you haven't lost any of that with age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you didn't have to say all of that. It's not getting you out of this,\" Clara said, leaning closer, belly pressed against Brandon's erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-just being honest,\" Brandon said, as Clara moved her hand around his chin and gave him a soft kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for some tongue next?\" she grinned as her phone buzzed. Clara groaned and reached into her purse, seeing a call from Kristina. \"Ugh, hold on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you're trying to do, Mom,\" Kristina hissed on the other end. \"And it's a little desperate, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Desperate times call for desperate measures,\" Clara said, looking Brandon over. \"Very, very desperate measures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I thought you should know that I've parked your Mercedes in a fire lane. If you get over here in, oh, 15 minutes, you can probably avoid getting it towed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You little-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And take a taxi. Daddy's here too and if he sees you with Brandon, well...anyway, see you soon.\" Kristina clicked off her cellphone, leaving Clara to scream from behind clenched teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you get today off, dear,\" Clara said, patting Brandon on the cheek as she packed up her purse. \"But tomorrow, I'll get my tongue.\" She kissed Brandon the ear before whispering. \"And I don't just mean a french kiss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon let Clara out to call a taxi as he sped off, his own phone buzzing with a text from Sarah<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for picking me up,\" Sarah said, still wiping ultrasound gel off of her belly. She was pretty huge, so there was a lot of surface area for her to cover. \"I'm surprised you got here so quick. I thought your internship was like 30 miles from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was, um, stopping by an electronics store,\" Brandon lied. \"I needed some new earbuds. Mine died.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should have told me about it,\" Sarah said. \"I could fix them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd do that for me?\" Brandon said, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah blushed, looking down at her bare belly. \"Y-yeah, of course.\" Brandon was trying not to eye her belly, knowing if he did, he wouldn't be able to put his eyes back on the road again for quite some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn uncomfortable silence whistled through the car. \"S-so, how are your inventions coming?\" Brandon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Sarah said happily, slowly sitting up as she rolled her shirt down as far as it could go. \"I'm meeting with a guy named Dr. Schultz tomorrow and hopefully he'll be interested enough to invest. I've got quite a few neat things planned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" Brandon smiled, looking over at his sister. He'd like her old hair, but her new brown locks and a look of confidence made Brandon's heart twinge. He had to keep reminding himself \"She's your sister. You're blood relatives. This is crazy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what I really need is someone with great business skills to help make this steadier,\" Sarah said. \"I think I can build a whole industry around what I'm working on.\" Sarah paused, running her hands over her belly. \"Hey, you said you had a dream a few nights ago and you said there was a business name in that...PregTech?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon's foot slammed on the gas and he scrambled to get the car back to its regular course and speed. That was the most vivid dream he'd ever had, filled with huge, friendly pregnant women everywhere. \"Y-yeah, I think so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not a bad name,\" Sarah said quietly. \"And besides a business expert, I'll need a face for PregTech. Someone to really sell it. Like a celebrity or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, I'm sure it'll work out great for you,\" Brandon smiled. \"You were always so smart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Sarah said quietly, feeling her cheeks get slightly red. \"Hey, let's swing by the mall. I need to walk around some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back to the mall,\" Brandon sighed, moving over into another lane to take the right exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well excuse me!\" Sarah pouted, crossing her arms and resting them between her belly and breasts. \"And what do you mean 'back' to the mall?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" Brandon gulped, heart pounding. \"Nothing at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce at the mall, the two Page siblings walked around the perimeter, where there were impressive fountains, dozens of little shops and restaurants, and other things to draw attention. As they walked, Sarah grabbed Brandon's arm when she saw a familiar face. \"Oh my God, it's her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\" Brandon said, straightening up as Sarah's belly and breasts pressed against his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That woman...Dad's having an affair with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!\" Brandon blurted out, covering his mouth as people turned their heads to the commotion. Luckily, Kim hadn't noticed and she was still looking at the mall's huge directory for clothing and jewelry stores she hadn't been to yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I was in the car with them and overheard. I don't think Dad knows I know,\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor Mom,\" Brandon sighed, which only inflamed Sarah's envy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well, maybe being a gigantic pregnant whale doesn't turn guys on,\" Sarah blushed. \"Though, this woman isn't much better. She said she's basically only banging Dad for money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Brandon said, an idea forming in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I doubt she even finds Dad attractive. She'll probably have sex with anyone if they spoil her...I don't want to look at her anymore. Let's go,\" Sarah scoffed, waddling past Kim. Brandon followed, stopping when Kim bent over to check the directions, her huge ass sticking up in the air. Brandon snapped a quick picture with his phone and sent it to his boss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Good?&gt; Brandon asked. He got a response within seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;PERFECT&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me,\" Brandon said, taping Kim on the shoulder, trying to emulate the bad guys in rom-coms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim turned around and looked at Brandon. \"What.\" It wasn't even a question like she was curious. She said it to tell Brandon clearly that he was out of her league and she didn't want to continue this conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just saw you were interested in jewelry and can appreciate good things,\" Brandon schmoozed, motioning to his own amulet. The jewels and gems gleaned in the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\" Kim said, crossing her arms and looking at Brandon speculatively. \"And what, if I go out with you, you'll buy me some tacky rubies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but the man I work for can,\" Brandon said. \"He's a very wealthy man, but he's getting older and has a pregnant wife and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know the type,\" Kim giggled, which made Brandon a little angry. \"Having his little scrubby valet find him girls is kinda weird, but okay. Where is he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just give me your number and-\" Brandon stopped, seeing Kim's obvious skeptical look. \"How about I give you his number and you can both work something out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you're talking,\" Kim said, getting out her phone as Brandon gave her Tyler's number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt; hi there :) &gt; Kim sent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later. &lt;you the girl with the big ass?&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt; yep ;) &gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Let's talk. I'll send a driver&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kim and Tyler straightened things out, Sarah was dragging Brandon along. \"That was so embarrassing,\" Sarah said, face bright red. \"How could you talk to that woman?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was for work,\" Brandon protested. \"And when did you get so strong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be some residual energy,\" Sarah said, cutting Brandon off before he could inquire further. \"I'll explain later...or maybe never.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Page siblings went away, Kim strutted toward the mall herself, unknowingly making a beeline for the parts of the mall Yaral was drumming up the most trouble.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The afternoon sun shone above the country club as Erin drove her golf kart to the 16th tee off. With mainly pars, an eagle and a couple of bogies, she was doing fairly well. Grabbing her iron, she bent down, trying to make sure her belly wasn't getting in the way of her swing, she looked past the sand patch, over to the green. Her breathing slowed down and she concentrated as hard as she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHACK!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white ball flew high into the air, it soared through the sky, past the sand bar, narrowly missing the trees and landing straight on the green, she could see the ball roll closer and closer to the flag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlop!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A hole in one!\" Erin screamed jumping up and down for joy. A crowd had formed and applauded at her fantastic strike. Driving over she asked someone to pick up her ball. There was no way she was able to reach down and grab it. Making her way over to number 17 Douglas and his buddies were just finishing their  game. \" hey, Douglas, isn't that your daughter with the crowd? \" said of Douglas's polo buddies asked him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDouglas looked over to see Erin going up to the next tee off. \" oh god\" Douglas said. \" come on,first the games keeper, now this? Jeff, Sam, let's go.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" no no no\" Jeff said, \" let's see if your pregnant daughter beats your ass\" the group laughed  and Douglas annoyingly chucked as they drove over to Erin and her crowd. Brody was Erin's own cheering squad waving a toy around like a flag. Erin had managed to borrow several different clubs, irons and putters from various people. Going up to the ball, a large sound similar to a something from a horror movie came from her belly. Brody knew his sister too well and in a flash was running to the buffet table half a kilometre away.\" ooooohhhhh, does anyone have food? I'm starving...\" She winced as she felt a kick in her belly. She hadn't eaten since they barred her from the buffet. An old woman came over to the pregnant sports lady and gave her a packet of pretzels. She downed all of it, but it did very little. \" damn it, why did they bar me?\" She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople heard what she had mentioned. \" they let a pregnant woman starve?\" Someone near the front said. \" dear god, what's wrong with the head of this club?\"  As everyone started talking, the same man who barred her before was starting to sweat. If he wouldn't do something now, he surely would be fired. Walking over to the hugely pregnant woman he said with great concern \" oh god, hello Erin, it's me, Ron, from the buffet. I just wanted to apologise for everything I did. I didn't know you were going to go all this way to get food.\" Erin almost started swearing at him till she saw someone coming over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a trail of smoke Brody came back with two baskets with a variety of foods. \" \" Erin, I could tell you, you, you were hungry. So I ran and I ran to the buff, buff, the food place! I got you Icecream, and ham and muffins and shrimp and and pickles, and some cheese, and an orange and a bananana and some chicken legs!\" Brody said between puffs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Brody\" Erin said thankfully as she was handed the first basket. In front of everyone Erin started eating the food. By the end of the second basket she wasn't feeling hungry anymore and resumed playing. \" for the wait, this better be good\" one of the more impatient members said as she grabbed the club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh god, this is it, she is going to kick my ass in the scores, the guys will have a field day\" Douglas thought to himself as she was about to take her swing. \" hi honey!\" Douglas called to his daughter. In mid swing Ashley was thrown off her game. Swinging the club the ball went flying, her last second interference was setting it's trajectory off course. The people gasped as it flew over water but were upset when the ball made a crash landing in the sand dune near the green. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daadddd\" Erin called as she waddled over to her father. \" do you know how much that is going to cost me?\" Douglas looked around the rich unpleasant mob. Thinking on his toes he said \"Oh honey, I'm sorry. I was just trying to support you, that's all\". The annoyed faces suddenly changed and let out a collective \"aawwww\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" well, father, your oh so great timing just cost me a good shot.\" Erin answered waddling over to the golf kart. Her belly was barely touching the steering wheel as she drove to the sand pit. Getting out of the vehicle she grabbed her borrowed open club sand wedge. As she lined herself to the ball she saw a film crew set up. \" oh geez, I better get this finished before I have any more distractions. The crowd around the green watched eagerly as she brought her golf club back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHACK! Ppffffff<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hit the ball and it went soaring over 5 inches and landed on another part of the sand pit. She was getting furious now as sweat started forming on her brow from the afternoon sun. She went to the ball, lined up aaand...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPpff WHACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second time was much better, it made it onto the green with mild applause. With two putts she just got par and her score as unchanged. Brody ran over, gave Erin her ball, a great big hug, and then everyone went to the last play. The report had started doing her news segment. \" hi, I'm Sasha Brown here to talk about an amazing woman. 25 and already pregnant with quadruplets Erin Turner has shown the high class community that even whilst pregnant you can still swing the shots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking her way to number 18 Erin was feeling confident, the app made by the country club said she was coming third, but if she aimed and hit correctly, she could come first! Making it over to the 18th tee, she was ready to win. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBending over the audience was either viewing a fantastic sight of her derri\u00e8re, or her generous cleavage. Slowing her heart rate right down she breathed in heavily, looking down at her golf ball she could see how dirty it become. A smidgen of dirt on one side, a blade of grass peeled off the ball and dropped to the ground.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat golf ball wasn't perfect, like her. Sure she wasn't the worse child out there but she was much better then the other country club kids, getting high, doing cocaine and crystal meth. But she had to try harder than everyone else because she was pregnant. Time slowed down as everyone waited eagerly to see her swing. She brought her club back, looked at exactly where she wanted to hit it aaaannddd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nnothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dropped her club. People started to question what she was doing. \" dad, can you come here?\" She said, a concerned look on her face. Douglas walked over to her daughter. \" what's wrong? Are you in labor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a look of upset and frustration on her head she shook her head. \" why do I have to do this?\" She whispered, starting to get upset. \" why do I have to play to their rules, I shouldn't have to fight for my food, I'm eight and a half months pregnant with quadruplets, why can't I feed my future children?\" Erin started crying. Douglas looked at his daughter with pity, remorse and a tempered fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" look, honey, I am sorry, I had no idea. Leave it to me, daddy's going to fix what the stupid troglodytes did here today. Just enjoy playing the rest of the game. I am sorry I can't watch your final shot, I need to take care of your mother, she called me saying something was wrong.\" Erin hugged her father as a couple of tears rolled down her face. \" just be strong for daddy, remember we will always love you\" Douglas said as they finished hugging. Douglas walked over to his kart and drove to the country club, a look of complete rage on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where's Clara?\" Louisa said, sipping her virgin grasshopper. Little did she know that Clara was just trying to get into her daughter's boyfriend's pants a while ago. \" she told me she was at work, I'm sure it was something about making sure her husbands business is making money\" said Joyce taking a bite from her desert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" are you sure? I know Tyler is making a lot of money, especially with that business he has made on constructing something on the mountain line on the southwest side of town.\" Debra brought up, pointing over to the mountains on the horizon. \" I also hear he has been cheating on Clara with three different women!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" don't be daft\" Belinda chimed in. Belinda was one of the more creative people in the book club. Her entire family were fantastic at playing classical music. Crossing her long slightly tanned legs and running her fingers through her long flowing black hair she turned to Barbara. \"What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara laughed a little. \" you know how Tyler is around pregnant women, he's worse than the guy who runs this place. With so many pregnant women in town, how can he find someone to have sex with, trust me, I know his type!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" what's that supposed to mean?\" Louisa questioned her busty tanned friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" well, let's just say this baby isn't Ron's\" Barbara said with a wink. The entire group fell silent. For a good minute no one was gossiping. Douglas came up the stairs and reclaiming his gentleman type physique he walked over to his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving her a kiss Douglas asked her \" honey, have seen Duncan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh, yeah I'm sure he is getting ready for the award ceremony, try his office\" Louisa said, taking a bite from a celery stick. Thanking his wife, Douglas headed upstairs to Duncan's office.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Duncan stood there, adjusting his hair piece and reciting his speech in his large office. Photos hung off the wall from when he met world leaders, celebrities and wildlife he has killed. A modified sniper rifle was mounted behind his desk and surrounding it were the heads 4 of the most deadly and endangered game he has killed. Along the windowsill was his medals for polo, rowing and sailing. A glass cabin are held all his trophies and at the door was an angry Douglas, almost hungry for blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" ah Douglas, my good man, what's wrong?\" Duncan said a concerned look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I'll tell you what's the matter you egotistical prick, I just found out my daughter, has had to run through rings in her pregnant body, in order to feed herself.\" Douglas angrily yelled, his rage rising. \"Now as one of this country clubs biggest endorsers, whom has had to put in a great deal of money into making this one of the best country clubs in America, I want to know why your people are putting my daughter through hell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Firstly Douglas, I want to say I am very sorry that this has happened to you and your daughter, however there is a reason why this has happened, come look at the hall of families.\" Duncan said as they left his office. Walking down the hall they saw photos of families doing a large variety of high class activities. \" look at these families Douglas. As you can see they are all well known for what they do. The Lovecraft's are the best sailers, in this photo you can see the Roberts in their rendition of Macbeth and over here are the Woods in, what would say isn't the most flattering picture, their synchronised swimming clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDouglas looked around and he noticed a couple of things \" quick question Duncan. Where is Ron's family and why aren't there any photos of the country club here?\" He questioned, looking at all the pretentious families in their ridiculous activities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" good question. See every family here has a life pass to the country club once they achieve a status in something that is worthy of being recognised by our committee here. Us being good friends i wanted to make sure that your family would receive a life time pass, but sadly there was nothing to be considered recognisable. So, I had to make incentive for your daughter to start playing golf with you. It would appear your daughter is exceptional at golf, if you two were to team up, I could count that as a family activity and finally have you amongst the hall of families.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" okay, fair enough, but what about Ron?\" Douglas asked his angry cooling. \" he is your second in command\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" well my friend, the answer to that is simple, he doesn't have a family yet!\" Duncan said chuckling. They walked over to the window to see Erin on the green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin was sweating, she had made it past the sand dunes, the ponds and their snapping turtles, it was now her time to win the game. It looked like an impossible shot. She was on the edge of the green and the hole was toward the other side. Looking at the ground she could see a slope on the left side to her. Breathing in she aimed and as she tapped it with the slightest bit of effort the ball rolled towards the slope, made it down the slope with some extra speed, got closer and closer to the hole until.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlop!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ball went in giving her the low enough score to win the game! The audience roared with a thunderous applause, Erin jumped for joy knowing she had won. The book club came down to celebrate with Erin and the crowd after winning the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the afternoon was filled with post game celebrations. Duncan got up on the stage with a series of trophies and medals. He and his wife started congratulating everyone in their age group whom had the best score, then it came down to his final two trophies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" Well ladies and gentlemen, it would appear we are down to our final 2, but they both go to the highest scoring person today, so don't worry Charles, you will be able to go back to the bar quicker\" the audience laughed at Duncan's comments. \" The trophy for best score in the 21-40 age group and the best score in all of today goes to, ERIN TURNER!\" Erin excitingly waddled up on stage. Accepting the two trophies, she also received a golf bag and some green plastic thing. \" we are changing from tickets to a more electronic format. This is your first part of the emerald card, gain the last 3 and you will be welcome to anything in our club, from the spare bed rooms, if you wish to have a party here, you will be welcome to free unlimited food, room service and  use of our spa. LETS HEAR IT FOR ERIN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd applauded as the day drawed to a close. The family headed to the car, Brody was dirty holding on of the trophies, singing \"trophy trophy trophy!\" Erin was tired and thankful as the waiters that barred her earlier were now carrying her winnings. Joyce and Louisa were joking about as they walked to the Valet, when Joyce whispered something in Louisa's ear, \" no way!\" Louisa said, \" you guys go first, I'll join you, Douglas? Honey! I'm staying the night, just make sure Brody gets tucked in and let Erin do anything she wants, especially with her quads on the way she deserves this win!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTipping the valet Douglas, Erin and Brody got in the car and drove off. The only thing on Erin's mind was how was she going to get to Brandon's place down the street? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The taxi pulled up just outside the Page's place. Katie and Ashley quickly struggled to get out of the car. Ashley paying for the can as fast as possible. Waddling to the front door Kate gave Ashley a massive slap on the butt. Ashley responded by tackling her onto her front lawn, passionately making out with her doing so. \" whoa whoa whoa\" Katie said stopping in the middle of masking out. \" let's get inside first. The taxi man confused with what he just saw tried his best to drive away casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley helped push Katie up off the ground and once she was up helped pull Ashley to her feet. Ashley just fit through the door, Katie on the other hand had no problem walking in. Moving through the living room they started stripping each other's clothes off whilst engaging their lips and tongues. They had both put their amulets around their necks now, the lust energy was combining with the envy energy. They were hungry for each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly they climbed the stairs. Sadly this was always one of the problems of being pregnant. After a few minutes of creaking they reached the top and were back in their lustrous ways again. Unfortunately one of Sarah's over stretched bras was out in the open, catching Katie by surprise, falling onto her back Ashley collided with her their amulets impacting on each other and smashing the fragile gem on Katie's amulet. The amulets started to shine a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING PING PING PING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I can't believe you are tied with me on baby count\" Ashley said looking at her with awe. Katie looked at her gargantuan frame now. She could forget being called petite, the only things she could say that were that size were her arms.  Katie had gained another five whilst Ashley grew by one. Slowly they made it to the bedroom and to Ashley's bed.\" Um Ashley\" Katie said, starting to sweat \" this is like a first time for me, with uh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" shush now\" Ashley said putting a finger in her lovers lips. \" trust me, with me, this is the first time doing it right!\"  Gazing into her eyes she locked lips with Katie then pushed her onto the bed which made a load groan. \" maybe I should be the only one on here\" Katie said, giggling and presenting her sexy naked body to Katie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" okay but it will cost you\" she said, massaging Katie's thick juicy thighs. Looking at her wet vagina Ashley put her face closer to it, feeling the heat from her lover. Then she plunged her tongue in. Licking the clitorus Katie was astounded. She was in a whole new world, a place she had never been. Biting her lip she moaned in pleasure, Ashley was good at this, she had a lot of experience. Whilst she sent waves of pleasure into her new lover she massaged the belly she was resting on. The magic of the amulet was intensifying, that shine turning into a glow, she screamed out in orgasm. Ashley almost choked as she came into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoughing a bit she saw Katie lye on her back, then moving around the bed she lowered herself into Katie's face. The bed creaked again heavily, it was on it's final stretch. Just as she weren't to start tonguing her the bed broke. As the bed fell to the ground Ashley fell on top of Katie. \" oh god!\" She said climbing off of Katie who was in complete nirvana. Her amulet was glowing intensely for some reason. So was hers. Beams came from their amulets sending pure waves of pleasure through the both of them.\" Oh fuck, oh fuck, fuck, oh god!\" Was all that Ashley said as she could feel something happening. Katie screamed out in pleasure, orgasming time and time again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After the magic and the other kind of magic stopped, Ashley got up. She wasn't pregnant this morning, now she had 10 foetuses and no way of getting rid of any of them. She walked over to Katie, who was laying on her side. She went to see if Katie was okay but her belly made contact with hers first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZapp!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like a lightning bolt of pleasure struck the both of them. The magic inside their bellies was acting like a massive pleasure zone for them. \" holy fuck, oh god! Oh fuck YES! More, more MORE!\" She screamed. this startled Ashley, waking her. Getting onto her all fours, she rolled over to Katie. They started to lock lips again, they weren't finished yet. Getting wet again, Ashley groped her equally huge sexual partner. Katie cooed, she was in complete heaven. She sucked on Ashley's large aureolas. Ashley struggle but eventually got up, rolled Katie onto her belly, then positioned herself in the opposite manner on the bed. Rearranging their legs in a scissor format they started grinding against each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nzap! Zapp! Zapp!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir bellies were making contact as their clits rubbed against each other. Ashley started to scream. This was getting too much for her. Kati<div align=\"right\"></div>e was on edge, she came time and time again, she felt like she was being coated in pleasure, after 5 minutes of intense fucking they blacked out, their leg spasms happening randomly.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brandon's neck was beginning to get sore from craning so much. Everywhere he turned, there were pregnant women for him to gaze at. Malls were always magnets for spotting big bellies. They were big places where lots of families gathered, which meant there were statistically good chances tp see mothers-to-be waddling up and down the corridors. But the Smallton Mall had been even more of a congregating spot for expectant women, thanks to its large maternity clothing store, its pregnant yoga classes, and the other events and specials it offered pregnant women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was never like this. Quite nearly every woman Brandon saw was pregnant and it was rare to see anyone with a belly smaller than \"full term with twins.\" Brandon had an excellent belly right beside him with Sarah's large brood, and even before she was pregnant, Sarah was always gorgeous. And while no one Brandon saw at the mall had a belly as superb as hers yet, it was much easier on Brandon's mind to see pregnant women who weren't his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a little...crowded here,\" Brandon said, trying to sound nonchalant as he attempted to squeeze past two very fertile and, by the looks of them, overdue women, laughing and chatting without care for their size. Sarah snorted a little laugh and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, whenever Mom would drag me here for pregnant yoga or maternity clothing shopping, I always felt like I stuck out like a sore, swollen thumb. Now I blend in a little more,\" Sarah said, looking down at her huge belly and blushing, running one hand over her womb. \"I guess I still stand out by a lot.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was beginning to have mixed feelings about her pregnant and belly size. For one thing, she now knew that she wasn't <i>really</i> pregnant. Somehow, this amulet of hers contained a mysterious \"pregnancy\" energy that had given her the amazing bump she was sporting. Or maybe she was already pregnant and the amulet just exacerbated things. She couldn't quite remember. Sarah's memory was foggy if she went back too far, thanks to the \"reality shifting\" powers the amulet had. But Sarah also knew she could control this energy, thanks to her inventions, and could make her belly bigger, smaller, or possibly nonexistent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet...while for nine months she'd hated being pregnant and carrying around such a large, uncomfortable load, she now couldn't imagine making her belly any smaller. She even had the occasional urge to get even bigger. Every time she thought about how big Ashley's belly was, Sarah burned with envy and wanted to match her mother's size, if not bigger. Also, she long suspected that Brandon liked big pregnant bellies and she felt like that was something she should keep around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out of my way,\" a woman growled, pushing some other pregnant patrons out of the way. Brandon and Sarah turned to see Janice, moving through the mall, her gigantic belly pushing the crowd away easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, she's as big as you,\" Brandon said, immediately biting his tongue. \"I-I mean...uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're right. I'm surprised too,\" Sarah said slowly. \"She looks a little familiar too. Brandon, I'm going to visit with her for a bit. You go do...whatever it is you do.\" Brandon gulped in protest, but to no avail. Sarah was already waddling over to Janice. \"Hi there...Janice, right? You taught pregnant yoga here at the mall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still teach it. They haven't fired me yet,\" Janice sneered at Sarah. \"You...you're always with Ashley. Her daughter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's me,\" Sarah beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like her,\" Janice said, panting as she moved her hands under her belly for support. \"Your hair isn't as natural a shade of brown as hers, though. And your eyes don't have her gleam. And your belly isn't as-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, I get it,\" Sarah said, cheeks burning as she felt another wave of jealousy. \"When I went to yoga, you weren't this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big?\" Janice scoffed, slowly lowering herself onto one of the mall's benches. Sarah took her arm to help the furious woman sit down. \"I feel twice as many kicks inside me now. I've got sextuplets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you not always?\" Sarah said, worrying her new pregnancy inventions might have accidentally affected Janice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I was pregnant with triplets until he did this to me,\" Janice said, patting her belly, then groaning when a new wave of kicks came in response. \"I mean, he already did this to me when he got me pregnant, but then he put his hand on my belly and boom! Six babies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joel. It doesn't matter who,\" Janice said. \"I've given up any chance of him stepping up to raise his children anyhow.\" Janice leaned back and rubbed big, slow circles on the front of her belly. \"But Jesus, I can't do my job now with all this extra weight. I was just getting used to carrying triplets full term. Now these?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might have a solution,\" Sarah said, standing up and reaching under her shirt. Detaching her spinal support, Sarah groaned as she bent to put it on Janice's back. Without the support, the full weight of Sarah's pregnancy was now being felt. The energy she had from Antonio's \"experiment\" had long since worn off. \"Try this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice stood up, surprised at how easy it was. \"This is...this is amazing!\" Janice grinned, throwing a few quick punches in the air, followed by a flurry of kicks. \"I feel like all the pregnancy weight is gone! I can move just like before!\" Janice turned to Sarah, who was now as tired and uncomfortable on the bench as Janice had been. \"Where did you get this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made it,\" Sarah smiled, rubbing her belly the same way Janice had been. \"I'm an inventor and I've been working on a number of inventions for pregnant women...some more impressive than others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\" Janice said. \"Well if you have any more, I could sell them easily at my yoga classes.\" Janice rubbed her belly in thought as she walked around. \"Actually...if you really have more inventions, I might have an even better proposition. A woman...well, she looked more like a girl to me, wanted to partner with me to create a pregnancy product empire. And she seemed to have pretty savvy business experience too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That might be just the thing I need,\" Sarah said. \"I've been toying around with a business idea. How does 'PregTech' sound to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds promising,\" Janice smiled, calling Katie up on her phone. Janice stood there as the phone buzzed and buzzed. \"Urgh, why is she not picking up?\" Janice yelled, her wrathful anger coming back. \"What could be so important that she's not answering her cellphone?\" If only Sarah knew the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the rest of the mall, Joel, controlled by Yaral, continued to prowl around, breathing in the chaotic energy his pregnancy magic was creating. Throwing wrenches into people's lives were the sustaining force in Yaral's life and nothing was a bigger depth charge in someone's life than a sudden pregnancy. While he drew on the chaos created by the amulets, to stay in Joel's body until he had his \"meeting\" with Brandon later that day, he'd need to drum up a lot of chaos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so he had. Nearly every woman in the mall that was currently pregnant was made that way thanks to Yaral in Joel's body. All he had to do was touch them and PING! A big belly sprouted out of them. And for women who were already pregnant, he added on to their brood. Still, now that he was at the mall in a corporeal form, Yaral was annoyed that there was one person missing at the mall. Antonio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYaral had existed for thousands of years and drummed up chaos and pregnant turmoil without a care in the world. But along the way, a few mortals managed to get in his way. Jack Dale Jr. Diana Larsen. Nicole Zavaleta. And perhaps his most irritating: Antonio Greene. He was the one who had the audacity to use Yaral's creations for personal, monetary gain. And no one gets to gain from Yaral's magic but Yaral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yaral clomped around, not used to using a human body for a long time, he bumped into a woman in a tight, purple dress: Kim. \"Hey, watch where you're going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYaral paid no attention as he kept walking, but was bemused when Kim grabbed Joel's shoulder and turned him around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I don't know who you are or who you think you are and I don't care. When I look at you, I see a lanky loser with no class, no taste, no skill, and no love life. You think because I'm a hot piece of ass, I'm just some tramp you can run into and brush off? Well I've got news for you: I'm more than just a hot piece of ass. I'm the hottest fucking bitch you'll ever see and you'd better have a good mental memory because this is the closest you'll ever get to me. I'm rich, I'm sexy, and I'm out of your league. Are you still gawking at me? You've got beady, dead little eyes and you're disgusting. I'm stuck between wanting you to leave so I never have to see you again and telling you off more, because you are such a fucking loser that it's fun to find new things to cut you apart with. I just wish one of my sugar daddies was here so he could punch you right in your dumb face too. And FYI, even if by some miracle you're loaded, I'd never sleep with you. I wouldn't even give you a sarcastic kiss on your scruffy cheeks. Are you still staring at me? Don't you have a life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYaral held his temple, unable to understand why this insignificant woman was still pestering him. Luckily, he had a way to get chaotic energy from her <u>and</u> make her go away. He took a few steps toward her and gave her a light pat on the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God! Did you just touch me? I'll call security on yoooh!\" Kim cried out, putting her hands on her dress, which was quickly getting tighter as her belly expanded more and more, ripping through the fabric. Kim staggered to get a seat as her heels started to give out as she got bigger and bigger, reaching octuplet sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYaral took a deep breath and kept walking around. \"Refreshing.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Putting his head phones on Brandon headed over to the electronics store. \" I can feel it, coming in the air tonight\" Brandon sung under his breath, looking through the series of video games. \" hmm, Density, Hola, Lord of War wait what's this one?\" He thought to himself looking at a game with a pregnant hero. Foetus Fighter! Based on the exotic eastern martial fighting sport of pregnant fighting! Picking it up he made his mind and walked over to the blu ray section. Pretending to play the drums he went to the 'collections' pile. Stacked was a series of movies based off various film series, but at the top was the Catalina pile. The now famous and very pregnant Catalina. It looked like a series of films she starred in before getting pregnant. He looked at the titles of the movies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Piranha bay 6, bikini boom showdown'<br>\r\n'Triple Gamma house! The bitches bite back!'<br>\r\n'First the worst, seconds got bust, thirds the one with the huge chest'<br>\r\n'Cum dumpsters, an anthology of erotic real life tales'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking on the side he saw the large R and warning signs of hard core sex scenes. \" oh my god\" Brandon said, dropping the DVDs. \" the hot celebrity here is a ex-porn star!\" Putting away Foetus Fighters he walked back outside to the sea of bare bellies. Women were flooding up to the Katie's maternity store, but no one was there, women were in pain and in need of food, foot rubs and clothes to cover their expansive middles. Navigating  through  the maze of globular flesh was incredible, until he placed one foot in the wrong direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLosing his balance he lost sight of Sarah, he came crashing down, BAM! He went, as his side hit the hard tiles. \" oouuch\" he cried out, but no one heard. With the amount of women talking about their pregnancies, it was ridiculous.  How could so many women get pregnant at once? Getting on his arms and knees he manuevered through. The air was thick, the heat radiating from their bellies hit Brandon like a hot water bottle. Sweating, he crawled forward, looking for freedom in this clostraphobic labyrinth of fertile delight. He accidently bumped up against an almond skinned belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sanjay, is that you? Your brothers and sisters are kicking, could you rub them to sleep?\" Said the owner of the belly. Not saying anything he rubbed the belly for the appropriate time. \" oh thanks San, here lemme give you something\" she said, patting her leg. Brandon backed away slowly, worried his cover would be blown. Off to the distance he saw something. Light! Crawling faster and faster he tripped. Like dominos nearly every woman fell, crashing to the ground one at a time. The ground shook as they groaned and struggled to get up. Brandon was free!  Or was he? Looking again it was almost heaven for him! Women were groaning and moaning, moving about trying to get up, their clothes were torn, flesh being seen through the mall to Joel! It looked like he was the only other man in the mall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not like anything else could happen. PTTSSHHHHHH, water sprayed from the ceiling, some how the fire alarm was pulled.\" Joel!\" Brandon called, yet he didn't reply, the raining water and women complaining were making too much noise. As women started to try to move around he called again and on a third time, he finally looked over. \" he's calling me\" Yaral said. \" he has an energy to him... He might be a friend of the person who truly owns this human vessel.\" Joel walked gracefully over to Brandon, past women who just couldn't get up. Brandon was using this chance to touch bellies. It was like something heavenly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" could you help me up?\" One expectant bronze headed woman asked Brandon. She was quite large with quintuplets. He tried to help her, pulling as hard as he could but ended up falling on top of her. \"OOPph\" she said as Brandon came close to her face. He rolled off the her belly instantly. \" I'm so sorry, here\" he said helping her up to her feet. \" I'm Brandon, I hope you are okay\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm alright, my names Grace\" Grace said shaking his hand smiling, \" do you know what's going on?\" She started to become distressed. \" I came in here for a new laptop when some guy bumped into me and, well is happened\" she said pointing at her huge belly\" Brandon felt bad for the poor gal, pulling out the amulet he tried to think how he could change what was going on. \" nice thing\" Grace said looking at the amulet. \"Mind if I touch it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instant Brandon placed the amulet in Grace's hands a ring of blue light came from it. Time slowed right down, only Brandon, the true amulet bearer could see what was going on around him. The blue ring moved faster outwards until it covered everyone in the mall. Shops, seats and caf\u00e9s were changing as if time was being rewritten. Disappearing, every woman there calmed down. Yarals temper grew as he looked at the chaotic magic subsiding around him, he knew what just went down. An hours work, down the drain. \" So, you came to the mall for uni supplies?\" Brandon asked, trying to set his mind off what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" are you kidding me? I have been pregnant for he past nine months, I have no time for uni\" grace laughed, readjusting her very tight outfit. &lt;ATTENTION CUSTOMERS, WE ARE SORRY FOR WHAT HAS HAPPENED. STAFF WILL BE AROUND TO HELP YOU ALL OUT&gt; Said the announcer. The pouring water stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel finally made it over to Brandon and Grace. Touching her belly another 3 occupants were added of her belly. \" what the hell?\" Grace said holding her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Joel, are you okay?\" Brandon said looking at his friend, the only other guy in the mall for some reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" yeah I am quite fine, shall we head to your night of the dungeons and dragons?\" Joel/Yaral said, Yaral looking through Joel's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" uh sure, let's go to the liquor store first\" Brandon replied ready to leave \" I mean, the girls aren't gunna drink, but you know how these nights go, we could make wizard sticks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't use magic like- oh you mean taping beverage cans together to make something in the shape of a staff. Okay, lead the way!\" Yaral said, tapping into Joel's thoughts again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" uh yeah, you might need the alcohol more than I thought\" Brandon said starting to walk to Sarah. Grace almost let him get away. Pulling him back she placed the amulet with a folder piece of dry paper in his hands. \"Call me\" she flirted, winking at him. \" again? Is there something about me?\" Brandon questioned under his breath. \" Joel wait, we need to find Sarah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n5 minutes ago<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah watched Janice perform various yoga moves in a more secluded area. She flipped her hair around and slid to the ground doing the splits. Jumping back up she was amazed. \" this is amazing!\" Janice said sitting down at the bench next to her. The robo-spine was working superbly, ever since she used in a heavily moisture area like her shower, Sarah knew she could use that spine in all kinds of areas. She just need to test it underwater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked around and saw the crowd of expectant mothers. \" Are these ladies in your class too?\" Sarah asked Janice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" well about 2 thirds are here for my night time class, the other third are here from my late after noon class, I have a few other pregnant aerobics instructors that help me\" Janice answered easily. For some reason the magic of the amulet wasn't making her wrathful for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey talked a little while longer until women everywhere started falling down. Luckily for them they remained on the bench. \" good god what happened?\" Janice questioned looking down at the sea of orb like flesh. PPPTTTSSSHHHHH the water started coming down Janice quickly handed her the robo-spine thinking it would get damaged when wet. Sarah reattached it to her spine and they decided to wait there for Brandon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon manuevered around a corner and saw Janice sitting with Sarah. Joel/Yaral remember her yelling at him last time and he decided he didn't want to deal with another annoying rant. \" I shall wait here my friend whilst you grab your attractive sibling. Then we will slay some dragons!\" Joel/Yaral told Brandon as he stood at the potted plant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon carefully tippie toed around the area until he made it to Sarah and Janice. \" hey guys, uh Sarah we have got to go, we can stop off at the bottle o on the way.\" Brandon tried to order his older sister \" I mean this area, just isn't that uuuhhh great for me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" wait a second I know you, you are Ashley's boy\" Janice said intrigued. \" I remember you from a few days ago.\"  Brandon laughed awkwardly at Janice trying not to gaze upon her beauty then prodded Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" ow, OKAY, I'm sorry here take my business card, and contact me so we can talk business tomorrow\" Sarah said stand up. Shaking Janice's hand Sarah, Brandon and Joel headed to their night of fun and games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rebecca scrolled through her phone with one hand, smiling occasionally at a funny tweet. Her other hand gradually rested on her belly, rubbing softly and feeling its firm but round shape. <i>I should go to the gym sometime soon</i> Rebecca thought to herself. <i>Feels like I'm getting out of shape</i>. Rebecca looked down at herself and moved her hand up and down her belly's slope. <i>Oh, right. I'm pregnant, not fat</i> she thought to herself, shaking her head. <i>I've been so forgetful lately</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't trust her,\" Wendy said, hands behind her back as Antonio looked over the paperwork at his desk. Rebecca looked up from her phone to the meeting she was in with Antonio and Wendy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Forgot about this too</i> Rebecca said, pausing before returning to Twitter. The \"sloth\" in her amulet was working just fine since getting it back from Antonio's latest invention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. Catalina is on our side,\" Antonio smiled. \"I've got significant leverage on her, and if Ms. Corazon wants to continue her legitimate movie career, she'll stay on my good side. I've destroyed all evidence of her seedy past, save for a few DVDs that Rebecca put in our most secure vault just today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca winced a little. <i>I <u>knew</u> there was something else I forgot about today</i>, she thought to herself. Rebecca left Catalina's only existing porn films in the mall stock room, where they ended up in the Smallton mall's own video store. Any concern over the issue went from Rebecca's mind pretty quickly, but she still made sure to text herself a reminder. Antonio's anger was something she'd seen before and she didn't need to experience it first-hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then the last report for the day will be this,\" Wendy said, handing Antonio a chart. \"Revenue today was...hectic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hectic?\" Antonio said, looking over the data. \"I don't understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as per your plan, our pregnancy-centric business have been doing extremely well, but the customer base grew much faster than we anticipated today. We weren't prepared and stores became so congested that we might have actually lost some money in a few areas,\" Wendy said. As she handed Antonio security camera footage of the mobs of bare-bellied pregnant women, she couldn't help thinking about her own budding pregnancy. Wendy was still unsure of when she should bring up her status as a mother-to-be to her employer. Somewhat ironic, given that Wendy was one of the few women in the city of Smallton who was naturally pregnant at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yaral,\" Antonio cursed under his breath as he handed Wendy back the charts and photographs. \"We have to work quickly then. Redouble our investments in pregnancy businesses in and around the mall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" Rebecca sighed, looking up after she'd caught up with her timeline and sent all the jokes and observations she could think of, \"if any of the pregnancy-related businesses, like, partner-up or something now, they could probably bankrupt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sound very relaxed,\" Antonio bristled, lowering his eyebrows. Quietly, he cursed Yaral again for somehow giving Rebecca the \"sloth\" amulet. \"But I highly doubt that will happen. It would take quite the mixture of business acumen, connections, innovation, and PR to create a competing pregnancy business empire in this mall. It can't happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-kay,\" Rebecca said, rolling her eyes as she went back to her phone, opening up 1024 and forgetting what else she thought she should say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina pouted as she waddled down the sidewalk, hands on her hips. How dare Antonio speak to her like that? Doesn't he know who she is? She's Catalina Corazon, the hottest up-and-coming actress in the world! Just look around: people were staring at her and the paparazzi were...well, there wasn't any paparazzi, unless you count the occasional teenager snapping a picture of her on their phones as they laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why aren't there any paparazzi</i>? Catalina thought angrily, her mind shifting from Antonio to TMZ. <i>If a Kardashian walks anywhere with a fully covered baby bump, they fall over themselves, and they aren't even in movies! Here I am, a star, my belly totally exposed in this non-maternity tank top</i>. It was true: Catalina was using her tank top as a bra, keeping her heaving chest held in place, her big mocha belly, filled with an ever-growing number of children thanks to Antonio fiddling around with her amulet, hanging out for all to see. Catalina looked down at her full breasts, barely contained in her tank top and thought about how many tabloid photographers she could get if she also took that off...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No</i>! Catalina thought, stomping her foot. <i>I never have to get naked for strangers again. Never, ever again</i>. She sighed, her mind going back to Antonio and the control he has over her life. Catalina believed that if her history in porn was ever exposed now that she was a major celebrity (in her own mind, of course. Her popularity was growing, but her pride amulet was changing her perspective greatly), all that fame would turn to ridicule and her movie contracts would dry up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Still, I hate working for Antonio. I mean, a mall? My star's burning much hotter than that. I just need to find another, bigger opportunity that needs someone for promotions. Then I can get leverage over Antonio and get those last few DVDs back and live the life of a silver screen queen</i>! Catalina cackled to herself as she ran her hands over her belly, passing by some pregnant strangers and sucking up their pregnancies. <i>Jennifer Aniston: no baby. Halle Berry: only one baby. Even Angelina Jolie only had twins. So with sextuplets, I should be at least three times as famous as Angelina Jolie</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley and Katie smiled and pecked one another on the lips, running their hands over each other's naked, pregnant bodies. \"I feel so...young with you,\" Ashley giggled. \"Me, a mother in her mid-40s, making love to a beautiful, pregnant 20-something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look amazing,\" Katie replied softly. \"I swear, you have all the sexy maturity of a woman in her 40s, plus the body and face of every super-model put together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I did do a little modeling in my younger years,\" Ashley blushed. \"Before Sarah, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They missed out having you model when you were pregnant,\" Katie giggled back, leaning forward to kiss between her new lover's breasts. Ashley was an extraordinarily good-looking woman given her age before the amulet passed pregnancies onto her, but as a side-effect to her \"lust\" amulet, each baby put in her uterus multiplied Ashley's beauty as well as her libido. So at 10 babies now, Ashley looked like a goddess walking among mortals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two began to kiss again and Ashley prepared for round two, the door downstairs closed. Ashley gasped and pulled away from Katie. \"That's my husband.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you didn't care,\" Katie said, kissing a trail up Ashley's neck. Ashley heaved herself up as much as she could, looking for what bits of Katie's clothing were within arm's reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care if he knows I had sex with someone else after he cheated on me, but I don't want him to confront you,\" Ashley said, tossing Katie what should could gather. \"Hurry, before he gets upstairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay,\" Katie said, waddling awkwardly to the hallway, bumping into Sarah. She stared back at Katie in disbelief, looking between her gargantuan belly, now bigger than Ashley's since she last saw it, and her bare melon-sized breasts. \"Hi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" Sarah said slowly. \"Did you just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door slammed shut again. \"H-hi Dad,\" Brandon said from downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me in here,\" Sarah said, putting her hand on Katie's naked back and ushering her into Sarah's bedroom/workplace. She shut the door behind her and crossed her arms, glaring at Katie. \"Did you and my mom just...have sex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did,\" Katie sighed, trying and failing to squeeze into her clothes. She'd gotten a lot bigger since she last wore these. \"But your father was the first one to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To cheat on Mom, I know,\" Sarah nodded, walking over to the other side of the bed. \"Looks like neither of you have the same bias against sleeping with pregnant women that he does.\" Katie blushed and looked down at herself. Sarah was a little intimidating. \"Must be nice to have someone to care for you even when you're as big as a house.\" Sarah was jealous. Jealous of Ashley for getting sex even when she was pregnant, more pregnant, than Sarah. Jealous of Katie for getting so...close to Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, Katie would have jumped on this opportunity to press Sarah more about her sexual history as a pregnant woman to see if she could get lucky enough to wrap her arms around her child-baring hips and belly, but thanks to her \"greed\" amulet, post-coitus, her mind was going back to making money. And with 10 babies now inside her womb, that greed was even stronger than before. Katie saw the blueprints and schemes on Sarah's desk. \"You're an inventor, huh?\" she said, trying to heave herself closer. When it was clear that Katie needed help, Sarah handed her the designs herself. \"All pregnancy related...you know, I'm trying to start some pregnancy-centric business ventures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you the one Janice at the mall is working with?\" Sarah said, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I am,\" Katie grinned. \"It looks like you have some pretty interesting things here. With this, we could be making more money than even the mall's owner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The mall's owner?\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some guy who's been trying to make money off of pregnancy there for years,\" Katie said. \"I dug up lots of financial data the other night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's envy burned inside her amulet. \"Why should some guy who doesn't have to carry a heavy load in his belly make money off of us pregnant women? Let's blow him out of the water.\"</span></div></div>",

I know Mom doesn't like her, but as far as I know, you don't feel the same way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine if you spend time with Erin,\" Tanner replied, his voice still stuck in a monotone. \"And it's probably better if you spend the night down there. Your mother and I are...having an argument.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>An argument</i>? Brandon thought. <i>You cheated on her and it sounds like she found out. How could anyone cheat on Mom? She's so nice and caring and...and she's pregnant! Wonderfully, hugely pregnant</i>. Brandon felt his face flush and he grabbed a few cases of beer, hurrying down to the basement. He hoped the work would get his mind off of Ashley's pregnant belly and make him forget that he getting an erection thinking about her. He was still under the impression that Ashley was his biological mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Brandon went downstairs, Tanner sighed and walked up to his bedroom, opening the door slowly. \"Ashley?\" he said before he got a good look at his wife. Ashley was naked on the bed, her enormous, round belly towering above her. Her lap was wet, her face was bright red, and she was still convulsing slightly with pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Tanner,\" Ashley cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...had sex,\" Tanner said, his eyes wide with shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes two of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanner grit his teeth and fists. \"Where is he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*He* Ashley chuckled. \"He's gone, you don't need to worry about that. I'd worry a lot more about you right now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Ashley, I'm a man and I have needs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have needs too. Not that you cared,\" Ashley said, turning her head away from her husband. \"I think you should sleep on the couch for the next few days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an impotent groan, Tanner stormed out of the room, slamming the door behind him. Ashley let out a gasp when he left, putting her hands to her face and crying gently. <i>He didn't even try to deny it. That's how little he thought of cheating on me. I'm carrying 10 damn babies for him and he sleeps with some young thing like it's nothing</i>. Ashley's sobbing stopped as she had one last, horrified realization. <i>And despite it all...I still wanted him to have sex with me. I almost asked him again. What is wrong with me</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner was chillingly quiet as Sarah pushed herself away from the table. The only words between them were Tanner asking if her investor meeting was tomorrow morning or afternoon. Sarah piled dinner onto two plates and picked them up. As she turned around, Tanner spoke up again. \"Why do you need two plates?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah froze. \"Well, I need to bring Mom her dinner and...you know how bad hunger can be for pregnant women. I know how hungry I am now so I can't imagine how Mom is, eating for 10.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"11,\" Tanner said. \"She's pregnant with 10 so she's eating for 11.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, 11,\" Sarah nodded, hurrying up the stairs; an easy task now thanks to her pregnancy-spine. <i>10? I guess that reality warp doesn't affect me anymore since I started tinkering with the amulet for my inventions</i>. Sarah opened the door to Ashley's room slowly, smiling at her expectant mother. \"Here's dinner, Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you sweetie,\" Ashley smiled, the lamp on by her side. She was sitting up now and managed to adjust one of her maternity bras to fit her breasts, now all the way up to K-cups. \"Just put it here,\" she said, patting her belly. Even with her breasts resting on her belly, there was plenty of room for her swollen womb to act as a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah put the plate down and sighed, looking at her mother. \"I always knew Dad was an ass, but I never thought he would seriously...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't worry about your Dad and me,\" Ashley smiled, reaching over to hold her daughter's hand but only managing to rub the side of Sarah's belly instead. \"I'm going to be fine. And don't get too mad at him. He's still your father, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But not Brandon's</i> Sarah thought. <i>But you don't know I know that yet</i>. \"Okay, Mom. Just...let me know if I can do anything for you, okay? With my new pregnancy inventions, I'll bet I can-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, thank you Sarah,\" Ashley smiled, patting Sarah's tummy before focusing her attention on her plate. Sarah looked down at her mother, still burning with jealousy at how well Ashley was taking things while still looking gorgeous in the process. She envied her energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in Sarah's own room, Katie had papers all over the room, making calculations and notes. \"I don't know how much you'll get from this investor of yours, but I think I can get the materials to make 1000 of those spines with very little overhead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" Sarah said, putting a plate beside Katie, who was still totally naked with a belly as big as Ashley's \u2014 maybe even bigger, since Katie was shorter. As Sarah eased herself into her own desk, she saw a few sheets of paper there with her name written out several times. \"What's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incorporation,\" Katie said. \"We'll need it if we're going to create the kind of pregnancy-business empire we're thinking of. Got any ideas for a company name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PregTech,\" Sarah said without any hesitation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good. We're lucky this boom in pregnancies are happening when the mall's owner was so unprepared,\" Katie said, pausing to look down at her amulet. \"Hope it wasn't my fault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know about these too?\" Sarah said, holding up her own amulet. Then, Sarah connected the dots. Katie having an amulet. Katie working at a maternity store. Katie fucking Ashley. \"Wait a minute, are you the one who got my Mom and me pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no!\" Katie said, holding up her hands in self-defense. \"I may have made you both a little bigger, but you were both huge when I first saw you. I even found my amulet at your house!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah narrowed her eyes. Katie seemed to be telling the truth. Besides, it was a secret they shared now, as far as they knew. \"I actually experimented with my amulet some and it's led to some other inventions. They're...big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bigger than full pregnant mobility?\" Katie said, holding up the patent for Sarah's spine. Sarah nodded and gave Katie another stack of papers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spontaneous pregnancy, changing pregnancy size, permanent pregnancy, turning pregnancies into a source of renewable energy,\" Sarah said. \"And that's just a start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This...this <u>is</u> big,\" Katie said, starting to drool as she thought about the possibilities. \"We could make billions off of this...can you do all of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most of it, but I'm constantly learning and understanding more,\" Sarah said. She looked over Katie, the only person to sleep with her pregnant mother, as big and fertile as her. Sarah sat beside her and slowly placed a hand on Katie's belly, rubbing gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie turned and put down her papers, which were the last things concealing her breasts. Normally, Katie would be all over Sarah now, but after already having pregnant sex and the greed in her amulet now multiplied by 10, she was more focused on her work. \"You know, I've got a manual that explains how to use the amulet in my purse. If I could get it, I'll bet you could make your inventions even better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh,\" Sarah said, removing her hand as Katie went back to her charts and contracts. \"Right. Good idea.\" Sarah's cheeks burned. She didn't know why she tried to woo Katie, but deep down, the answer was clear: jealousy. Why could Ashley get this pretty young tycoon but not Sarah? She looked down at her belly, barely concealed, and rubbed gently. <i>Brandon wouldn't ignore me</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownstairs, Brandon opened the door and smiled to let Grant in. \"Great to see you here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course; wouldn't miss it,\" Grant grinned, moving inside. Behind him walked a woman about the same age as him with straight brown hair and big, thick-framed glasses. \"This is Mara, a friend of mine. She's a HUGE D&amp;D nerd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true,\" Mara sighed. \"I brought my own character sheet and guides. Hope that's okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" Brandon said, leading them to the basement door. As Mara walked down, Grant took Brandon aside and showed him a plastic shopping bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, look what I found at the mall's video store,\" he whispered, taking out a few DVDs. \"It's porn with that famous actress around town! Catalina Corazon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem excited,\" Brandon laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding? Aside from Mara, the Catalina in this movies is the only non-pregnant woman in town. I need this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're exagerating,\" Brandon said, rolling his eyes as there was another knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so,\" Grant sighed, going downstairs. Brandon could hear Joel's weird greeting echo up the steps as he opened the door to see Erin's smiling face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" Erin blushed. \"Can I come in? Is your Mom around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's upstairs and doesn't know,\" Brandon said. \"She and my Dad are having a spat. I'll explain later.\" He leaned in to kiss her but Erin was faster, giving Brandon a big, wet kiss with plenty of tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You taste nice,\" Erin murmured as she waddled downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, now we are complete!\" Joel said with a booming voice, Yaral still inside him. A lack of chaos energy was rendering him weak and his mind was straying. \"Now, shall we start our glorious quest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess so,\" Brandon smiled, popping the cap off of his beer. \"Let the games begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Next was mara who was becoming aquatinted win everyone. Grant was next to her, pulling up his gm board, dice and figurines and inbetween the guys was Joel, observing the cabanossi. \"These tiny meat disks are delicious\" Joel said grabbing more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" okay that's it\" Brandon said pulling out a six pack. \" if you're going to talk like that all night, you are gunna have to drink\" pulling off the top he slid the beverage to his mate.

Or should we talk about jewellery?\" Joel said, looking at Brandon and Erin with their matching amulets. They shined, almost unearthly, atleast to Yaral it did.

Off to the distance was a large dark green clothed tipi, that had a particular shadowy aura about it. \" you know, I have heard of my fair share of mystical adventures, I say we go there\" Luke said as they walked over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking inside they saw an old gnome on top of a giant cloud filled orb.</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There must be a lot of condensation in that\" Erin said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Erin the point of this, is to be in character, think, what would a barbarian do?\" Mara said to her heavily pregnant friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>\" who enters my- oh Gharn! How good it is to see you\" Batta exclaimed brushing away her grey hairs as she floated towards the fat wizard. Giving each other a big hug, Batta returned to her orb. \"What bring you here old friend?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" well, we seek the staff of life, we were wondering if you could point us in the right direction. Last time we heard it was in the valley of ice.\" Gharn said, pulling out his flask. Batta talked for hours about the staffs history, boring Flynn to the point of exhaustion.</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it okay if we take a break?\" Joel said, his head in his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" well I guess we can, I need to visit the thinking room\" grant said heading up to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an awkward silence Mara piped up. \" so Erin, I have heard there are many people here pregnant with multiples, I'm guessing that's not just one\" mara joked as she grabbed some pretzels. With the mention of the P word Joel was back up right listening to the <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" you're not wrong\" Erin laughed. \" I'm 8 months with 5. My due date is in a few weeks. I have to say it's refreshing to see someone not pregnant here.\" Joel noticed that too, why wasn't she pregnant? Morphing some magic in his hands he shot a ball of pregnant chaos magic at Mara. The magic was invisible to everyone but him as it went to Mara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BOING!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt bounced off her! Why would it do that? The ball shot straight over to Erin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>PING!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin's belly filled up with another occupant.\" Woah\" Erin said as the extra weight was added. \" I um, I don't know what just happened\" she said with shock. \" I, I think I should see a doctor.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon saw her belly grow too, remembering what happened at the mall he said \" wait Erin, stop\". Grabbing his amulet he placed it on Erin's belly. A blue light emanated from the amulet for a second as time slowed down. Erin stood still, with a strange look on her face until BUURRP! \" oh my god, I am so sorry! acid reflux.\" She said rubbing her large midsection \" these six have a mind of their own\" she chuckled. As the two sat back down and Yarals anger grew. If he couldn't use his pregnancy magic to cause chaos, maybe there was another way... Looking down he noticed something different in the large gem of Brandon's amulet. It was completely blue now. But that wasn't all, a sliohette of a head was starting to appear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile at Brandon's workplace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler typed away at his computer. Everyone else had left the building, a single neon light shone above his head as he balanced budgets. Unlike past judgements, he knew a lot about keeping accounts and maintains a steady business. Sadly He knew his business wasn't going to survive if he had to support a gold digger. Not only that but no many people have been able to fund his projects, especially since \"the Baby Boom\" as it was being said in the news. Looking at his accounts he realised to survive the next two months he would have to cut spending on \"the company car\", trucks and eliminate the paid intern program. Meaning Brandon would sadly be fired. A buzz came from his cell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe sent an image of her now incredible rack, but he had no idea about the large orb that came with it. Grabbing his keys and phone he dashed to the elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDriving the company car out of the car park he sped wildly like a coyote after some kind of road bird. Taking a short cut past a children's ball park he saw the slutty hottie sitting on a bench facing the street up ahead. As he swerved around the corner he could see her in her sexy, curvaceously PREGNANT BODY!? He couldn't take his eyes off that fleshy orb, it was filling him with white hot rage! He pressed down on the gas, furious at what Brandon told him. All that sexual frustration over the past few months and for what, nothing?! Sadly for him, this wasn't going to be the last major thing to hit him tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>CRASH! </b></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Antonio threw his jacket off and slumped in front of his desk, bringing an oxygen mask to his mouth and taking in a few, deep breaths. His body relaxed in his chair as he secured the mask and turned on his computer. The genetic disease Antonio suffered from wasn't just making his arm deformed. It was taking away his stamina and strength as well. Fresh oxygen was easier for him to breathe, but he didn't dare show anyone he needed it. The only time Antonio could feel his healthiest was in the solace of his penthouse office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntonio tapped a panel on his desk and a low phone ring rattled throughout the room, again and again, until it stopped. He groaned and hit the same panel again and, after a few more buzzes, Rebecca's voice came through. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up?\" Antonio repeated back. \"I wanted your reports on our plan to maintain the mall's financial future this evening. Do you have them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, right, right,\" Rebecca said. She was reclined on her couch in her own home, Playstation controller resting against her large belly. All around her was loose paper and other garbage she didn't bother to clean up. \"I'll...get it to you soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been very derelict in your duties lately, Ms. Quo,\" Antonio said. He knew Rebecca had gotten the \"sloth\" amulet, but he was still expecting more out of her. Unfortunately, it had already bonded to her, so there was no chance getting his top operative back until his plan came to its completion. \"What about our plan to finish the energy conversion beam? Our test run earlier today went well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About that,\" Rebecca said, running a hand up and down her pale dome of maternal flesh, \"I never got the details from you on what exactly you need for this plan. It looked like these necklaces have something to do with it, but...you know...what are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntonio gritted his teeth, his nostrils flaring. \"That's not what I pay you to know about. Just do what I tell you or you'll be giving birth to your babies on the street.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever,\" Rebecca said, taking her headset off when Antonio hung up, returning to her game. She'd been curious about the finer points of Antonio's plan for a while and even thought it was a weird coincidence that both she and Catalina were pregnant while Antonio was trying to capitalize on the mall's pregnant customer base. But the thoughts quickly left her mind as she continued with her game, reaching a hand to the pizza box she had on her coffee table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntonio rested his head in his hands, stopping to look at his mangled hand in anger. There was a buzz at the door and Antonio took his oxygen mask off, slipping a glove back onto his deformed hand. \"Come in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy walked in slowly, tablet in her hand. \"Sir, we've checked flight logs and it looks like...Dr. Schultz is coming to Smallton.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Schultz?\" Antonio said, reading over her notes and observations. \"I doubt he's coming to help with my efforts. He's the only other person who knows any detail about these amulets. Probably even more than I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not sure why he's coming now, but I thought you'd want to be aware,\" Wendy said, her voice getting quieter and quieter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have Rebecca on it,\" Antonio said, typing out a message for his lazy commando. \"Anything else for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-just one more thing,\" Wendy said, biting her lip. \"I'm...pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim sat on a bench while police and firefighters talked to her, trying to understand what happened. \"He just swerved at hit the light pole?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He wasn't paying attention and hit the curb, yeah,\" Kim sighed, looking away from the officers. She knew that, even now, they were checking out her breasts and enormous belly and, while flattered, she didn't exactly feel like being ogled today. When Grace touched Brandon's amulet, reality was rewritten in the mall and all of the pregnancies Yaral created while possessing Joel changed, so it was like no one was aware they hadn't been pregnant moments earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim, however, was already leaving the mall and things didn't change for her. She was perfectly aware that one second, she was a flat-bellied knockout, and the next, she was a swollen, waddling octomom-to-be. Kim still hoped her looks were enough for whoever the rich guy Brandon set her up with, but evidently not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there any reason you're not...covering your pregnant stomach?\" a medic asked, a hint of a sneer on his lips. \"I mean...that's pretty distracting. It could have been why-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, is he going to be alright?\" Kim pouted, flashing the senior detective a piercing look. \"I've given you all the information I have and I'd like to go home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll live,\" another medic said. \"Concussion, broken bones. He'll spend a few days in the hospital but that's all. We've contacted his family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Kim said, heaving herself up and waddling away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-excuse me,\" the detective said, chasing after her. \"But did you want someone to maybe walk you home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim grinned. She knew his look. Even with the big belly, she still had the charm. \"No, I'll be fine,\" she purred, stroking his cheek. \"I've got lots of friends I can stay with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...attack, I guess,\" Erin said, shrugging. The table let out a small groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, try and have fun,\" Brandon said with a smile, giving Erin a small nudge with his elbow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't make me go into labor on you,\" Erin smiled back. \"Okay, um, <b>Katherine swings her broadaxe at the cave troll</b>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant rolled the die. \"You miss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I just miss completely?\" Erin protested, mouth full of chips and dip as her other hand rubbed her belly quickly. Brandon watched her hand with an eager glance, his face turning red. From where they were sitting around the table, only Mara and Brandon could see her full, bare belly and Mara was too focused on her own turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. Just how it happens sometimes,\" Mara smiled. \"<b>I fire two +5 medium fire arrows at the troll's head</b>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant rolled again. \"Both hits. The cave troll is defeated.\" He let out a little smile and turned to Mara. \"G-good job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Mara smiled back, her dimples showing. \"But isn't the game master supposed to sound a little more impartial?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say we continue on,\" Joel said, crossing his arms. When the rest were playing, they were distracted enough for him to try and impregnate Mara again. After nearly half a day of possessing another person, as well as the beer he'd foolishly drank, Yaral was losing control over Joel's body. He needed some more chaos in his vicinity, and quickly, or he'd have no choice but to leave before he can get more information about Brandon and his amulet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You press on and come to a fork,\" Grant said. \"Two passages. What do you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the rest looked at the game map, Yaral sent another surge of energy at Mara. Again, nothing happened to her while Erin's belly surged with its seventh occupant. \"W-what the?\" Erin said, wrapping both hands around as much of her belly as she could. It was beginning to tilt the table. Brandon was looking at his texts when the surge happened, and in a frenzy, he put the phone down on the table and touched his amulet to her belly. A blue glow filled the room again and Erin's look of surprise turned to calm. \"Sorry, lot of kicking again I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never felt a pregnant belly,\" Mara said, reaching a hand out. \"M-may I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Erin smile, turning to show Mara her enormous belly. \"Don't let the size scare you.\" Mara let out a little laugh and felt Erin's belly, letting out a few quiet gasps. Erin liked having someone else feel her belly for once. With seven babies, she couldn't rub all of it, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon's phone buzzed on the table and Erin looked in time to see the text. &lt;Tyler's in the hospital. We'll be seeing a lot more of each other in the next few days <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/suitheart.png\" alt=\"*SuitHeart*\" title=\"SuitHeart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is this?\" Erin said, turning to Brandon with a worried expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no one,\" Brandon said, gulping. Erin snatched the phone away and texted the same question. In a few seconds, a reply came back, with a picture of Clara's pregnant belly attached. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;It's not my daughter, in case you can't keep your bellies apart. Let's finish what we started tomorrow&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin's hands began to shake. \"Brandon...I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's chaos, but not nearly enough,\" Joel complained, giving Mara one last shot of pregnant energy. And again, only Erin got bigger, now at octuplet proportions. \"Ugh, this is vexing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-here, let me...\" Brandon said, trying to touch his amulet to Erin's belly, only to be slapped away by Erin. As she slapped it away, Yaral saw a blue flash again, but in addition to reality being rewritten, the silhouette he saw before leaped from Brandon's amulet and vanished, passing through the walls in an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's why,\" Joel nodded, a cackling grin on his lips. \"Sister...you finally show up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All you care about is...is bellies!\" Erin said, face bright red. \"You only liked me...because I was pregnant. Any pregnant woman turns you on and you'll fuck whoever you can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-that's not true!\" Brandon protested. \"I love you, Erin! I always have!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should go,\" Mara whispered to Grant. Unknown to anyone else in the room, Mara had ovarian cancer when she was young and, while she had a clean bill of health now, she was infertile. If the amulet was rewriting reality, it wouldn't have mattered, but Yaral was focused on causing sudden, non-rewritten pregnancies, so Mara was unaffected. And the energy when to the only womb available: Erin's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you're right,\" Grant said, slinking out slowly, with Joel not far behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for your hospitality!\" he barked. \"This has been very...illustrative!\" He let out a demonic laugh as he slammed the door, leaving Brandon and Erin alone.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Catalina waddled around her apartment, one hand consoling the babies kicking inside her naked belly, the other scrolling through her phone, deleting contacts. \"I can't believe I slept with you,\" she said after each one, scoffing. \"I'm famous now. I deserve much, much better.\" She peered down at her round, coffee-colored belly, with her full, equally-naked breasts resting on top. \"Well, it might be a while before I get any action with this big ball. The fans think it's cute but...I don't know if they really think it's sexy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the amulet changed reality around, Catalina was a rising but still largely unknown celebrity and model. Now, as the first actress to star in movies while several massively pregnant, her cache skyrocketed and she was on the path toward real success. But Catalina knew she wasn't there yet and pressured her agent to get her into bigger and better projects before her belly \u2014 her cash cow \u2014 went away. Catalina was certain sticking around the Smallton mall wasn't going to land her any blockbusters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina's phone rang and she picked it up with glee, happy to see her agent calling her. \"Hello Maurice,\" Catalina purred. \"Any luck on getting me cast as Black Cat in the next Marvel movie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, the studio still doesn't want a pregnant superhero, as many times as I've asked,\" her agent coughed. \"But I've got some other news you might find...interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, out with it,\" Catalina huffed, crossing her arms. Why hadn't she fired this little man yet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how but your movies from your, let's say, <i>former career</i> have been sold,\" Maurice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, Freddy vs. Jason 2? I don't care about tha-\" Catalina said, stopping when she realized what career Maurice was referring to. \"Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very,\" Maurice said. \"I pulled a lot of strings to confirm this. I even got a security guard to show me the tape. Catalina, if this gets out-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Catalina said, pacing around. \"No, this might be good. I knew Antonio had one copy on hold as blackmail. This might be my chance to get my hands on the last piece of my past in porn and destroy it. If he or she wanted to buy Catalina porn, then I should be able to...seduce them and persuade them to hand it over,\" she smiled, admiring herself in the mirror. \"Send me everything you have on the person who bought them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice was grunting and growling, swinging her barbells around with vigor. There were so many things she was mad about. For one, the device she hung from to do her vertical sit-ups was no longer supporting her weight. It was as if she wasn't pregnant with sextuplets yesterday! Janice was also angry as she thought about how the mall had screwed her pregnant yoga and fitness classes out of money. Since Sarah and Katie presented their ideas for improving their businesses, she'd thought more and more about the mysterious owner of the mall and his bullshit policies to funnel money into his pockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut most of all, Janice was mad about Joel. That little twerp...okay, that tall twerp had knocked her up with sextuplets and didn't say a peep to her. And when Janice ran into Joel at the mall today, he acted so strange and had the nerve to touch her belly! If he wants to act like these are his babies, he needs to go the full mile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping her weights with a loud thud, Janice let out a long sigh. She was a yoga teacher; she was supposed to be able to meditate and be calm. But she had a wrathful energy building up inside her she couldn't extinguish. So, instead of letting it go to waste, Janice waddled to her computer and started contacting every business in the mall that even remotely dealt with pregnancy. If Katie wanted a business alliance, Janice was going to give it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you see me as anything other than a big belly?\" Erin said to Brandon, trying to cover her belly with her arms. \"A big belly and maybe a nice pair of T&amp;A?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erin, please,\" Brandon begged. \"I've loved you since before you were pregnant! I think you're funny, you're smart, you're cool. I like being around you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin scoffed. \"And you liked being around her too?\" Erin said, pointing to Brandon's pocket where he put his phone back. \"And her...her daughter, she said? Let me guess: she's pregnant too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Brandon said. \"I mean...yes, and yeah, I like pregnant women. You know that. But there's a difference between just lust and love. And since I've been with you, I don't lust after other women.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe that,\" Erin said, shaking her head. \"That's not what your text sounded like. How long have you been sleeping with her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't have sex with Clara!\" Brandon said. \"I did whatever I could to get out of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you didn't have sex with Clara,\" Erin said, rolling her eyes. \"Just Clara, then. Her daughter, though.\" Brandon paused and Erin's eyes went big. \"Oh my god...you didn't actually...oh my god.\" Tears began to fall down her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was cornered and...it was an accident!\" Brandon said, holding his hands up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe this,\" Erin said, holding her hands to her mouth. \"Do you know how many guys have hit on me? I didn't do anything because I thought we were...a couple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are!\" Brandon said, reaching his hand into his pocket. \"Look, you can call them yourself and hear the truth.\" As Brandon pulled out his phone, Grace's phone number fell out. Erin gasped and bent down slowly, groaning with her pregnant weight, taking the number off the ground. Brandon was paralyzed with fear and shame and couldn't move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of them?\" Erin said, lips trembling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not,\" Brandon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh, it's just a third woman,\" Erin said, letting out a frustrated laugh. \"Pregnant too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erin, please-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is...this is worse than when I found out I was going to be pregnant and single,\" Erin said, hands rubbing her belly slowly. \"Sorry to rub and turn you on, but they're kicking. They kick when I get worried. They weigh a ton, they press on my bladder, and they kick when I'm trying to sleep.\" Erin's tears started to flow again. \"B-but you know what?...this is the first time I haven't wished you were the father. Goodbye, Brandon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erin!\" Brandon said, stepping forward only to get a slap in the face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said goodbye,\" Erin said, turning around and waddling up the stairs. When the door was closed behind her, her tears really began to flow and she headed for her car as quickly as she could, heading for any drive-through fast food on the way home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon stood in dismay downstairs for a few minutes before lazily cleaning up the table and snacks. His heart was on the floor in absolute tatters. And worst of all: it wasn't just a misunderstanding. He'd faltered with Kristina because she was sexy and wanted him. Brandon wasn't exactly used to women \"wanting him,\" and it was just his luck that they were all turning out to be pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the room was clean, Brandon trudged back upstairs, washing his face and brushing his teeth before walking to his room. The light was still on under Sarah's room but she'd also put up the \"<b>Working: Do Not Disturb</b>\" sign, so he couldn't go to her for consoling. Then, he heard a voice from down the hall. \"Brandon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe crept into his mother's room, seeing Ashley still sitting up in bed, hand on her enormous bare pregnant belly. Brandon didn't remember it being this big, but at the moment, he didn't care. \"Yeah, mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Mom</i> Ashley shuddered a little, knowing she wanted to tell Brandon the truth soon. But maybe midnight wasn't the best time. \"Can't sleep, honey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno,\" Brandon sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mere,\" Ashley said, waving a hand. Brandon walked over and Ashley gave a little smile. \"Well you're not going to sleep with your street clothes on. Put on your pajamas.\" Brandon gulped. He took of his jeans, jacket, and shoes, leaving just his t-shirt and underwear. Ashley gave another soft smile and patted the other side of the bed. Luckily she and Tanner bought a big enough bed so when she slept on her side, there was still room behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCautiously, Brandon slipped in beside his mother, facing her back. Ashley, without looking, reached over and took Brandon's hand and held it against her belly, before taking the covers and bringing it over both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, feel more comfortable?\" Ashley whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhmm,\" Brandon choked out, his body pressed against the back of a hugely pregnant woman he knew as his mother. Of course, Ashley no longer saw him as just her adoptive son. She saw him as...Brandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-me too,\" Ashley said. \"Now we can both sleep tight.\" Ashley closed her eyes, tracing her fingers against Brandon's, loving the feel of his touch against her motherly bulge. She didn't have any underwear she could fit into around her hips, but with the size of her belly and ass, she knew Brandon wouldn't be able to notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of them were particularly calm, both of their hearts racing like crazy for slightly different reasons. Brandon let his hands rub and feel small stretches of Ashley's decaplet belly. He couldn't lie to himself: he loved his mother's belly and being close to her like this was...exhilarating. With every baby added to her belly, her beauty grew and grew. And she was gorgeous before the amulets even showed up. Taking in a deep breath of her hair and skin, Brandon let his eyelids settle, pressing against Ashley a little more as the two slept, wrapped in a pregnancy-centric embrace.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was quiet in the Page house at 1 in the morning. Tanner slept comfortably in the guest room, Brandon and Ashley were in the same bed, sleeping heavily but in Sarah's room, Sarah was planning with Katie to take down Antonio and his mall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I did come across this device in one of the restaurants, it could give us enough power to fuel EVERYTHING. If I grab a crowbar from the shed, plus some other things I have created, I'm sure we can grab it. \" Sarah whispered as she grabbed her extra large coat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan, but what about the security cameras?\" Katie questioned, trying to put together a makeshift toga from one of Sarah's blankets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"that's where this bad boy comes in.\" Sarah said pulling out a black spherical orb with wires attached to it. \" before I started working on pregnancy inventions, I made a series of interesting gadgets. This one helps businesses restart their circuitry  with a massive and incredibly short power gigajolt  to the wiring if there was a power outage or a black out. If I hook this up to a generator, the power in the street will go out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent, now how will this help us?\" Katie said as they snuck out of the room and down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's simple, we hook this up to the electrical generator on the street and Boom! Power outage for a long time.\" Sarah said as they left the house and took the crowbar and torches from the shed. Looking at the cars they realised the only car they could take was Tanners Rangerover. After 20 minutes they found the keys and got in the car. Sarah being the smaller one drove with the seat back at maximum. Katie pushed the passenger seat down, squeezed into the back door and placed her gargantuan belly on chair in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving Burger Queens drive through, Erin parked and gobbled down 2 of her 6 burgers in record time. Wiping her mouth she brought the cola up to her fuller cheeks to take a sip. \"How could he\" was the only thing going on in her mind, she needed to distract herself. She ate and ate, downing the next burger and the one after that, plus the fries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrowning the food with more drink she looked in the mirror. Staring back was a larger than ever pregnant woman, all that food she had been eating was going straight to her thighs, butt, belly and breasts. Her face and arms somehow looked like they did before she became pregnant. \" maybe it's because I have gained all this stupid weight... He probably wants some slutty skinny bitch who is pregnant\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin's emotions were like a typhoon. At one point she was upset, then depressed, now a large burgeoning rage poured upon her. Funnelling down the last two burgers she went to start the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried again to start it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the third time she pushed it too far and flooded the engine. \" god damn it!\" She angrily yelled punching the wheel, setting the air bag off.  Luckily her breasts took most of the impact. Coming to she used her still delicate fingers to fish for her phone in her purse. \" mum, can you pick me up? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouisa turned up in a taxi, asked the taxi man to wait and waddled to Erin's car. Erin was shocked by how her mum looked.  Her clothes remained as pristine as ever, but her hair was incredibly dirty, her face had smears of mud and her body looked like she had swam through a swamp. Louisa saw Erin with her arms over the deflated airbag and tear stained makeup \" are you okay honey?\" She asked sympathetically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I could say the same thing about you\" Erin said, curious as to how her mother was looking the way she was now. Grabbing her things, she squeezed herself out of the car and waddled over to embrace her mum. They locked the car and took the taxi home. On the way Erin started to tear up again, grabbing tissues from her bag she sobbed to her mother \" mum, why are men jerks?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" oh honey, they aren't, they are just idiots\" Louisa said putting her arm around her massively pregnant daughter. \" why? What did Brandon do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" oh it's just the worst, he has been so unfaithful\" Erin said as she blew into her tissue. Stuffing it into her bra, she brushed up against her amulet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I mean, this whole pregnancy business has been such a tricky mess\" Erin continued to cry as Louisa's belly expanded with an extra occupant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" oh honey, I'm sorry. Brandon is a very busy man, but he is an arse, don't worry about him, the only thing that matters is that you are here, safe with mum.\" Louisa said, getting angry at Brandon. \"Look, how about we stay up, drinking tea and Talking about how stupid men can be? I mean, being this heavily pregnant, it's not like we are going to have that much sleep, are we?\" Going home they spent the night in the living room talking, with tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in Tanners car Sarah and Katie headed straight to the restaurant district. \" wait, how heavy is this thing?\" Katie asked Sarah, whom now just remembered the incredible size of the thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frap, do you know where we can get a forklift?\" Sarah questioned as she let out a large sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know just the place\" Katie said directing her through town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanner's car zoomed through the somewhat empty city, the only place open was \"DUALSHOCK\" the geekiest gaming bar in town. Joel, Grant and Mara went there after things went down hill at the Page house. Joel was talking to Mara about who would win in a fight between Hercules and Kratos. \" listen here mortal, I swear, I, I, oh god\" Joel said as the alcohol took it's final effects on Yarals mind. He felt trapped, caught in a bear trap, he needed out, HE NEEDED OUT!!! \" I, am, out\" was all Yaral could say before leaving Joel's head and escaping to the night. Joel collapsed onto the ground, unconscious. \" help! Help!\" Grant said as Mara tried to read a pulse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDriving up close to the mall the two walked into the mall's delivery zone. 2 factory workers walked inside leaving the forklift out in the open with the keys in the ignition.  \" finally a stroke of luck\" Sarah said grinning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSneaking over was taxing for Katie, that decatuplet belly was really straining her. Sarah handed Katie the robo spine, then got behind the stearing wheel. \" aaand attached, HEY WHOA\" katie yelled as Sarah pushed a lever, causing the forklift to lift up her belly. Quickly she jumped on top of her belly, making herself comfortable. \" I guess you can go now.\" She said not realising in her position she was flashing the world her ghetto sized pale booty. Madly they drove out before the two lady workers came back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katie, do you see if they followed us?\" Sarah said lifting her up so she could look over the forklift. As she did so Katie's makeshift toga was caught on a passing branch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, hey, what the?\" Katie said alarmed as the silk sheets were torn from her body. Her breasts flew free, turning Sarah on. \" hey go back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chilly tonight?\" Sarah said laughing \" I'm sorry, I can't, if I get off now, the forklift will flip under your pressure.\" Katie gave her a furious look and tried to swipe at her. \" hey! Relax, there is no one here! Don't worry, the restaurant will have sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two made it to the street. Lowering Katie, Sarah grabbed her blackout device and hooked it up to the generator. Pressing the green button the energy flowed through at an incredible rate. The generator and the entire street blacked out in seconds. the electronic doors to all places opened. \"Wow for such high class places they have such bad security.\" Katie said, waddling naked through the darkness with Sarah.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's funny how quickly they were able to build, almost irregular. Looking at the time he realised how long he made his scientists work. Picking up his phone with his good hand he called his right hand man. \" yes sir?\" Bills voice came from the other side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I *COUGH**COUGH*** realise you guys have been putting in a lot of hard effort and time.\"The weapon should be ready for testing tomorrow, let your lab assistants know they are free to go home. Oh, and can you check up on Petissiyum on your way *CCOOUUGH** home? I just want to make sure it's all locked up, take some knock out gas there if anything goes wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood\" Bill said, hanging up. Turning to the large laboratory he said \" okay, you guys have worked for long enough now, boss says it's home time, take tomorrow off, I can do tests on my own\". He collected his belongings from his locker and switched off the main lights as he and his lab partners left the facility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf way up the restaurant district our two pregnant heroines found \" Petissiyum\". The same place Sarah found the device. They easily opened up the place without triggering any alarms. Everything was offline. Walking through Katie found a large sheet to cover up her breasts. She found another for her backside. They continued past the kitchen and into the supply area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill Jobson parked his car outside the restaurant district. There was no light what so ever, it was darker than a trip to Isengard. Grabbing a torch and his gas canister, he put on a gas mask and walked down the shadowy district of open restaurants. Looking into Petissiyum, he saw torch lights moving through the kitchen. Turning off his torch he snuck in and readied his canister. As he neared closer he stuck to the shadows and pulled the pin and threw the can into the room our two pregnant heroines were sneaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere it stood, the menacing machine looked like it would need twenty people to lift it. \" I'll grab the forklift and we can- wait, what smells funny\" Sarah said as she started getting drowsy. \" Im afraid it's past your bed time ladies\" came a voice from the shadows. Bill revealed himself from the shadowy areas as Sarah and Katie collapsed on the ground in a matter of seconds. \" say goodnight\" Bill said smirking. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah opened her eyes as she felt herself being bumped and shaken awake. She moved one hand to her belly to discover that it wasn't coming from her babies. Well, not exclusively from her babies. There was always at least one kicking around in Sarah's womb at any given time. But as Sarah felt soft light wash across her face over and over again, she figured out where she was: in the back of a van with Katie resting against her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katie,\" Sarah said, nudging her companion a bit. \"Katie wake up.\" Katie let out a low moan but didn't stir much. Sarah knew how she felt. As she tried to move around, there wasn't much Sarah could do and she still felt tired and groggy as sleep beckoned back to her. The last thing she could remember was looking at the inner paneling of the energy device in Antonio's compound, then falling asleep. \"Must have been...some sort of tranquilizer,\" Sarah mumbled, trying to get to her feet. Sarah's pregnancy robospine increased her body's ability greatly, not only making it easier to lug around such a heavy pregnant belly, but also giving her some resistance to the sleep-inducing gas. But not much. At least she managed to wake up before...Sarah shuddered at the thought of wherever she and Katie were being taken. The last time Antonio help Sarah captive, it was not a pleasant experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looked around the van's interior, understanding its designs and mechanisms quickly. She shook loose some paneling and exposed the wiring. With a quick pull, she disconnected them and the van began to sputter and slow down. Sarah could hear the driver curse in the front. It was only a matter of time before he walked around to get them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katie, hurry and get up!\" Sarah said, scurrying on her knees to unlock the back door. In her condition, the element of surprise was all she could hope for if she wanted to escape. \"We need to be ready to make a run for it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, Ashley, you're so loud,\" Katie slurred, a coy smile forming on her lips. \"I barely touched you there.\" Sarah felt her envy burn in her chest again as she heard Katie continue to go on about Sarah's mother. That split-second distraction prevented Sarah from taking her weight off the door when Bill opened it and her pregnant weight knocked the wiry scientist over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy now, easy!\" Bill yelled, getting up and holding one hand out at Sarah, keeping the other hand by his hip. \"Just get back in the van and no one gets hurt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get in the van?\" Sarah said, holding one hand to her head. She was on the verge of passing out again and stumbled toward Bill. Being the coward that he is, Bill yelped and pulled out his weapon, firing a shot at Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr so he thought. Antonio had Bill working on two inventions over the past days: one was a device built from the gem from Catalina's amulet to make it easier to make people pregnant. The other was a new, non-lethal weapon to incapacitate attackers, hopefully cornering the market on tasers and giving Antonio another source of wealth. Bill took the wrong weapon with him and instead of a stunning burst, he fired a blast of pure pregnancy energy at Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, she doubled over, gasping as her belly swelled. Her clothes, which only held onto her preposterous size by a thread of elastic, gave out, snapping and ripping as her belly, breasts, and ass reached incredible proportions. The discharge from Bill's weapon added to Sarah's belly immensely, making her pregnant with 15 babies. Her moans grew and grew as the robospine stopped being able to compensate for her size, making her knees wobble along with the rest of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it didn't stop there. Bill's weapon was vastly inferior to Sarah's own similar device and it exploded in his hands. A shockwave of pregnant energy spread across the city, affecting those closest to its epicenter the most strongly. That was bad news for Katie, who was in the van just behind Sarah. The swelling in her belly snapped her awake and she moaned loudly, feeling five more babies appear in her womb. What little of her body was actually covered by her makeshift toga was on display to the world now as Katie nearly rolled out of the van, running her hand under her gigantic, 15-baby belly for support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Run!\" Sarah yelped, trying to waddle away as best she could. The robospine might not have negated her pregnancy, but it at least reduced the weight to more like a twin pregnancy than a 15-baby one. Katie was not so lucky, barely making it a few steps before succumbing to her pregnant weight and drug-enduced lethargy. Bill cursed again, reaching his non-burned hand for Katie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the one the boss wants,\" he growled, stopping when police sirens blared. Bill ran off, leaving the sabotaged van behind. The police cruiser nearly followed him, but stopped when the driver saw Sarah and Katie. Officer McCulley stepped out, one hand resting on her prominent pregnant bulge which had recently tripled in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two alright?\" she said, chewing her gum with care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-we're fine,\" Sarah gulped. \"Our baby shower went a little...crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it,\" Officer McCulley said, looking right at Katie and her toga. \"Say, did you both...just feel your bellies grow? I was only carrying one in here until a few seconds ago, poof, triplets doing a jig on my bladder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>His device must not have included a reality shift</i> Sarah thought, a little happy that she could build a better pregnancy weapon. \"Y-yes it did. Officer, can you drive us home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOfficer McCulley sighed and smiled. \"Guess I can empathize with you two. If you can fit in my car, I'll give you both a ride home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon was sitting in his kitchen. Except it wasn't his kitchen. It was enormous and ornate and magnificent. One familiar sight was Ashley humming as she cooked in front of the stove, although she wasn't wearing anything but an apron and underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for breakfast?\" she said sweetly, turning around to face Brandon. But her voice wasn't the same motherly tone as usual. It was more...familiar. She also had a more intrigued curl to her lips than before. Brandon had never seen his mother like this. Just as he was processing her alluring face, his eyes moved to her colossal belly and he couldn't believe it. She was much, much bigger than he remembered her with 10 babies. What was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I told you,\" Sarah scoffed, walking into the kitchen in a blazer and pinstripe pants. Her outfit was tailored to allow her own big belly, just as big as Brandon remembered, to stick out bare and proud. \"I'm the CEO of PregTech. We can afford a maid to do these kinds of things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, no one can cook for Brandon but me,\" Ashley cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And me. Don't be selfish,\" Sarah pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, of course,\" Ashley smiled. \"We share him. Isn't that right, Brandon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was already running out the door, only to bump into the bellies of Katie, Janice, and Catalina, all of them smiling at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Brandon,\" Janice said. \"Good morning, though we all know you had a good night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that supposed to mean?\" Brandon choked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on now,\" Katie said, rolling her eyes. \"If I was with Ashley every night, the woman who tests PregTech's pregnancy enhancements, I know how my nights would be. Look at the position you're in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what position?\" Brandon yelled. He was getting scared. This was all too real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really now?\" Catalina smiled, holding Brandon's chin. \"Honey, just open your eyes to see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon jolted awake, just in time to see Ashley move to sit on the edge of the bed, stretching her arms above her head and giving out a little peep that Brandon had to admit was...cute. Without making any noise, Brandon watched his pregnant mother stand up and stretch her belly out, the light from the blinds illuminating her like the work of art she was. Brandon could see much of her bare belly and even parts of her cleavage. But what nearly made him cry out was seeing that all night, Ashley hadn't worn any underwear, as evidenced by her naked, plentiful ass right in his range of vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Brandon,\" Ashley smiled, turning around to face him. \"I didn't wake you, did I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-na,\" Brandon managed to get out. Ashley smiled more gently, running her hands up and down her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I've got to tell him today</i> Ashley said, sensing today was the best day to tell Brandon he wasn't her biological son. Whether she would include the ways she'd been thinking about him lately...she wasn't sure. \"Brandon, do I look...bigger to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-bigger?\" Brandon sputtered, holding his blanket close to conceal his erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My belly feels heavier and I think there's more movement inside me,\" Ashley sighed, looking at her hugeness. \"Could you get your sister? I need a second opinion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon nodded quickly and wrapped the bedsheet around him, going to Sarah's door. Officer McCulley brought her back in the middle of the night without disturbing anyone before taking Katie to her own apartment, so when Sarah heard her door begin to open, she slowly sat up, glaring at Brandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you peeping on me now?\" she snorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no!\" Brandon said, face flushing. \"Mom just wants your help. She thinks she's...bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bigger, huh?\" Sarah sighed, turning over in bed to reveal her own gigantic, bare, 15-baby belly. \"Well, tell her I think I've got bad news: she <u>is</u> bigger.\"</span></div></div>",

Not only did she not fully fit in her bed, due to her immense size, but she was incredibly hungry. It made sense: with eight babies inside her womb, the gluttony of her amulet was greatly multiplied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could get move, a tray with breakfast was placed on top of her bed and Erin looked up to see Louisa's smiling face. \"Mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, dear,\" Louisa said. \"After your night, I thought you'd appreciate some breakfast in bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, you didn't have to,\" Erin said, shifting in bed slightly. With just an adjustment of a few inches, her colossal belly knocked over her tray and Erin scrambled to catch all the plates, snatching a few loose pieces of food in her mouth on the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems I did,\" Louisa chuckled, heaving her own impressive pregnant weight down so she could sit by her daughter. \"Feeling any better this morning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Erin sighed. \"I mean...I dunno. I really liked Brandon, Mom. When I was with him, it was...it was like no one had ever treated me that way before.\" She coughed out a little laugh and put one hand on her belly. \"I guess I know why now. You were right about the Page family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if that's fair,\" Louisa sighed, running her hands through her daughter's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is. That whole family is pregnancy-obsessed,\" Erin scoffed. \"That's the only reason he showed me any affection, you know. He <u>likes</u> the bellies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just feeling upset right now, honey. It's normal,\" Louisa said, petting her daughter a bit more. Still, her words made Louisa stumble a little. <i>The Page boy is turned on by pregnancy? I guess there has to be someone. Douglass certainly doesn't care for it</i>. \"If you want, I do know...something that can get your mind off of all this business with the men in your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do anything, Mom,\" Erin said, shaking her head. Louisa took a big sigh and ran her hand up and down her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you know my 'Book Club' at the country club?\" Louisa asked. Erin gave a little nod. \"Well, we don't typically talk about books. We gossip over drinks. But now that we've all got babies on the way, we've had to find a new outlet. The women and I, we-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mama,\" Brody, Louisa's younger son, chirped, walking up to Erin's bed. \"Mama, I wanna go to the library.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brody, in a few minutes,\" Louisa smiled sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're already late, Mama!\" Louisa frowned and looked at her watch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, I forgot,\" Louisa said, getting up slowly and waddling toward the door. \"I've got to take Brody to his reading circle at the library.\" She turned and winked at her daughter. \"I'm sure there's a lot more reading going on there than at my meetings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Mom,\" Erin said, managing to get herself out of bed and waddling. Brody's jaw dropped as he looked back at his pregnant sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erin! You're so big!\" he blurted. Brandon's amulet rewrote reality so Brody was used to having a sister pregnant with octuplets, but he'd never seen her bare belly at this size before. Louisa grabbed him by the back of the shirt and hurried Brody out of the room, scolding him for being rude. It was a little too late, though: it was the birth of a future pregnancy fetishist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin pushed her hands into her back and moaned. \"Great, now what?\" Erin never had all that many friends, with her family's wealth driving most people away. But luckily, amid the chaos of last night's D&amp;D game, Erin managed to make one new girlfriend. Bending and gasping to get at her phone, Erin called Mara up to organize a get-together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds fun!\" Mara said on the other end. Deep down, she was just happy to hang out with such a massively pregnant woman, always curious about what the experience was like. \"Park or mall?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't been to the mall in a while,\" Erin said. \"That sounds good. Besides...\" she looked down at her massive, fertile size. \"I think I need some new clothes and the best maternity store for miles is there.\" Erin hung up and looked at her belly for a few seconds. \"Wait a minute...am I...bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe radio started playing the top 40 pop hits as Kim groaned, reaching one arm over to hit her alarm clock off. Moving her hand back to her midsection, Kim saw that what happened yesterday was not just a vivid nightmare. She was still pregnant with what felt like 20 brats but in reality was only nine very active fetuses. Thanks to Bill's weapon exploding, the pregnancy energy shockwave added one more mouth to feed inside her bloated middle, without Kim's knowledge. Slowly, Kim sat up in bed, spreading her legs to accommodate her incredible size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim went over the positives and negatives in her head. There were no stretch marks and her unnatural tan had now become a nice glow. Her tits managed to grow a few cup sizes too. And the way things were going in the city, it wasn't like she was the only woman with a huge pregnant belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first negative was pretty obvious: she was pregnant. Soon (and very soon, by the looks of her), Kim would have to give birth and be a mother to eight babies at once. Another sharp kick made Kim rethink that \"eight\" number. Kim also hated the \"pregnant look.\" It was bad enough when her best friend got a bun in the oven, but now Kim would have to look at her own enormous belly all day and all night too. Plus, Kim would now need a whole new wardrobe, even if was just her underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new thought and potential positive entered Kim's mind. This belly didn't have to be a burden. At least not for her alone. Tanner should have to support her. She was fucking him and his wife had a belly the size of a moon too. Hell, maybe this weird jumbo-pregnancy took a while to show up and Kim had been pregnant with Tanner's babies all along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swung her legs over the side of the bed and picked up her phone, calling Tanner while she looked (or dare she say, <i>admired</i>) her pregnant body in one of her many full-body mirrors that made for such good selfies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the Page family sofa, while Sarah and Ashley were discovering one another's new \"sizes,\" Tanner groaned and reached for his phone. \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey handsome,\" Kim purred. \"I think you should come see me today. And soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a great time,\" Tanner said, bringing his voice down as he looked up the staircase. \"My wife knows and...I think my kids know too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got more kids to worry about than just those two D-listers,\" Kim sighed. \"Come over, because if you thought your wife was big, well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanner nearly dropped the phone as his face lost all color. He opened his rapidly drying mouth. \"I-I-I'll be over s-soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca let out a loud groan as she threw her blanket off. \"Fine! I'll pick up!\" She picked up her buzzing phone and put it up to her ear. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's no way to talk to your employer,\" Antonio said stoically on the other end. \"Unless you no longer wish to work for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, it's fine, I'm sorry,\" Rebecca sighed, wrapping her covers back around her, looking curiously down at her pregnant body as her cover no longer covered as much as it used to. Did she get bigger? \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntonio sighed. \"We had a break-in last night. Wasn't security one of your concerns?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, right...well, what did they take?\" Rebecca said, reaching for some cold pizza near her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, thanks to one of our other researchers. We got lucky, but we can't find him,\" Antonio said. \"I'm at the restaurant now. Come over here now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, yeah,\" Rebecca said, hanging up and looking around for some clothes. After less than a second of searching, Rebecca sniffed the outfit she fell asleep in. \"Good enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the lab hidden in Antonio's restaurant, he admired his device that turned pregnancies into energy. \"Killing two birds with one stone, Mr. Greene?\" Wendy said, hands crossed behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely. We'll get to make sure the laser still works and I'll give Rebecca some much needed punishment,\" Antonio smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And...did you think at all about what I told you?\" Wendy said, putting one hand on top of her soft bulge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntonio stood speechless for a few seconds, gazing at one of his most impressive inventions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's focus on making sure business at the mall runs smoothly today,\" he said. \"No time to discuss...personal matters.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sun rose on another day at St. Paul's hospital. Doctors had just finished life saving surgery on Tyler Cegill, one Joel Sagan was in a coma with what could only be suspected as either an unnatural event, or alcohol poisoning and in the waiting room were 30 pregnant women believing their pregnancies had been alerted some how. And now to cap off this hectic start to the day, leading news reporter Ray Roberts pulls in with his cameras to talk about this \"baby boom\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay strided  through into the waiting room. It was fairly packed. Every woman except for Erin and Lousia was there, trying to book an appointment for their \"sudden burst\". \" come on guys, we have a day of pregnancy to film, let's see if we can handle it better than they do!\" Ray said putting on his fake smile and walking up to the counter. A heavily pregnant Indian woman shot up at the sight on the almost Disney-prince-handsomeness that he bore. \"Oh my god!  IT'S RAY ROBERTS!\" She squeezed in a high pitched tone. Instantly, well, slowly everyone struggled to get up, then waddled over to Ray. Ray could see he large swarm close in on him quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking on his feet he called out \"who wants autographs?\" . Hands shot up in the air. Grabbing one of his many markers from his jacket he started signing peoples belongings until one very attractive cheerleader asked \" could you please kiss my belly instead? I don't know when I would get a chance like this again.\" Ray looked down at her triplet filled belly. \" you're legal right?\" He muttered \" I mean, sure, why not!\" He said getting on his knees and kissing and rubbing the belly. The crowd awed as the lips touched the tanned surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople started showing up revealing their bellies, sending Ray over the edge. Pulling out moistening creme he gave his lips a layer of moisturiser before kissing and signing every, single, belly, there. \" kiss belly, shake hand, kiss belly shake hand, kiss belly, kiss hand, shake belly, shake hand\" he said doing exactly what he was saying. By the end of it, he either shook of kissed everyone's belly. Out of breath he lay on the ground, panting. The camera man looked down and asked him, \" yo mate, do yah still wanna film now? Ooorrr should we uuhhhh, take 5?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing up his hand to signal five, he collapsed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn L ward, Joel lay in his coma as rant patiently waited by his side. When grant had to get a lung transplant, Joel waited with him, night and day, except for uni and work of course. They had been friends longer than when Brandon came to school. This was the second time they faced danger, the first time was when they got in a bar fight with an old bully, Michael and his girlfriend Amy. There was a knock at the door. \" hello?\" Came a feminine voice. \" come in\" said grant, hoping for a sexy nurse to come in. He was wrong. Grace, the lovely woman that gave Brandon her number came inside. Looking at that enormous belly, Grant sighed. \" oh finally, a room without other large bellies.\" Grace said popping herself down on the chair on the other side of the room. \" I mean, you may think I look great with all this\" she motioned to her spectacular face \" but being pregnant is hard work. It's good to not talk about it with someone\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmmm, Grant thought, she is different, \" so, what do you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" men, atleast I would if I had a boyfriend. Haha, I was working here at the hospital as a nurse until my maternity leave started. 8 oh, wait, 9 babies is the real work.\" She said rubbing her massive middle. She didn't know how that extra one didn't make it into there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I see. I am currently studying biology at Whitman University, it's fantastic. My friend Brandon has been there studying engineering, we've had a great holiday but next week it's back to work.\" Grant said, adjusting his glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" you guys go to Whitman?\" Erin said almost jumping out of her chair. \" I have always wanted to go! I actually was going to go there to study psychology until these guys came into the picture\" Erin looked at her belly. How much chaos had it put into her world? Not only pregnant, but octuples!? She let out a defeated sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" what's wrong?\" Grant asked, curious as to what she was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I just want to know why, why all this happened. One stage you are a highly respected nurse that's going to start studying psychology, next thing you are 8 months pregnant with 8, sigh, 9 bastards\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" if only they slept as well as my friend here\" Grant said chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" wait, I know that guy, I bumped into him at the mall. Twice\" Erin pondered as she waddled over to his bed. Hmm, something doesn't seem right.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" what's wrong?\" Grant said scratching his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" his brain is different, look.\" Erin said showing grant an X-ray of his head. A red mark was left in the shape of what  looks like a red fish hook with a bump in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" what the hell is that?\" Grant weirdly asked \" I need to get Joel's parents down here now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver in D ward Tyler was just coming to in front of two pale white orbs. What the hell are they? Tyler thought to him self as he reached for one. \" He's awake!\" Clara yelled as Tyler touched her belly. Shocked his hand flew back and hit him in the eye. \"Ooww... Damn it\" he said as he rubbed his face. His left side was completely patched up, shattered glass tore up his face pretty badly.  Looking down he saw his left let was wrapped up like a mummy and suspended more than Pinocchio. His right arm was out of commission and right foot had bandages on it. His ribs were badly broken, he he lost the big toe on his left foot and broke a finger nail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around he saw his wife and daughter there, upset. What was he thinking, he was going to cheat on his loving wife and daughter and this was the price he was going to pay. He started to tear up. \" honey, I'm so sorry\" Tyler said as he looked into his wife's eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" it's okay, I'm just so glad you are awake\" Clara forgivingly said to her bed ridden husband. This near death experience had made them put things in perspective. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" dad, I'm just so glad you are alive!\" She cried as she threw a hair away from her eyes. The rushed to hug him, but bounced off each other \" OOMPH! Sorry, here you go first mum\" Katherine said as  Clara went to hug him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" oh and some of the people from the country club are coming today to wish you well\" Clara said as she wiped away the tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" well, hopefully this month will be our month to join their family!\" Tyler chuckled as they all tried to hug again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh shoot, I forgot\" Clara said grabbing her phone. \" I need to make a call to one of your employees\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Walking over to the windowsill of her apartment she could see the construction of several sky scrapers. \" huh, why hadn't I seen those before?\" She pondered as she rubbed coconut oil on her bare skin.  Grabbing her tablet she checked her schedule. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to go to the malls sports section to be at some kind of signing midday. Once finished, she needed to go down to the food court to be the celebrity contestant on the pie eating contest. With that over she had to promote one of her many other movies \"the queens hive\". To round off the night she was going to a wet t shirt competition at \"ROGERS\" a bar that hadn't been taken over by Antonio. This was being run by the Alpha Trios at Whitman University. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina loved the shenanigans she got up to whilst studying, so this would be a great way to end her day. A day controlled by that old, weird man. She had enough, calling up her agent  she was starting to get stressed. \" yo, Catty! How are you? Have a good sleep?\" Her agent said eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina's amulet started to burn. \" look I told you not to call me that name, skip the pleasantries, have you found where the DVDs are?\" She sternly told the man on the other line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Yes, I'll need to show you in person though, meet me at Pieces, the cafe near the hospital.\"  Said the agent the happy tones in his voice disappearing faster than you can say alakazm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver in Newton Parade an auction had just started. On sale, lot 34 a strip mall that could fit 10 good businesses, or for someone more daring, could be torn down for their own purposes. There were several people there, ready to purchase the place with a lot of foot traffic, including people who owned the mall, businesses in the area and Katie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe auctioneer started. People were sending their numbers up faster than a coding machine.  The auctioneers voice got faster and faster as the hour went on. Until 3 people remained. Katie looked over to one of the people she was competing against. It was Bill! That man who tried to kidnap him. Shooting up she yelled \" I know you! You tried to kidnap me and my friend!\". Bill was stunned, he had no idea what to do. As quickly as he could he ran for his truck before anyone else could get to him. \" uuhh, okay I guess that leaves two people.\" The auctioneer said as they got down to the nitty gritty. The number soared higher and higher, closer to the 7 figure digits. Katie was sweating, any further and she wouldn't have a business to run. Defeated she dropped her paddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going once\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't beat that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going twice\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sold to the mysterious man in the yellow scarf.\" The auctioneer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone dispersed. Katie was disappointed, talking with Sarah, she was hing to show Dr Schultz something. It was time to look for another property.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man in the yellow scarf tapped on his earpiece \" yeah, Clara? The place is purchased. You guys can start work tomorrow after signing the property\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice was going for her daily run, well more like a jog, okay a walk. As she walked allong the large bridge that ran over Smallton river she decided to take rested her weight against the bench that was there. She looked at the birds flying, the summer wind blowing in from the east and the cars passing by and felt at peace. That's when a she heard it, over the bridge there was a massive protest going on. Waddling over Janice saw the mayor on his podium trying to calm them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" my fellow Smalltonions, please calm down. After the trouble we had in the restaurant district, we have had to make the laws that applied to normal people apply to pregnant people too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice was shocked. How could they do such a thing to these poor defenceless women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What pregnant woman would try to break into anything?\" One man yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" this is madness, you've gone crazy with power!!\" A pregnant woman shouted, fiercely angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bad egg came hurtling through the sky and hit the mayor with exact precision.\" Trying to wipe the rotten yolk from his eye his guards helped him off stage. \" do what you need to do\" he said as he entered town hall.  Policemen gathered around the crowd of men and pregnant  women. \" That's it! You are all under arrest for resisting a government address\" said the captain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" you can't do this, only one person threw something\" Janice said to one of the policemen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" sorry, Captains orders. Now I need you tole your hands in the air madam.\" The police man said, shrugging his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" what's wrong with you men?\" Janice groaned angrily. Men. Men had always been there to ruin everything. First it was her father leaving her mother for some skank, Joel left her after she became pregnant, Antonio at the mall kept raising the rent on her gym and now the mayor was taking away pregnant women's rights? Not anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBring her belly back she thrusted it forwards knocking down the poor police guard. He fell quickly to the ground, thank god he had a helmet on, otherwise he would have had some serious damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe police were shocked, looking at the young fit woman take down a muscle bound police man with a single thrust. \" let, my people GO!\" Janice screamed as she ran at another police Sargent. Men and women dispersed from the scene as the rest of the police troopers arrested Janice. As she hit the ground Janice yelled \" RUN, RUN AND TELL WHAT YOU HEARD HERE, AND TELL THEM ABOUT HOW I JANICE, SET YOU FREE!\" She was knocked out and carried by several men into the police man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Jennifer Armstrong reporting at the scene, a heavily pregnant woman by the name of  Janice fought off the police. Being one of the very few non pregnant women in Smallton, I can only feel compassion for these poor pregnant women. Back to you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley looked at the scene going on from the tv as she got ready for her day, she was eating jam on toast, but can't remember where she placed one of her pieces. \" oh my, I hope they are okay. \" she said as she put on a blazer. Sarah finally made it down stairs, 15 foetuses was incredible, she needed a way to get that energy machine working and her robo-spine ready for her interview with Dr Schultz today. Walking into the kitchen her belly collided with Ashley's sending causing Ash to slip onto her large derri\u00e8re.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap.\" Ashley said as she realised where she landed.  Getting up a piece of jam toast clung to her backside. \" I'm so sorry! Are you okay?\" Sarah panicked as she tried to move her titanic belly away so she could help Ashley up. \"Oh this was my favourite\" Ashley complained as she removed the sticky jam for her backside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing back up stairs she heard the shower running. Thinking it was Brandon she walked into the bedroom and slipped off her skirt. \" oh man, even these?\" She said feeling jam on her knickers. Brandon unbeknownst to all this was still in Ashley's bed. Bending over she took off her colourful undies. As he woke from his slumber he was presented with a fantastic or in his case a shocking sight of his 'mother's' plump, shapely butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was struggling to get her undies off, \" stupid jam\" she muttered to herself. Brandon was fixated on her curvaesious, mouth watering like bum. It was hypnotic, he almost want to grab- no, he couldn't, that's his mum he thought to himself.  Getting her knickers off she bounced over to the cupboard and grabbed another skirt and undies, spinning around she saw Brandon staring with a full blown erection. \" Brandon!\" She squeaked, Tanner and Sarah almost heard her squeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Brandon covered his face in shame, \" mum, I'm so sorry!\" Brandon cried. He ran into his own bedroom embarrassed. Attracted to his own mother, that was sick, disgusting. He threw up in the bin. The phone on his bed buzzed, it was from Clara. &lt;hey. forget everything, you don't have to worry any more, just don't screw my daughter&gt;. Well, at least there was that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley sat down, after putting her undies and skirt on and hung her head in shame. \"I'm going to have to tell him now, high school can wait\". Walking over to Brandon's bedroom, she took a deep breath, then knocked. \" Brandon? Are you okay? Look, I have some news to tell you\"</span></div></div>",

Brandon was partially relieved he wouldn\u2019t be blackmailed into sneaking around to fuck his boss\u2019s wife anymore, but, thanks in part to his current erection, he was partially disappointed to. Since Erin made it clear she didn\u2019t want anything to do with Brandon anymore, he could have had guilt-free sex with Clara. And Kristina too. After all, they were both extremely good-looking women and they were both pregnant. Where else would he find two pregnant women so eager to have sex with him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrandon? Are you okay?\u201d Ashley said on the other side of the door, knocking. Brandon seized up. Bad time to start thinking about pregnancy again. The door opened and in came Ashely\u2019s enormous belly, full and round with 11 babies. Her top didn\u2019t do much to cover it, but just the attempt of her XXXL maternity blouse to make a difference made her whole appearance cuter. After a few seconds of waddling, the rest of Ashley came in, a worried look on her face as she looked Brandon over. Her radiant brown hair was tossed messily around her. \u201cI have some news to tell you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon felt his face get redder and redder as the women he only knew as his mother struggled her way across his bedroom to sit beside him, the bed creaking under her. She was centimeters away from him, her belly and breasts still jiggling as she sat down. Ashley\u2019s piercing eyes were looking over Brandon and her full lips were already mid-pout as she searched for the words. Brandon knew if he didn\u2019t blurt something out now, he\u2019d \u201cblurt out\u201d from another part of his body. \u201cM-Mom, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry?\u201d Ashley said with surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019ve just had a lot of crazy things going on. Erin dumped me last night, works been hectic, and m-my dreams have been so\u2026confusing and vivid, so when you saw me, I\u2026\u201d Brandon looked down in shame. \u201cL-like I said; things have been crazy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley put her hand on Brandon\u2019s cheek and patted it gently. \u201cI\u2019m not upset with you, honey. And I\u2019m sorry things didn\u2019t work out between you and Erin.\u201d She held back before adding a nice <i>I told you so</i> in, choosing instead to lean in and give him a peck on the corners of his lips. When she withdrew, Ashley took a deep breath, wrapping both hands around her belly. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I wanted to talk to you about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon looked at his mother, too stunned to respond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrandon\u2026sweetie\u2026your father and I love you, and we\u2019d meant to tell you sooner, but\u2026\u201d Ashley looked down at her belly. \u201cBrandon, this is only my second pregnancy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what do you mean?\u201d Brandon said, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour\u2026your mother and I were very good friends and when she and her husband got into a car accident and died\u2026you were just a baby. I promised I\u2019d take care of you and...\u201d Ashley let out another long sigh and ran her hands through Brandon\u2019s hair. \u201cAnd I hope I have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-of course you have, M-mom,\u201d Brandon said. He was stunned. He\u2019d gone through 20+ years of life without ever knowing he was adopted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley sighed and smiled. \u201cThen I\u2019ve done my job. You\u2019re an adult now and you deserve the truth. I\u2019ll always love you and\u2026\u201d Ashley felt her own face start to turn red now too. The lust in her amulet was burning up and, now that it was out in the open that nothing between them was\u2026the \u201ci-word,\u201d every cell of her body wanted to jump Brandon. Ever since she became pregnant, she\u2019d felt something drawing her toward Brandon and it had only gotten stronger in the past few days. \u201cAnd\u2026if you\u2019d like, you can just call me Ashley from now on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Brandon gulped, looking the pregnant woman he once knew as his mother over. \u201cA-Ashley.\u201d Just saying her name made him quiver. If she wasn\u2019t his biological mother, then\u2026the way he\u2019d been thinking and feeling about her wasn\u2019t weird. Same for Sarah. \u201cDoes Sarah know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley nodded. \u201cShe only found out recently too. I\u2019d love to talk more about this with you, honey,\u201d she said, heaving herself off of Brandon\u2019s bed. As she groaned, Brandon put his hand on her arm to push her more. When that wasn\u2019t doing the trick, he pushed on her hip as much as he could, getting contact with her tight rear. \u201cOof, thank you,\u201d Ashley said when she was upright. \u201cBut like I was saying: I\u2019d love to talk more, but I have to go\u2026I\u2019ve got work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWork?\u201d Brandon asked, but Ashley just grinned and waddled out the door, letting Brandon watch her big ass shake as she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack downstairs, Sarah was still eating breakfast, giving up on trying to fasten the buttons on her blazer. Hopefully Katie would have something new for her. Ashley sighed and fluffed her hair out, checking herself in the mirror. \u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told Brandon,\u201d Ashley sighed. \u201cHe knows he\u2019s adopted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least I found out before him,\u201d Sarah said, looking up the stairs. With 15 babies in her womb, her envy was incredibly strong and any little victory over\u2026well, anyone felt good. And since she was outsizing Ashley in the belly department, her self-confidence was at new heights. \u201cSo you\u2019re really doing this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re expecting 15 babies, you bet,\u201d Ashley said, trying to stretch her blouse down her belly another extra inch, revealing two more inches of her cleavage in the process. \u201cI\u2019ll see you this afternoon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee you,\u201d Sarah said, puffing out her own chest, both with confidence and to compete with her bosomy mother. \u201cWhen you come back, you\u2019ll be seeing a newly funded and active PregTech CEO.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley smiled, happy for her daughter, and headed out the door. Before she took maternity leave, Ashley was a high school teacher who was well liked among her students. Now that she was eight months pregnant, and with 10 (now 11) babies, the school naturally wanted her to stay away. As healthy as she told the other teachers she was, the other faculty and were skeptical, assuming that if Ashley so much as sneezed, she\u2019d go into labor and squeeze out nearly a dozen babies right on school property.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with the recent rash of pregnancies around the city, thanks to the amulets and Yaral in Joel\u2019s body, most of the school\u2019s teachers were hugely pregnant and the school system couldn\u2019t afford maternity leave anymore. Ashley was called back, at least until she was a week or two away from birth. Ashley stood on the street corner, a few confused students looking at her and her belly. She couldn\u2019t exactly fit into a car anymore and even if she could, she wouldn\u2019t ask her husband for a ride to work. Ashley had to ride the school bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was trembling, her fist inches away from Brandon\u2019s door. Now that he knew they weren\u2019t biologically brother-and-sister, Sarah thought he\u2019d be less hesitant to give her a belly rub. With 15 babies in there now, she needed it. And maybe, they could go a little further. Brandon may be a dweeb, but no one had been more caring to her during her pregnancy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Sarah was about to bring her hand against the door, it flew open and Brandon hurried out, bumping against his sister\u2019s huge belly. \u201cWhoa!\u201d Brandon cried out, stopping in his tracks to look at her incredible size in awe. \u201cS-Sarah! You\u2019re\u2026you\u2019re\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBigger, I know,\u201d Sarah sighed, rolling her eyes. \u201cThere are some pregnancy experiments around the city that I can\u2019t get into now, but\u2026we\u2019re all bigger,\u201d she said, patting her roundness. \u201cI already explained it all to Mom.\u201d Sarah stopped and sighed. \u201cI mean\u2026you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Brandon said, forcing a calm smile. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I guess it makes sense. You and Ashley look so much alike and I\u2019m so unlike either of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cL-look, Brandon,\u201d Sarah said, her face turning a little red as she turned away. \u201cIf you ever want to talk about this more\u2026y-you know where to find me. Okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Brandon nodded, gulping as he looked Sarah over. A pregnant belly even bigger than Ashley\u2019s. He couldn\u2019t believe he was actually thinking about who he was more attracted to: Sarah or Ashley. This news would take some getting used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that that\u2019s out of the way, why were you in such a rush?\u201d Sarah said, rubbing as much of her belly as she could. \u201cI\u2019ve got a sore belly I can\u2019t reach now thanks to you running into me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry! I got a text and I have to be at work today!\u201d Brandon said. \u201cI was told there was big news!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMind driving me?\u201d Sarah asked. \u201cI mean\u2026I\u2019ll have to put down some seats, but I can fit in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon checked his phone. \u201cThe mall, right? You go there more than teenage girls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah rolled her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve got business there, weirdo. And it\u2019s on the way. Just let me grab some things and we can go.\u201d Grabbing two armfuls of gear and electronics, Sarah bustled down the stairs, feeling Brandon\u2019s hand on her back and arms to support her. \u201cT-thanks,\u201d she mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnytime,\u201d Brandon said back, both of their faces burning. \u201cDad\u2019s car is already gone. Wonder where he is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith his girlfriend, probably,\u201d Sarah grumbled as she struggled to bend over and put Brandon\u2019s seats down. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky you\u2019re not a Page, Brandon. Dad got Mom knocked up and cheated on her. My baby daddy ditched me. The men in our family are a bad bunch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-hope you and Ashley raise your sons right, then,\u201d Brandon chuckled, getting into the driver\u2019s seat and powering the car up. \u201cReady?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs I\u2019ll ever be,\u201d Sarah sighed. No matter how far back she could lean, her belly stuck out between the driver and passenger\u2019s seat, right next to Brandon. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Catalina rested one hand on her chin while the other one stroked her bare belly. She\u2019d thought about covering it up, but after rubbing oil and cocoa butter all over her dark brown skin, it looked so good she couldn\u2019t bear to hide it. Instead, Catalina had on a thin tank top that managed to hold her breasts in while showing plenty of sideboob, and if you were close enough, nipples too. Catalina never wanted to pose nude for money again, but that didn\u2019t mean she was against being a little flirty with her body. Especially if it meant getting attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sweaty agent plopped down across from her at the table, handing Catalina a smoothie and a plate of sandwiches. \u201cT-these are the ones you like, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019ll do, Maurice,\u201d Catalina sighed, eating with gusto. \u201cWhat did you find out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHis name is Grant,\u201d Maurice said, sliding Catalina a security photo. \u201cStocky, bearded. I also managed to get some of his past purchases at the store. He\u2019s a typical nerd.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike you,\u201d Catalina said with a tiny grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother bead of sweat. \u201cI-if you say so.\u201d Since her pride amulet, Catalina had become much more demanding on her agent and Maurice folded under pressure easily. \u201cBut here\u2019s what you\u2019ll really like: I had some paparazzi around town look for him and guess where he is now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina rolled her eyes. \u201cA comic book store? How should I know what nerds do? Just because they buy my tickets doesn\u2019t mean I understand them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s in the hospital,\u201d Maurice said, pointing his thumb at the nearby building. \u201cICU.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina took a big slurp of her smoothie, finishing the drink in one big suck. \u201cHow did you manage all this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI may have promised the store clerk some autographed Catalina Corazon movies and promised the paparazzi you\u2019d cause some drama on the streets tomorrow,\u201d Maurice said, tugging at his collar. \u201cM-maybe a nip-slip.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina grabbed her agent by the tie and pulled him close. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t find me those DVDs, I\u2019d have Antonio himself throw you off a balcony,\u201d she growled. \u201cSee you later, Maurice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cG-goodbye,\u201d Maurice nodded as Catalina pushed away from her table and waddled toward the hospital. <i>Grant, whoever you are, you\u2019re in for a surprise</i>, Catalina smiled. <i>I\u2019m getting those DVDs and we can do it the easy way or the fun way</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maternity store was packed as women of various sizes saw what fit their new bellies and busts, thanks to the swelling last night. Katie was waddling around, admiring business as much as she admired her pregnant customers. Still, no one held a flame to Ashley. To think: now Katie was the bigger one of the two. \u201cThis amulet is definitely not boring,\u201d she sighed, looking up to see Sarah waddle through the crowd, looking nearly as radiant as her mother. \u201cLaura, keep an eye on things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes ma\u2019am,\u201d Laura, the store\u2019s old owner said. She was still afraid of what Rebecca would do to her if she didn\u2019t let Katie be in full control of the store. Plus, profits were up many times over since Katie took over. Who knew that mousey girl was such a saavy businesswoman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat can I do for you, Ms. Page?\u201d Katie grinned, rubbing her belly slowly. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be getting ready for your investment meeting today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need an outfit that actually fits,\u201d Sarah said, motioning to her mostly exposed belly. \u201cThe last time I had one of these meetings, being half-naked and pregnant really sank my boat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie stroked her belly in thought. <i>She rocks the sexy pregnant businesswoman look a lot better than I expected\u2026this could be a new style</i>. Shaking her head to return to the real world, Katie waddled over to a rack in the back. \u201cI ordered these in today. They\u2019re just plain white button-up shirts, but they should fit you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs quick as always,\u201d Sarah said, feeling the material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot quick enough. I got beat at an auction for some great new property,\u201d Katie fumed. \u201cPregTech would be in the clear if I\u2019d gotten that. Instead, we\u2019ll be battling Antonio on his own terf.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can beat him,\u201d Sarah smiled, holding up her equipment. \u201cI got a pretty good look at the energy device last night. I can design most of it if you let me work in the back, except I really need someone it\u2019s been tested on to compare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA test subject, huh?\u201d Katie said. \u201cThat\u2019s a tough one. Only one of those things exist in the world and the guy who uses it probably won\u2019t share it with us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca struggled for a few milliseconds before giving up. Antonio\u2019s constraints weren\u2019t that bad, but she got bored. \u201cYou sure about this, Antonio?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPositive,\u201d he smiled, angling the laser at Rebecca, her clothes opened up to reveal her pale pregnant belly. \u201cYou need to learn what happens when you disappoint me and this ought to give you an extra kick to do your job too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Rebecca shrugged. \u201cNot much I can do right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntonio knew that wasn\u2019t right. In fact, she was one of the few women in the world he actually feared. With her training, Rebecca on a normal day could break out of her confinement and break his neck in seconds. But with the sloth amulet, that wasn\u2019t likely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis won\u2019t be as strong as the first test, since we don\u2019t have as many amulets here,\u201d Antonio said. \u201cBut I think the results should still be what we desire.\u201d He flipped the switch and a blue beam shot into Rebecca\u2019s bloated belly, causing it to swell slightly as Rebecca cried out in ecstasy and passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen you wake up, pay our businesswoman friend a visit,\u201d Antonio whispered in Rebecca\u2019s ear as he walked away, ordering Wendy to untie her. He didn\u2019t want to spend any more time with her than he needed to. In truth, while Antonio found pregnant women a good source of revenue and marketing, he was disgusted by them. He found them fat, obnoxious, complaining, and thinking about a baby or multiple ones growing and squirming around inside them made him nauseous. Well, it wasn\u2019t like Rebecca had any kicking fetuses inside her anymore. For the next few hours, her womb was pure energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow is this possible?\u201d Tanner said, hands in his head. Kim smiled and ran her hands over her belly, pretending to be happy to be pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow? Look at your wife and daughter, stud. Super-fertility runs in the family,\u201d Kim chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026I just saw you yesterday and you had abs,\u201d Tanner yelled. \u201cYou can\u2019t just be full-term with octuplets now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore like nine now,\u201d Kim sighed, looking back down at her tan orb. \u201cFeels like more, at least.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNine, whatever!\u201d Tanner yelled, standing up. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it really so crazy?\u201d Kim said. \u201cI mean, think back. I remember seeing your wife and it felt like one day, boom, she\u2019s a whale.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe veins on Tanner\u2019s forehead throbbed. Reality had been rewritten, sure, but there weren\u2019t many details added. He couldn\u2019t honestly say he remembered seeing Ashley\u2019s belly grow over time to its current titanic proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-still, how do I know it\u2019s\u2026they\u2019re mine? I know I\u2019m not the only guy you sleep with,\u201d Tanner said, a cruel little grin on his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t, you\u2019re right,\u201d Kim said, batting her eyelashes at him. \u201cBut you\u2019re the only one manly enough to make me <u>this</u> big.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, please,\u201d Tanner groaned. \u201cThis is no time for games.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll go visit your wife and tell her that it\u2019s just a possibility that I\u2019m carrying your kids,\u201d Kim purred. \u201cAnd if it turns out they\u2019re not yours, no harm, no foul.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanner bit his tongue. Ashley knowing about his affair was one thing. Finding out that Kim might be pregnant with nine of his babies was another. \u201cAlright, alright. What do you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo be supported,\u201d Kim smiled. \u201cThese little ones are going to need a home once they\u2019re out of mine. And medicine. And food. And clothes. And college.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll\u2026talk about it,\u201d Tanner said. \u201cOkay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Kim grinned. \u201cNow then, I didn\u2019t realize being pregnant made me so horny. Come here,\u201d she said, opening her arms wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanner scoffed. \u201cAre you crazy? I\u2019m not having sex with a pregnant woman.\u201d With that, he left, slamming the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh,\u201d Kim said, tapping her fingertips on her belly. \u201cNever thought I would get turned down for sex. Being pregnant has more downsides than I thought.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Joel still laid there, like a log on a river, unmoving despite the chaos that had happened around him. Grace and Grant were still trying to decipher what on earth is wrong with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" it's not a tumor\" Grace said looking through her findings. Grant chuckled at her comment. She looked at Grant quizzically \" what's funny?\" .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IT'S NOTTA TUUMMUUORR\" Grant blurted out loud in his best Arnold Schwarzenegger impression. Grace laughed, looking at him with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" stop it, you're distracting me\" she said playfully. Something that the two people didn't notice was that from behind them a somewhat invisible spirit had floated up behind them. It was similar to Yarals, but bared the figure of a woman. Lania, Yaral's brother was awoken last night after Erin slapped Brandon's amulet from his hand. She had explored the city, looking at all the mayhem in the town. Recently she felt a familiar presence and came to the hospital to inspect it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I mean, it looks like the work of some wizard or whatever!\" Grant said looking at the X-ray again. It looks like flames were escaping this weird wound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina walked up to Joel's room, quietly she opened the door. \" is there anyone by the name of Grant here?\" Catalina asked slyly. Grant turned around and saw Catalina with her large almond skinned belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I am sorry madam but we are trying to solve a mystery here\" Grant said shooing her out of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" bu-bu-but do you know who I am?\" Catalina stammered, confused by what's happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" yes, pregnant, and I assure you, the maternity ward is in the next building, good day!\" Grant said closing the door behind her. Catalina was furious! No one ever treated her that way before. But it was also, different. She went to bang on the door, but stopped. She was better than this, she needed to plan how to get the DVDs from that ewok with glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Lania saw the mark that the Yaral left on his brain. In one quick motion she flew into and out of Joel's head, removing the mark. With her work done she let Joel rest and flew out the window without anyone noticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Grace rubbed her belly as she looked at the short hairy man. \" you don't like pregnant women, do you?\" She said, walking over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" what do you mean? How can someone hate something like that?\" He said looking to the ceiling. Grace's belly was really close now, it was getting weird for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I understand if you don't like it, it's just a big amount of flesh.\" Grace said rolling up her shirt. \" but wait isn't that what breasts are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" it's not like that!\" Grant said obtusely, dodging around Grace and her wide, pale belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" haha! You DO hate bellies!\" Grace said laughing at Grant's awkwardness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright. I do. How could you tell?\" Grant sighed in defeat. He collapsed in the chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the first sign was how you looked at me when I looked in.\" Grace said in her best sherlockian impression. \" the second was how you have steered clear from my belly, hell you don't even want to look at it.\" She rubbed her belly, soothing the kicks inside of her. \" my final deduction was when the very famous 'Catalina' Coraza- Cozza- whatever, the famous 'Catalina' came in and you instantly pushed her massive pregnant belly out of there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" are you sure you are a nurse? Maybe you should have been a detective\" Grant said, looking up at Grace who was looking smug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin waddled into the mall, she needed to do something whilst her mother took Brody to reading class. She was bored, upset, but bored. Looking over at the newspaper agency she saw most of the 'planned parenthood' and 'pregnancy' magazines were gone. The sports section was filled however. Picking up one of the golfing magazines she started reading some tips to pick up her game. Her game was pretty good. Actually it was really good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPurchasing the magazine she took he elevator upstairs she saw the cinemas were out with a bunch of films out. Surprisingly they were all pregnancy related. There was a double \"viewing for two\" feature on in ten minutes, first up was a sports movie called \" hole in one for a game for two\" starring Catalina Corazon, followed up by \"Heads or Tails: The tale of Jack Jr and his magical coin\". Grabbing literally everything from the lobby she brought her trolley sized amount of snacks to the double feature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLania flew through the sky observing the chaos happening below her. She knew who did this, her brother Yaral has ruined many cities in his chaotic reign over the amulets, now it was time for Lania to bring in some order. She just needed to hone in one Yaral's signal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlying down through the city she could see women days away from labour, going about their lives. She noticed a bus struggling to travel with its added weight. Flying in she needed to find a way to alleviate the weight before the bus broke down, adding extra chaos into the cities lives. Noticing a 22 and a 50 year old women sitting together, each pregnant with twins, she thought fast. Using her time/pregnant abilities, she teleported the 4 babies into her own stomach whilst rewriting time to seem as if they weren't pregnant at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she needed to get rid of these babies before they became a permanent fixture to herself. Flying slightly slower she came across one of the ladies from the country club, Barbara. Focusing in on her belly, she added the extra babies to her uterus, giving her a grand total of 6. Rewriting history she watched as Barbara continued wig her day like nothing happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at what she was doing, she realised it was only a start. She needed to take control of someone who has been causing a lot of chaos in the city...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYaral saw the blue spirit honing in on the mall. He was still sick, from infecting Joel, that young mans body was too strong to control. He realised he needed another body, something weaker, but had a mind that could work with him. Someone like Antonio... That's when it dawned on him. Lania was honing in on him to eliminate his chaotic ways. He needed to do something, and quick. He bolted for the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlying through the mall he couldn't find him anywhere. The shops, his headquarters and his laboratory didn't have him. His panicking increased until he felt a disruption in the energy waves. He flew to the disturbance. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rebecca awoke in her chair remembering her bosses orders. Thinking like the agent she was she picked up her phone and dialled 911. \"Yes, I thought you should know there is an disturbance at the mall, you may need a van to bustle these criminals under your new laws.\" She had read a day before that this was being planned, she had her own plans too, and she would need the polices help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaping out of the chair she dashed outside. She saw the distance to the mall was littered with homeless people, she needed to get up somewhere she wouldn't have to deal with them. The machine's laser had reunited Rebecca with her strength, motivation and agility. Seeing the narrow ladder up to the roof she realised there would only be one other way up. Grabbing onto a pole she swung up two floors, balanced over a railing and jumped onto a drain pipe that bent under her weight. As the metal pipe bent over Rebecca used the motion to get her to the other side of the alley way to scale the building to the rooftops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the sun shining from behind the clouds she smiled as she jumped, cartwheeled, ran and bounced to the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie was selling so much maternity wear she was down to her emergence stock. Sarah worked in the room behind trying to recalibrate the robo spine and some other pregnancy equipment like 'the pregkent' a sheet with built in microfibres made to calm the baby and stop it from kicking whilst the mother sleeps and 'nause-gone' a head massager that stops headaches, relaxes the stress levels and boosts brain activity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was getting incredibly sweaty, she had taken her clothes off and was now only working in a singlet and undies. Sarah was coated in sweat, dirt and grease, she was working against time now. She had finished everything else and now her 'piece to a resistance' was her robo-spine was the only thing left. She also had to battle against the weight of her gargantuan belly which took up a lot of room.  Reattaching some materials the robo-spine was active again with a low hum. Attaching it to her back it finished loading and was as silent as a mouse.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie came in and saw Sarah hard at work. Katie looked at Sarah in the dim light, the sweat glistened her incredible cleavage in the light, the singlet she was wearing barely covered her belly, that fantastic, eye popping belly of hers. It was so perfect, fantastically round and oh so plump. A slight oil stain appeared on her upper thigh as she turned around to reveal an amazing, mouth watering backside. It swayed as she tested her robo-spine, it worked perfectly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around she saw those juicy lips of hers moved hypnotically, looking like they were saying \"Katie..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Was all Katie could say as Sarah walked up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I said are you okay?\" Sarah asked, as her huge belly rubbed up against Katie's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" oh, I uhhh, I'm fine? Everything is sold, and literally have nothing else to sell for the day, how are you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I'm okay, I'm ready now, I was going to go to the gym to. wash off, oh my god!\" Sarah yelped as she got down on her knees. She realised she left a smudge on Katie's clothes. Well with this size it was easier for her to just roll onto her belly. Wiping the smudge off of Katie's work shirt Katie cooed at getting her belly rubbed. Sarah noticed this and decided to rub her belly more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie was on the tip of heaven. She started remembering what happened last night. She just had to have more. Bringing Sarah back up she leant in for a kiss. Sarah looked down at the short brunette. This was it, she was finally going to get what she wanted for the past nine months. Leaning in her lips were a rabbits hair apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRASH!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katie! We, oh I'm sorry, we have an emergency out here \" Laura called from the door. Sarah and Katie both sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" to be continued\" Katie said as she waddled out into the store front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca triumphantly stood above a broken mannequin. \" oh I'm sorry\" Rebecca smugly stated as she motioned towards Katie. \" I have been told by the head office that this place is been taken down, today. You have 5 minutes to grab your things and go\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie was stunned out of her life. Another set back today? She couldn't stand for it. \" and what if I refuse?\" Katie stammered out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" oh you really don't want that, right Laura?\" Rebecca said revealing Laura with her arm twisted around her back. She was scared out of her wits, Rebecca laughed at her pleas to let her go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" let her go!\" Katie shouted. Rebecca dropped Laura's hand, said \"boo\" and Laura scampered away. \" well <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash Rebecca ran straight to Katie, pinning her to the ground. Sarah saw from the window what was going on and sent a text to Brandon. &lt;remember Katie's store? I need you to come by quickly and pick up some stuff from behind the store in a green box, please hurry.&gt; detaching the spine she placed her 6 inventions in the large green box, then putting on some maternity shorts she went to confront Rebecca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh look, another hen wants to join the coop\" Rebecca said smirking at Sarah's size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" what?\" Was all Sarah could say about the strange comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" you know, coop, where chickens go in, and you're a hen Bec- forget it. You two are trespassing on mall property, you both are under arrest.\" Rebecca said, a tiny bit of slothness coming back in.  Katie struggled but could do nothing as Rebecca stood on top of her hands behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" you can't arrest a pregnant woman!\" Katie cried out, struggling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" true, I can't. However these bad boys can, come in big boys!\" Rebecca called out to the police out the front of the mall.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah flustered as the cops swarmed into Katie's maternity store. Every pregnant woman was being dragged out, either in handcuffs or with two burly arms wrapped around them. Sarah turned back to Rebecca and saw her content smirk fade into a look of exhaustion and boredom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me Ms...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quo, but just call me Rebecca,\" Rebecca yawned, resting one hand on her belly for a second before a spark of energy made her arm jolt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rebecca,\" Sarah said, waddling closer to Antonio's top agent. \"How about I show you a recent invention of mine for mothers-to-be like yourself who need a good bit of rest and relaxation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R&amp;R, huh?\" Rebecca said, raising an eyebrow. Antonio's notes said this one was a talented inventor and she was feeling awfully tired lately. \"Like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does a non-invasive massage and no kicking babies waking you up sound?\" Sarah gulped as two police officers stormed over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you cow, come with us,\" one of them growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, wait,\" Rebecca said, holding up one hand. \"Let her stay. I want to talk with PregTech employees.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So should I let this one go too?\" another officer said, currently cuffing Katie's hands behind her. Sarah looked at Katie and opened her mouth, then paused. Her envy was building up again and she thought about Katie having sex with Ashley and getting all the attention with PregTech. Why should she get all the credit and all the fun while pregnant?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know her,\" Sarah said, turning back to Rebecca. \"Take her away if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie barked out some muffled protests but Sarah was already leading Rebecca to the back of the store, where she got out her pregkent and nause-gone, putting them both on Rebecca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this <u>is</u> nice,\" Rebecca sighed, closing her eyes and lying back in a seat in the storage room. Sarah let out a relieved gasp and looked over the small but strong woman Antonio had sent after them. Where did she get all her power and mobility from? Curious, Sarah reached a hand out and placed it on Rebecca's belly. A small zap made Sarah take her hand off and a light bulb went off in her brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is the same thing that happened to me</i>! Sarah realized, digging through her box for the prototype pregnancy-energy machine. <i>If I run a few tests on her belly, I'll be able to complete this</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, Sarah had monitors stuck all over Rebecca's belly and was studying the readings carefully while taking notes with one hand and rubbing her own belly with the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything alright out there?\" Rebecca mumbled. \"It sounds a little loud and weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, let me fix that,\" Sarah said, turning up the levels on her nause-gone. \"This is just a prototype. The next version will have some headphones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea,\" Rebecca replied as she drifted back to sleep, bare belly on display for Sarah to research.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim was looking at her sixth outfit choice so far, turning around to see how every angle looked in her full-body mirror. Luckily for her, she'd sprung for a large model early on so her entire nine-baby body could fit in the frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The ass looks better in this one,\" she sighed before turning back to face her reflection, placing both hands on her belly. The fabric did nothing to conceal her enormous fake-tan-orange ball of babies. \"But the bulge doesn't look good in this one.\" Kim sighed and stripped off the top, stopping to look down at her cleavage. \"At least this bra is holding up,\" she said, cupping her breasts. \"Best gag gift ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kim undid the straps on her tight pants and slid them off, Lania's disembodied spirit hovered around her apartment. \"I'm getting too weak,\" Lania moaned softly. \"I knew I wouldn't be able to stay in this world for too long. I need a body to stay here for a day. If I'm out, there must be trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassing into the room, Lania could feel Kim's maternal energy. There were many, many pregnant women in the vicinity, but Kim was the only one giving off a very familiar signature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yaral was here,\" she scowled. \"Somehow, he's responsible for her pregnancy more than usual. She's the best bet for me to stay on Earth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe if I went with black,\" Kim pouted, turning her underwear-clad pregnant body to the side as Lania passed through her body and entered her. Kim let out a small yelp and her head bent back. Her hands clutched her huge belly tightly before she relaxed and leaned back down. \"Good, it worked. Now I just need to find the master amulet,\" Kim said in a much calmer, less whiny voice as she headed for the door, still clothed only in her bra and underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus ride to the high school was slow since the district's buses hadn't been upgraded to carry so much extra weight yet. About 3/4 of the women on the bus were pregnant and with several children. Ashley alone was responsible for plenty of drag, with her 11-baby belly and pronounced ass putting a deep dent in the long seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you rub her belly and make a wish?\" the boys in the seat across from Ashley sneered and laughed. Their comments weren't directed at Ashley: sitting next to her was Abby, one of the least popular people in the school. She was a senior with short, straight black hair that obscured a surprisingly cute face. Abby had little in the way of curves and she was one of the students not made pregnant by the events of the past few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, wish that some of her roundness would make its way to you,\" a girl behind the boys laughed, rubbing her own wide belly. \"You'd think you'd get something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby just hunched down even more, biting her lip. Ashley glared at the students but didn't say anything. Abby reminded her of Sarah. While later in life, Sarah's looks began to take after her mother's, Sarah was always a quiet, odd girl with no friends. Ashley placed her hand on Abby's back and rubbed it softly. \"Don't listen to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need pity,\" Abby muttered. \"Especially from one of the teachers here. They give me just as bad a time as the kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't remember me?\" Ashley smiled, patting Abby on the shoulder. Abby scoffed and looked up at Ashley's face, her jaw dropping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mrs. Page?\" Abby said, looking at her in awe. \"You're...I mean, you were big in class, but now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They gave me maternity leave pretty early on,\" Ashley smiled, patting her enormous belly. She barely fit in the bus seats with her maternal size. \"And there was a bit of a...mishap in the city yesterday that added another one in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I noticed,\" Abby said, looking around at all the twin and triplet bellies now on the bus that were one baby and twin bellies yesterday. \"Sorry I snapped at you,\" she said, running her hands through her hair. \"You were always...nice to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Abby parted her hair, Ashley got a good look at Abby's face and bit her lip. The lust in her amulet was building up again and she wanted Abby. She already cheated on her husband while pregnant, then flirted with her adopted son. Would she tempt fate with one of her high school students now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're nice too,\" Ashley smiled, leaning in for a quick kiss on the lips. She smiled at Abby's shocked face. \"Very nice.\" The bus began to slow down as it stopped in front of the high school and Ashley heaved herself up, pressing her belly against Abby. \"Hope to see you in class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you too,\" Abby said, eyes wide and fixed on Ashley. Ashley chuckled as she got off the bus slowly. She had some self-control when it was just 10 babies, but with her lust multiplied 11 times, it was too much for her. She was going to have fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Brandon!\" Clara smiled, sitting behind her husband's desk. \"So good to see you again. You're handsome as always.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you weren't going to do this anymore,\" Brandon grumbled, standing by the chair with his arms crossed. The desk was covering Clara's belly so his libido was calmed. Slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not,\" she chuckled, taking out some paperwork. \"At least, not yet. Tyler might go back to his old ways. Who knows?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he going to be okay?\" Brandon gulped. He might not like his boss, but he didn't want him to die in a car accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll be fine,\" Clara said, pushing some documents forward. \"But while he's out of commission, I'm in charge of the company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you're in charge?\" Brandon stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did a lot of things behind his back,\" Clara sighed. \"This company would be a loose piece of paper in the back of some bank cabinet if it weren't for me. But times now are tougher than ever. This baby boom is doing a number on us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm fired?\" Brandon asked. Clara let out another chuckle. Brandon didn't like the sound of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I...like having you around,\" Clara nodded. \"It's nice knowing there's someone here who thinks I'm sexy besides me. No, what I have there are a few  investment opportunities I'm looking into to keep us afloat. I need you to pick one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a little...beyond my usual duties,\" Brandon said, his voice trailing off as Clara stood, resting a hand on her belly. \"B-but I'll get right on it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon left the office and saw Kristina prowling toward him on one end of the hall. Panicking, he ran for the stairs and left the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope Clara will be a better boss than Tyler and let me look over these at the coffee shop,\" Brandon gasped, images of Ashley flashing into his head. \"I need a break from bellies for the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, I was right,\" Kim said, making Brandon turn around in surprise. His legs nearly buckled and gave out when he saw her pregnant hugeness in nothing but underwear. \"I need to talk to you.\"</span></div></div>",

Modesty should have wained since I was around and I have seen other expectant women in similar states of undress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe that's true,\" Brandon said, wondering where all these half-naked pregnant women are, \"but you're a little...bigger than most pregnant women and you're a hell of a lot better looking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting,\" Kim said, drinking her glass of water. \"Well, now that we are comfortable, I can begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-begin?\" Brandon said, hand shaking as he drank his coffee. \"You help my dad cheat on my mom while she's pregnant, insult me at the mall before I try and hook you up with my boss, show up colossally pregnant, and then you just drag me off the street saying you want to talk? What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should explain,\" Kim said. \"I am not...this woman, whoever she is. I'm only using her body as a host.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A...host?\" Brandon said. Dozens of fantasy and sci-fi movies flashed through his head. \"You're possessing her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's a good way to put it,\" Kim smiled. \"I'm a projection, a spirit of Lania, a sorceress from over a millennia ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon was listening as best he could. Now that he knew this wasn't <i>really</i> Kim, he felt less guilty about staring at her chest and belly. \"Uh huh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To summarize, I was the daughter of a powerful royal family, but I was born with a demonic spirit inside me. I was taken to another sorceress who expelled the demon from me, but it impregnated her instead, and in seconds, she gave birth to a baby the same age as me, only he was covered in bizarre discolorations on his skin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he...also a spirit floating around possessing people?\" Brandon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I will get to that soon. We were raised like brother and sister by the royal family, but my brother was clearly intent on evil. He was obsessed with creating chaos and when he was older and left home, I learned he took up sorcery as well. I followed him and learned some of his same tricks, and on the way, I learned who my brother really was: Yaral.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yaral,\" Brandon repeated. \"Should I know who that is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His name is recorded throughout history: a malevolent spirit that causes and feeds off of chaos. He particularly likes to do it through the creation of sudden, unexplainable pregnancies,\" Kim said, leaning in closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon gulped. \"So the amulets...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am getting to that,\" Kim said, shaking her head. \"Humans are much more impatient in your time. Yaral has existed for thousands of years, but he thought that by taking human form, he could become stronger. As my brother, he had all the power he needed to create some of his strongest tools for chaos: the amulets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon heard a strong bolt of dramatic thunder, but it turns out it was only some silverware being dropped on the floor as two pregnant waiters bumped bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fool that I was, I actually used my magic to help him build the first one. He told me it was a Preg-Transferer to help women who can't have children and I thought my brother was becoming more noble. When I realized how dangerous it truly was, I sent it away and created instructions to go along with it. Yaral then left and created seven more amulets, but I know little about those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're out there, alright,\" Brandon gulped. \"So...that booklet with the amulet was real?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it was real,\" Kim said, raising an eyebrow. \"You did...read it, right?\" Brandon gulped and Kim smacked her forehead. \"Humans...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So all the pregnancies around the city...even Sarah and my mo...Ashley?\" Brandon said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, if you'd read the instructions, you would have known how to make the reality shift not affect you,\" Kim said, rubbing the side of her huge belly, bumping up against the table a few times. \"But now you have that power. Almost everyone you've met who is pregnant was either made that way by the amulets or by my brother directly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Directly?\" Brandon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He possessed someone too,\" Kim said, looking out at the street. \"I could sense it. The real Lania left a piece of her soul in the master amulet when she cast it away, so if she ever needed to help out, I could come in her place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where's the real Lania?\" Brandon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unlike my brother, I am mortal,\" Kim sighed. \"I died many years ago, and somewhat strangely, I was only pregnant once with one child.\" She looked into the air. \"I can sense my descendent in this city somewhere...two of them, actually. A mother and daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Don't tell me</i> Brandon panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting a family name too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh no</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Page. Is that familiar to you?\" Kim asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, easy!\" Katie said as the police pushed her into the holding cell. She turned around and saw that she was being pushed into a wall of big, round, and often bare pregnant bellies. \"Actually...go ahead and push me in a little deeper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet down,\" the police lieutenant barked. \"You crazy women...you're pregnant! You should be at home with your husbands, cooking dinner, knitting little sweaters for your babies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some of us don't exactly have husbands,\" Katie grinned. \"Or, in some of our cases, wives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Disgusting,\" the lieutenant said, shaking his head and walking away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katie?\" a voice said. Katie was short even before her belly weighed her down and she could only see something coming through the bellies. \"Out of my way. Out of my way! I said out of my way!\" Janice growled, finally pushing her way to Katie. \"Good, you're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm here,\" Katie sighed, crossing her arms. \"Sarah sold me out. It was probably to protect PregTech, but still...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah,\" Janice snarled, punching her fist into her palm. \"I'll get even with her...a workout from hell ought to even the score.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I can bail us out, at least,\" Katie said. \"Once Sarah's spines start selling, we'll make up the money easily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you get us out too?\" some women started asking, hands pressing against Katie's enormous belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hands off my partner!\" Janice yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-now now, we're all pregnant women here,\" Katie grinned. \"We can touch each other's bellies if we want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you say partner?\" one woman said, getting close to Katie. \"Partner with Janice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she's part of PregTech with me,\" Katie said, but in no time, a group of women were around her, on the verge of tears and bending to kiss her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Janice gave us hope!\" they cried out. \"That pregnant women can be more than a big, slow burden! She's our hero!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is PregTech?\" more women asked. \"Is it part of your pregnant philosophy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y...es,\" Katie grinned, profits and possibilities entering her head. \"PregTech is many things, but one thing to remember is that PregTech is a company for pregnant women, by pregnant women. Fitness, mobility, clothing, food...energy, entertainment. Everything a pregnant woman could want.\" Katie waddled to the center of the cell, holding her hands up as the rest of the women supported her belly. \"And most of all, freedom! Live your life like you're a normal woman. No, better! Because being pregnant is better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pregnant women are better!\" the women chanted with joy as Janice waddled up to PregTech's business manager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great sales pitch,\" Janice said, rolling her eyes. \"Now can we go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie waddled back with Janice to the cell's bars as Janice called for a guard. \"And remember...um...we're having a kick-off event tomorrow all day at the mall!\" Katie said. \"Bring all your friends. All your pregnant friends!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards had to lean in close to hear Janice talk about bail as cheers and moans filled the jail. The two were led out of the cell and down the hallway, with Katie still waving and giving thumbs-up to the women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina paced around outside the hospital room, stroking her chin. How could he turn her down? I mean, the pregnant bump wasn't always ideal, but she was still Catalina Corazon! She was damn sexy. The sexiest, biggest star in Hollywood, in fact! As Catalina paced, she butted bellies with Grace, who actually outsized her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Grace smiled, trying to waddle away as Catalina grabbed her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me ask you,\" Catalina said. \"I'm attractive, right? Even with the belly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" Grace said, before turning to Catalina and grinning. \"I mean, <u>I</u> think you're good-looking. You're Catalina Cor-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, you're a huge fan, I know,\" Catalina said, waving her hand around. \"But look, I need something from that weird bearded guy in there and flirting isn't working.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want something from someone who thinks you're attractive, I can help,\" Grace smiled, rubbing her belly against Catalina's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss, please. I know it's intimidating being around such a legendary actress, but I need to focus,\" Catalina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't bother. He doesn't like pregnant bellies,\" Grace shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't give up that easily,\" Catalina boasted. \"In Expect Danger, I defeated the leader of the Drake Crime Syndicate all while carrying the president's illegitimate twins. I can get this guy to give me my freedom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freedom?\" Grace said, but Catalina was already bursting into Joel's room. Grace let out a sigh and put her hand on her belly. \"That crazy woman's acting hornier than I am...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sports club was empty, well except for the heap of maids and cleaners messing up last nights mess. Dry dirt lay in clumps all over. Place, in the opening was a bikini top, hanging over the statue of Lord Pharel. The pool was empty and looked literally like a pig sty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoyce stood there ordering the hell out of the poor immigrants that were working for her. Joyce's son Harold delicately walked in, through the vast mess that encapsulated the  place. \" Dear god mother, what the devil happened here?\" He said brushing a lot of hair away from his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Harold, what on earth are you doing here?\" Joyce said with much alert. \" look, I'm currently very busy, it looks like the horses broke through and trampled through the house, I'll make sure to fire one of the help today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarold grabbed the keys from his pocket and went to leave. \" I guess I'll check out some of the sports equipment in the mall, bye mum\". Joyce waddled over to Lord Pharel and grabbed the bikini from the moustached statue. She took one look at the intimidating figure whilst thinking what happened last night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPharels stare could pierce the heavens with its intensity, he stood for what everything important to the country club stood for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nINTEGRITY<br>\r\nSTRUCTURE<br>\r\nPRIDE<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInfact that was chiseled into the plaque below him. He fought against legendary beasts and much much more. Joyce's husband had mirrored himself in his image, believed in his ideals and would never deal with what they got up to last night. \" oh god\" Joyce whispered under her breath. Rubbing her twin filled belly she grabbed a mop and cleaned harder than the help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" what's her problem?\" Asked one of the people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I heard her friends had a stripper here last night\" whispered another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" nonsense, that wouldn't explain this mess.\" A man said, \" look at that mark right there, only a beach ball could make that mark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" or something else\" a lady maid said, rubbing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoyce pulled out her headset and called Barbara. \" hey, we can no longer do our night, uuhh, sessions, here, I'll need you to find a clearer liquid if we are to continue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrody ran into the library hands waving and mouth screaming. One collective SHUSH changed his vocal extremities. Looking at everyone's stern faces, Brody tipetoed over to his friends. Louisa waddled over to the other young mothers who were expecting their second and third kids. She sat down and saw the ladies hypnotised by their screens. \" are we going to go through this again\" Louisa said to the other 6 ladies. \" come on, phones on the table. Yvonne\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" sorry Louisa, I just love this app the others were showing me, it's letting us buy stuff from the mall when we are doing ourrr, you know, boring things!\" Yvonne said in her French accent. \" this is really amazing!\" Louisa looked down at the screen and started window shopping. Pulling out her phone she texted Erin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin was watching the ads before movie 1 began. For some reason she was the one person in there and she was enjoying it, if only she had a friend to- \" oh crap\" she said fishing her phone form her bra. \" Mara? I'm so sorry! Come up to the cinemas, I got tickets to see a double feature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" okay will do\" Mara said on the other line. Looking at the swarm of pregnant women, the chubby girl had to think of a way to get up 5 floors in 3 minutes. The first floor was both the hardest and the awkwardest. Her short frame meant her big boobs brushed up against a few tall women's bellies. Pushing her thick frames glasses in she dashed up the escalator to the second floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond floor being the sports floor she wasn't dealing with any pregnant women but a lot of male partners to pregnant women, there was a line to get into the prenatal yoga. After being stuck behind two begrudging husbands pushing prams she took the elevator up two floors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entertainment area on level four was almost deserted for some reason. Not many people were splurging money on entertainment with families on the way. She sped to the escalator taking it to the high end market section and cinemas. Racing in she paid the ticket holder and got in just in time for the feature presentation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" this... mall.... needs some.... changes...\" Mara breathed as she stole one of Erin's drinks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" help yourself\" Erin laughed as the film began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith second period over the school was having recess. Ashley waddled past several pregnant teens over to the teachers lounge. Opening the door was like something out of a sitcom. The male teachers were taking over the left quarter of the room while the pregnant ladies took up the other three quarters. Ashley strode in and made her way over to the cups. Pouring herself a cup of green tea she was interrupted by a tall tanned bald gentleman. \" hello miss Page\" came a deep voice from the gentlemen. \" Alfonso!\" Ashley said, her voice varying, \" it's so good to see you! how's music class?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" the class, is doing tremendously well, our musicans are going to regionals next week, I would love to see if you still have the... How you say, moves?\" Alfonso said bring up her left delicate hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" oh stop it you, you know I'm mar-\" Ashley started. She realised she and tanner were no longer a couple. \" you know what, I would be happy to, but what about my figure?\" She rubbed her large expanse. Alfonso seemed unfazed by it, In fact his large Spanish hands stroked Ashley's belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" are you kidding? You have never looked more attractive in your life\" he said chuckling. Ashley's amulet started to burn with lust, as he stroked her incredible midsection she became slightly wet. Time slowed down, it wasn't until he let go of her belly did she realised her worse night mare was right next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HHHHHHIIIIIIIIII\" said Tracy, Tracy was a woman so wildly wound up she could power a truck with her energy. \"Hello Tracy\" Ashley groaned, \" what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy grabbed her iPad and ran through some pages on some ebooks \" I'm afraid you two are violating rule 627, deliberately making contact with a pregnant woman's belly\" she said with a mocking smile \" now rules are rules and women of your, size have needs, but we here as teachers of this high school need to set an example.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" hmm, funny\" Ashley said, thinking quickly. \" now, firstly I am so sorry about your condition, not all of us can be pregnant, but if you watched the news today, women are now considered just like everyone else in terms of the law, making your, little, rule, invalid.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" we will see about that\" Tracy said and the skinny Indian left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eer, okay my spanish dancer, how about I visit you during period 4 and we can tango until we tanstop.\" Ashley flirted before slapping herself in the face . \" that sounded better in my head\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Still in her undies and singlet she worked quickly in the room as the heat started to rise. \" Katie really should have had a fan, how are you doing under there?\" Sarah quietly asked Rebecca. She was in a deep sleep, those years she spent in Saudi Arabia were coming back to her. She remembered the vacation she had there after eliminating several government officials.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah applied suction like cups up to her belly, trying to understand the type of energy. They were off the charts. But we're reacting slowly. The energy cells in her were synced to her amulets sloth like behaviour, anything that activated that feeling enhanced it by hundred more. Sarah's mini-sound machine evaluated the contents in her belly. \" okay so the matter that the foetuses were made from were converted to energy, that mused have been from the radiation from the Ray gun\" Sarah said as she took the suction cups off. She needed a sample from the energy though. A needle would pierce the energy, the end result would be catastrophic. She needed a sample from up her vagina. How the hell was she going to do that!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst Rebecca let out a small snore Sarah waddled to her her kit. She had a small beacon and some synthetic analysis pills. Attaching the two together she needed an excuse to insert the makeshift pill in there. Looking around she saw Katie left a container of 'coconut oil' on the desk. Grabbing some of the stuff she started to rub it on Rebecca's belly. Immediately startled Rebecca grabbed Sarah's arm, Sarah winced in pain. \" what the hell are you doing?\" Rebecca sternly said, ready to introduce Sarah's left hand to her left elbow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I'm, ow, just applying some coconut oil to your belly, I thought I saw stretch, ah, marks or veins, and we don't want that now do we?\" Sarah tried to say through the pain. Rebecca was confused. Sarah was hoping she didn't call her bluff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" do, we?\" Rebecca asked. She never had friends, or time for friends, so the thought of her belly having marks never occurred to her. The funny thing was her pregnancy, just like everyone else's in this town had no marks or veins what so ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" yeah, I mean, ouch, a girl like you is quite a catch. Not a whale like me\" Sarah said, trying to reach the innocent person behind that iron hard shell. \" and isn't this relaxing, I mean if I rub here...\" Sarah rubbed some warm coconut oil into the lower half of her belly. The sensation hit Rebecca like a ton of bricks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" IIIOooooOoOOOOOOOOoooooo\" Rebecca said her legs spreading, she came a little with how sensual Sarah was with her touch. Rebecca plaited there and then, her bellies glow starting to disappear. Sarah didn't have much time. Brought Rebecca's pants and undies down, quickly swabbed her vaginal walls and then put what she had into a testing tray. Pulling up her pants she did her best to drag her out. VRemoving the Nause-gone she tried pulling her towards the shopfront. No use. Barely squeezing through the door frame she saw two remaining police men, waiting out in front of the store. \"Help! Help, please officers, could you come here?\" Sarah pleaded to the large men. The officers came and saw Rebecca lying unconscious. \" we were getting a little hot and heavy and I think she suffered from heat stroke\" Sarah was thanking her year 11 drama teacher for her believable performance. \" the two men came in and carried her out \" don't worry mam, we will take her to the hospital, we would ask you to come but, we only have the one police car and we couldn't fit the both of you\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" no worries mam, we will make sure your friend makes it safely to the hospital.\" One of the men said as the hauled the assassin out of there. Clearing up the mess she got ready to analyse the material\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie sat in prison, the holding cell was getting a bit too much, she almost needed to kiss someone. Janice came over and tried to get a hold of her smitten friend. \"Katie\" Janice said trying to snap her out of it \" Katie!\" She slapped her only to get no response. \" It's useless, what the hell is wrong with you?\" Janice shouted at her but Katie was lost on a high...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She looked around her and all she could see was a multi skin coloured sea of large, plump bellies. Her greed amulet started to amplify, her belly had grown so large last night it was having an adverse reaction to her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice looked as Katie grabbed a Chinese woman's belly and started to rub it and kiss it like was her God. \" okay that's it, I need someone with law expertise, is there anybody here that is a lawyer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I am\" came a confident woman in another cell a Latina stood up and walked over to her cell bars. \" I graduated 2 years ago from Harvard, the top of my class and I assure you I have the sharpest mind in the legal system.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" excellent, I need you to start finding a way to reverse this Stupid law, try and get us out of jail, now I need someone who works in real estate!\" Janice called out from on top of the bench. 3 women shot up their hands. \" awesome, I hope you gals are from different companies cause when we get out, I am going to need you three to start scouting for strip malls, lots of land, basically anywhere we can start a new mall. There is a mad man behind that place and he needs to know that this town, no make that this city belongs to us Amazonian goddesses!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery pregnant woman started roaring with applause, except for Katie who was massaging belly after belly, without anyone complaining. Janice could see that it was time to take back this place. Waddling through the cramp space she went up to the Latina lawyer. \" now, you are our key to freedom. What can we do to get out of here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin and Mara sat pigging out on their large food supply as Catalina's sports movie entered its second act on the gritty cinematic screen. Erin had a pretty peeved look on her face as Catalina's character 'Sally' waddled up to a podium. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I now represent to Sally Saunders the Harmony Cup!\" Said the announcer clapping as he shook hands with the pregnant golfer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding me? Her technique was all off, she didn't go through any emotional journey and do you call that acting?\" Erin said, her anger building. A shushing came from far behind them, \" oh shush yourself!\" She said before funnelling more popcorn in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't think it was that bad, like that scene with Jennifer Nielson was alright\" Mara said picking up a box of twislers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I guess... Hey Mara, do you ever think this place could be better?\" Erin asked, looking at the state of the cinema.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" what do you mean?\" Mara asked, biting down on one of the red sweets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" look at the state of this cinema. The man running this place is doing something with the profits and it's not being put back into the public. Let's just hope this next film is better, something about a magic coin!\" Erin answered turning back to the screen.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Catalina paced back and forth in the hallway, waiting for Grant to come back out. The hospital in the normally lazy town was full of activity. Women with humungous bellies were beings moved around, either in wheelchairs or by waddling, as police officers followed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a crime to love being pregnant!\" one woman with a sextuplet belly extending far beyond the constraints of her clothing, protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It <u>is</u> a crime to join with others in inciting protests,\" a cop growled. \"We saw your posts on Facebook. New city pregnancy laws make that a crime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is insane,\" the woman cried out. \"I'm creating life inside my womb! You should be bowing down to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the crowd of police and pregnant women passed, Grant stepped out of the room and walked one of the hospital's vending machines. Catalina stepped from behind the machine and leaned against it, a sultry smile on her face. \"Hi there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hi,\" Grant sighed, recognizing Catalina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope I didn't startle you,\" she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I could see your belly sticking out,\" Grant said, turning back to the machine. Catalina took his chin in her hand and turned Grant back to face her. She winced a little as she gripped him: his beard obviously hadn't been washed in a day or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad,\" Catalina purred. \"Because I wanted to talk to you, Grant. I've been wanting to talk to you for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know my name?\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina just smiled and continued to pet his hairy face. \"Grant...sweetie, I know you have some old movies of mine.\" Grant immediately started to turn pale. It was embarrassing enough that someone was telling him they knew he bought porn. But the woman in the video itself? Grant started to stutter, but Catalina kept going. \"You know, I've been looking for those for a long, long time. I was wondering if I could...have them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant started to relax. She wanted the DVDs back. He hadn't even gotten to watch them yet. \"I-I dunno...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure we could think of a trade,\" Catalina smiled. \"An autographed copy of 'Elite Belly Force?' Or an advanced screening of my next movie, 'Birth of Danger?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks,\" Grant said, getting his soda out of the machine. Catalina was increasingly desperate and snatched the drink out of Grant's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe...I can do something else for you,\" Catalina said, shaking up the drink and opening it. The soda shot foam onto her chest, making her top even tighter than before and giving her heaping exposed cleavage an enticing shine. She really, really didn't want to have sex with Grant, but if it meant getting away from Antonio, she'd sleep with a hundred dweebs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I don't-\" Grant started to say, before hesitating. He remembered some of Joel's words days earlier and had an idea. \"Actually...hold that thought for a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's how the amulet is used. Understand?\" Kim said, hand against Brandon's chest. She was still possessed by Lania, still pregnant with nine fetuses, and still completely naked aside from her bra and underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes,\" Brandon said, her face inches from his own as she leaned in to grip his amulet. Her soft fingers were touching his chest and her huge belly was bumping against his thigh. \"T-thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Kim said, returning to her seat at the caf\u00e9. \"You have the master amulet, so to stop Yaral's spread of chaos, you're the most important person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I stop it?\" Brandon asked. \"I tried to make Sarah and Ashley's bellies smaller and that didn't work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The eight amulets are in a state of maximum stimulation,\" Kim said, hand on her belly. \"Now they're at their strongest and the most chaos can come out of this. You will need to find a way to stop the chaotic influence and make things return to a state of normalcy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the hell do I do that?\" Brandon said. Kim shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your amulet is stronger than the others,\" she said. \"Use it to your advantage. But you should be warned: as the amulets grow in power, so do their individual abilities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean besides the whole 'pregnancy transfer' thing?\" Brandon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. The other seven, to add more chaos to the mix, were infused with various evils. Greed, wrath, lust, etc.\" Brandon gulped when he heard this news. He hoped the owner of the lust amulet wasn't anyone he knew. \"But yours comes with two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two evils?\" Brandon said. \"I haven't felt my personality change at all...except I'm more nervous with all these pregnant women around now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim ignored Brandon's tiny admission of pregnant love and kept explaining. \"For one, you can increase the sizes of pregnancies by greater amounts than any other amulet. And as it grows in strength, pregnant women will find themselves...drawn to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drawn to me?\" Brandon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Even in this body, though she feels a certain amount of disdain for you, this woman wants to get intimate with you on a primal level,\" Kim said, looking down at the body she was taking over. \"Curious. Would you like to have sex now so this feeling can pass or would you like to continue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-continue,\" Brandon shuddered. This would explain Clara and Kristina's behavior lately...and that girl in the mall who gave Brandon her number. But did this extend to Sarah and Ashley. Flashes of Ashley's naked rear and bare belly flashed into his head and he let out a tiny groan. \"I-is there anything else I need to know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at the moment,\" Kim sighed. \"My focus is beginning to break. I need to recharge by letting this body be around more pregnant women.\" Kim stood up, stretching out so her nine-baby belly jutted out an extra few inches, then proceeded to stroke it. \"Are you sure you would not like to lay with this body? It feels like she is more than willing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll pass,\" Brandon choked out. Kim was, even before she got pregnant, a super-sexy woman, but he was still reeling from his break-up with Erin and his confusing moment with Ashley. Plus, the idea of having sex with his father's mistress was not exactly appealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" Kim nodded. \"I will likely see you again before the day is over. I may have new information once I've rested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye, Lania,\" Brandon muttered, waving to Kim as she waddled back down the street, catching looks wherever she went. The waiter put down the bill and let out a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those new pregnancy laws still can't keep pregnant women from wearing as little as they can when they come over here,\" he said. \"If the owner wasn't a big preggo too, your lady friend would have had to put on some real clothes...although she did have a great face and ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-and belly,\" Brandon said, putting his credit card on the bill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bellies are gross,\" the waiter scoffed. \"But her tits were really nice too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant tapped Joel on the shoulder a few times until his tall friend woke up. \"Hey pal, you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Joel smiled. \"Just getting some rest, but otherwise I feel good as new.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to hear it,\" Grant said. \"If you hadn't been healthy enough, you may not have been able to beta-test the new roleplaying expansion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would have hated to miss that,\" Joel chuckled. Joel had been randomly selected from just a handful of people in the country to test a new, wide expansion for their usual D&amp;D routines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About that,\" Grant said, leaning in closely. \"I think I might have something you'd want to trade for your spot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give up my spot?\" Joel said. \"No way. I'm in the hospital, I know, but I'm not delirious. Nice try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really!\" Grant said. \"Remember what you told me about...pregnant women?\" He was glad Grace wasn't in the room to hear this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm listening,\" Joel said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, I just happen to have a very attractive pregnant woman who'd be willing to have sex with you,\" Grant smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who, the nurse?\" Joel said. \"She's hot, sure, but this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not the nurse,\" Grant said, holding up one of his DVDs. \"Her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Catalina?\" Joel yelled, sitting up in his hospital bed. \"Catalina Corazon will have sex with me?\" He narrowed his eyes. \"What do you get out of this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beta-testing,\" Grant grinned. \"Deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel hesitated before reaching one hand out to Grant. \"Deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant shook Joel's hand and darted back to the door, opening it up. \"Alright, he's ready for you in here.\" Catalina waddled in slowly, one hand on her belly. She looked Joel over for a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Slightly less gross than this one</i>, Catalina thought, turning back to Grant. \"You're a good friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am, aren't I?\" Grant smiled, before Catalina grabbed him by the collar. Her alluring tone was gone and her prideful, powerful voice was back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave the DVDs on the table. When I'm finished, I'm taking them and leaving. Understand?\" Catalina whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-understand,\" Grant squeaked out, putting the DVDs near the door and running out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina turned back to Joel and smiled. \"Now then...think you're ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always ready,\" Joel grinned. \"Though...I've never done it in a hospital bed before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina sighed. <i>Just get it over with. Just get it over with. Just get it over with</i>. \"We'll find a way, babe.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah typed away at her laptop, still huddled in the tiny workroom she managed to put together in the back of Katie's store. To anyone else, the space might have seemed roomier, but Sarah was pregnant with 15 full-term fetuses and space was in short supply. Still, despite the cramps, the kicks, the occasional craving, Sarah was confident that she'd finished the device: one zap from this beam and a woman's womb would transform into a generator of immense amounts of biological and thermic energy. The pregnancy, if it could still be called that, would be permanent as a result and the woman would stay incredibly healthy as the energy filled her body. The more pregnant a woman was, the more energy she generated and the more that could be shared with others. And, if the woman wanted to resume her pregnancy and one day give birth to her children, it was an easily reversed procedure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect,\" Sarah sighed, hands on her hips. \"I think this might be my greatest invention. Better than what those goons who kidnapped me put together, for sure.\" Her envy had not dissipated one iota. She wondered whether she should use the beam on her own womb again. The idea of not going into labor and taking care of 15 babies appealed to her, but did she also want to look pregnant forever? And when Antonio used similar technology on her, it made her have an...orgasm and then pass out. That made her shiver a bit. \"Well, someone's got to-\" Sarah began to say before her cellphone buzzed. Sarah pried it out of her increasingly tight pants and saw a reminder she left herself. \"Shit, I have to meet with that investor in like 10 minutes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah fastened her robo-spine on and loaded up as many of her pregnant inventions as she could. Of course, the laser and her pregnancy creating/removing gun were the first to go in, but she'd made so much more. A revolution for pregnant women around the world was in this little cardboard box she clumsily tried to pick up and rest on her belly. As Sarah waddled, struggling even with the new-and-improved robospine, a helping hand held the other side of the box. \"Do you need help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do, thanks,\" Sarah smiled, glad to have the weight relieved a bit. Her view was still blocked by the box, but if she'd seen the stranger, she probably would have yelled out loud. Kim, still mostly nude, was holding part of the box as she waddled along with Sarah. With nothing else to do, Lania sought out her descendants and the closest one was Sarah Page. Kim smiled softly as she admired Sarah: beautiful, brilliant, hugely pregnant. But Lania could tell she lacked confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me,\" Kim said. \"How long have you had that amulet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah gulped. \"A day or so. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just asking,\" Kim sighed. She didn't want to worry her great-great-great-many-times-great-granddaughter just yet. \"It just makes you look so...strong and sure-headed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Sarah said, never hearing such an odd compliment before. \"T-thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome,\" Kim smiled as Sarah made it through the mall's doors. \"Just remember to believe in yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That hasn't been easy lately</i>, Sarah thought. \"Thank you,\" she said, trying to peek behind her boxes to see the woman who helped her, but Kim was already off, exploring the mall for what it had to offer a thousand-year-old spirit. \"Oh well. Taxi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley knew being pregnant in the classroom would be hard, especially when she was <u>this</u> pregnant. She would think how it could be fun if she was an elementary school teacher. All the children would want to touch her belly and ask questions about her pregnancy, which she'd be happy to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut high school was different. None of the kids wanted to see her bulging belly, hear about what it's like to feel kicking constantly inside her. They wanted their class so they could get their grades and then they wanted to go. It didn't help that, lately, most of the student body was pregnant. Nor did it help that Ashley's lust amulet was still in full force and several of the students looked pretty appetizing right about now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can anyone tell me what Milton is describing in this section?\" Ashley asked, pointing to her various bullet points written on the dry erase board. No hands went up. \"No one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Page, why don't you just sit down and relax,\" said one girl in the back, legs on her desk, bare triplet belly jutting in the air. \"It's hard enough waddling around school for us, so you must be exhausted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm here to teach!\" Ashley said, hands on her wide hips. A few students chuckled as the show of frustration made her belly and breasts jiggle more then they already were. Ashley was always a gorgeous teacher and with each baby added to her belly, her skin got clearer, her eyes grew deeper, and her breasts, hips, and ass got sexier. And that wasn't even counting how enticing her belly was to the students who were into that sort of thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Page, c'mon,\" another pregnant student whined. \"I'm probably going to give birth in a week. I won't remember any of this crap after I go through that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Class, don't be like that,\" Ashley said again, turning to the board. Her movement was too aggressive and her buttons popped off, letting her bare belly slap against the whiteboard. She cooed and turned back to the front, rubbing the sides of her sore belly as the front was covered in marker stains. \"Oh no...I can't reach it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get it!\" one student, Steven, said eagerly, running up and grabbing a rag from the board. He started rubbing Ashley's belly, which only made her coos grow in pitch and volume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's very nice, thank you,\" Ashley purred, running her hands through his hair. The rest of the class leaned forward in shock as Ashley bent down and kissed Steven on the corner of his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mrs. Page?\" Steven croaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Brandon?\" Ashley squeaked, continuing to kiss the student. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what are you doing?\" he said. Ashely opened her eyes and realized she was kissing a student in front of the whole class as he rubbed her belly. \"I-I-I...class dismissed!\" Ashley ran was quickly as she could out the door and to her car. She needed to talk to Brandon and she needed to talk to him now. Otherwise, she might not last the rest of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy hurried into Antonio's office as the room filled with the loudest coughing fit she'd heard from her boss yet. \"Mr. Green?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wendy!\" he growled into his handkerchief, holding up his cellphone with his withered hand. Wendy took the phone and saw one text from Catalina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;I quit ;) &gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you send out the-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're gone!\" Antonio said, his coughing finally over. \"The DVDs, our only recordings of her past, are gone and Rebecca can't find them. She's resting at one of our labs right now. Some clueless police thought she was having heatstroke, for some stupid reason. The effects of the energy beam have worn off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what's our plan now?\" Wendy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Find us a new spokeswoman,\" Antonio said, taking a long sip of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spokes<b>woman</b> specifically?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it needs to be a pregnant woman. It seems I'm competing with an entire corporation made up of pregnant women. They call themselves 'PregTech.' And preferably someone in the sports world,\" Antonio barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pregnant athlete?\" Wendy said. \"That's going to be a little hard to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have my full confidence,\" Antonio scoffed, turning around in his chair to look out of the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of...of pregnancy,\" Wendy said, putting her hand over her uterus. \"When I told you I was pregnant...you didn't respond.\" Antonio didn't move back around. \"I-It's yours, you know.\" Still nothing. \"Do you want to t-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're dismissed,\" Antonio finally said, pulling his oxygen mask back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes sir,\" Wendy nodded, tears in her eyes as she left his enormous office. Back in her own office, Wendy sobbed openly, hands clutching her still-flat stomach. She didn't even know how she felt about Antonio or even if she wanted to continue a sexual relationship with him. All she knew now is she was having a baby and wanted support for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she cried, her eyes spied the stack of papers on her desk. To better understand the situation around the city, she got every piece of news, all the way down to the country club's newsletter. And on the front was a picture of a very pregnant woman playing golf and, apparently, winning the amateur tournament. She picked up the phone and called mall security.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, I'm wondering if you had eyes on 'Erin Parker' in the mall today? A credit card purchase at the movie theatre? Thank you,\" Wendy smiled, hanging the phone up. If she couldn't get Antonio to stand by her when she was carrying his child, maybe she could get him to talk to her when she had a new spokeswoman.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brandon walked back into the building shocked. Is this why he was attracted to pregnant women? Looking at his surroundings he remembered the events of yesterday, for some reason it felt much much longer, like time had been acting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" is it true what she said?\" Brandon said to himself, walking to the office. He looked over at the secretary, Zoe. She was one of the women who wasn't pregnant until last night. The blast last night must have consumed 75% of the female populous. She sat there finishing a call whilst she rubbed her belly which was quite smaller than the other women who worked here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Hey Brandon, how are you buddy?\" Zoe said punching him in the arm. Brandon laughed trying to mask the actual pain he felt. \" I'm doing okay, what's it like to be back at the office?\" Brandon asked looking at the pregnant belly. 'Hmmm I wonder' Brandon thought pulling out his amulet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah! I completely forgot, sorry, I'm still disorientated by what happened this morning.\" Zoe said rubbing her belly. \" Barbados was fantastic! I caught up on my surfing, I did some hiking and I got to see a lunar eclipse! The jet lag was horrible though so I took yesterday off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" so, tell me what was surfing like?\" Brandon asked as he thought of her pregnant. Zoe's belly started to fill up, sounding like a balloon inflating until <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" surfing? Please! Not like this, it was all just sun baking on the beach and playing in the pool\" Zoe said rubbing her belly more, the buttons beginning to strain. \" say that is a nice shirt on you\" her active voice starting to turn flirty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInteresting, Brandon thought more as he continued to think more about her pregnant. \" let's see, what was the pool like?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING<br>\r\nPING <br>\r\nPING <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zoe's belly reached quintuplets her belly burst through her shirt. Her thoughts became more and more primal. \"I, uhh, uhh, it was good. tell me, have you been working out?\" Zoe started to sweat, her breasts were glistening, she was in heat and it was only getting worse by the second. A grin came upon Brandon's face, he was enjoying this way to much.\" H-have you been working out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe just one more, I'm sure it's reversible he thought as he put in a little bit more. Zoe started to moan as Brandon's amulet over powered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING <br>\r\nPING <br>\r\nPING<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe's breasts escaped their prison and jiggled out in the open, she couldn't take any more, the very short woman got off her chair, pulled Brandon down by the collar and locked lips with him. Zoe was a very passionate kisser, she knew behind the walls was every employer of Tyler industries, so thinking quickly she dragged him to the store room. \" wait what are you doing?\" Brandon said in confusion. He then realised what the strong short woman was doing. \" never mind \" he said as Zoe threw him into the store room, against the empty boxes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah got off the train in Charlesburg, the neighbouring harbour city to small ton. The 5 minute trip was interesting to say the least. They had to take several passengers onto other carriages to distribute the weight on the tracks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't concern Sarah though. She spent the time in the bathroom changing out of her gritty clothes and stuffing them in bags, with the closest fitting skirt, shirt and blazer combo she was removing the grease from her face and applying make up. By the end of it, she went from looking like a mechanic to looking like Jennifer love Hewitt, a VERY PREGNANT Jennifer love Hewitt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled through the platform and saw the turn styles. Walking over to the extra large exit she tried to fit through, but her belly got stuck. She tried to move back, nothing. The exit was half the size of the door. She was not going anywhere. \" damn it, a little help?\" Sarah asked the attendants. A mother came by with a curious child. The kid, wondering what was going on snuck underneath and tried to help out. \" I think the kids got an idea\" said one of the people on the other side. With the help of the kid and some extra station guards she got through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Daniel, that was very nice, but remember to ask before you do anything like that\" the mother said as they carried on their day. Sarah looked at he marvellous city that was Charlesburg. Titanic buildings pushed up the sky as people in high priced suits walked to and from meetings. She waddled across the street and over to a building with purple tinted glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Making her way into the building she was astounded by what she saw. A well oiled machine made of hard working gentlemen who looked like they came out of the high end business catalogue. She made her way to the lobby, checked in her items and then waddled onto the elevator. Sadly she wasn't able to turn around so she asked the man to push number 34. In record speeds it flew up half way of the building and at her stop, she got off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the offices  she could see a well dressed man with a greying eccentric hair style through glass doors.  His eyes were fixed upon the city. Hearing a knock on the doors he said  \"come in\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I may need a little help with that\" Sarah said from her side of the glass. The older man turned around, revealing a finely combed beard covering a very large chin. Shocked by his appointments size he dashed to the doors. \" good afternoon my fair lady. It is good to finally meet the face behind those fantastic emails. Might I say what a beautiful woman too!\" dr Schultz said with a bright toothy smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" oh you are too kind\" Sarah smiled back at the German Professor. \" so where should we begin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" well, I must say I am curious, do you need any thing? I wasn't expecting someone expecting, or at\u0142east THIS expecting haha.\" Dr Schultz asked the heavily pregnant woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" it's okay maybe it would be better to sit on the couch rather than test the weight of the chairs.\" Sarah joked. Dr Schultz chuckled, looking at the amulet around her neck. They sat down, getting comfortable on the rich  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nnormally I would get my associates in for formalities, but they can wait, are you okay with this interview being recorded?\" The doctor asked. Sarah nodded eagerly, waiting for the interview to begin. \" okay, well let's begin. So, tell me what do you believe in, generally?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I would have to say that I am a firm believer in evolving, adapting to change and stick to my guns in a heated argument.\" Sarah stated with much confidence. Dr Schultz had an interested look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" an interesting answer. Why stick to your guns when you can find common ground?\" Dr Schultz asked, pouring himself a glass of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" because when it's a topic I have studied for a long time and I know the facts, then I have no reason to find common ground. Facts are facts.\" Sarah answered, scratching an itch on her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" okay, second question. Why have you become an inventor?\" Dr Schultz asked as he brushed his beard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I want to help improve the lives of us, the people of today. We can't look to the twerkers and the beliebers for guidance, we need smarter, more knowledgable people, the Bill Nye's and Carl Sagann's to make the world a better place.\" Sarah stated with a bang to the desk, she wasn't just a pretty face, she was a devoted woman to a cause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" excellent!\" Dr Schultz said clapping his hands together. \" one last question before you show me your equipment, I have one last question, have you heard about the seven deadly sins?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina stood there before Joel, who was getting out of bed in his scrubs. Seeing his satchel he quickly grabbed the deodorant and gave himself a quick spray. Catalina looked at the ginger fellow, it wasn't the worst person he had sex with, including the countless people from the sex industry that would make her want to shower away the regret. Walking up to him she started to make out with him. After a second Joel pulled away. \"What are you doing?\" Joel asked her, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" what? You wanted this to happen, didn't you?\" Catalina said getting frustrated. She just wanted to get this over and done with. Joel sighed, he had been known as a master of sex, and one of his celebrity crushes was going to treat sex like this? \" I do, but you are doing this all wrong, no offence, here let me show you something.\" Joel said guiding her to the hospital bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel placed the pregnant celeb down on the hospital bed. As she sat Joel came around behind her and started to massage her back. Catalina became weak at the knees as Joel's manly hands gentle massaged her delicate back. With all the stress she had, she never realised what kind of toll it was doing to her back. As he moved down Catalinas began to moan. She had never been touched before, she had been so focused on work she never realised the better things. As Joel finished her back she asked \"why did you stop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to get on your back now.\" Joel asked her. In her state she complied. Joel got on top of her legs and started to massage her feet. \"OoooooOOOOOOOOOooooohhhHHHHHH\" Catalina moaned out, getting wet at the power of his hands, he gracefully worked her swollen feet as she clutched the bed sheets. Stepping off the bed Catalina was ready for everything. \" now?\" Was all she could breathe out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" one last thing\" Joel said as he removed his hospital clothes, revealing his toned, skinny yet muscular body. Catalina was shocked and so thankful she didn't have to have sex with grant.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sure he was getting a beta pass for this, but at what cost? Acting impulsively he opened the door carefully, reached out and grabbed one of the DVDs. \" I'm sure she won't miss this one\" he said as replacing the DVD with one of the other DVDs he had on him called Deep Impact. Putting the porno in his backpack he placed the other back and left the hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As he left a cloaked individual walked over to the same room. He peer through to see the DVDs. Taking one of the DVDs he pulled out his phone texted Antonio \" I managed to grab one of the DVDs without them looking, we can start removing her promotional items from the mall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" good, *cough cough* good\" Antonio said, wheezing. He collapsed back into his chair and put on his oxygen mask. When he removed the gem from Catalinas amulet he was only in the early stages of his illness, but the energy tapped into his body, causing the virus cells to produce at a faster rate. \" my god, you are not the match you were 10 years ago\" a mysterious voice came from the walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" show yourself Yaral, save this dieing man a waste of breath.\" Antonio breathed out. Yaral came out from the wall opposite to him, his ghostly form flew around some artifacts. \" oh Antonio, it has been too long, but look at you, I mean I have lasted eons, I caused the Australian baby boom, the collapse of the Aztec empire, and Ive got something new cooking here, but you know about cooking, or atLeast you have someone who has a bun in the oven!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" why must you mock me?\" Antonio barely managed to get out. The virus was starting to accelerate. Yaral rolled his eyes at his complaint. \" look, I'm here to help, jeez you can't let anyone have a moment.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flew over to him and tapped him on his shoulder. Instantly the healthier cells started fighting back harder than ever. \" there I gave you 3 weeks, in return you need to do something for me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing her things Ashley walked  from her desk down stairs. Each stair groaned as she stepped on scaled down the mountain of steps. Looking at his paper work Alfonso almost bumped into Ashley's great expanse. \" oh Ashley, sweet heart, are you okay?\" He said seeing the concerned look on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" it's just a little hard making my way down these stairs whilst this big. Could you help me?\" Ashley asked, wiping sweat from her  forehead.\" Alfonso complied, reaching out his large muscular arm. Taking it, Ashley was pulled over to him. Alfonso lifted her up onto his arms and walked down. \" OH MY!\" Ashley said looking at Alfonso. \" isn't this a bit much for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" ha ha ha, you know how much I work out, just one thing, can you be my eyes? As much as I love to see your perfect belly, I cannot see.\" Ashley laughed until she saw what he meant. With their help they got to the bottom of the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking through her hand bag she realised her car keys weren't in there \" oh that's right, I went by bus. Alfonso, I need another favour, could you use those same gorgeous muscles to drive me across town?\" She asked in her most flirtatious way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll cost you, but we can talk about that later\" Alfonso said as they went to the car park. Ashley waited infront of the car park as Alfonso brought over his dark green hummer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" what happened to your Ferrari?\" Ashley asked looking at the gigantic vehicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They needed someone who could carpool all the pregnant women to work, so I bought this second hand from an old friend. The Ferrari is still at home in great condition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting in Ashley had a sigh of relief \" you know, it's been so long since I have been in a car that felt so, roomy.\" They took off in a reasonable speed. It was interesting the stuff Ashley saw throughout town, there was a pregnant rich woman with a huge amount of KY jelly, an arcade being torn down, a few women were being arrested for protesting and Alfonso's stunning abs through that very tight shirt. \"So, Alfonso, what do you have planned for the rest of the day?\" Ashley said, tracing her finger along his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have one more class at the end of the day, why? Did you have anything in mind?\" Alfonso said as they waited at the intersection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" well, I mean, I have always enjoyed your dance moves, maybe we could try some more at Damien's Look out?\" Ashley purred to the handsome, tall dark specimen that sat next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" but what about that other place you had to go?\" Alfonso asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" that can wait, I have an itch that needs scratching.\" Ashley said moving her hand down to his leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina was shocked, how could someone geeky have abs like that? Joel walked over to the actress in need and ran his hands through her hair. Slowly they both leaned until their lips touched. she moaned as Joel ran his fingers through her long flowing hair. Slowly he undressed her until he saw Catalina in her full incredible body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Catalina moaned as he delicately groped her breasts. Her skin felt incredibly sensitive, she had no idea what he was doing, she was just loving it. Moving his hands down she bit her lip as his fingers circulated around her belly. \" a little trick I learnt after fucking my first pregnant woman\" he whispered as her moans grew deeper and deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She clutched the bed sheets as his fingers danced around her belly and down to the lips of her vagina. One single brush from his index finger was like a surge of pleasure. She gasped as he started to finger her, \"mmmmmm\" she said as his fingers picked up pace, his fingers worked faster until \" oooOOOOOOOHHHHHhhhhhhh fuck yes!\" She cried out as she came.wiping sweat from her fore head she pulled him in, \" FUCK, ME, NOW...\" She said as placed one hand on her massive middle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel did as he was told. He pulled her to the edge of the bed and grabbing his dick, brushed it up against her vagina. For a second she was wondered what was he waiting for until he thrusted every last inch of his member into her. She screamed in pleasure as he thrusted harder and harder into her. His hands moved all over the expanse of her huge middle. The amount of pleasure zones he was hitting was unbelievable to Catalina, no one had touched him this way before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next hour flew by in a series of moans, screams and bangs from the door. As the clock hit 3:20 the two collapsed down onto the mattress. Both exhausted from the experience they went through. \" how?\" Was the only word to escape from Catalinas mouth. Joel could only grin as he looked at his mocca skinned lover. What he hadnt realised was that he had created a monster</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mara sighed, crossing her arms as she fidgeted in her seat. She liked having Erin as a new friend and even thought it was cool that her friend was pregnant, but in the theater, the problems with having a hugely pregnant friend were starting to make themselves known. For one, Erin had the armrests down so she could fit her nine-baby belly into the tiny seats. Normally, Mara would be happy to be able to rest her arm on Erin's pregnant stomach, but Erin fidgeted just as much as Mara, constantly readjusting after her fetuses squirmed and kicked inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of that, Mara couldn't hear the movie over the sound of Erin snacking. Her fingers rustled the popcorn in the bucket, her teeth cracked the hard peanuts and chocolates, and her lips slurped up cups of lemonade until the straw made a horrible \"empty\" sound. It was driving Mara crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I shouldn't be eating this stuff,\" Erin whispered to her new friend, unaware how much noise she was already making in the theater. \"I have more golf games planned and I should be trying to stay in shape.\" Erin placed a hand on her pregnant belly, rubbing her bare skin. \"Then again, I already look plenty big. I doubt anyone will notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so hard on yourself,\" Mara said, taking the opportunity to get a belly rub next to Erin's hands. \"You look great. I look heavier than you by far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, Mara,\" Erin said, stuffing her mouth instead of telling her friend otherwise. \"Oof, I regret drinking so much here. When these kids kick my bladder, I feel like I have to let a waterfall loose in here. But this concession stand food is so salty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss?\" a voice whispered, looking in Erin's row.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it the noise?\" Mara asked, assuming the voice was coming from an usher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm looking for Erin Parker,\" the voice said, leaning in closer. It was Antonio's assistant, Wendy. When her eyes fell on Erin's belly, Wendy felt like she found the right woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's me,\" Erin said, wiping her lips clean. \"May I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you can,\" Wendy smiled. \"I'm part of the mall's administration. Would you mind coming with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh,\" Erin blushed, heavily herself up slowly, her belly jiggling around as she moved. \"Alright then. Mara, do you want to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a private conversation, I'm afraid,\" Wendy said, crossing her arms behind her back. Emulating Rebecca's imposing look was tricky to pull off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok...well, it was nice to spend time with you again,\" Erin said, smiling at her friend. \"Sorry about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine,\" Mara smiled back. She liked Erin too, but she was looking forward to being able to hear the movie. \"Have...fun I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Erin said with a nervous laugh, going off with Wendy. When the two left, Mara snatched a few snacks from the cart before the theater's employees came back to whisk it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what's happening in this thing?\" Mara said to herself, dropping a maltball in her mouth. \"Why are there three coins now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're kidding,\" Sarah said, hands on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I've devoted a lot of research to this,\" Dr. Schultz said. He had just finished telling Sarah about the amulets and their powers. His history was not as complete as Lania's, but he knew the basics: somehow, the amulets led to spikes in pregnancies and came with the seven evils to tempt the women who were unlucky enough to wear the amulets themselves. \"Throughout the past few millennia, you can find a few instances of unexplained population growth, accompanied by rumors about magical jewelry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah gulped, stroking the amulet nestled between her breasts. She couldn't dismiss him outright: from her own testing of the amulet on her technology, what he was saying was obviously true. But the news about bringing out negative behavior in people was news to her. Why did he have to be the one to understand these things about the amulets but not have to face its consequences? Her envy built up in her, still ignorant to its effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would have dismissed it all as rumor and coincidence too...except for one case in a small town in what is now Southern Germany,\" Dr. Schultz said. \"Very few people know about it and of those who do, most have dismissed it as a fairy tale. But I know better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Sarah asked, getting nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the records show is the same thing: seven women began wearing these amulets and the entire female population of childbearing age began bearing enormously large pregnancies,\" Dr. Schultz continued. \"But it didn't end there. The women with amulets...started a war.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A war?\" Sarah said, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On a very small scale, but yes. The seven women divided themselves into two sides and manipulated the people of the town to pick a group to support. In the end, everyone ended up having to leave the village and it disappeared from memory,\" Dr. Schultz sighed. \"But allegedly, one of the women with an amulet, the one with the largest pregnancy, said of the ruined town: 'This will happen once more.'\" That sent shivers down Sarah's spine. \"So you can understand my curiosity now that I appear to see the very amulet before me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I see your point,\" Sarah said, \"but I've got things under control. I've actually found a way to harness the amulet's power into my inventions. That's why I need your funding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inventions?\" Dr. Schultz said, crossing his arms. \"Forgive me, but I don't see how you can turn a magical amulet into a...household accessory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah pouted. Men were constantly looking down on her genius. Why did they have to have all the success? Why couldn't she be recognized as a great inventor? She'd show them...she'd show them all. Sarah heaved herself up and took out a metallic armband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here is a prototype for a commercial version of what I've already developed,\" Sarah said. \"Imagine pregnant women all over the world being able to change the size of their pregnancy size. Right now, I'm pregnant with 15, but with one button, I can have 16.\" Sarah tapped her armband and her belly swelled out another half a foot. \"Or 17.\" Another swell. Her clothes were beginning to audibly strain. \"Or hell, this thing is so good, I could go up to 20!\" With that, Sarah ballooned to an incredible size, her pregnancy reaching unbelievable proportions. Multiple feet of belly jutted out from her stomach and it was perfectly round, firm, and smooth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my,\" Dr. Schultz said, adjusting his glasses. \"This really...um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And women all over the world can have this same level of control,\" Sarah boasted. \"Bigger bellies, smaller bellies, quick pregnancies, longer pregnancies. Women who can't conceive can have as many babies in their belly as they want with the press of a button. I even have a way to make pregnancies permanent while generating endless energy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Schultz moped his brow with a handkerchief. \"T-this is quite a bit more than a device to help pregnant women walk around more easily like you said in your emails.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah blushed, realizing that she may have laid too much on her prospective shareholder at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but this will revolutionize...everything!\" Dr. Schultz said, standing up. \"If you can get this amulet thing under control then...then I'm in,\" he said, sticking out his hand to Sarah. \"Consider me PregTech's first investor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fantastic!\" Sarah squealed, shaking the doctor's hand quickly. \"You won't regret this! N-now if you excuse me, I want to go finish building these for the grand opening tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah bolted out the door, getting out her phone and checking the PregTech corporate bank account. It had millions in it now and she attempted to make a few transfers before the mechanics of business tripped her up too much. \"This isn't for me,\" Sarah sighed, sending money to bail Katie and Janice out of jail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally!\" Janice growled as she and Katie stormed down the jail's halls, hands pressed into their backs to support their immense pregnancies. \"We were cramped in there long enough.\" Maritza, the pregnant lawyer the two met in the jail cell, tried to follow behind, but despite having a much smaller belly, she couldn't keep up with the PregTech executives when they were upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to know where Sarah got the money to bail us out,\" Katie said. \"She'd better not have wasted what little money we had. Hopefully she got her investor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'd better have. Getting us stuck in there...if it was all for nothing, I'll smash that stupid spine of hers so she can feel what it's like to waddle around for once,\" Janice growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two left the cell, Katie felt another person run into her big belly. \"Hey, watch it!\" she snapped before seeing who ran into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I'm not used to...well, walking,\" Kim smiled softly, still possessed by Lania, still pregnant, and still half-naked. Her eyes focused on Katie and Janice's amulets and her smile grew. \"Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am now,\" Katie grinned.</span></div></div>",

Sometimes when you're pregnant, you get weird cravings, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I've noticed,\" Brandon blushed, getting dressed quickly as well. He wasn't prepared for just how well his ability to increasingly impregnate women with his amulet would work and get them to fall for him. Kim's crazy story was true after all. It certainly explained why there were so many pregnant women in the city, after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon was glad to be having some guilt-free sex too. Things with Erin ended roughly, for sure. He still felt a little sad, a little confused, and a little angry, but a quickie with an octuplet-carrying Zoe dulled that a bit. When he was dressed, Brandon poked his head out of the storage room, looking around to make sure the coast was clear. Tyler may be gone, but it was still bad office etiquette to have sex in closets and being an intern didn't exactly provide much job security.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Brandon stepped out, he felt a hand on his shoulder and a belly against his back. \"Hello there, tiger~\" Clara purred. Brandon turned around to see his boss's pregnant wife grinning at him, her hand still tracing against him. \"You look a little spooked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm...um...\" Brandon sweated. Clara gave the closet door a light push and saw Zoe still trying to put on her non-maternity top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,\" Clara said, her smile growing. \"Looks like you've come around a bit,\" she teased, pressing a finger into Brandon's chest. \"Ready to go for another round? I could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-aren't you...I mean...\" Brandon worried. Clara was...super sexy, sure, but she always scared him a little. And with his newfound \"powers,\" making her into more of a pregnant goddess and having sex with her against his desk would be easy, but he felt strange having sex with his creepy boss's wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Clara said, her lips getting closer to his. \"You don't want me to tell Tyler about you and Kristina, do you? I'd hate to stress him in the hospital anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon continued to panic until he felt Clara's fingers against his amulet. Kim told him it didn't just \"create\" pregnancies. It transferred them. Brandon clutched his amulet and made a big wager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara let out a long sigh and prodded Brandon with her finger more aggressively and painfully. \"Look, I know you're young, but you have to at least keep your dick in your pants at work. Even Tyler could manage that.\" Clara's belly was back to being totally flat and any affection she held for Brandon was long gone. \"Get it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes,\" Brandon nodded quickly. She was even scarier without the belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may be the de facto boss while Tyler's recuperating, but I don't have the power to fire anyone,\" Clara hissed. \"That's the only reason why you're still here. Now get back to your desk and finish out the day. You spent long enough at lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes!\" Brandon nodded again, rushing off to his desk. Kristina was already sitting in his seat, spinning around slowly. \"Kristina,\" he squeaked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't forget about me. Good,\" she said, stroking her belly. \"Here, you can take the chair back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Brandon said, but as soon as he sat down, she went back into the seat, using Brandon's lap. \"W-whoa now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't seen much from you lately,\" she cooed, kissing him faintly. \"I feel a little frisky, but I don't want to go to the elevator again. Any good spots in this stuffy place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon felt his cheeks burn again. If the newly non-pregnant Clara saw her daughter teasing Brandon's erection at his desk, it wouldn't be a question of whether he'd be out of here or not. It was a question of whether he'd leave in tact or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure,\" Brandon panicked, seeing Clara walk toward him. He clutched his amulet again, worried about what Kristina will be like without a belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" Kristina said, hopping out of Brandon's lap like it was on fire. \"If I trip and fall in your lap, do the decent thing and leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Brandon gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\" Clara said, crossing her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" Kristina scoffed, mimicking her mother's pose. She didn't want to admit having any kind of contact with Brandon Page of all people. \"Can I go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go where?\" Clara sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, to Dad's hospital room. Anywhere's better than this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a pretty slow day,\" Clara nodded. \"Brandon, you can go home. I expect better focus tomorrow. Just because Tyler isn't here doesn't mean you're getting a vacation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes!\" Brandon nodded so quickly his ears rang. He darted to the elevator, shivering as Zoe shot him a wink from her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please?\" Ashley pleaded, clutching Alfonso's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashley,\" he sighed, trying to give a reassuring smile. \"I like you too and I'm sympathetic to your situation with your husband, but...be realistic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Ashley panted. \"We both like each other. I know we do. And we can have a sexual realtionship without it affecting our life teaching at the high school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not the issue,\" Alfonso said again, scratching his head. \"I want to be polite about this but...look at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley looked down at herself. Most of the front of the car was just her 11-baby pregnant belly. \"You don't like it?\" she said meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're one of the most beautiful women in the world,\" Alfonso said, stroking her cheek. \"And when you have your little ones, I'd love to take you in my arms and make you feel such passion...but until then, please, accept this.\" He leaned forward to kiss Ashley, but her belly kept him away. One hand stroked her amulet gently and her womb surged forward, pushing Alfonso back a few inches as she added two more babies to her brood. \"E-excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Ashley said, tears welling up in her eyes. \"If you want me, you have to want all of me.\" She gripped her hands against her belly. \"I'm pregnant. That's who I am. If you can't accept that...then I'd like to go home, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlfonso sighed and turned back to face the road. \"I understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley squeezed her phone out of her increasingly tight pants and texted Brandon while she fought off crying in front of her workplace crush. &lt;please come home soon&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A spokeswoman?\" Erin said, raising an eyebrow. \"For the mall?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For parts of the mall,\" Wendy smiled. \"Services for pregnant women. I'm sure you've noticed all the businesses we have catering to women in your...situation.\" Talking about pregnancy still felt funny to Wendy. After all, she found out she had a baby on the way just a few days ago and the father wouldn't talk to her about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but why me?\" Erin said. \"Catalina Corazon's a real celebrity. Stick with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our contract with Ms. Corazon has...faced an obstacle,\" Wendy said. \"Creative differences. But you're a local celebrity in your own right.\" She held up the newspaper with a pregnant (though not as pregnant as she was now) Erin hitting a golf ball. \"You showed the people of this town that a pregnant woman can do everything a regular woman...or a man can do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin stroked her chin. \"I see what you mean. But I'm young and I'm trying to enjoy myself lately. This sounds like it would be a lot of work that's not much fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can be a lot of fun,\" Wendy lied, forcing a smile. \"Especially as we try and compete with 'PregTech,' run by a couple of overly-ambitious women who think they can market to pregnant women better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PregTech?\" Erin said, stifling a laugh. \"That's a funny name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just some disgruntled mall storeowners and a local woman named Sarah Page,\" Wendy shrugged. \"Now, your salary as a mall employee would be-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you say Page?\" Erin said, her tone getting low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes?\" Wendy said, looking up from her iPad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in,\" Erin said, standing up slowly. \"I'm going to go take a colossal pee, but when I get back, I want a six-foot sub sandwich and a plan on how we can crush PregTech.\"</span></div></div>",

Mmph, I may need to buy something more comfortable from you\" Lania said reaching a hand out to katie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you person we just met so who are you?\" Katie asked puzzlingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" oh yes how strange of me.  I'm la- kim, Kim! I'm kim lanny. I overheard your names outside of that dreaded place. So as I was saying, Janice, you are a ferocious young attractive woman, yoga may not be in your tastes unless you turn down the spicy sauce.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, I work better angry\" Janice said rubbing her shoulders with her fists. Who was this woman, telling her she what to say. She was freakin Janice Wheeler! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" so, how has your pregnancy been coming along?\" Katie said, looking at Kim's large octuplet belly. She was amazed by the fact it was perfectly tanned even during a pregnancy like hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess it has been okay, I mean I should be asking you, you look like you have ten big ones growing side of you\" Lania laughed, rubbing Kim's belly. She was having a good time with the short brunette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"12 actually, it's been a bumpy ride, I'm so jealous, I can't get a tan, look how white I am!\" Katie said revealing her huge belly \"you know what, with all these babies, it would be easier to talk in cups, making me an L! Isn't that right D?\" Katie laughed, patting Janice on the back. \"So, can I rub your belly kim?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice groaned. It's almost as if Katie couldn't care less about this business. All she wanted was to rub women's bellies. \" I'm heading off.\" Janice grumbled. Katie and Lania were so deep in conversation that they didn't see her leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I rub your belly?\" Katie asked trying to hold herself back from launching herself at the pregnant slut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" only if I rub yours at the same time. \" Lania said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice needed to calm herself down, she needed a cooler head to  think what needed to be done next. Fishing through her pockets she saw the ad for Hayden's, the poetry cafe. \" hmm, I might go there tonight, but first some swimming is in order.\" She said waddling to the bus stop.<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca waddled out of the emergency ward. \" miss please, with your ultrasound we have no idea what's inside your belly! \" one of the doctors pleaded not knowing the deadly skills that the pregnant asian possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" look doctor, I'm fine, here look\" Rebecca said as she did jumping jacks. The doctor winced, worried she may go into labor, but nothing happened, in fact her quad filled belly easily bouncing along with her boobs. She couldn't do too many though, all those twinkies were taking its tole. Putting a hand on one of her large thighs  she yawned, the energy was quickly dispersing and the sloth energy was returning. The doctor sighed \" look, ethically I can't let you leave\" he said calmingly placing a hand on Rebecca's arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca's reaction was swift and brutal. Grabbing his arm, she spun him around onto his belly whilst breaking his arm. \" AAAAIIIIHHHHHHHH, GAURDS\" the doctor screamed out. Two security guards ran into the emergency room seeing the scene before them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" who hurt you boss?\" One of them asked, no one there looked like they broke his arm. Rebecca made her escape whilst everyone was tending to the doctors broken arm. Running down Rebecca fought against her sloth like nature. Entering another hall she could hear a familiar voice coming from one of the rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel lay next to Catalina who wrapped herself around the tall pale man. \" please can we go again?\" She asked like a school girl pleading as cutely as she could. For a moment her pride had left her, she had forgotten the DVDs and was just in need of sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" look, it has taken me a lot to do this, you are going to have to give me some time.\" Joel said reaching for a bottle of water. \" maybe in ten minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" no, listen here pal\" Catalina said sternly, her moment of peace gone. \" I am a busy woman, I have appointments and I need stress released, so we are going to have sex NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca barged the door open to see Catalina, naked on top of Joel, threatening the poor man. The door banged open, against the tablet with DVDs on it, sending them into the trash bin. \"Jesus Christ, haven't you heard of knocking?!\" Catalina said covering her large chest up. She couldn't do the same for her quintuplet sized belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, I haven't dealt with this before. Okay Miss Movie Star I am going to give a choice. You could get dressed and come with me, or I can show detectives that you can kill celebrities in new and exciting ways!\" Rebecca sternly said with a grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, how do we know a heavily pregnant woman like yourself can kill anyone?\" Catalina said smugly as she got off the bed and on Rebecca's level. Rebecca laughed at her statement, she loved to show off her talent when she had the chance. She brought up one of her now thicker legs. All that snacking and laying around put a lot more weight on them. She brought the leg thundering down on the bed side table, completely demolishing it. The contents inside were unsalvagable, it was a carpentry calamity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel hadn't seen this much power in a woman before let alone two pregnant women.  The women stood firm and confident. He wasn't sure whether to be worried or turned on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina used her extra height to be as menacing as she could.\"Do you know who I am? I am Catalina Corazon, yes I know I have had a troubled past but it just made me stronger. You want to know why I don't have a body guard? Because I am a woman who spent her time fighting off sleazy pricks, thugs and horny teenagers. I'm the spanish Dynamo, the fucking bitch dragon that will rip yah a new one, I AM-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Catalina could finish, Rebecca grabbed her by the arm and flipped her on her exceptionally large booty. Rebecca laughed as Catalina winced out,\"Okay, I get your point, ow ow ow, let me get changed and I'll go\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah waddled out of the office, Her twenty largely sized belly pushing open the doors she couldn't reach. She couldn't see past her belly, which looked like she swallowed two adults, or her breasts which were the size of beach balls.  After half an hour of searching she finally found the elevator. In her haste to the interview she had forgotten her surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another five minutes of waiting the doors opened and a woman in her early 20s in bright blue hair, a punk like outfit and pale untattooed, unpierced pale skin appeared. Sarah wasn't looking and as she attempted to get inside the elevator became wedged in the doorframe. \" oh god, are you okay?\" The woman asked looking at Sarah's incredible size. \" haha yeah, let me\" Sarah said pressing a few buttons on her armulet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors tried to close but nothing happened. She tried to press the buttons harder, but again her belly did not go down. \" damn, I may actually have a problem, could crawl underneath?\" Sarah pleaded to the woman on the or side of of her soft middle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so\" she said as she got on all fours. She paid attention to her high heeled boots, she didn't want to hurt the poor pregnant woman. The underside of her belly was incredible. Curiously she brought her hand up and lightly touched it. Sarah cooed as her hand traced her voluptuous belly. No one had touched her in ages. Any touch she received felt like heaven. The hand glided along her expanse like the wind on grass on a spring day. Her legs became weak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" please... before I crush you.... stop....\" Was all Sarah could breathe out. The punk quickly crawled out from beneath her. \"I'm... Sarah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you, I'm Blythe\" the woman said, handing her a business card. \" I am just visiting my uncle, white hair, eccentric man. Heard of him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" yeah, he is down that corridor, third exit on your left, down another corridor, door on second right. Oh but before you go, could you help me into the elevator?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlythe agreed and tried pushing her into the elevator. It was hard, she couldn't get the right way to push. That's when Blythe saw Sarah's incredible derri\u00e8re. Sarah was attractive before her \"pregnancy\" she had the best arse with a curve that looked like a soft peach. Now it had grown to twenty times that size, whilst remaining that plump state. \" I'm sorry for this\" was a ll Blythe could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Was all Sarah could say as Blythe grabbed her butt and pushed. Her hands sunk into her juicy bottom but it was just the trick. Sarah made it into elevator quickly and very easily. \"Oh...\" Sarah exclaimed rubbing her backside. \" thank you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" no, thank you\" Blythe said winking, she blew Sarah a kiss as the doors closed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>3 o clock showed its pleasant face as catalina was taken in hand cuffs towards the exits of the hospital. \" where are is the freaking exit?\" Rebecca said as they entered a waiting room. Pregnant women flooded the room, some there for check ups, others had \"unexpected growth spurts\" that night and some were there puzzled with why they woke up eight months pregnant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up Rebecca saw a plasma TV showing episodes of the hit supernatural drama show \"The unkown curves: in a city called Fleeton\". On the screen was a bimbo-like character stood up, in front of a jury giving a final verdict. \"As you can see, these ghosts have finally taken me too. I'm afraid in two days I'll stop being the high priced lawyer and become a, a, OH MY GOD!\" An orb like creature with several tails came in flying directly at the bimbofied woman. It flew straight into the poor gal. She collapsed as her belly once flat grew out, until she was nine months pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, I forgot this was on, I have to watch this\" Rebecca said pulling Catalina into the full room. They squished past every single sweaty belly, the aircon couldn't compete against the sheer amount of hot, sweating women in the room. Men had to leave to compensate for space. \"Can I take that seat?\" Rebecca asked an Indian woman who was sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a woman who is half as big as mine? Forget it.\"the woman said smugly, returning to her magazine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, maybe I wasn't clear, I WANT EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THIS ROOM OUT OF HERE BEFORE I START HAVING A BASKETBALL GAME WITH BELLIES!!!!\" Rebecca called out to the entire room. Instantaneously the room fell quiet and women started to  file out, quickly. Pushing Catalina down, Rebecca collapsed right next to her. Putting her feet up, Rebecca was offically back into sloth mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Half an hour went past and Catalina was still stuck. She could hear paparazzi trying to finder her outside the room. The choices were simple, escape the mysterious woman that has her hostage here, or deal with the bloodsuckers outside. Making her decision she waited till Rebecca was just about to fall asleep and in one brisk moment she jumped up and called out \"help! I'm held hostage in here!\" Every man with a camera heard her  and bolted for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bitch!\" Rebecca called out trying to reach for her. The door broke open to men with cameras snapping as Rebecca's reach only grasped Catalinas unbuttoned top. The shirt ripped down showing her voluptuous fun bags. In a moment of confusion Catalina tried in vain to cover herself. Sadly she couldn't with her hands chained up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed next was the security guard coming in, to a very delightful scene, arresting Rebecca who was startled by the mess and helping Catalina to her cuffs and a spare smelling guard jacket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina ran back to Joel's room, to find that he and her bra had checked out a while ago. \" it would seem the game is on\" Catalina said as she looked for the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill waited outside Antonio's office, he looked down the hall and saw Wendy talking to a heavily pregnant red head. Looking at his watch, he heard Antonio call out \"come in\". The muscular scientist pushed open the doors entering Antonio's office. There seemed to have been a few items missing.   \"What's going on?\" Bill asked, curious to what was going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing to be concerned about, tell me did you get the DVDs?\" Antonio replied getting up and stretching. His bones sounded like rattling dice as they loudly cracked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure do, here\" Bill stated putting a DVD into Antonio's laptop. As the menu came up Antonio realised something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bill, you have done wonders in the past few missions, but do you think Morgan Freeman would have been in a porno?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, why, what are you saying?\" Bill asked, fearing what came next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because if I am right here, and I don't see Catalina in any of these scenes, it is that YOU GOT THE WRONG DEEP IMPACT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntonio beat bill the best he could with the empty DVD case. Once he reclaimed his temper he heard the phone ring. \"Wendy! WENDY! Oh forget it, I'll get it.\" Antonio said storming over to the secretaries desk. Picking up the phone he angrily talked to the person on the other line. Putting down the phone he sighed rubbing his temples. \"Bill, can you please just do this? Go down to the jail and get Rebecca?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I'll bring her back here\" bill said, leaving the old man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon made it home and collapsed on the couch. Readjusting his pants from his time with Zoe, he gave a heavy sigh, he threw the phone to the other side of the house, not seeing the 5 texts from Ashley. He went up stairs, pulled out his nintendo 64 and started playing the legend of Zelda. In a time like this he needed some escapism. As he played through he water temple he heard a knock on the door. Putting down the controller he walked down stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the door was a heavily pregnant policewoman. \" excuse me is your mother in the house?\" The officer said politely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid not, might I ask what this is about?\" Brandon asked quizzically. A look of concern forming on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I am afraid it's about the owner of the residence, I'm guessing your father.\" The woman said, trying to be as delicate as she could to brandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley arrived outside her house and was almost ready to kill Brandon. \" do you know how long it took me to find you?!\" She yelled concerningly, not noticing the police officer. \" you weren't at work, you didn't answer my texts, what's wrong with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You texted me?\" Brandon asked \" wait hold on, you aren't my mum, what's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm so sorry\" Ashley said embracing Brandon. Brandon's head fit perfectly between Ashley's pillowy breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer stood there completely confused. \" I'm sorry, but Im afraid I have some bad news about your husband\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" oh what is it now?\" Ashley asked, annoyed at what he could have done now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" he was arrested in the business district earlier today for laundering money\" the police officer said bring her hat to her chest.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was only once looking closer that one could see it was in fact a large, tight, wet pregnant belly attached to an angry woman doing the backstroke. Janice had already swam nearly half a mile since leaving Katie in the lovely care of Kim. Before the amulet filled her with wrath (and seven full-grown fetuses), Janice would use yoga as her main form of relaxation and found it particularly helpful for expectant mothers. But now, Janice had to feel the push-back of the water and hear the crash of her arms and legs smacking through the gym pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doing ok?\" asked the woman in the lane next to Janice as the PregTech co-owner stopped to get a drink and catch her breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's it to you?\" Janice growled back. The woman looked at her in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't recognize me?\" Janice raised an eyebrow and took off her goggles. Now it was clear: this was Maritza, the same pregnant lawyer from the jail cell who helped them leave when Katie got bail. \"I haven't been able to thank you properly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, right,\" Janice nodded, turning and letting her belly rub up against the lawyer's. \"Always happy to help a fellow pregnant woman. We need to stick together. God knows this world doesn't think much of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lawyer smiled brightly, but turned when she saw her phone buzz on the dry pool deck. Drying her hands and flipping through, her smile only grew. \"Speaking of which, good news down at the prison.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\" Janice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just say they're not locking up any more pregnant women,\" the lawyer smiled, giving her brown belly a giddy rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanner buried his face in his hands. For years, he'd worked hard to be able to show up the rich society in Smallton. He wanted to get into the country club. He wanted to be able to buy his mistress better gifts. And most of all, he wanted to show up the arrogant Turners. Ashley and Tanner rarely shared many views nowadays, but they had one thing in common: they hated Erin's family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in his quest for money and status, he took work from a mysterious company tied with the mall to launder money and keep their massive business afloat. But now it had all fallen apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least I'm in a holding cell by myself,\" he sighed as the officer put his belongings in a small tray on a desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to keep men and women separated and our...usual cells are crowded with women right now,\" the officer said. \"New law and all.\" The officer's radio began buzzing and he quickly left the room. Tanner rested his head against the wall and took a few deep breaths. Within minutes, the door loudly opened again and three pregnant women strolled in, all looking at Tanner with an amused look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't think they locked up anyone but pregnant women in this town anymore,\" one Chinese woman with quadruplets laughed, rubbing her stomach as she looked Tanner over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do with him?\" A young black woman with sextuplets said, arms crossed. \"We broke all the others out, so it's only fair that he joins them. Then again, it's people like this that let their fear of independent pregnant women ruin our lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please, let me out!\" Tanner pleaded. \"My wife is pregnant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is?\" the third woman, a pregnant woman with olive skin, said. \"Then who is this?\" She held up Tanner's phone, scrolling through the various pictures of Kim he had, all from before Yaral made her exceptionally pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black woman gasped. \"Cheating on your pregnant wife? You're staying in here, asshole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Tanner yelled, running to the bars as the pregnant women stormed out. \"For how long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as we can keep you in there,\" the Chinese woman laughed, closing the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the station, one police car pulled in, with the two officers looking at the prison hesitantly. \"Do we go in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you hear? Preggos have taken over,\" the other officer whispered. He didn't want their passenger, an Asian pregnant woman arrested by a security guard at the local hospital, better known to you readers as \"Rebecca.\" \"I say we make a run for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one could blame us,\" the first officer nodded. \"But what do we do about her?\" As they turned around, the two young men saw an empty backseat, a broken pair of handcuffs lying down, and a badly broken door. Rebecca had used her skills and strength to break free and was already heading back to her apartment. Why did she escape? Simple: she got bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pregnant police officer, after giving Brandon a quick look-over and finding him surprisingly attractive for reasons she couldn't explain, headed back to her car, struggling to move the seat and get in. Ashley was pacing in small circles, her belly swinging around abruptly with each turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I have to go, don't I?\" she said, hands massaging her bare pregnant skin. \"He's still my husband, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ashley finally turned to the door, Brandon grabbed her wrist. He hesitated before speaking. \"Ashley, wait...don't go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't go?\" Ashley said. \"He raised you like his own son, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but what he did to you is inexcusable,\" Brandon gulped. \"You may not be my mom, but I still care about you. And if cheating on you isn't bad enough, he cheated on you while you're pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley looked into Brandon's eyes, feeling her heart race and her amulet pulsate. \"Brandon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put his hands on her gigantic stomach. \"You're carrying his babies for him and he neglected your needs for someone else. Even when you still look so-\" Brandon bit his lip, stopping before he let too much out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still look so what, Brandon?\" Ashley said, putting one hand over Brandon's hand on her swollen stomach, feeling light movement underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So good,\" Brandon said, his face turning bright red. \"You look beautiful, Ashley. The most beautiful woman in the world. E-especially now that you're pregnant.\" He hung his head. \"I...didn't feel this way until you got pregnant, actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley sighed slowly. \"I had a suspicion for the past few days that you liked pregnant women,\" she said, moving one hand to Brandon's chin. \"But to hear someone say I still look good when my own husband won't even look at me, well...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley leaned down, as far as she could with her fully occupied belly, and kissed Brandon on the lips. She let her lips rest there for a few seconds before breaking the embrace and fluttering her eyelids at him. Even now, with her amulet's lust at extreme capacity, Ashley wanted to wait and savor her time with Brandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mo...Ashley,\" Brandon whispered. Ashley just smiled and put one finger to his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be in my bedroom,\" Ashley said. \"I'll leave it at that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't need to even say that much. In no time, Ashley and Brandon were in her room, both undressing. Brandon watched in amazement as Ashley, as unbelievably sexy and pregnant as she already was, became like a butterfly leaving a cocoon as she came down to her underwear. Her bra gently cupped her maternal breasts, long beyond conventional cup measurements but still as soft and inviting as ever. Her thong underwear only came half-way up her plump butt. And of course, there was her belly: smooth, round, colossal. In Brandon's excitement, his amulet released the pregnancies he took from Clara and Kristina and Ashley's pregnant body grew again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brandon,\" Ashley said, looking down at her now 25-baby belly. \"Be honest. Am I...too pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon got close to the woman who raised him and ran his hands all across her bare body. \"Of course not. You're perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley unfastened her bra and slid Brandon's hand under the cup, letting his feel her naked, inviting bosom. \"Take me. I've wanted to feel this for so long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two kissed and stroked one another quickly, letting their tongues lash together and giving Brandon the opportunity to suck on Ashley's chest for the first time in his life. Ashley squeezed his erection, feeling one in her hand for the first time in nearly nine months. As their excitement grew, they had to figure out how best to proceed. Ashley was too big to ride Brandon on top, so he turned her around, entering the fabulously fertile woman from behind while feeling her amazing ass press against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley moaned loudly, squeezing her bedsheets. Katie was fantastic in bed, but she still missed feeling a man's member inside her. And Brandon's master amulet only made him more desirable to pregnant women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Brandon, he was in heaven. It was a dizzying, confusing heaven, but he still felt himself enjoying every millisecond, drinking in the sensations until finally climaxing inside Ashley. Ashley was experiencing an orgasm of her own and as her body shook and convulsed, she and Brandon crawled into bed. He kissed and stroked her belly, worshipping it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good?\" Ashley panted, petting Brandon's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good? I'm great,\" Brandon laughed. \"I just had sex with the world's biggest pregnant woman.\"</span></div></div>",

Sarah burned through what little money she had left putting together her latest round of inventions. But now, PregTech would be up and running with what Sarah hoped would be its flagship products: her gear for expectant women like herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, another thought had been passing through Sarah's mind. Initially, her inventions for pregnant women were built around comfort and mobility: the robo-spine, the massager, etc. But since she discovered the power of the amulet, Sarah had developed her own devices for personal use: a machine to regulate her own pregnancy, even giving her the power to add or subtract fetuses at will. A sensor that allowed her to locate other pregnant women in the area. And most recently, a way to convert her womb into pure energy, which would not only make her pregnant permanently, but allowed for unlimited potential in the area of energy and health.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah gulped as she rubbed her belly slowly, her cheeks turning a bit red. When she initially learned she was pregnant, Sarah hated everything about it. Having a big belly, being sore and swollen, feeling kicking, knowing one day she'd have to raise all these children by herself. And worst of all, she was experiencing the miracle of life alongside her mother. But since Sarah learned her pregnancy was the result of some kind of magical amulet, she viewed her condition...differently. Making other women round with child gave her a guilty delight and she felt a camaraderie with other pregnant women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she could truly mass-produce her latest inventions and given women the ability to make themselves as pregnant as they want to be, as well as choose whether they even want to give birth or not, Sarah knew that could create a very different world. And not one she necessarily disliked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sarah waddled up the stairs and put her sample inventions back on her bed, she heard some low noises coming from down the hall. They were quiet,  but Sarah's senses were heightened as a result of her first brush with Antonio's pregnancy-energy device. Sarah crept as best she could to the end of the hall, her heavy, maternal body making the floor creek. Sarah got closer to the source: her mother's bedroom door, and didn't hear any interruptions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I haven't been spotted</i>, Sarah thought as she gently pushed the door open. <i>But all that moaning...did Mom and Katie hook up again? Why are those two the only pregnant women getting busy while I'm still</i>-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's train of thought halted abruptly when she saw who was in bed with Ashley. Brandon was spooning her mother's gargantuan pregnant belly, kissing Ashley between her enormous breasts. Ashley made the occasional moan and coo as she stroked Brandon's hair and back, her thighs rubbing together under the sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cellphone buzzing alerted Sarah and she hurried back to her room as quickly as she could, her own large belly bumping against the wall and banister as she moved. Brandon brought his head up, his attention too distracted to tell if there was a noise at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, sweetie,\" Ashley said, putting her hand against Brandon's cheek and kissing him, immediately putting Brandon's curiosity to rest. Still, Ashley opened one eye and looked at her door. <i>So you know</i>, she thought with a sigh. <i>Well, if Sarah didn't know already, she knows now: this household has changed</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in her room, Sarah put her phone to her ear. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, you sound as angry as me,\" Janice scoffed on the other end. \"Look, there's a march of pregnant women starting from the prison to city hall. Did you get the investor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Sarah said, one hand on her wide hip. \"I built PregTech when it was nothing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, then if we're going to really take off, it needs to be now. Because you know what's halfway between the prison and city hall, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah nodded. \"The mall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So meet me there. And see if you can pull Katie away from her spray-tan bimbo,\" Janice growled, hanging up her phone. \"So you're on our side?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Maritza nodded, toweling Janice off as she stood in the pool's locker room, pregnant and naked. \"It's not just the pregnant women in the prison. Through word-of-mouth, nearly every woman with an occupied belly knows about you three.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect,\" Janice smiled. She didn't need Joel anymore. When PregTech starts selling to this abundantly fertile city, she'd have enough money to support her babies and a legion of men ten times sexier than the lanky geek to care for her. <i>Still</i>, Janice thought, looking down at her glistening belly, <i>I will miss being pregnant...if only there was a way to make this last longer</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" Kim said, walking slowly behind Katie, who was pulling the possessed preggo with one arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm sure,\" Katie said, her grin seemingly plastered on. \"It'll be much easier to talk and r-rub each other's bellies if we go back to my apartment. Plus, I've got lots of clothing there you can try on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like to try and fit in more,\" Kim said, looking down at her half-naked body. Well, thanks to Kim's belly size, maybe five-sixth naked. When Lania possessed Kim, she was clad only in her bra and underwear, which would be enough to catch people's attention alone. Kim was always an incredibly sexy woman, with luscious breasts, an even bigger ass, and smooth bronze skin, not to mention a supermodel face. But add in her nine-baby belly and Katie was in heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She's hot, she's pregnant, she's naive, and she loves belly-rubbing</i>, Katie thought, cackling to herself. <i>This amulet is the best good-luck charm a pregnancy-loving girl could ask for</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katie?\" Kim said, getting Katie's attention back. \"May I ask you a question?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sure,\" Katie gulped, turning back to her current idol. \"Anything, Kim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When we go back to your place, are we going to...have sex?\" Katie nearly fell over when she heard that. Lania was still getting used to life in the physical world and could read expressions and body language well now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-would you like to?\" Katie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so,\" Kim nodded. \"I've already done my work, so I'm just here to experience things for myself.\" Kim got close to Katie, giving her a savory, if not novice, kiss on the lips. \"Let's have sex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie's hands were trembling as she pulled her phone out of her pocket, feeling its buzzing out of synch with her own shivers. \"Y-y-yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katie, finally,\" Sarah sighed, hurrying out the door. \"We need to get to the mall, quick. The marketing opportunity of a lifetime for PregTech is about to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Katie said as Kim studied the small woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got an investor and a mob of pregnant women, all of whom love us and PregTech, are heading past the mall soon. If we want this company to take off, we need to do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo sides of Katie's mind combatted one another. On one hand, she wanted to have sex with Kim so, so, so much. But the greed from her amulet kept pushing her and pushing her to go. And the more pregnant Katie got, the more influence her amulet had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she was persuaded with one simple argument: <i>If you get rich off of PregTech, you'll have pregnant women all over the world at your beck and call</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Kim,\" Katie sighed. \"I've got to go. Work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand,\" Kim nodded. \"I hope to see you again before the day is over. And may I suggest something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Katie nodded. Kim took Katie's phone and stuck it between the pregnant entrepreneur's breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easier access,\" Kim smiled, giving Katie another kiss before walking away. Katie stood stunned, not the least of all because of how great Kim's ass looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashley, you've got competition,\" she muttered to herself, unaware of the hooks Kim already had in Ashley's husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah waved down the next bus she saw, panting and sighing as she tried to get money out of her pants. Her pregnancy was growing faster than she could buy fitting clothes, so her pockets were incredibly tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No charge, ma'am,\" the bus driver said. Sarah looked up and saw a very pregnant woman behind the wheel, a knowing smile on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Sarah nodded, pushing her incredible maternal bulk down the tiny hall, squeezing into a seat by herself. Her head was still rocked with confusion and envy over what she saw in her mother's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy did Ashley get to have so many relationships when Sarah was just as good-looking and just as pregnant?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Brandon see in Ashley and not Sarah?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy wasn't Sarah the one being comforted and held, like Brandon used to do by rubbing her belly at night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hit Sarah as she brought her hand to her lips, shocked by her realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God,\" she said quietly. \"I'm jealous of Ashley. I want to have sex with Brandon.\"</span></div></div>",

The protesters were minutes away, just enough time for Sarah to set thing up. She had to take a specialised taxi because her large frame couldn't fit her through any regular size doors anymore. \"Jesus sarah, what happened?\" Katie said looking at Sarah's incredible size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" you aren't going to swoon over her too are you?\" Janice grumbled, to her Sarah was alway pregnant with twenty little ones,  or as they talked about before, a T size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I was demonstrating something in the interview and things went a bit haywire.\" Sarah said as she placed the first part of her invention down. The angry mob started to become louder as she got down on her knees to lock wires in. Sweat started to form on her forehead as she continued her set up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up!\" Janice shouted, trying to motivate Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to do this?\" Sarah quipped back just as harshly. Janice took a couple of steps back. The crowd was getting really loud now, they had mere seconds before they came around the corner. Finishing up, she pointed the invention at Katie and fired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you-Oh OH MY GOD, HOLY SHIIIIIIII\" was all that came out of Katie's mouth. Her belly was changing and the effect it had on her clitorus was incredible. She collapsed on the ground moaning in a sea of orgasmic bliss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah smiled, \" okay pick her up, we need to go two blocks down.\" Sarah commanded as they saw the pregnant army come around the corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDashing down the alley ways Janice was running easier than Sarah. Sarah may have been a beauty, but she was not a sporty gal. \"Why are we doing this? Why not do all three of us at the same time?\" Janice said as they entered the restaraunt district. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because this beam always has always have an effect where after the being hit, the woman hit gets knocked out for I dunno, five minutes? Afterwords when they wake up they have a temporary energy boost for several hours.\" Sarah said setting her invention back up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for the location changes, my machine discharges a fermions that should direct the mob away from the police and through business district, away from the mall, but I just have to make sure the machine is set up to send them in that direction.\" Sarah said as she looked down at her watch. Katie was struck 2 minutes ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, say goodnight\" Sarah said pointing it at Janice. The beam shot out and hit janice who seemed unaffected. \" huh, is that i-oooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh MMMYYYY\" Janice's voice went from normal to a high pitched orgasm, she went crossed eyed as she collapsed on the ground her legs spasming out as she came. With a bit lip and a satisfied look on her face, she was out for 5 minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's invention let out the scents reminiscent of things like fires, gangs and gun fire out that would direct the protestors further away from the mall. Three minutes passed and Katie woke up on the hard concrete, a little groggy as the energy started to take its affect. \"Oh my god! That is one hell of a hit!\" Katie said as she rolled over to a point where she could jump up. \"So, what do you need me to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" okay, I need you to carry Janice down the alley way to the next barricade, I'm carrying the equipment so I can't help you. \" Sarah said, packing everything up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" hah! Sorry Sarah but Janice is the brawn in our team, not me.\" Katie said, putting her hands on her hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, just try to pick Janice and I'll tell you everything that's going on\" Sarah said as she picked up the invention. Katie scoffed smugly and did what she was told, picking Janice was incredibly easy. \"What on earth?\" Katie stammered out as they ran to the next street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's simple, the foetuses that were once in your belly have now become pure energy, energy has no mass so it weighs nothing! Basically it's like lifting a large helium balloon with a body attached, plus you have built up some strength from carrying how many babies?\" Sarah asked as she looked at Katie's belly, it wasn't as big as Sarah's twenty, but still quite impressive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget that now, why are we stopping here?\" Katie said as they entered another empty street. Placing Janice down she wiped sweat from her brow, she wasn't a jogger and the protestors were right behind them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so this is as far as we can take them from the mall, as long as they don't take brook street, we should be fine.\" Sarah said as she broke into an old building.  They left Janice unconscious on the bench as they climbed the stairs. \" okay so I have a vantage point from floor two. When the crowd comes around i need you two to calm the crowd, they should be fairly tired from walking. I will be firing the beam at as many women as I can, but I don't know how long the power source will hold out\" Sarah said as she opened  a window on the second floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Power source? Don't you mean battery?\" Katie said, as she picked up the invention. That's when she saw Sarah's amulet lodged into a power converter. \"Wait, do you have one of these?\" Katie pulled out the amulet from her bosom. Sarah was in shock for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katie, I will need to borrow that\" Sarah said, the envy in her starting to burn inside her. \" if you want more people to join our cause, I suggest you let me borrow that for power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie looked down at her beautiful amulet. It shined from the afternoon sun. It was all hers, she stole it from Brendan, she hadn't had this much fun in a long time, she wasn't going to give the amulet back. \"Forget it\" Katie said as she went to leave. Sarah quick stepped in front of Katie, with her hand out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid I can't do that, can I please have it\" Sarah asked again, more dominantly. Katie walked right up to Sarah, to the point where both bellies touched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, now let me do what you asked me to do\" Katie said thrusting her belly at Sarah. The impact caused Sarah to fall back on her juicy backside. Using her long plump legs, Sarah kicked katies legs from underneath her and she went crashing down. They struggled to fight, Sarah couldn't get her hands on Katie cause her boobs were in the way, Katie had the same problem, but that was because of Sarah's belly. By the end of it, they were rolling around on their bellies, unable to do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truce?\" Sarah asked, wiping swear from her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, on one condition, my amulet stays with me\" Katie said, stuffing the jewellery back in her cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but you have to do something in return\" Sarah said as she helped Katie roll onto her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay one last thing, DON'T let them go on Wallaby Way, that road will take them straight to the mall, a death trap for us.\" Sarah cautioned Katie. \" do your best to send them on Holliday way, which leads to the business district.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that should be easy\" Katie said as she pointed the displacer gun at Sarah and fired. For the second time that week Sarah was in heaven. Every inch of her belly felt like it was being stimulated, she screamed to the heavens as she came on the dust floor. She collapsed as Katie left and went downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownstairs Janice was just getting up \"fuck that was incredible, whoa\" was all she could say as she felt her belly become like a nuclear reactor. So much energy was surging through her. She turned to Katie. \"What do we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We get clients!\" Katie said as the mad crowd came around from behind the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Protest: Part 2<br>\r\n\"We send our message to Mayor Brower, get your ass off the ivory tower\" was heard through the streets of Smallton.  Amongst the crowd were pregnant women of all ages and races. The protest lead them through Woodfile road, up to the restaraunt district where some of the crowd got cravings and went in and  now a good 10 thousand of them waddled towards the empty street Katie and Janice were on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace was amongst the group of people, for a nurse her voice was loud and boisterous. She looked at the sea of multicoloured bellies, the women with smaller bellies lead the pack whilst the largest bellied women came up the rear, more concerned about soothing their bellies by rubbing them softly and gently. The largest there was a polish model with decatuplets, keep an eye out for her later. Every single woman shouted into the sky \"Remove the law you idiotic men, the future belongs to us women.\" As Grace continued marching, or at\u0142east doing her best to, she saw the only men in the sea of sexy forbidden flesh, Joel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here?\" Grace asked waddling past everyone to the handsome tall man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying to hide from a particular woman\" Joel said ducking as he saw a celebrity turn around. It was Catalina Corazon, the she demon that Joel slept with a few hours ago. Ducking behind a large asian woman, he narrowly avoided being caught in Catalinas eyesight. The celebrity headed to the front of the pack to get a better look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please you got to help me out here\" Joel said as he did his best to hide behind everyone. He looked at Grace and saw her large pale belly out in the open. He just wanted to touch that sexy belly of hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay I'll help you out, but I have to ask, why are you here in the first place? This would be the worst place to hide.\" Grace said as they came around a corner. Joel wasn't paying attention, he softly touched Graces belly, he caressed it, feeling it's soft yet firm presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oohh, how can you do that?\" Grace asked as they came closer to Janice and Katie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah woke up energy booming, she stood there waiting for the best time to shoot the beam out. As the ladies chanted, Janice and Katie stood there ready to stop them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We send our message to Mayor Brower, get your ass off the ivory tower\" they chanted, louder and louder. The crowd came closer and closer to the women, their feet were hurting but they weren't going to stop. Janice and Katie tried to hold them back but they were to much, they started to move past them, Katie needed to do something, and fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EVERYBODY SSSTTTTOOOOPPPPP\" Katie yelled at the top of her voice. The added energy from her belly turned her almost into a megaphone. Breathing out she realised where she was, a field of sexy, pregnant bellies. Janice saw Katie reverting to her ways so she thought quick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We understand you are in major pain. I am sure many of you remember us, we were in prison with you. We are Preg-Tech a new company specialising in helping the best kind of people in the world, THE PREGNANT KIND\" the crowd roared as she talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have taught many of you, in my yoga class, you may think the mall is the best place to go, but assure you, it's not. It's run by an evil man who despises pregnant women. We can help you. My friend Sarah is up in the building there powering her invention to make your pregnant lives easier and much more enjoyable, can I have a volunteer from the crowd please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA petite pregnant Indian woman came up. She was a size A, unlike the twinners and triplet holders in the crowd. \" now I assure you, this is completely safe, she will be knocked out only for a little while, and after that she will feel a surge of energy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd was quiet in suspense, even Cat, Grace and Joel were staring in suspense. Sarah shot the beam out and the small lady went down. The women were surprise by the beam but didn't really do anything, the effort they put into the chant had them exhausted already. They stood there, rubbing their bellies and talking.  One of the ladies from the country club was there. She was trying to direct them to the mall but she wasn't doing so well, this was her chance. \"This is all a trick!\" She called out. As she looked around, she could tell people started to agree with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women started leave, heaving their bellies down to the mall. \"No, please no!\" Janice pleaded. A quarter of the crowd had carried on their chat to the mall, whilst the others continued to wait. Sarah started to panic, she could see a celebrity in the crowd, maybe she could wow her. Desperation hitting her, Sarah launched her beam into the crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace saw the beam coming as it struck her. She was showered in a wave of incredible pleasure. Women were cumming left right and centre, a wave of pleasure came from the crowd. But Sarah's beam could only go so far, a third of the crowd had ran off in fright!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that were left were 5 twelfths of the crowd, less than half of the original triumphant protest group. Not only that two fifths of their remaining groups were now out of commission, fainting after orgasming. Catalina was one of the 4200 pregnant women still awake. Above all the bellies lay a clear path to the man she was looking for. Joel. She leaped into action dodging bellies before Joel could turn around. As he his eyes came into contact with Catalinas, he was too late.  Catalina glomped him to ground, the crash tackle/hug was one that left Joel on the ground, unable to escape Catalinas fleshy doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me miss, are you Catalina Coranzon?\" Katie said running up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure am, why?\" Catalina said, thrusting her hand down on Joel's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as you may have noticed, we had some trouble with our, uhh presentation. Do you think we could talk and ask for some pointers?\" Katie asked on a borderline of pleading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" yeah I can help you out, you seem to have an 'interesting' thing going on, but you must understand I don't just work for anyone, I am freaking Catalina Corazon!\" Catalina said, laughing. \" you may want to go after some of those people that ran away screaming though...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie knew what she meant, after they exchanged contact info Katie dashed off to the mall with Janice whilst Sarah  helped the unconscious women.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"It doesn't look good,\" Erin agreed as Antonio turned back around in his chair. He'd just turned on the local news, showing the pregnant protest heading toward City Hall. \"And they're all by the mall right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" Antonio croaked, coughing into his handkerchief. \"And pregnant women were, at one time, the main staple of this mall. And our plan for future development.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin had always wondered why there were so many stores catering to pregnant women in the mall. \"But these protests shouldn't mean all that business is going away. Just tell them you're on the side of 'pregnant rights' and they'll keep coming to your mall. And isn't Catalina Corazon your spokeswoman? She's probably the biggest pregnant celebrity in the world right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, Ms. Corazon has...decoupled from us,\" Antonio said. \"We want you to replace her as a spokeswoman. Specifically, a pregnant spokeswoman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin looked down at her large belly and stroked it slowly. She was certainly one of the larger women in the city as far as belly size, but did one winning golf game really turn her into that much of a celebrity. \"I'm not sure if I'm the right person. And besides, all you have to do is use your wealth to promote pro-pregnant political groups.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Popular support for pregnant women is being taken by our competitors,\" Antonio said, coughing loudly again. \"They call themselves PregTech and they'll take all our business if I'm not careful. I'm operating with low funds at the moment too, thanks to the police nosing around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PregTech? Never heard of it,\" Erin said, taking a fourth plate of food from Wendy. \"Thank you. Anyway, like I was saying. I don't think you need to be too worried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know my situation,\" Antonio said, trying to keep his composure as the disease ate away at him. \"That damn inventor bitch, Sarah Page, is on our heels right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you say Page?\" Erin said, her voice dropping as she glared at Antonio. \"And her brother is Brandon Page?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntonio turned over a few documents on his desk. \"Yes, that's right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take the job,\" Erin said, standing up abruptly before struggling to get her footing, thanks to her belly swaying back and forth. She headed for the door and Antonio stood up, his head spinning with dizzyness as he did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-where are you going?\" he asked, gripping the table for support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To go save your mall,\" Erin replied without looking back. As soon as she left the room, Antonio fainted, knocking over his chair loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Greene!\" Wendy yelled, rushing in. \"Mr. Greene!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There,\" Erin said, pointing to the group of pregnant women still headed for City Hall. \"Stop in front of them. Then run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Run? Why?\" said the young man from the movie theater, selected by Erin to drive one of the mall's carts out to the protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you're not pregnant and they're so worked up, who knows what they might do?\" Erin said, stepping out and waddling toward the women. As she got closer, she removed her shirt to not let anything obscure her massive pregnant belly. Many of the women in the crowd had naked bellies as well, so she fit right in. \"Ladies! Please, may I have your attention?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost women kept walking, but a few stopped and looked at Erin. \"What are you doing, my fellow pregnant sister?\" one mom-to-be asked, both hands wrapped around her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This protest is not what we should be doing,\" Erin said. \"City Hall won't listen to us. They don't understand. But there's one thing they do understand: money.\" More of the women stopped as Erin's speech started to come together. \"We should be supporting the one place that's had our interests at heart since we first knew we had something growing in our tummies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you with that PregTech tricksters?\" a Middle-Eastern woman with sextuplets asked, pressing her hands into her back to support her maternal weight as she waddled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, they're just what you called them: pregnant women trying to make a buck off of all of you beautiful, strong mothers,\" Erin said. \"No, I'm talking about the mall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The mall?\" the women said in shock. But then they started to think about it. The place was always crawling with fellow pregnant women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spas, gyms, clothing, accessories, and most importantly, the biggest food court for miles,\" Erin said. \"If we continue to support the mall, there will be a powerful business in the area that has pregnant women's interests at heart. The city will have to listen to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women were now all listening to Erin and some were nodding along while stroking their pregnant stomachs, but others weren't convinced. \"There's going to need to be a lot more renovation done at the mall if that's going to work. And more types of businesses we'll all want if you really want to be preg-friendly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She has the money,\" Barbara smiled as she to the front of the protest, belly proudly out and shimmering with oil. \"Good to see you again, Erin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" another woman in the crowd, a black woman with triplets, asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are all part of the local country club,\" Louisa said, waddling up to the front as well, joined by the other Book Club women. \"And we're part of the wealthiest family in the entire city. We will all be sinking our money into making sure the mall becomes a place for pregnant women, by pregnant women.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe even a place for us to have our mud wrestles,\" Barbara whispered in Louisa's ear, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had the same thought,\" Louisa replied with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why I recognized her,\" someone yelled from the back of the mob. \"She's that young pregnant woman who won the country club's golf tournament! She shows us that pregnant women can do anything another person can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we can do one thing they can't,\" Erin smiled, turning to the side and stroking her curves. \"We can create life.\" The protesters started to cheer, not with anger, but with joy as Erin looked over the swath of new mall customers. Her amulet glowed and her belly grew once again, leaving Erin pregnant with 12 babies while a few protesters had slightly smaller bellies. \"Now, let's go the mall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everyone alright?\" Sarah asked as the pregnant women, knocked unconscious by the energy beam's orgasmic side-effects. As they got back up and touched their surging bellies, they smiled at one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel...great!\" Maritza laughed as she patted her belly. \"Still heavy, but I have all this energy. And look, my skin has never been healthier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is pure energy,\" Sarah smiled, jutting her pregnant gut out. \"Not only will it give you what you need to complete your tasks, but your health will never be better. And, once modifications are complete, you can power your home with the energy inside your wombs right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long will it last?\" Martiza asked, hands never leaving her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For now, only about 24 hours. But as I improve it, hopefully, you'll be able to turn your womb into pure energy whenever you want!\" Sarah said to the huddled crowd. \"Imagine, pregnant women becoming the most powerful humans on the planet. All possible with PregTech!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd cheered again as Katie waddled close to Sarah. \"We'd better get them to our headquarters soon. They're all worked up now and who knows what will happen? They don't have your robo-spines yet but they're mobile enough to cause trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, let's go to PregTech now!\" Sarah yelled out. \"At the mall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did she say to go?\" women asked one another, having difficulty hearing Sarah over all the chaos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said it's the mall!\" one woman yelled. \"We need to start protesting the mall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, don't do that!\" Sarah said, but it was too late. The swarm of angry, big-bellied women was now headed for the mall: the one place trying to take Sarah's business away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what?\" Janice groaned as the mob left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah grit her teeth and started stroking her belly as she thought. <i>Why did everyone listen to Katie when she first talked to them</i>? she asked herself, envy still dwelling within her thanks to her amulet.</span></div></div>",

He sat on the edge of the bed, watching Ashley waddle around, her colossal belly hanging out as her full, naked breasts rested on top. Her hands were pressed into the small of her back. \"You like this?\" she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you look so beautiful,\" Brandon said, leaning forward as Ashley continued to stagger around. \"But it looks heavy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is heavy, sweetie,\" Ashley smiled, patting her bathtub-sized bump. \"But I haven't been able to model for anyone in such a long time. And I've been so proud of my pregnant body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it,\" Brandon said. Ashley grinned and turned around, gripping her dresser and twerking for the boy who thought she was his mother for most of his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've gotten bigger in all the right places,\" she cooed, turning around and clutching her breasts. \"Here, too. But best of all~\" she said, sliding her hands down her mammoth belly, still completely smooth and shimmering, \"this belly. I can't put into words how sexy I think it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-me either,\" Brandon gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then get over here,\" Ashley smiled, wagging a finger at Brandon. \"Let's share it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if Brandon knew what was going on in front of the mall, he might slightly change his picture of heaven. There were two long rows of women staring each other down and all of them had big, beautiful pregnant bellies sticking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You fell for their games over at PregTech?\" Barbara cackled, hands all over her bare, pink bump. \"You can't see how easily they're taking your money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were there for us when no one was,\" Maritza said, shaking her head and stroking her big, brown belly. \"The mall is shady and always has been. You're siding with the enemy of pregnant women if you go there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies, ladies,\" Erin said, walking between the rows of bellies. \"We're all pregnant women. We all know what it feels like to have kicking and movement inside your womb. We can have a reasonable discussion, can't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mall...does it promise pregnant energy?\" Martiza scoffed. \"Complete pregnant mobility?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has PregTech give you any of those things?\" Erin said, raising an eyebrow. \"You don't seem very mobile, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Erin sure is,\" Louisa smiled. \"She's beaten grown men in sports, even while she's carrying 12 babies. We don't need PregTech. We're strong enough on our own and we'll make the mall our own place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women started to grumble and got closer, their bellies pressing and rubbing together. Erin ducked out of the standoff and saw Sarah, Katie, Janice, and Catalina hurry over, with Sarah in the lead thanks to her spine. \"Ah, you must be Sarah Page. All Pages have ridiculous bellies, after all. It's all they can think about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erin?\" Sarah said as she stopped near the standoff. \"You organized this protest? That seems so...unlike you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm with the mall,\" Erin grinned. \"And we're here to stop PregTech.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir amulets glowed as they came into close proximity and the women in the standoff felt their bellies expand and knock each other off-balance. This only worsened relations between both sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm no fan of the mall, but we can't have this kind of confrontation,\" Sarah said. \"Please, tell your side to go in peace and we'll do the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't get what you want, Page,\" Erin fumed. \"Like your idiot brother thought he could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah didn't know where to begin but turned to her team. \"Okay, Katie, you did a good job last time. Try to move them, will you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katie? Tell them to leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, good,\" Katie nodded. She had a drooling smile plastered on as she watched thousands of pregnant bellies of all shapes and colors rubbing and pressing against one another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" Sarah said, rolling her eyes. \"Janice, you got anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'll rip their bellies right off for fucking with us,\" Janice growled, starting to march toward the standoff. Sarah put her belly in the way and placed a hand on Janice's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you're a little too worked up right now,\" Sarah sighed. \"And they don't listen to me too much...what do we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-hem,\" Catalina said, one hand on her hip, the other on her belly. \"You forgot one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you said you wouldn't join us?\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if I'm going to be out of the spotlight. I want to be PregTech's face, its spokeswoman, its persona,\" Catalina grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie snapped out of her daze for a moment as her greed flared up. \"I don't know if we can afford you, quite yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need much,\" Catalina smiled. \"My hate for the mall and...its owner are enough to drive me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're hired,\" Sarah nodded, getting out of the way for Catalina to waddle with more poise than Sarah thought was possible for a woman as pregnant as the jumbo-sized movie star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone!\" Catalina yelled, immediately getting the attention of both sides of the pregnant flank. People gasped and cheered, on Erin's side and on Sarah's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Catalina!\" women clapped. \"You're an inspiration to pregnant women everywhere!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, I'm very good,\" Catalina nodded, waving with one hand in small gestures. \"You all want to be like me but you know you never will. Please, quiet down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to tell them how great the mall is?\" Barbara shouted with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The mall is horrible,\" Catalina said with sly smile. \"And it's run by fools. If you want to be like Agent Foxila Moore in 'Bump With Vengeance' or the first pregnant superhero in a feature film, 'Captain Fecundity,' then you'll support PregTech.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe PregTech supporters cheered and anyone not already showing their bare belly tore off their clothes. \"What do we do now, Catalina?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We go home,\" Catalina said proudly, hands on her hips. \"Relax, get pampered, and wait for PregTech to tell us how all their amazing products and services can help us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConvinced by the pregnant film star, the line started to break down as a wave of bellies left the mall's parking lot and dispersed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do now, honey?\" Louisa asked Erin, who was chewing her lip and rubbing her belly. Erin's mind raced. She wanted to crush Sarah to get back at Brandon and this new mall gig sounded pretty sweet. And speaking of sweets, she had a craving for an ice cream sundae.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies!\" Erin grinned, raising one hand. \"We atta-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erin!\" Wendy panted, running through a wall of big, firm bellies to get to the newest mall employee. \"Wait, I have some important news.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Erin sighed, lowering her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Antonio is...incapable of running the mall any longer,\" Wendy said. \"He's been sick for years and it's become too much for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Erin sighed, continuing to rub her belly. He wasn't someone she'd loose sleep over. In fact, he seemed like a slimy guy from the beginning: the kind of rich creep she always tried to avoid at the country club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, in accordance with his wishes,\" Wendy gulped, \"you are now in charge of the mall's operations, especially its marketing toward pregnant women.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin's jaw dropped. \"You...there's no one else? Someone who's worked for the mall for longer than an hour?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntonio told Wendy very little as his breathing became erratic when she found him. But one thing was clear: amulet. He needed the next executive to have an amulet. Wendy called Rebecca first, but of course, she just said it sounded boring and hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Antonio wants you,\" Wendy said. \"What's our first order of business?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's convene a big lunch meeting,\" Erin smiled, her belly growling. \"Mom, you and the rest of the book club are my main team now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have plenty of ideas, don't worry,\" Louisa grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And everyone else!\" Erin bellowed. \"Please, show your support for pregnant rights and shop! Shop at the newly titled PreggoMall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiles away, in a tiny apartment paid for by a nursing student, Grace was moaning loudly while Joel was desperately trying to catch his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you've got a lot of energy,\" Joel wheezed as Grace's huge belly slammed against him again and again. \"You don't want to slow down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I want to go all night!\" Grace giggled, peering past her nine-baby belly. \"When I woke up and saw you there in the street, I was already horny. Now I've got endless energy inside me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel didn't know Grace wasn't talking metaphorically. As the target of Sarah's laser, she was able to ride anyone for hours and Joel was, to her, just fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel, on the other hand, was having noticeably less fun. <i>F-first Catalina, now her</i>, Joel groaned. <i>I-I think I'm developing a fear of pregnant women</i>.</span></div></div>",

Her powers were of no use at the protest, the levels of chaotic power were off the charts. The streets, were dead quiet. She heard a bird chirping as it hung out in a tree, enjoying the sunset. Off to the distance, Lania saw an asian woman threatening a random stranger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" look, if I have to ask you again, you will have to go straight back to the dentist\" Rebecca threatened the poor individual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear I don't know who the person in the picture is. \" the guy screamed, he was in horrendous pain, a single movement from Rebecca could spell dislocated shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on here?\" Lania Called out from across the street. She didn't have much time left in Kim's body, maybe she could do one last deed of good will. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get lost slut, I'm trying to get info\" Rebecca said, rubbing the mans face into dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, hold on, wouldn't there be an easier way of doing this?\" Lania said, her grasp starting to slip on kim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"please... He-lp meeee...\" The poor man cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" here lets, just, can you let go?\" Lania said struggling to remove the assassins hand from the short gangly Indian man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" buzz off\" she said pushing her off her. Lania was expecting resistance. She slipped, falling and hitting her head on a pole. Lania flew out of Kim's body, the sudden blow to the head caused her to fall out. Rebecca continued to interrogate the man whilst Kim lay cold. After a minute or two, Kim came to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU ARE A GEEK, SURELY YOU HAVE SEEN SOME GUY CALLED BRANDON PAGE\"  Rebecca yelled. Kim was too disoriented to recognise her surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eerrrrrr where, where am I? What happened?\" Kim barely said, her head was spinning. Rebecca realised the poor skinny man didn't actually know anything and let him go. Looking at kim she decided to help her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that, are you okay?\" Rebecca said as they both go up together. Their bellies rubbed together as they stood up. Rebecca could feel the energy still swimming inside her body, it was over stimulating her, she needed to calm it down. She pulled up her top to reveal her belly. Rubbing her tanned belly, she cooed as she calmed down. Looking at Kim's belly she couldn't believe how someone could be hat pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca's belly inflated with more energy. It grew to the point where it rivalled Kim's. \"I think I need to collect myself, do you know where he nearest cafe is?\" Kim asked the stranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two blocks that way\" Rebecca said trying to pull down her shirt. Angrily she pulled down fiercely and tore the bottom front. Singing she threw the torn bottom half away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, thanks\" Kim said as she turned to leave. She stopped then turned back \"do you want to come with?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um sure, I have had enough of work today anyway\" Rebecca said as they walked towards the cafe near the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanner sat in the jail, the foul smell of other people's sweat stunk up the air, a foul smell that would make a skunk puke. He had hit one hell of a low, and there was no way of escaping it. The jail doors opened and a very pregnant officer threw in a bulky looking nerd. \"So, it looks like the world is now run by pregazonian women\" the nerd said, sitting on the other bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" haha, good one\" Tanner chuckled, his mind temporarily escaping the world he was currently in. \" I'm Tanner, and you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In trouble, my boss owns the mall and I have failed my past couple of assignments. Chances are I am not getting out for a while. Oh, right, I'm Bill.\" Bill said as he lay on his bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know it's funny, pregnant women have to deal with carrying a child, sore backs, swollen feet, morning sickness and some really disgusting things, yet they all managed to band together and almost take this town by hostage\" Tanner said to his new friend. \" how did they manage to come into control of such power?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower... Lingered in Bills head, he was loyal to Antonio. But Antonio was fixated on power and himself. \"So, Tanner, what did you do before coming to this happy Chappy place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights dimmed as Tanner started his monologue. \"Well, I used to run a powerful technology company. We had the highest business in the east coast, I would bring my daughter in some days to check out the factory line. I guess that's what started her love of inventing. I was also laundering money at the time, so long story short, I get caught and thrown in here. You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? Haha, I came to this town after my fearless leader dominated a town in China, ever wonder why China has such a booming population?\" Bill asked laughhing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, should I?\" Tanner asked quizzically. \"What did your boss knock up all of China?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, geez. Well, kind of, I mean, he didn't do it himself\" Bill said, turning to face Tanner. He really shouldn't talk about the amulets, but this was some business man, what would do with the amulets? \"Okay I don't normally do this, but seeing as how we are going to be here a while, it will be good to have another mind on this. So my boss goes to small towns around the world and uses artefacts to gain incredible wealth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, with magic?\" Tanner said sarcastically waving his hands in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no, let's call it enhanced science. He goes to cities, makes as many people pregnant and then leaves, with fortunes of people's money. Sometimes the towns collapse under the stress of it all.\" Bill said trying to gain the attention of his new room mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I'm not buying it\" tanner said, going over to the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Mister Business, how do you explain the incredible amount of pregnancies. Currently 87% of the lady populous is pregnant, that means roughly one or two hundred women are not pregnant, not including the elderly and those under 17.\" Bill stated. Tanner looked back at him, he did have a point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baby boom?\" He tried to say back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding me? Not at this rate! Forty Six percent of this town is pregnant. I think we are about to say goodbye to Smallton.\" Bill said laughing \" if there isn't a city increase, we are going to see daily riots and a place run by local militia. I would say I'm currently in an okay spot. I should have been leaving tomorrow, but it looks like I am here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay fine, tell me, what's causing this babysplosion?\" Tanner said grumpily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, sit down cause you won't believe this. There are these series of amulets that are behind it all. The can increase or decrease the amount of fetuses in a woman's belly.\" Bill breathed out and then in again \" When it affects a woman's belly, time is rewritten and they have no recollection of what happened. The only exception is if they already knew about the amulet in the first place and what they can do\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so is there any way to reverse everything? A big reset button?\" Tanner asked trying to get more from fellow prisoner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, uh, uh, if I told you that, You may find the master amulet and destroy all my hard work\" Bill said laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanner slumped back into his bed, astounded. Maybe there was a way to reverse Everything, to bring life back to the way it was, before he cheated, before he laundered money, before all those stupid mistakes...<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of town in the mayors office, Hank Brower stood looking out at the town he governed. Today had been a big mess after enforcing the pregnancy act. He could be facing expulsion from office for what he has done. He heard a knock at he door, \" come in\" he said brushing some crumbs from his greying moustache. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn came his drop dead gorgeous secretary Frank. \"The forms for a revised pregnancy act are here.\" Frank said placing the pieces of paper down. \" I have to say this is a close one, what will you do to stop the vultures from coming in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my young apprentice, you see the community have already played their card, now before we see the council tribunal, I have to play this one. The pregnant ladies of Smallton will be given a luxurious amount of benefits to go with them following the new laws.\" Hank said, looking over the papers. \" to top it all off, we are going to change the name of the town, hold on, we were given city status this morning.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, what are we going to call Smallton?\" Frank said, rubbing his shiny chiseled dimple chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHank picked up his short list of names. \"We are going with the name from one of the fertility gods, Freyjaton. What do you think?\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The mall was bustling with pregnant women.  First gree floors were packed with bare pregnant bellies. Women laughed as their bellies squished against each other. Erin and her book club had them eating out of their hands.  Wendy squeezed past the fleshy labyrinth to get to erin. \"Erin, can I grab you for a second? \" she said as she got to the now famous pregnant woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two said their goodbyes and made their way to Antonio Greene's head quaters. All the pregnancy artifacts had left the room but his paintings remained. Wendy went to the desk made of rich mahogany and rubbed her slight bump. \"You know, I always wondered how in a town of pregnant women, you remained, well untouched.\"Erin said looking at the gorgeous woman. \" I mean I know you are a secretary but wow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well actually that's what I wanted to talk to you about.\" Wendy said, brushing her hands through her short black hair. \" what do you know about that piece of jewellery that is around you neck?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found it after I had sex with bra- Brent.\" Erin said, watching her words. She didn't want them knowing about her having sex with the enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that is actually a magic device that can create and transfer pregnancies\" Wendy said as she brought up her tablet. \"They were found ages ago by a crew that had Antonio as their campaign leader, some guy called Schultz as archeologist a British professor lady and some others. Apparently it was in some European tragedy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're kidding\" Erin said, looking at the gems in her amulet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, I'm serious. they took it to Australia to test it, Antonio got greed and after one false move he caused a baby boom. Before any disasters could occur they tried to shipped it away from Antonio to China. After China's incredible growth Antonio tracked it down and took what he found to America, which leads us to the past few days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay so why are you telling me all this?\" Erin said as she sat on the couch. She was so glad she was just wearing her skirt and bra, the t shirt was getting too tight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay so, we need you to follow on with what Antonio has made.\" Wendy said, bringing up a screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Antonio has made a business and a plan at will give us an unlimited amount of money, resources and other needs.\" Wendy continued to show the new CEO what they do whilst Erin chowed down on some snacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Basically his plan is to take the amulets from town to town, build up their populations to the point where they are bustling, then pulls in millions of dollars in revenue. We even have a team of scientists making inventions in a lab underneath.p the mall. Sadly over the past few days, a terrible sickness has struck him, which I believe is caused by this.\" She showed Erin security footage of Antonio pulling a gem from Catalinas amulet. Even the recordings were starting to be affected by the time rewriting, Catalina looked heavily pregnant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where is that gem?\" Erin said pointing At the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have no idea, our chief scientist Bill apparently was handling it whilst taking care of two intruders. After an unfortunate event he ended up losing the gem and a prototype weapon was destroyed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Wendy I'll do this, first we need to grab Bill, then we need a way to locate amulets and that gem. Who else do we have on our team?\" Erin asked, planning her next few moves. She stroked her belly calmly, she didn't want to distrust the little ones inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we have a large variety of people working around the mall but we do have someone that works with us called Rebecca, this 30 year old assassin.\" Wendy said going through the employees on her tablet. \" She was fantastic at what she does, at\u0142east until she became incredibly useless and lazy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, tomorrow morning I'm going to see what I can do to whip her into shape. But first I have some personal issues I need to take care of, if you excuse me.\" Erin said as she waddled out. Thinking for a second, she turned around, \" wait, did you mention lab?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara finally headed out of the theatre after the two massive films showed. \" you know what, I know it was a long wait, but it was great to see what happened in Heads 'n Tails.\" She said to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked through the mall booming with pregnant women. Everywhere she turned there was a pregnant woman with her top off. It was the biggest amount of pregnant women she had ever seen. Almost all of them were only wearing bras! Except for an asian woman and a woman with a fake tan. She walked up to the two but was bumped over by a large pregnant woman. \"What the hell do you think you are doing?\" The woman yelled in a polish accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I didn't see your, your\" Mara said, picking up her glasses. Putting them on she was confronted with an incredible pale white orb. \"Whoa\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that? Are you mocking my size?\" She proudly yelled louder. \" I am a proud pregnant polish model and you are a no body!\" Grant was busy eating a hot dog a floor lower when he heard the commotion. Looking up he saw Mara cowering as more pregnant woman started abusing her. Swallowing a bite he dashed for the poor girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She thinks she's better cause she isn't pregnant\" another woman chimed in. The amount of hormones in that floor was enough to collapse the mall. Kim stood with Rebecca away from the abusers. For once felt somewhat wasn't sexual, pity. Slowly she waddled through the large crowd to the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it, stop it everyone!\" Kim shouted, \" this is a woman, just like the rest of you. Just give her a chance to explain herself.\" The women quieted down and started to breathe, rubbing their huge bellies. The polish woman looked at Mara with disgust. \" hi, I just wanted to say sorRRYYYYYyyy\" in mid sentence Mara was grabbed by Grant and they bolted for the emergency exit. \"Well I tried\" Kim said as she and Rebecca went to the cinemas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" Grant said as they left the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you\" Mara cried out hugging him. Tears rolled down her eyes, she had never been through an experience like that before. They held each other in the light of street lights.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>An hour later<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah, Katie, Janice and Catalina walked into a massive warehouse. \"Welcome to 145 Trigger Street. We used this place for one of the scenes in 'Athena, Modern day Warrior Princess'.\" Catalina said as they walked around the empty place. \"After we shot it I bought the place so I could rent it out to companies, it looks like I bought it at the right time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say that again, man this place is incredible!\" Katie said looking around whilst rubbing her huge middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you know what, for a rich lady, you are all right\" Janice said, realising this is the first compliment she gave in a while. \"But if you think about crossing us, we will be on you like white on rice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's her problem?\" Catalina asked Sarah \"doesn't she know who she is talking to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, she is just an angry woman, it's surprising she is a yoga teacher\" sarah said as she leaned against a beam. Her phone started to buzz. \" hey, i have to take care of this, could you make sure nothing happens to 'the energy alternator'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, trust me, no one will take it. \" Catalina said as sarah left. Catalina was pissed about earlier. She wanted Joel so bad, she had never had anyone like him before. She almost had him during the protest, but had to choose a new business over a night with him. Even though a large percentage of the crowd had been struck by the beam, Catalina didn't get touched by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sarah left them Catalina walked up to the other two members of Pregtech. \"Hey, so you two are completely filled with energy right now huh?\" She said, trying her best to not look like she was asking for anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, there are so many things I can do that I haven't been able to do whilst pregnant. Don't you miss drinking?\" Katie asked the very pregnant celebrity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so much, it's been hell being lethargic. You know, I didn't get struck when that beam was used during the protest.\" Catalina said  seeing a mark on Janice's belly. \" I think you have something on your belly Janice\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here I'll get it\" Katie said, a bit too eagerly. She rolled onto her massive belly, grabbing her handbag she got water and tissues. Dousing the tissue she rubbed Janice's belly. Janice cooed as the cold wet tissue touched her belly. She had been in the muggy heat all day, from the sweaty jail cell which she cooled off from in the gym pool. Then there was the protest in the bleeding heat. She didn't notice that Katie had wiped the mark clean off, she was just enjoying Katie rub her massive belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeez these guys are kinda weird, Catalina thought to herself. \"Maybe you guys should test the alternator once more, Sarah can't be the only one to use it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, mmmm, oh yeah sure\" Janice said, as Catalina carried the esky sized machine over. \"Thanks, Katie, I think, it's done\" Janice had to hold herself back, she was on the brink of losing control. Katie stepped out of the way as Jancie fired the machine at Catalina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina gasped as the beam struck her. Her belly felt like a reactor filled to the brink with nothing but pleasure. Her legs started to wobble as she collapsed to the ground. She came heavily as she moaned out loud, her orgasm echoing through the warehouse. In five minutes she was going to be on the hunt for Joel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah waddle outside, her belly squeezing through the small side door. Looking at her phone she was getting a call from brandon. Envy burned inside her as she remembered that her mum had taken away her chance to be with him. Burying it all deep down she answered the phone. \" hey Brandon, how's things bro?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sarah, I have to talk to you, do you think we could meet up? Do you remember the bar we went to celebrate Joel's 21st? I'll see you there in 20 minutes\" brandon said on the other side of the line. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, see you then\" Sarah said hanging up. In the dark alleyway she stood wondering how the hell she would get there in 20 minutes. That's when she heard a crunch.  Spinning around she knocked over a trash can with her belly. Another loud crunch came from the shadows. \"Hold it\" called the person, a gun came out held by a delicate white hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't shoot, I have no money\" Sarah cried out. The armed assailant laughed and another CRUNCH came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" please, that's not what I want. I'm just here for the energy bill\" said the shadowy figure mockingly. Sarah started to feel different. Looking down she saw her belly shrinking by the second. All those month, her energy, her children, all gone. She tried to scream out in terror but nothing came out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her belly became almost flat(she had a lot to eat over the past few days) she looked up to see the shadow figured persons belly expand out into the light. \"Oh my god, I can see how this energy is the best!\" The woman said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you do this, you monster!\" Sarah said, I her now chubby figure. She started to cry out loud, she couldn't use her amulet, it was connected to her invention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" you know what else is hilarious about this?\" The woman said, rubbing her massive belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Sarah said, wiping the tears from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will never remember a thing.\" The woman said coming out of the shadows. Sarah stared straight at the woman, an intimidating mask on her face.  The masks gaze shined a bright light at her head, making her forget she ever had an amulet let alone how to use it, that she was ever pregnant, and she had any feelings for brandon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was there, on her knees, unsure of what happened. All she remembered was that she had walked out to talk to brandon. She walked back to see what everyone else was doing. Walking in she saw the three pregnant business women talking about their business. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I have to go, can you guys lock up for me?\" Catalina asked, throwing Katie the keys. Katie would have caught them if she weren't shocked to see Sarah's body. \"Sarah what happened?!\" She yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Oh I bumped into a trash can, but I have no idea why I'm in my bra only, do you have a spare shirt?\" Sarah said trying to wipe a smudge mark from her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why aren't you shocked?\" Katie asked Janice quizzically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Just because she is the only woman not pregnant doesn't mean we should hassle her about it, the public would be on her back already\" Janice said as she picked up the keys. \"So, let's meet up here tomorrow, get some gear in, okay? Catch you all later\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The newly titled PreggoMall was growing quieter as the evening approached. The many pregnant women who now increased their efforts to shop at the mall went home to their husbands, boyfriends, wives, girlfriends, or went to an empty bed. There was new pride in being pregnant and the women showed off their new maternity outfits, hastily redesigned to show off one's curves and bare belly rather than conceal them. And for many of these women, this was the first night they had sex while pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not every pregnant woman had left the PreggoMall. In a newly renovated room in the basement, tiki torches borrowed from home decor shops dimly lit the lines of hugely pregnant Book Club women, standing with their arms crossed, smiling at the dozen or so pregnant women from the city gathered there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When do we start the audition?\" one of the women asked quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As soon as the leader of the mall returns,\" Barbara smiled, her hands tracing her swollen middle slowly, enjoying the feeling of kicks coming from children her husband did not put inside her. \"Until then, get comfortable. Our audition will not be easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouisa turned and smiled as a door in the back opened and swung shut. \"Here she is now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies,\" Erin cooed as her steps thundered forward. The dozen women gathered quivered as they saw Erin come toward them. Or rather, her belly. Erin was pregnant with over 30 fully-grown fetuses and her belly didn't show a single sign of stretching or distress. Instead, it glimmered with more vigor than ever before. Louisa and Barbara moved aside to let Erin get to the small throne they made for her, easing in as her belly stuck out several feet. She, like the other book club women, only had on a bikini, with her amulet cozied between her breasts, fresh from stealing Sarah's pregnancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is everyone brave enough to want to join the mall's inner circle,\" Barbara said, pacing in front of the lines of women, her hands tracing their bellies. \"Should we have them introduce themselves or get started?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only want to know the names of whoever will join us,\" Erin said, smiling as one of the book club women placed a large bowl of pasta on her colossal belly. When Erin robbed Sarah of her pregnancy and her amulet, she also took Sarah's energy from the conversion laser and her robo-spine, allowing her to move around normally, despite her incredible maternal size. \"You will all compete for one open spot on PreggoMall's Board of Directors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women all nodded, rubbing their bellies eagerly. They were chosen from the largest pregnant women in the mall and they all wanted the prestige and the money that came with the position Erin and her cohorts held. They each stripped down to their underwear as Louisa dragged over a large inflatable pool filled with thick oil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The greatest pregnant tradition: oily wrestling,\" Erin grinned, rubbing her belly as she ate meal after meal. \"Once the mall is rebuilt in our image, we will have a place for true pregnant mud wrestling, but this will suffice for now. The rules are simple: if you are knocked out of the pool, you lose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne after the other, pregnant women got into the pool and were soon rubbing their bellies and breasts together, dripping with shimmering oil as they tried to knock each other out. Bras and underwear slipped off easily and no brawl ended without both women becoming naked. Erin grinned as she watched, seeing pregnant women vying for attention and prestige.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's right Brandon</i>, Erin smirked. <i>Pregnant women can take care of themselves. We are strong and we don't need you</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're all doing so well,\" Louisa smiled. \"It's a shame only one can join us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should make it an annual event,\" Erin laughed. \"Then they can all practice in the mall's mud pit year-round.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end, the competition was between two women: the polish model and an Indian woman with an unbelievably swollen belly. Both paced around the rim of the pool, eyeing one another, wondering when to pounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I'm late or whatever,\" Rebecca sighed as she interrupted the tryout, noisily waddling into the room. Close behind her was Kim, still hugely pregnant and wondering where she was and why she was still in her bra and underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be Rebecca Quo,\" Erin sighed. \"I'm in charge of the mall now. Antonio is gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool,\" Rebecca shrugged. \"Or not, I don't know. I'm just reporting back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who is she?\" Erin said, pointing to Kim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca looked over and sighed. \"Damn, I knew I forgot something. This is a secret meeting, isn't it? No outsiders allowed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What exactly <u>is</u> all this?\" Kim smirked, waddling forward, her arms crossed against her breasts. \"I know the town is controlled by preggos now, but still, this looks so weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like she said, we run the mall now,\" Barbara said, stepping forward. \"Which means we run the town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I want in,\" Kim grinned. \"My sources of income have dried up thanks to this thing,\" she said, patting her belly, \"so I need a new gig.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get in line, sweetie,\" the polish model chuckled, putting her hands in the small of her back, showing off her belly's size. \"The Indian woman and I are competing for a spot on top.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim laughed and hopped into the pool, thrusting her hips and knocking both women into the oil. They shrieked and tried to get up, but Kim had already grabbed each of them and shoved them out using her belly as a battering ram. In seconds, Kim was alone in the pool, covered in oil and smiling widely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting,\" Erin smiled, stroking her chin. \"Looks like we have our newest board member.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything's ready for the grand opening tomorrow,\" Katie sighed, rubbing her belly quickly as she admired the new headquarters of PregTech. Catalina's old movie set was a great spot, it turned out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have plenty of spines to sell and other services,\" Janice nodded. \"And since no one is giving jobs to pregnant women now thanks to the city's policies, we can pay women to help us build more. It's perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll show Antonio, or whoever that giant preggo who replaced him is,\" Catalina cackled. \"And all eyes will be on me...or us...no, I take it back. Me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever works for you,\" Katie laughed, wanting to stroke Catalina's perfect round brown belly. \"You'll make us money, so you can pull all the hijinks you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice just huffed angrily, continuing her work. \"Sarah should be here to help us. She's the one who's not burdened by a big belly, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said she had some business to attend to. Family business,\" Katie sighed, her cheeks turning slightly red. \"Her mom is...very pregnant, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know?\" Catalina asked. \"I've never seen her around. She sure wasn't at the protest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've met before,\" Katie grinned, biting her lip. \"Anyway, things look good here. I say we all go home and get some sleep to be rested and ready for tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina nodded and smiled, feeling the energy sloshing around inside her womb. There was no way she was going to sleep tonight. She was going to track down Joel and have the time of her life, especially now that she had the power inside her belly to keep it going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they all left, Catalina hurried out, using one of Sarah's inventions to try and track down the man she'd fallen for. Meanwhile, Joel had managed to escape from Grace's clutches, exhausted from an energy-fueled fucking session and no longer the same man he'd been before. As Joel stumbled down the sidewalk to get home, Catalina found him and meowed seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you again,\" Joel groaned. \"What can I do for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We weren't finished,\" Catalina smiled, running one finger down from her breasts to her popped-out belly button. \"And I've got enough energy to go all night long. What do you say, big guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, please,\" Joel whimpered. \"No more bellies. I can't handle more bellies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, come on,\" Catalina pouted cutely, waddling over to him. \"Bellies are in style now, don't you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Joel shrieked, running down the street as fast as he could. \"Grant! Grant, where are you man? You were right all along!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn,\" Catalina pouted, putting her hands on her wide hips. \"I'm horny and I've got all this energy. What do I do now?\" She sighed and waddled home, pulling Sarah's amulet out of her pocket. Since Catalina was the last one to use the energy converter, she held onto the amulet, recognizing it as Sarah's. \"I've got to remember to return this to her tomorrow.\"</span></div></div>",

I know you can't drink, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Sarah said, flagging down the bartender. \"I'll have what he's having. And keep my tab open. I think I'm going to have a very thirsty night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're drinking?\" Brandon said, turning to the woman he thought before today was his biological sister. \"But you're-\" Then Brandon saw. How could he not? Sarah's enormous pregnant belly was now gone and she was back to being the same flat-stomached, traditionally-sexy woman she'd been before he got his hands on the amulet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, busy?\" Sarah chuckled, taking a big swig of beer when the bartender handed it to her. \"Ah, that hits the spot after a day like today. Protests, new building, getting robbed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robbed?\" Brandon said, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some preggo took my robo-spine,\" Sarah sighed. \"Probably someone who doesn't want PregTech to do well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon had a feeling the robber took more than just her spine. He figured, since Lania in Kim's body told him his amulet was the most important, he could still remember that Sarah had become pregnant thanks to its powers. \"Sorry about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, we've already got more than enough spines to sell tomorrow,\" Sarah said. \"So, what did you want to talk about?\" Brandon let out a long sigh and Sarah cut him off. \"I think I can guess, actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead,\" Brandon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You learned you were adopted,\" Sarah said, rolling her eyes around, pretending to think hard. \"And...you had sex with my pregnant mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so loud!\" Brandon whispered frantically. \"You...you knew about that, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw you two lying in bed together,\" Sarah said. \"And I put two and two together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon turned bright red. \"I...I can't even imagine what you think of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah shrugged. \"I'm not mad, honestly. I always thought you were a weird goof, but if you can make Ashley happy, that's fine with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...I was her son for so long,\" Brandon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The heart wants what it wants,\" Sarah shrugged, drinking again. \"And I had a feeling you liked pregnant women, so at least someone is pleasuring her besides Katie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katie?\" Brandon said, shocked. \"From the maternity clothing store?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhmm,\" Sarah smiled. \"You and her have very similar taste in women.\" Sarah shuddered a bit. \"Geez, just thinking of Mom so pregnant gives me the heebie-jeebies. I can't imagine ever being pregnant with one baby, let alone the 25 she's carrying now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Then I won't shatter your illusions</i>, Brandon thought as he drank some more. \"Did you know you and I aren't...you know, blood-related?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only learned recently too,\" Sarah said. \"It makes sense, actually. Mom and I are such brilliant, strong women and you're such a fuck-up and a weirdo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True,\" Brandon laughed as he drank some more. \"So if Ashley and I continue to...spend time together, you're okay with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I, envious?\" Sarah chuckled. \"No, trust me, there's no an envious cell in my body.\" Thanks to Erin, she was telling the truth. \"Just, you know, treat her well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon nodded. \"I really have to now. Tanner's been arrested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arrested? For what?\" Sarah said, sounding more surprised than she actually was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some sort of financial fraud. I convinced Ashley not to bail him out after all the shit he's done to her,\" Brandon said, his tone getting darker as he finished off his beer and immediately ordered another. Sarah joined him in a second round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad there's one woman here who can drink,\" the bartender scoffed. \"The whole city has a baby on the way and we need women to bring in customers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah leaned forward. \"You know, I'm starting a company called PregTech and I have an invention that can make women drink alcohol with zero harm to her babies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? Well hurry it up then,\" the bartender said. \"Not that pregnant women bring in a lot of horny guys at happy hour, but it would be nice to at least have some more customers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you wouldn't mind investing in PregTech,\" Sarah smiled. \"We're opening tomorrow on Trigger Street.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I will,\" the bartender smiled, giving them their beers and heading off to talk with other customers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it...weird?\" Brandon said. \"You being the only non-pregnant woman in town?\" He wanted to see if he could jostle her memories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine with it,\" Sarah laughed, drinking more. \"And I can think of a few women who aren't, can't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Brandon could think of was Mara and he still didn't understand that, since he didn't know about her infertility. \"I guess so...\" He took another sip. \"It's nice to talk like this with you, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so,\" Sarah shrugged. Brandon's heart sank a little. The nightly belly rubs he was giving his adopted sister really brought them together and now that it was gone, they were apart again. \"By the way, your ex-girlfriend is running the mall now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's what?\" Brandon said, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, and she's colossal,\" Sarah laughed. \"Even bigger than Mom, can you believe it? No wonder you had the hots for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon's cheeks turned red but he also started to piece things together. If the mall was opposed to PregTech and Erin was now huge while Sarah was barren, Erin must have used the transfer to take Sarah's babies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say...did you ever have a necklace like this?\" Brandon asked, holding his up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That ugly thing? No way,\" Sarah laughed. \"But...the other PregTech women had one. And I think I left one with my energy conversion laser.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your what?\" Brandon blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind. Anyway, I'm not sure whose was on the laser, but Catalina Corazon used it last. I'd ask her,\" Sarah shrugged, turning to her beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Then that's who I have to go see</i>, Brandon sighed. <i>Get the amulet from Catalina, steal Sarah's babies back from Erin, and give it all back to Sarah</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon knew he had some more responsibility now, after talking to Lania. These amulets were dangerous but he'd struck a bit of a balance. But with Sarah losing hers, that balance was gone. He needed to restore things before he could fix this whole situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where does Catalina live?\" Brandon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already you're going to fuck other pregnant women?\" Sarah said, glaring at Brandon. \"What about Ashley?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you don't understand. I-\" Brandon said, but Sarah had already slapped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm starting to know why Erin doesn't hang out with you anymore,\" Sarah said, gulping the rest of her beer and walking out. Brandon sighed and hung his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay Brandon</i>, he said to himself. <i>Who else knows where Catalina lives</i>?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brandon downed his drink in a couple of gulps. He didn't like Sarah like this, the pregnant version of her would take the time to understand and not jump to conclusions. At\u0142east that's what he thought. Maybe she was right, Brandon thought as he stumbled outside. It was time to go back and see Ashley. There should enjoy his time with her before he goes back to uni next week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides he thought to himself as he opened the bar doors, he had no idea what Catalina looked like, he came close to seeing her face a couple of times, but it was always obscured by something.Crossing the street he didn't pay attention to the red hot force running straight into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brandon!\" Joel yelled as they crashed to the ground, \" quick follow me\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two ran behind a dumpster as Catalina dashed through the streets. Snarling like a velociraptor she tried to tap Sarah's gps. It flickered then turned off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whose, the crazy spanish lady?\" Brandon said to Joel, trying to hold his head up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SSSHHHHHH This celebrity stalker bitch, I banged her once and now she's tagged me and wants me as her slave.\" Joel whispered as the watched Catalina get frustrated and continued searching. Catalinas large decatuplet belly started to grumble. \"Mmm, it is getting late, I'll find you, you sexual beast, tomorrow, this celebrity needs tacos...\" Catalina said waddling off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" talk about crazy, how could she be a celebrity?\" Brandon said laughing. \"You need some place to hide?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, mind if crash at yours?\" Joel said keeping a constant lookout for Catalina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, I was gunna do something but, BUURP! She would hate to see me like this\" Brandon said wiping his mouth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much! Do you remember the shortcut through the mini putt putt home?\" Joel asked his drunk friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but no games tonight, I have had a few.\" Brandon said as he lead Joel through the alleyway. They walked up to the abandoned public school where Brandon acted like as an agent whilst Joel humoured him by joining in. Exiting carefully over a barb wired fence they walked along the river side footpath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brandon, why have you stopped hanging with Grant and I? I mean, you know how Grant was after Kevin went to alberqureci, so why have you stopped hanging with us?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon was shocked, he had no idea he was neglecting his friends. \" I had no idea, I am so sorry! I just, have been through so much\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? What's going on?\" Joel asked, concerned for his mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found out I was adopted\" Brandon said, looking down at his shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit man, I'm sorry.\" Joel said, shocked at what he was hearing. \" what are you going to do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I don't know, I have 2 more days at work, but my boss most likely won't be back, he had a car accident. I also found out Sarah knows about my, um fetish\" Brandon said, crashing to the grass. The alcohol was still affecting his physical self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, I have a fetish too, well at\u0142east I had.\" Joel said lying down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you probably would be sick at the thought of mine\" Brandon depressingly said, looking at the sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, my fetish has put a curve on the female populous\" Joel laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon looked at him for a second. \"Wait, you like pregnant women?\" He guessed by the supposed pun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! How the hell did you figure that out?\" Joel stammered out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please, curve?\" Brandon said laughing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was talking about the curve in the population. Shit, yeah, haha, stupid me.\" Joel said chuckling at his idiocy. \"I mean, I was until I started getting swamped by pregnant women. I mean, I know Catalina was hot, but she is ferocious! I just wanted to go home and relax when she comes out of no where and starts having her way with me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might have been sexually assaulted, I think.\" Brandon said pulling a six pack from his bag. \"Well, if it helps, I have a pregnant fetish too. Hey look!\" Brandon said pointing at the fake lighthouse from the putt putt course. He passed Joel a beer as they traversed the river to get to the putt putt course.  If it weren't for the giant rocks in the water they would be soaked from the waist down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ran up the hill to the putt putt course and climbed over the fence. The moon illuminated the area. The putt putt course was empty. The only noise they could hear was from the resident frog \"General Croaks\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey crawled behind the light house, manuevered through the  jungle stages and jumped over the frogs pond. Climbing over the fence was the real trouble, Joel didn't even notice his phone falling into the castle. With a hop and a skip they ran the last block to Brandon's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"book club\" stood around the now massive pool of mud, the one used for large mud wrestling matches. Erin and Kim sat at the front of the pool as the others duked it out. At first they wore bikinis to hide themselves, but they soon realised that they only made things harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara grabbed Belinda by her long black hair, tugging her into the mud. Belinda coughed as she tried to get up but was shut down by Clara. She might have been the only non pregnant woman here, but she could still hold her own. Clara placed her massive rear end of poor belindas face until she tapped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSPLOOSH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara was toppled by Louisa, who dived at her. Clara and Louisa locked eyes and began grabbing at each other. They locked into a battle of endurance, their large, dirty, bare breasts rubbing against each other. It wasn't until Louisa's foot slipped that Clara grabbed the upper hand. She twisted Louisa's hand around her back until she gave in, wincing in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Clara almost stood in victory, that was until Barbara swung her belly from behind her. Clara went flying. Luckily for her, she had practiced in taekwondo. Grabbing her wits she found out where she was going to hit and safely landed just inside the arena. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning back at Barbara, Clara's breasts free fully jiggled. Barbara stood in a stance that made her butt look super tight and braced for impact. With every footstep Clara's butt shook with great tremor. Erin and Kim watched with fascination. \"Having a non pregnant person on our team might be risky...\" Kim advised Erin. Kim had her own motives, men will be wanting to screw non pregnant women at any chance they get. She needed to get laid, and soon, so she needed to take out the competition. Erin heard Kim's advice. but chose not to respond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the last second Clara dived between Barbara's legs. Before the heavily pregnant woman could respond, Clara pulled her legs from beneath her toppling hate poor woman onto her fleshy, pillowy boobs. \"I give\" Barbara breathed in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople didn't exactly cheer when they saw the only non pregnant woman win. \"Clara, you have bested us all. Now for your prize, can you go to the spa room?\"Erin said, hugging Clara's naked, muddy body. Clara walked into the other room, closing the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can see here, non pregnant women are a threat to our safety\" Erin said as she gathered everyone over, making sure Clara couldn't hear from the other room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow, we start our war, we need to strike the non pregnant women first, gather them from near and far, I need them for energy costs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Clara?\" Bel said wiping mud from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, she just won, she just needs her prize.\" Erin laughed, looking at her amulet.\"go home, and await tomorrow's instructions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill opened the door to his apartment. \"Here, you can sleep on the couch\" he said to Tanner who followed him. \"Tomorrow we can start talking about what you are going to talk about your life, I need sleep...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, why are you doing this?\" Tanner asked the new friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just say amongst all this chaos, everyone needs someone, and you need it more than others\" Bill said as he closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanner looked up to the apartments ceiling. What will his life be now? What does his kids think of him? What about brandon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brandon, you fucker\" Joel said as they walked into the living room. \"You have Omega Battle 4?! That game was my business in primary school! Remember the weekends we played this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it was awesome\" Brandon chuckled as he opened another drink. \"Cheers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, don't you have work tomorrow?\" Joel asked his overly drunk friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but the lady that is the boss there has been on my back since her other half was in that accident and to be honest, I'm done with helping others...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Early that morning a massive storm struck what would be the last few hours of \"Smallton\" Mayor Brower was just reading his city naming speech for the last time when his 9:30 appointment came in. \" Ah it's finally good to see the man behind all those exceptional emails.\" Mayor Brower said standing up, greeting his guest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, its been hard, but I managed to leave the hospital with these crutches\" Tyler said, as he delicately manuevered to the mayors desk. \"I wouldn't miss this even if I wasn't able to use any of my limbs, now it's been a rough 48 hours, can we start from the top and work our way down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I understand. You have seen how many pregnant women are out there?\" Mayor Brower said, brushing some of the morning crumbs off his moustache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, funnily enough it was a pregnant woman that caused the accident I was in\" Tyler chuckled \" I think I even saw that famous Catalina person running through the hospital pregnant. When did she become so, *sigh*, big?\" He used to love Catalina, especially her pornographic films, but ever since the car crash, he felt like a changed man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes well, whilst you were in hospital, we had a massive protest through the streets of our ever growing community, women are demanding ludicrous requests because they are pregnant! \" Brower said as he poured himself a glass of water. \"Now I love pregnant women, sure my wife isn't pregnant, but we have a lovely daughter who is. If the pregnant women were able to conger that much force yesterday, then I am certain the dynamics of this soon to be called city be run by the expecting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" hmm I see what you mean, but don't these women deserve some rights?\" Tyler asked Mr Brower. Brower looked back at his guest with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, mate, we have been friends since you brought one of the first big businesses to my town, but you have to realise something. Today it's a list of demands, tomorrow they will want positions in our government, by the weekend they will have chairs in our chamber of commerce and next week I'll be out of office. This is a disease in our community and it needs to be put to a stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler didn't like what was being said by his friend, \"Howard, listen to yourself, look at what has been going on the city, you talk about chaos and your only response is more chaos\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please, I know what happened yesterday, those two gangs will be fighting each other for some time. The only way I will remain in power is if we funnel more of this chaos, they will destroy each other, then who do you think will come in and take out the ruins of the survivor?\" Howard Brower smugly said to Tyler. \"And I'm sure there will be a need for building businesses, to build this city into a metropolis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, will need to think about it\" Tyler said as he went to leave. The car crash made him realise how fragile life could be, he had given up a pursuit for an affair, he wanted a more ethical life, but this, couldn't be it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Tyler, you do like your position in the country club right?\" Howard said as Tyler went to open the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, why?\" Tyler asked quizzically to his older friend<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No reason\" Howard said as he went about his business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice woke up, her vision blurry and her bed closer to the ground than usual. \"Mmmm, the heart burn is doing a number on me today\" she though to herself, rubbing her large chest. Stumbling out of bed she went to the kitchen and poured herself a glass of water. Drinking it she waddled slowly back to bed, her vision blurry. All it took was a murmur from the bed to get her vision back to normal. \"What the fuck are you doing here?\" Janice screamed as Katie revealed herself from behind the sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you have no clue about last night do you?\" Katie smugly said grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm starting to remember, oh god we did it, didn't we?\" Janice said throwing her hands up in shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahah, yeah, I tried to say no us being in business together and all, but you were too forceful\" Katie said, lying back. \" you know what, that was fucking impressive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear to god, don't you dare tell anyone\" Janice threatened the short girl. Her wrath energy was coming back quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie chuckled and got off the bed\" oh come on, you know you enjoyed it. You couldn't stop screaming my name. How about we go for another round?\" Katie said as she approached janice. Her naked body shone in the morning sun, her nipples erect as the cool breeze blew in from the open window. Janice cooed as katies bare belly rubbed up against hers. \" okay, but you swear you won't tell anyone\" Janice said as they went in for a kiss. They started to kiss more passionately whilst their bellies lightly grazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I have just the thing\" Janice said as she went to grab something from her drawer. Katie crept up behind her, she didn't expect what was coming. Janice eagerly spun around, her belly colliding with Katie. The energy inside their bellies instantly erupted. \"Oh fuck!\"was all Janice could say as the two collapsed on the grow, orgasming tremendously in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrants place was relatively empty except for two em embers having breakfast and watching TV. On the screen was a broadcast from town hall, Mayor Brower was standing at his podium ready to make a speech. \"Thank you everyone for coming, the weather is horrid so we are hosting this talk here. I have brought you all over because today we are setting history today. Ever since my re election back 2 years ago, I promised that I would make this town into something big. We made a mall for the towns people, doubled the industrial side and added a new sports area for swimming, athletics and so on. Yesterday I realised something, we can't try to make our town equal everywhere, but embrace what makes this place great.\" Howard drank some water and continued<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I noticed yesterday that we have the highest pregnancy rate in America for one town and because of this, we are being granted city status. To commemorate this occasion we will be changing the name of Smallton to Freyjaton!\" The audience roared in applause as mayor Brower smiled. As he went to take questions Grant took remote and turned it off. \"Freyjaton, has a ring to it I guess\" Mara said, getting another spoonful of frootloops in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, seems a little strange\" Grant said as he reclined on his couch, putting his arm around mara. \"Hey look, I have this double pass to a certain con tomorrow, I was wondering if you wanted to join me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Thank you!\" But what about your friends?\" Mara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joel gave me the tickets not realising he had two!\" Grant said laughing, \"but he got something good out of it, plus we need to get out of this place, I don't like what's happening here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing left that was now normal with the mornings in the Page household, was that every day was surprisingly different. First it was everyone sleeping in different beds, then Sarah was busy in a delightful tale of being kidnaped and today came with smell of alcohol and corn chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe living room was trashed, a series of nostalgic video games lay infront of a tv that brandished largely 'GAME OVER' in big cybernetic styles. Brendan lay face first on floor, shirt unbuttoned and flavouring all over his mouth, Joel was curled up in the fetal position with a large blanket over himself, ASSFACE written on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpstairs was a different story. Sarah was like a caterpillar awaiting to become a butterfly, she had wrapped her curvy body in sheets and a large Doona. In the parents room Ashley was awaking to the strangest noise \"game over bounty hunters! No one fights the Cartel and comes out alive!\" came a screechy, gangster like voice from downstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on earth\"Ashley said wiping her eyelids. She looked around and saw her new lover had left. She gave a long sigh and then got up. Waddling over to the stairs she heard it again, \"GAME OVER, No one fights the Cartel and comes out alive!\". This was starting to weird her out as she made her way down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, is brandon playing video games till he drops again?\" Ashley said, as she made it to the bottom of the stairs. Rubbing her incredibly huge belly she waddled to the TV. She looked at the  screen, a scary space gangster came out with guns, scaring the poor woman, in a flash she grabbed the remote and turned the TV off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh brandon, I love you but I will never get your obsession with video games.\" Ashley said to the sleeping prince. She heaved him up and placed him on the recliner. \"I should make them some pancakes for when they wake up.\" Ashley said, rubbing her grumbly tummy. Looking in the cupboard and fridge she noticed they were as empty as the line to a men's bathroom in a club. \"Looks like I need to go shopping\" she said to herself, grabbing her hand bag and in umbrella she walked out to her car.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ashley struggled as she tried to make her way into her car. No matter how far she moved her seat back, there was no way her belly, now carrying over 20 fetuses for nine months now, could fit inside while letting her also drive. Still, Ashley twisted and tried, not even noticing that her ass no longer fit in the seat anyway. Determined to go to the store and get something to eat, Ashley reached for the seatbelt and tried to stretch it across her massive physique. It barely made it a third of the way around and the strap coming down diagonally was lost inside her unbelievable cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I'll have to walk to the grocery store,\" Ashley sighed, patting her pregnant stomach as her unborn children kicked inside her. \"I'll have to ask Sarah to try inventing a car for expectant women to go with all of her other pregnancy gizmos.\" Still, even as she made the grueling trip back out of the car, Ashley couldn't be too upset. For the first time in ages, she'd had sex with a man and it was the one person she'd had the biggest, most secret crush on for ages: Brandon. Now that he knew they weren't biologically related, the barrier between them had fallen and they were passionate lovers. Ashley grinned and giggled to herself as she waddled down the sidewalk, stroking her gargantuan bare belly to help stir her memories of their time together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer amulet, the thing responsible for the majority of her lust and her ultra-pregnancy, burned and pulsed as Ashley thought about sex and added fuel to the fire between her legs. Ashley couldn't wait to get back home, cook her and Brandon a big brunch, kick Joel out of the house, and then hurry up to her bedroom to fuck for hours. Ashley was frustrated with Joel, despite him being the one who first set the idea of her having sex with someone other than her husband into motion, but he never pulled the trigger. Only teased Ashley and pulled her along on a string.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the who truly cemented the idea of finding sex somewhere else was Tanner Page himself. When she learned he'd been having sex with another woman while Ashley was barely able to get out of bed carrying his children, it utterly broke her heart. Looking down at her belly, she traced the kicks and punches of her fetuses with her hands and cooed. \"Sorry you'll never be able to see the man who made you,\" Ashley said. \"But I can't let you be exposed to him. He's bad, through and through.\" She felt a lighter kick and smiled. \"If it was up to me, you would never leave my belly. I'd carry you all inside my womb for as long as I could...maybe your big sis Sarah could help me with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley hadn't been watching the news much lately because she was constantly lost in a haze of sex and lust, so as she got further into the city, she could see there were lots of changes. For one, almost every woman was extremely pregnant! None as big as her, obviously, but the smallest belly she saw was likely overdue with quadruplets. And like Ashley, they all had their shirts up to reveal their wonderfully round middles and some women only had on a bra or a bikini as a top. \"Looking good,\" one woman smiled at Ashley, walking up and rubbing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Ashley smiled. \"It's nice to see so many women showing off their expectant bodies. We shouldn't hide our bellies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree,\" the woman, a muscular redhead with an octuplet belly and a navel piercing, said with a grin. \"That's why I love living in Frejyaton so much. All the women here have the right idea about pregnancy. And soon, the men will too.\" She cackled and waddled away, rubbing her belly with vigor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's only one man I need to like my belly,\" Ashley said quietly with a smile as she continued her waddle. \"I sure wish I had one of Sarah's new inventions for pregnant walking...then again, Brandon said he found my strained waddle sexy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you look amazing!\" a woman with a 14-baby belly and dark skin cooed as she hurried up to Ashley, rubbing her belly against hers. \"I have such a big crush on middle-aged preggos. Mind if I take a few pictures of you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go right ahead,\" Ashley smiled, striking a few sultry poses on the sidewalk as her amulet burned against her bosom. \"I'm glad you like what you see.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where do you shop?\" the woman asked as she rubbed her own belly eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Ashley said with confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, you know. PreggoMall or PregTech?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley paused, stroking her chin. \"I-I don't know what PreggoMall is, but my daughter is one of the creators of PregTech, so-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is?\" the woman said with shock and glee. She pressed up against Ashley and gave her belly a long, sensual rub. \"Listen, since we're such good friends, think you could get me on the waiting list for one of those robo-spines?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I have to leave that up to Sarah,\" Ashley gulped. \"Sorry, she doesn't want me meddling in her business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman sighed. \"Fine. You're a good mother. That's what makes you so sexy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley shook her head in confusion as the woman with the camera waddled away. \"What is going on in this town since I was home?\" Making her way to the grocery store, Ashley saw aisles and aisles of big-bellied women getting lots of food, clearly letting their cravings get the better of them. Ashley kept being distracted by all the sexy women she spotted and knew, in this new pregnancy-centric city, she could probably get more than a few phone numbers out of her trip, but chose to focus on her shopping list. Besides, she had Brandon to take care of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ashley filled up her basket and waddled around, she was stopped in an aisle by a familiar tan belly. \"You!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello again,\" Kim grinned, her hands running up and down the sides of her massive belly while her other hand held a basket filled with luxury foods. \"How could I forget you? The reason Tanner ran to me for sex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley gripped her fists in anger and pointed at Kim's belly. \"Are those his?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" Kim sighed, patting her swollen middle. \"All of these bellies popped up so quickly in this town, it's hard to say. But it makes sense, doesn't it? After all, you swelled up nice and large and so did I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know where my babies came from,\" Ashley said, placing her hand firmly against her round belly. \"We made them together and they grew inside me. And it doesn't bother you at all that while I was swelling and straining to create new sons and daughters for him, he was having sex with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Kim cackled. \"Not that I need him as a sugar daddy anymore anyway. I got a great new job that you'd be <u>very</u> interested to know about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You? A job?\" Ashley smirked, looking Kim up and down. \"You don't seem like a girl who gathered many useful skills in your lifetime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This belly is the only skill I need,\" Kim purred. \"I'm on the board of directors at PreggoMall and I've been learning a lot about our company. Seems our competitor is your daughter. And my boss is your son's ex-girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley turned pale. \"What do you mean 'ex-girlfriend?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never heard of her? She's named Erin and her belly would give yours a run for its money,\" Kim cackled, pressing her stomach against Ashley's. \"But the way I hear it, both PreggoMall and PregTech have ways to make pregnant women larger. Maybe I'll try and eclipse you someday. I want to give birth to more of Tanner's children than you. Just for fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're horrible,\" Ashley growled, which only made Kim laugh more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you around, big mama,\" Kim said, waddling away from Ashley. \"And be careful. Being pregnant at your age is no walk in the park from what I hear. Make sure your knees don't get too sore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley grunted and her breasts squeezed against the sides of her amulet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim's belly swelled forward and knocked over another woman's cart. \"Watch where you're going!\" Kim groaned, patting her colossal belly. \"I'm an important person in this city, you know.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah woke up on her stomach for the first time in days as her cellphone's alarm buzzed over and over. She groaned and reached over to hit the snooze button. Grabbing her phone, Sarah pulled it into her cocoon of blankets and saw that she had a voice message from Dr. Schultz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, now what?\" Sarah grumbled as she called the foreign investor back and brought her phone to her ear. \"Hello, doctor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Page!\" Dr. Schultz said with glee on the other end. \"I wanted to call to say congratulations are in order! I made the right choice investing with you and PregTech.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah rubbed her eyes, not realizing just how much she'd been drinking last night until it was hitting her now. \"Could you be a little more specific, doctor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The roll-out of PregTech is a huge success. What else would I be talking about?\" Dr. Schultz said. \"When I read about the protest outside of your city's mall with your main board getting in a confrontation with other pregnant women, I was worried I'd made the wrong choice. After all, with the amulet loose in this city, all pregnancies can become very dangerous. But you are in great business so far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Sarah said, trying to think. Katie, in her sudden burst of business wisdom (thanks to her greed amulet), must have set everything up while Sarah was off...doing other stuff. \"So my inventions are selling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little too well, it sounds like. There's a large backorder,\" Dr. Schultz said. \"But your partners have already put many of the city's pregnant population to help build your inventions and giving them jobs in the process. Between you and the revitalized mall, this city's economy is going to grow right along side its baby boom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the mall doing?\" Sarah said, not realizing just how serious the other side of the protest was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They have all kinds of new pregnancy-oriented shops open and room for activities meant for pregnant women. In fact, they're almost exactly matching what you and PregTech are doing,\" Dr. Schultz said, putting down his newspaper on the other end of the phone. \"Did you do something to piss off any of these PreggoMall people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indirectly,\" Sarah sighed, thinking about Erin's frenzy at the protest. \"But they can't do everything I do. I've got inventions on the way that they would only dream of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good, because I've got more bad news,\" Dr. Schultz said as he turned to his computer. \"It looks like the mall is planning to unveil its own version of your robo-spine for pregnant women.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Sarah said in shock, but then remembered her attack last night. \"That's right, someone stole the spine yesterday. They must have sold it to PreggoMall...or it was one of their employees who took it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd better start working on those new inventions fast then,\" Dr. Schultz nodded. \"But good luck. Glad I at least chose to put my money into an exciting company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he hung up, Sarah flung herself into action despite her mild delirium from last night. As she walked downstairs, she saw Brandon and Joel still asleep on the floor, surrounded by empty beer cans and bottles. \"Looks like someone had a worse night than me,\" Sarah sighed, wondering what her mother saw in him. She didn't care about Joel that much, but she needed Brandon to at least be alert. Sarah walked over and kicked him a few times with her foot. \"Wake up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon groaned and got up, looking at Sarah confused for a few moments. Then he remembered that she had her pregnancy stolen, likely by Erin, and her current lack of a belly made sense. Even without it, Sarah was still a beautiful young woman however. \"Sorry, crazy night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll bet,\" Sarah grumbled. \"I'm going to work and I have a lot to do. And if I recall correctly, you have an internship too. So figure out a way to get all this cleaned up and get Joel out of here while also going to work because I don't want to come home to a mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon nodded, but midway through, the memories his trip through the alcohol aisle fuzzed up became clearer. He knew he needed to restore Sarah's amulet-induced pregnancy to balance everything out. But for that, he needed her amulet, which Catalina had. \"H-hey Sarah!\" Brandon said, leaping to his feet. \"Actually, I don't have work today. Mind if I come help you at PregTech?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, so you can ogle at all the pregnant bellies in the city?\" Sarah glared at him. \"No thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, honest! I want to help. It was weird learning that we're not really brother and sister and I want to try to repair any relationship we might have had. It's not like I was doing nothing at my internship either. I can be useful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah crossed her arms and thought about it. \"Fine. If you step out of line, Janice will probably take care of you anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, just give me a minute,\" Brandon said, grabbing all of the bottles in one clumsy swipe. As he hurried out to the recycling bin outside, he got out his cellphone and called Clara, his boss while Tyler was in the hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Clara sighed on the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Clara, it's Brandon,\" he trembled. It was hard getting used to the way things were originally between them. Before he took away her pregnancy, she was set on having sex with him and blackmailing Brandon against her own cheating husband. \"I can't come to the internship today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine, it's slow here anyway,\" Clara said. \"This PregTech/PreggoMall thing has frozen the city. I'm sure glad I'm not pregnant during this chaos.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right, that would be bad,\" Brandon gulped as he hung up and hurried back to his sister. \"Okay, let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about him?\" Sarah said, pointing to Joel on the floor. Brandon groaned and wrote a quick note telling Joel where he was when he woke up and urged him to leave. \"Some friend you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're all busy,\" Brandon shrugged as he got into Sarah's car. Not long after they left, Ashley waddled back to the house, all sweaty and panting from her walk coupled with her heavy pregnancy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should try doing exercise again,\" Ashley panted, taking off her damp shirt and waddling around her living room. \"I haven't seen Janice in a long, long time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she waddled and stomped around, Joel awoke and slowly got to his feet. \"Hello?\" he said, looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello again,\" Ashley giggled as she rubbed her massive belly and gazed at Brandon's handsome friend. \"Remember me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel screamed and bolted out of the house, his experiences with Grace and Catalina giving him a severe fear of pregnancy. As he ran, he tried to think of where he wouldn't see any pregnant bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grant! Grant and Mara!\" he panted. \"Grant hates pregnancy and Mara can't get pregnant.\" He stopped on the corner and called his bearded friend. \"Grant? It's Joel...a convention? Mind if I tag along? I just...need to get out of the city for a while. Great, come pick me up at my apartment.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brandon walked into the factory where the factory line was being set up. \" how the hell are you guys working so ahead of schedule?\" Brandon said as he took out his note pad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, your boss's men came to me after they heard about the protest yesterday and begged me to help them with engineering up the production line. So, here we are!\" Sarah said as they walked towards the  managers office. \"See, they even installed cameras for free!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked through the assembly line, pregnant women and men were working in unison, however they did not enjoy working side by side. There were more pregnant women than men in this town now and many men were trying their best to assert their dominance amongst he maternal movement. \"Hey lady, move it, or at\u0142east do something useful with that belly\" a sleazy worker said, with a smoke in his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Get that disgusting thing out of your mouth and go to my office.\" Sarah snapped at the man. The man distinguished the cigarette on one of the machines and then walked up stairs. As Sarah walked up the stairs, brandon couldn't help but stare at Sarah's large behind. The food she had eaten over the past few days had gone straight to her butt. The two scaled the stairs up to the management level where the rest of the management team was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice stood at the head of the table, giving to orders to Catalina who was making sure her make up was on correctly, she had her mirror propped up on her belly. Katie was behind a laptop, trying not to look at Janice, the matter they had an hour ago still fresh in her mind. Sarah took her seat and advised Brandon to sit up the back. \"Who's he?\" Catalina asked, looking at brandon like he was a spy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my, brother.\" Sarah said as she arranged her sheets. \" Brandon? Tell them what you do\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Brandon looked around the room and just before he sat down he got back up.\"Oh yes, hi, I'm Brandon\" he said shaking Catalinas hand. Sitting down his hangover just hit him.\" How do you doOOHHHH GOD!!!!\" Brandon said as an incredible headache hit him. Everything went blurry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good god, Brandon what are you doing?\" Sarah asked her step son. \"Can you hear me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah, I don't think that's possible\" Katie said looking at Brandon, his hands holding his grabbing head. \" surely you can see he is in pain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's his own fault\" Sarah said walking over to him, kicking his leg to make sure he was still conscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you guys so loud?\" Brandon pleaded as he collapsed to the ground. \"Ugh\" was all Sarah could say as she grabbed brandon and dragged him onto the constructing factory line. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Brandon lay outside the meeting room, hearing every banging hammer, every chainsaw cutting and people calling out. The sleazy man who was smoking saw the poor hungover man and walked over. \" you okay mate?\" He asked, prodding the man who was moaning in pain. Sarah walked back inside and continued with her presentation, ignoring the agonising pain Brandon was going through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, today we will start working on three new inventions. Pregnant Women need to be more mobile, so we need to give them the ability to drive.\" Sarah said flipping her white board to today's agenda. \"We have to start working on constructing a biology department to help put an end to that horrible heart burn, Janice you will help me with that, you are a yoga expert aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice was fixated on Brandon's noises outside, sounding more and more like two moose mating. Spinning back around she said \"yeah, I'm such a yoga master, I'm so calm I can help find alternative ways to remove that heart burn. That stupid heart burn it's just like Joel, annoying, comes for whatever he wants and leaves, if I could I would crush that stupid pain like I would to that dick!\" Janice angrily said, remembering the man who put her in this situation. She crushed the China cup she was holding in her hand whilst looking at Katie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie spun around after seeing Janices threatening stare. Don't mention last night, not a word, was all Katie could think, she liked having sex with Janice, but she was a forceful character. \"And number three?\" Katie asked?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, Katie, Catalina, you will find and tackle a way to get PREG TECH to be the leading company in pregnancy needs here, we need a place to sell our products, so look into that too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man outside finally realised the pain he was going through, grabbing his noise cancelling head phones he put them on his head and brought him into Sarah's office, lying him down on the couch. \"There you go. The pregnant women are too busy to think of anyone but themselves...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca waddled into the mall, her sloth like nature had given her a wide behind. She noticed this herself and decided it was time to do something about it. This was going to affect her performance and with another pregnant woman behind the wheel of Pregomall she had to get into shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't just her mammoth butt that took all the fat either, her breasts were getting so globular that she couldn't zip up her tracksuit. Her cleavage bounced as her fat legs wobbled into the gym. She stopped, exhausted, not realising the energy her belly had converted a while back had now diminished. Her vision got blurry and almost collapsed, if it wasn't for a handsome man with a strong chiseled jaw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad I saw you come in\" the strong man said. \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Low... blood sugar... I think...\" Rebecca said as she pulled out a snickers bar. The man was impressed with how quickly she chowed it down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Frank by the way. So, are you looking for our prenatal yoga? It's my first day and my class is in 20 minutes.\" Frank said as he passed her a glass of water. Rebecca downed that too. \"Yoga may help you in your current, uh... Situation\" he couldn't help but stare at Rebecca's belly as she rubbed it slowly. He made sure he wasn't caught by pretending to look at one of the gyms flyers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" well, if you are the teacher, I guess it would be fun to try it out...\" Rebecca said as her breath finally came back to her. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Clara is doing fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe storm hit back at midday after what seemed like a brief window of sunshine. The clouds rolled in looking like a wall of darkness. Thunder boomed and lighting lit up the dark sky. People around town made sure they were inside for this storm looked absolutely monstrous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This wasn't the case for the mall though. The energy inside was almost electric, in some cases it was nearly literally. Erin was holding a press conference declaring she will be releasing new products every day until the end of August. The media had filled up the presentation room above the mall and everyone had a question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erin, CEN national, you have lived here since it was a small town, what would you say about this Titanic population and developmental boom?\" A reporter asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my family moved here because my dad owns a mining company that works around 120 miles directly South South west from here. He did his business in a diner down the road from here and that's where it all began. Things picked up and I was born\" Erin said as she looked out at the sea of faces. \"Businesses boomed and higher classed people started moving here. The town has grown but there has been a major boom in the past nine months. Look, I'll just say, I look forward to the future of this town; I'm sure it will be large, prosperous and welcoming to the smart and gifted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nodding in the crowd and a couple of claps as the press conference went on. \"Ray Roberts, channel 8 news, with almost every woman in this city pregnant, are you not afraid that this will  cause a mass displacement in city's economy and implode several of its businesses?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid I am not sure what you're saying, take for instance our line of devices to help pregnant women walk and perform certain tasks.\" Erin stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" yes, that's all good and all but those babies are going to come out, is your hospital going to be able to support so much labor? No pun intended, you are a very attractive woman Ms Turner but did you notice there are only 2 day care centres in town? What happens if they can't make it to the preschool?\" Ray lead further on. Erin saw one of her most fatal flaws, she hadn't realised that she would be giving birth soon, that she would have to support several young babies on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... um, I realise that we have been focusing on so much about pregnancies and not what comes next. I can assure you we just had a business close down recently in the mall and we will be setting up a day care there too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn attractive spanish reporter stood up. \" Marita Cardona from Wolf Nightly News. Erin, why did  Antonio Greene, a man who was successfully running a mall decide to leave the company and leave a woman pregnant with... atleast 30 babies due in a week or more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin's eyes became fierce, she was furious. First Clara dominates the mud pit without a foetus inside her and now this reporter thought she could ask such bitchy questions? She focused her amulet on her. Her belly grew out, fast, it was like a beach all was inflating underneath her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped when her belly was holding quadruplets. \"I'm sorry, I didn't quite hear the question, could you repeat the question?\" Erin asked grinning at what she had made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing her large midsection Marita repeated her question. \" sorry, I should speak up. I asked you why a perfectly good CEO- oh no\" Marita stopped as she felt her belly fighting against her restricting clothes.  The reporter's pregnant belly burst free from the cage that was her light blue shirt.  Marita was in shock, embarrassed by what had happened to her, \"I'm so sorry!\" She stammered out, failing to pull her shirt back around her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay turned around with everyone else, looking at the poor woman. For 'some reason' he was taking all the pregnancy related reports lately, and this was meant to be a break for him. Alas he still got to see some bare belly. Realising how embarrassed she must be he texted his co anchor Jennifer Armstrong [Jenny, you wouldn't believe what happened, you remember Marita from WOLF? her shirt just tore open infront of everyon, I'm going to go help her] <br>\r\n<br>\r\n[ why are you telling me this?] jennifer texted back [ you know the current report I'm doing, just get whatever details for tonight's show and leave]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[fine, I'm just gunna make sure she is okay] Ray texted as he went over to help the poor woman hide her exposed belly and breasts, maybe cop a feel of her belly as well.  Climbing through the maze of people he got to her and helped cover herself with his jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, wait aren't yo-\"  Marita started but was cut off. Lights, screens and anything else that was connected to a power port was turned off.There was a massive black out in the mall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on?!\" Erin asked Wendy furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There seems to be a power outage, don't worry the back up generator should come on.\" Wendy said assuringly. Sure enough the lights, cameras and everything else came back on, flickered then shut down again. \"Damn it\" Wendy said under her breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"all these cameras and the energy we have been using must of short circuited the generator, Okay people this is real, we will need to postpone this press conference, thank you. We will have people here shortly to help escort you out in safety\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLania flew around town trying not to be struck by lightning. Have you ever seen a ghost struck by lightning? No? Good. She flew right around the storm, making sure it would return and stay directly in Freyaton a little longer, it could slow down some of the chaos around town. Once she controlled the wind flow that was blowing the storm clouds she flew to a safer area away from the climactic part of the storm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sports club<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLania flew into the mansion, curious of what happens inside. She buzzed around, and travelled up the stairs. She heard talking happening from a room so she decided to investigate. She discovered a trophy room with what seemed to be a men's club. Duncan sat smoking cigars with his most trusted members of the club, his trusted committee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was his right hand man Ron, the sportsman master. He owned horse stables for the equestrian events, he trained the Lacrosse teams and is a golf course designer. Charles was next, his love for Alcohol was as big as the equator he called his waist line. He ran the media conglomerate that in Freyjaton. Douglas sat next to him, Erin's father was all to happy to be apart of the cigar Sessions. He owned the mining company and is one of the biggest founders of the club. Lastly was Tyler who was the man behind the country club itself, the man that constructed the town around them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me ask you something Douglas, has Erin seen Harold lately? He has changed since getting back into lacrosse.\" Duncan said. The smoke was starting to get heavy in the trophy room. Lania was finding it harder and harder to find her way. She spun around, making the smoke disappear, that's when she saw Duncan starring right in her direction. \"What the...?\" Duncan pondered. Lania panicked and flew out the window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flew through the blacked out mall, everyone was freaking the hell out, but there was security there to help escort them into the car park, where they could stay and not be in the rain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flew out, narrowly dodged Lightning as she studied the city some more. Next up was St Paul's Hospital. Women were coming in for their monthly check ups and ultra sounds. Tons of doctors were rubbing swabs onto some enormous bellies, one of which was a nurse who was making sure she was still just pregnant with 5 babies. Grace remembered earlier this week she bumped into the man she fucked yesterday and she felt her belly surge out, sadly the hospital had been so backed up she didn't get time to get the ultrasound until today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that makes nine healthy babies.\" The doctor said as he started to  switch off the machine. Grace was mortified, she had spent her pay checks on five cribs, how the hell was she going to support a whole freaking litter?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-th-that can't be right!\" Grace almost shouted as she rubbed the cream off her belly. Grace couldn't handle this, what was she going to do with her life? Single and a mom? Lania saw the poor woman in trouble so she thought she could take her mind off things. Unfortunately there was nothing she could do. Her powers were weakening and Yarals grip was becoming tighter and tighter in this city. She needed to find Brandon, if she could rest in his amulet she could regain the power she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Think of the opportunities,\" Catalina boomed, hands on her hips as she paced back and forth in front of the boardroom. \"You all have a chance to get exclusive access to a demographic that is quickly becoming the city's biggest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Biggest,\" Katie choked quietly to herself, eyes on Catalina's round middle as the actress-turned-executive wiggled it around with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pregnant women are the future of business here. Smallton is Freyjaton and the old way of doing things is, well, old,\" Catalina said, slamming her hands on the edge of the long table, letting her chest and belly hang down on display. \"So what do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boardroom was filled with the heads of the city's other industries, each looking at one another in confusion and fear. They were all men and what they viewed as the \"takeover\" by pregnant women made them worried for their own future. Until the mysterious PregTech reached out to them in what seemed like a life preserver thrown to a sinking ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the representatives sent to them didn't get rid of their fears. To them, Katie was the largest pregnant woman any of them had seen, even among the mobs of colossal women who went through the streets in a protesting mob. Her quietness, especially given that she was supposedly the one with the most business experience in all of PregTech, also made them lose some confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course, there was Catalina Corazon. She was already well known around Freyjaton from her role at the mall until recently, with her passionate rallies for more mall business to her costume changes to her prideful demeanor. And in such a cramped space, she was even more intimidating. Of course, since she'd worked at the mall, her amulet had made her belly even bigger, and therefore, she became more prideful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't help matters that Catalina had chosen to dress like one of her movie characters. She had on an open sports jacket with nothing underneath but black lingerie and a long blue tie that ran between her ample chest. She also forewent any pants or skirts, with a long pair of stockings covering up her legs instead. She'd also done her long brown hair up in a semi-professional bun and had a pair of glasses on for show. If any of the business leaders were familiar with the Catalina movie catalogue, they'd know she was Jane Knight, a corporate spy who tracked down the exporter who was secretly a drug dealer and had her sister, a police detective, murdered. It was the closest thing to \"professional\" attire she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-a few questions,\" one man said, getting over his fear to raise his hand. \"What exactly are we looking at as far as a return?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A return?\" Catalina cooed, leaning in farther on the table, trying to put her cleavage in his face as much as possible before her belly got in the way. \"You aren't convinced?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you say we're getting in on the ground floor, but it sounds like PregTech is just charing us a fee to recommend pregnant customers toward us,\" he said. \"It feels like...extortion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Extortion?\" Catalina cackled. \"Then wait 'till you see the women who run PreggoMall. Those are the real criminals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room grumbled uncomfortably, Catalina clearly hitting the limit in her business persuasion. She continued to move around the table with a catlike gait, trying to show her ass and breasts to as many of the men as possible. The truth was, as much as she wanted PregTech to succeed so she could promote herself and get back at Antonio \u2014 if he still had anything to do with the mall \u2014 what was on her mind now was sex. Joel had stirred something inside her and if he wasn't around, she'd have to get it from someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you give us any kind of model? Projections?\" another man said. \"Anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Projections?\" Catalina repeated, making her way back to the front of the room. \"Of course, we...um...\" She tried to look through Katie's documents and whispered to her. \"Little help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Katie said, her eyes still tracing Catalina's wonderful pregnant contours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Sarah said this was your thing,\" Catalina hissed, leaning down to try and get a better look at Katie's files. In the process, her creamy brown belly rubbed against Katie's face, only distracting the enormous mousey girl more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>C'mon Katie, focus! Focus! Everyone's counting on you!</i> Katie yelled at herself inside her mind, trying to find something to grab onto to take her mind off of the pregnant beauty in front of her. As in responding to her wishes, Katie's amulet let out a sizeable pulse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina was nearly pushed back by the jump in Katie's pregnancy. Her belly now rivaled Ashley or Erin's in size and may have even been a little larger. And as her womb expanded, so did her greed. The chief thing on Katie's mind was now money, not Catalina, and Katie rose to her feet as quickly as she could, which was not very.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Returns, of course,\" Katie smirked, hands rubbing her exposed stomach with glee. \"You see, pregnant women aren't like any other customer base you know. At least, not these pregnant women. They're stubborn, excitable, and loyal. The women who support PregTech support us like an army and if we tell them to buy from you, they will. Let me give you an idea of how it'll go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith deft and grace, Katie ran through the numbers for the gathered business leaders. It was an elegant monument to commercialization, capitalism, customer exploitation, and every dirty thing that went with it. Some of the men began to cry they were so moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I speak for all of us when I say PregTech has a deal,\" one of the men said, puffing out his chest and he reached out one hand to shake Katie's. \"PregTech is going to be the biggest force in the city and we want to be right there with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And maybe someday, the biggest company in the country,\" another man cackled. Katie smiled. That sounded good to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much,\" Catalina grinned, reaching a hand out to the man she'd narrowed down as the handsomest...or at least the least unattractive. Her hand gripped it tightly and stroked the back of his hand slowly. He pulled away in confusion and left with the other businessmen as Catalina pouted, putting her hands on her wide hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, that went well,\" Katie smiled, waddling over to Catalina and rubbing one finger up and down the slope of her belly. \"Want to...celebrate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celebrate?\" Catalina said, raising an eyebrow at Katie. \"It's the middle of the day. What exactly do you think we'd do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have some ideas,\" Katie cooed. Even when Catalina worked for the mall, she was one of the top three pregnant women she wanted to sleep with, behind Ashley and her daughter. And now that Sarah's pregnancy had been erased from her memory, Catalina was a very strong #2. \"So...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina continued to look at Katie in confusion when the boardroom door opened. \"Catalina, Katie, there you both are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brandon?\" Katie said, remembering Ashley's son vaguely, mostly from his episode at the PregTech headquarters earlier in the day. \"What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I need to talk with Catalina,\" Brandon said. \"My sister said you'd be here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina's eyes lit up. Not only was she already on the prowl for sex, but Brandon's amulet made pregnant women drawn to him. And, if he could say so, he wasn't too bad looking either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were looking for me, huh?\" Catalina smiled, waddling close to Brandon and rubbing her belly against him. \"Well...why don't we go talk~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what is the impact going to be on other businesses in the area?\" Jennifer Armstrong said, not having to hurry to keep up with Erin as she held a microphone to the young CEO's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assure you, we are in talks with other businesses,\" Erin huffed. \"PreggoMall's expansion will only help the city, not hurt it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you still haven't answered what happened to the mall's original board of directors,\" Jennifer said. When her co-anchor texted her, Jennifer was looking into the city's sudden changes to laws regarding pregnant women, but it became clear that the real story was here. Somehow, all of the events in Freyjaton were connected and the mall was one of the central points of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin let out a groan and turned to the woman abruptly, her belly smacking against her. She thought taking power would get rid of all her problems, but they'd only grown. She had new tasks and her hunger was only getting stronger. Plus, since she'd taken Sarah's pregnancy, she was feeling envious too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why does this woman get to be a slim bombshell while I work my ass off</i>? Erin fumed, her hand tracing her belly. Then an idea crept into her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to talk more, why not come to my office in about 10 minutes?\" Erin said, smiling slowly. \"It's in the basement, on the last room on the right. Just tell any guards I sent you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The basement? I thought the main office was on the top floor,\" Jennifer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the...real office,\" Erin lied, still smirking. \"Trust me.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Erin waddled slowly, her fingers tracing a small circle on the top of her belly as she chuckled to herself. She was currently pregnant with just shy of three dozen fetuses, but that wasn't the only reason she was moving at such a slow pace. The mall's blackout put everyone in the dark, particularly down in the extensive basement of the mall. Antonio stored away plenty of secrets down here along with the Smallton mall guts, but Erin stumbled across one thing of particular interest in her takeover of the business when it became PreggoMall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this really the best place to meet?\" Jennifer Armstrong asked, squinting as she tried to move forward. On both of Erin's sides, Joyce and Barbara were holding powerful flashlights, trying to illuminate as much of the passage in front of their new leader as they could. While they never thought all that much of Erin when they were simply members of the country club's \"book club,\" she made for an inspiring head of the \"pregnant revolution\" and she offered all the book club women plenty of power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, absolutely,\" Erin laughed softly. \"Ms. Armstrong, I couldn't help but notice that you're not pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...no,\" Jennifer laughed, holding one hand against her flat stomach. \"I guess not. To be honest, I'm new to the city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Erin said. \"How do you like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't so...exciting when I moved,\" Jennifer laughed again. \"It makes it more of a challenge to work as a reporter but I like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you ever want to be pregnant?\" Erin smiled, turning her head to look back at Jennifer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer looked down and smiled weakly, running one hand against her hair. \"I...have always thought about it. I come from a big family and I'm the oldest one, so my mother was often pregnant around me. But I don't think it'll be in the cards for me anytime soon. I'm single, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So am I,\" Erin said with a low, dark laugh. She turned to Barbara and snapped her fingers. The pregnant, young (for a cougar) executive on the mall staff handed Erin a candy bar which she ate with vigor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I heard,\" Jennifer nodded. \"I must say...for a young, single pregnant woman, you have remarkable maturity. Maybe I shouldn't have questioned your qualifications to run this mall after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, you shouldn't have Erin fumed as Sarah's residual envy flared up inside her. Thinking about her bachelorette phase only made her think about how Brandon was banging other pregnant women while she thought they were going to be together forever. She clenched her fists tightly and turned around abruptly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are,\" Erin said with a horrible smirk. \"Ladies, if you would.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoyce opened a door at the end of the hall and Barbara slunk behind Jennifer. \"What's...all this about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see,\" Barbara laughed, giving the reporter a hard push so she stumbled into the room. Joyce shut the door and locked it, making a deep thud as it closed. \"Is that all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so,\" Erin nodded, putting her hands on her hips as she beamed, happy in her victory. \"This would have gone much easier if that Rebecca Quo hadn't run off again. All of the old files seemed to say she was quite the asset.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When she was here, all she did was lay around,\" Joyce shrugged as she pointed her flashlight down the corridor, her hand tracing the side of her large belly. \"I think we saved time not having her here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" Erin laughed, waddling behind her two employees. \"Now, let's get to my office and turn the lights on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer banged her fists against the door, yelling for help as loud as she could. \"Don't bother,\" a woman's voice said behind her. Jennifer turned around to see the rest of the women who filled up her temporary prison. There were numerous pregnant women, some of them losers from Erin's tryouts for the PreggoMall executive staff, like the Polish and Indian pregnant beauties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd among them were two other women who weren't pregnant: Clara and her daughter Kristina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are we here?\" Jennifer asked frantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because that fat bitch is crazy,\" Kristina grumbled, her arms crossed as she looked around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I run...well, technically my husband runs a sizable business in the city,\" Clara said. \"I've been doing most of the 'heavy lifting' for years, but he got in an accident and I got to take the reins officially. So an investment opportunity falls into my lap: This mall wants to become an economic powerhouse with a redoubled effort and a plan to mobilize the pregnant population.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds right,\" Jennifer nodded. \"That's what everyone's saying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara scoffed, shaking her head as she looked Jennifer over. \"I wasn't buying it. No one knew all that much about Antonio Greene but I knew enough to not trust the takeover by a girl who's the same age as my daughter and looking like she's about to birth an orchestra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Timely reference, Clara,\" Kristina groaned, rolling her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need that tone from you right now,\" Clara snapped back. \"Just be glad we're not one of these other swollen women.\" All memory of their recent enormous pregnancies was taken away thanks to Brandon undoing his \"pregnancy transfers\" to them. \"So I started asking questions and Erin had me meet her and my charming daughter joined me.\" Clara turned around, looking at each of the glowing pregnant faces inside the room. \"And here we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...why here?\" Jennifer said, looking up at the ceiling. \"She can't seriously think she can just imprison us. Besides, there are hundreds of fanatically loyal pregnant women in this city. Surely there's a better way to hold us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash, Jennifer got her answer. An electric buzz filled the room and each of the women cried out in orgasmic bliss before collapsing. Everyone's belly began to grow and grow. For Jennifer, Clara, and Kristina, it happened at an incredible rate. Soon, each woman looked like she was pregnant with two sets of octuplets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worked like a charm,\" Erin smiled, watching this all happen from monitors in her office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we attach the energy convertors now?\" Wendy asked in a timid voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely,\" Erin nodded. \"This pregnancy energy transfer machine your old boss was working on is incredible. I may not be able to make it work the way it's supposed to, but I can get plenty out of these snoops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-and the women who tried out to join the executive board?\" Wendy asked, gulping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to show strength,\" Erin said, puffing out her buxom chest. \"And they're serving the mall in another way, aren't they? This is what they wanted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unconscious women were carried out by PreggoMall's loyal employees and put in a large living space set up on the other end of the basement. Each of them had a long clear tube attached to their popped-out navels that led into the wall. With all the wires securely fastened, Erin flipped the switches on a power board at her desk and all the electricity in the mall came back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It worked,\" Wendy said with a little smile, detaching the gasoline generator powering the security cameras and the \"energy transfer\" device. \"Ma'am, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, just call me Erin,\" the mall's leader smiled at Wendy, her belly rubbing against Wendy's comparably smaller one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...prefer working for you than Antonio.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin smiled and hugged Wendy tightly. \"Of course you do. We're fellow pregnant women, aren't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy blushed. \"You...you know, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't call myself the leader of pregnant women if I didn't, huh?\" Erin laughed. \"Now, I have a task for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything,\" Wendy squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The truth is, 'PregTech' is a dangerous enemy for us,\" Erin said, looking Wendy deep in her eyes. \"And I know they're still working on inventions. So I need a way to spy on them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spy on them...\" Wendy repeated. \"We have some mobile recorders we can use.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. See if you can find Rebecca while you're at it. This is her area of expertise,\" Erin nodded, sitting back in her chair with a loud smack. \"And...get my private chef to come see me. I'm still hungry nearly all day so I need to start requesting some more filling meals...that aren't too fatty.\"</span></div></div>",

On the way out she couldn't help but check out Catalinas sexy outfit and Brandon who was looking pretty good too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what is a handsome man like yourself here to see me about?\" Catalina asked as her finger traced the edge of the board table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" well I wanted to get to know who my sister was working with, I already know Katie and Janice is just a little bit bat shit crazy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHah, I know what you mean. So, I guess I would get to know you too. What kind of person are you? Surely there is an adventurous side to you\" Catalina purred as she took a step closer. She undid a button, revealing more of her juicy almond skinned breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweat started to form on Brandon's face, he remembered the incredible sex he had with Ashley and Erin, both of which were highly fantastic. Should he just continue having meaningless sex with woman after woman? Maybe there was more to life than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" Oh, um, Sarah said she lost a piece of jewellery and mentioned that you might have it.\" Brandon said remembering why he was there, trying to regain his focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina saw the poor mans struggle, she was no longer paying attention to what he was saying. She decided to help the man make a decision. She undid the last button freeing it from its cloth like prison. The shirt she was wearing was just  to clinging to her  huge ripe breasts. Brandon took a deep breath in, knowing the weight of his decision. Restore Sarah to her ripe state or listen to his second head. Breathing out he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you coming onto me Ms Carazon?\" Slyly with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think a celebrity would tell you?\" Catalina smugly flirted, smiling back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon chuckled at her comment. He took a few steps closer, his belly a whisper away from touching hers.\" if I was a director you would. But right now, I ready for your close up.\" His fingers gently traced over Catalinas large belly, her soft skin felt like ripe peach. Catalina had been longing for someone to touch her gently, her pride was conflicting with her desperation to have sex. The conflicting emotions were boiling over in her belly and after the energy rush she was given, all she wanted was pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon's lips came closer to Catalinas, they could feel each other's breath on their cheeks. As they both leant in to kiss they could feel a wave of pleasure consume them. Catalina cooed as Brandon continued to trace her belly with his hands and the tips of his fingers. \"I want you inside me\" she whispered into Her lovers ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon was already erect and his pants were already travelling to the floor, however he realised they were in a  board room with doors that could be opened at any minute. \"Just give me one minute\" Brandon said as he tore himself from the dark skinned Amazon and ran to the doors, barricading them with what he could find.  Catalina was getting impatient, how much longer was he going to have to wait? When he was final happy with what he had accomplished he ran back not expecting to have  Catalina pounce on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAMM! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon lay flat on ground, dazed, confused and still quite up for some sexual game. His vision was blurry but when he regained his eyesight he saw a massive belly weighting him down. It was a glorious sight to see, two very large breasts with aureolas the size of dinner plates stood above the gloriously large belly. Sadly he couldn't see Catalinas face, but he was happy with just the marvellous midsection of hers. \" Now I am going to fuck you, and there is nothing you can say about it!\" Catalina loudly told him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So wait, I have no say in this? You don't think I have some kind of say in this whole matter? I mean won't your sexy middle crush me?\" Brandon asked, \"I mean I want to have sex with you, I really do, I just think we should think about how we should do this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen here, This belly is full of energy, it doesn't weigh a thing, now his is going to happen, whether you like it or not!\" Catalina said as her fist clenched the carpet, so much energy was pulsing through her she was tearing the carpet from the floor boards. Brandon was starting to get worried but complied anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon brought his fingers up to moist pleasure centre and began to rub the edges smoothly. His touch would have been perfect for anyone else, but Catalina liked rough sex, all those years in the porn industry gave her a love for the pleasure that was given from pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hit me!\" She ordered, biting her bottom lip from the pleasure sure she was already getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know..\" Brandon started, becoming more and more uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOW!\" She screamed. In a state of shock Brandon whacked her large left thigh. Catalina moaned loving every moment. She reached underneath her and grabbed Brandon's member. In a motion she shoved it in her and started to ride it ferociously. \"Fuck, you're so, BIG!\" She panted as she rode the poor guy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon had never done anything like this before, he was starting to understand what Joel was going through. \"Hit me again!\"Catalina screamed, drawing attention to the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of he workers there was hearing commotion from the Brandon and Catalina. Walking up to room the man asked, \"is everything okay in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ssshhhhh\" Brandon whispered, trying to calm the porn star, but Catalina would have none of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MORE\" she screamed louder. She was in over her head. This was one incredible release for her. She teased at her nipples, gaining what she could from the sensitivity in her swollen aerolas. Brandon started to get into it,he started to ram her from his situation on the ground. He rubbed her huge midsection, which was sweating from all the effort. \"Oh-my-gooooddd\" they said in unison as they came in unison. They didn't stop for a good minute and brandon blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Brandon regained his composure he noticed he was free from Catalinas fleshy prison. Both of them lay naked in the board room in a busy office where they could get caught at any minute. What on earth was he going to do now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCommotion started to grow from behind the doors. Brandon started to panic. He got dressed and did the same for Catalina. Looking around he saw a door to a balcony that lead around the building. Picking Catalina up he carried her very easily out he door and away before being caught by the company that so humbly agreed to take them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking their way to the fire escape brandon made sure not to draw too much attention to himself. On the way out he noticed right in between Catalinas breasts was Sarah's amulet! Grabbing it he just needed to find the person who stole Sarah's pregnancy.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He decided since they couldn't exercise, that they would at\u0142east get to socialise and have a little bit of fun. Rebecca sat to the side, enjoying her cup of tea when she saw the women from her group clucking like hens in heir own little social circles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, remembering the adventures she had been on. There was the assassination of a Taliban leader, the time she brought Vladimir Putin to his knees and the business in Cuba, but what now? Was she destined to give up the life that life of gaining Intel on evil corperstions from across the world and just stop them? Or was she finally moving into a more stable time in her life?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again she loved the pay, the time she spent relaxing, oh so much time relaxing and there were plenty of benefits. She looked over at Frank as he got himself something. He saw his tight toned abs, arms with glistening biceps and legs that looked like they could make a treadmill sweat. It had been so long since she had a relationship too, it was very tempting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly for Rebecca Frank ended up making the first step. Walking over he parked his butt next to her. \"So, did you have a good time today? I hope I was as good as the last person who taught prenatal yoga.\" Frank said with a subtle laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" oh it was pretty good, I didn't meet the previous lady, apparently she sucked\" Rebecca said with a cute laugh. She almost hated behaving this way, it was against who she normally was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good. Oh, are you new here?\" Frank asked as he took a sip from his drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sadly so... I have had no one to show me around\" Rebecca said, trying her best to turn up the innocent look, something she had never done before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would be happy to show you around if you want\" Frank said with a smile, \" maybe after this horrendous storm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like that\" Rebecca said, a smile growing on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley waddled quickly through the rain to the Preggomall. She shook her umbrella and wiped the water from her belly. \"Sarah's gunna need a bigger umbrella for me\" she said as she walked into the crowded car park. As she was about to ask what was going on, the mall had completely switched back on. Lights, music and everything that could be powered was on and running at a supreme rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe few men and the masses of pregnant women piled back into the mall, making sure that they took full advantage of what was going on. \" sorry about that folks, welcome back to he Preggomall!\" The announcer said on surround system. \" Remember we have plenty of things happening today, up on he fourth floor we have try outs for the next model of Preggomall's line of lingere. On the second floor we are showing off the look of our new cooking show, which will premiere on channel 8 in two nights time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWomen were heading every which way, bellies were rubbing up against others, luckily enough these were still pregnant bellies otherwise they would have to change their name to orgasmall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley walked around and saw that everyone was in groups, chatting and having fun. Everyone was embracing their figures and it showed. For some reason, a few women started to look at her, then some more. By the time more than half of the women in the mall were staring at her, she had realised what her faux pas was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female populous had eliminated nearly their entire top half of attire and was only wearing a bra. Ashley looked down and noticed she was still in the ways of Smallton, afraid to show her belly. Stupid Tanner treated it like a disease  and sarah didn't want to see it, but thinking about it, brandon quite liked it and well, they quite enjoyed it together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing in she took the plunge, she grabbed the large cardigan she was wearing and pulled it off. As her head  came out from the cloth like prison she saw everyone looking at her. The top fell and the crowd erupted in applause!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouisa walked by, glad to see the fantastic work her daughter had accomplished. As she walked to the balcony she saw a commotion happening down stairs. Waddling down she  squished past other pregnant people and saw none other than Ashley siding with the people of Preggomall. \"This might be useful\" Louisa said to herself. \" Ashley what are you doing here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, Louisa, why are you here? Are they naming another bridge in your honour?\" Ashley said mockingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please please now, let's not resort to petty squabbles, I was coming over to meet you, Manu e Manu, belly to belly, with child both in utero before they come outero.\" Louisa said cheerfully with a big smile on her face. She raise her hands and continued, \"welcome you to our little utopia in the Preggomall!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, thank you?\" Ashley cautiously thanked her once enemy. \" wait, why are you doing this?\" Ashley stood her ground, as much as she wanted new friends, she wasn't ready to let go of old grudges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I saw on the news recently the business about your husband, and I started to think you know\" Louisa said as she got w glass of water from the bubbler. \"the men of this world have really had it good, but now is the time of the woman, the time of the pregnant woman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bunch of women cheered at her feministic call. \" come on, my fellow Amazon sister, let's show the world what we can do!\" The women of the preggo mall started chanting her name. \"ASHLEY ASHLEY ASHLEY ASHLEY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the heat of the moment Ashley got swept up and said \"I'll do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fantastic! Let's see what you can do!\" Louisa said joyfully. They walked up stairs heading to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ashley waddled slowly up the stairs, her enormous belly wobbling back and forth with each step. Louisa was waddling with much more ease in front of her thanks to the robo-spine PreggoMall had already ripped off from PregTech. Ashley couldn't help but watch Louisa round rear move around and felt her amulet begin to tingle. She hated Louisa for being rich and elitist but she always found her attractive, especially since getting pregnant. And that conflict only made her interest in Louisa grow. Of course, all of that was multiplied dozens of times over thanks to Ashley's lust amulet cozied between her gargantuan breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are,\" Louisa smiled, turning and showing Ashley to an all too familiar store. It was the maternity clothing store Ashley had frequented so many times, even when it was clear they had no clothes to fit a woman pregnant with more than 30 fetuses. But she liked visiting with Katie, and as it became clear, Katie liked visiting with her. She was the first woman Ashley had sex with while pregnant. If it hadn't been for her, Ashley may have gone crazy and jumped Brandon instead of waiting for him to open up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she here?\" Ashley said, her voice getting excited as her amulet pulsed, filling Ashley with memories of her time in bed with Katie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\" Louisa said, and Ashley's excitement died down considerably. Of course Katie wouldn't be there. She was working with Sarah and she knew her daughter was a difficult person to turn down once she got her mind on something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind,\" Ashley sighed, now looking around and imagining sleeping with any of the other topless pregnant women she saw in the mall. \"Why am I here? You want me to get a wardrobe change?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like that,\" Louisa laughed gently, leading Ashley inside the store. Once inside, Ashley could see that there were quite a few changes. The only thing it sold now was lingerie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley's face went bright red as she saw the images of seductively and scarcely dressed pregnant women around the store and shopping around. \"Easy, Ashley,\" she said quietly to herself, placing one hand close to her chest. \"You've got Brandon now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouisa didn't hear her as she continued to corral Ashley to the back. \"You know PreggoMall is trying to grow as a business, don't you Ashley?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I've noticed,\" Ashley smiled. Admittedly, she had other things on her mind lately but PreggoMall was still hard to miss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we need someone to help promote the mall,\" Louisa said. \"First it was Catalina, then it was my daughter, but they've both gone onto other things. So I think for our next move, we need to get back to basics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Basics?\" Ashley asked, her hands tracing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sex sells,\" Louisa laughed. \"And Ashley, if you don't mind me saying, you may be the most perfect example of a sexy pregnant woman. You've got it all: the warm look, the big breasts, the child-bearing hips, the ass that can barely fit your pants, and of course, the belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Louisa described Ashley's pregnant body, the enormous mom-to-be just got more worked up, her breathing getting quick as her amulet pulsed and burned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're trying to change the fashion sense in the city to be more pregnancy-friendly: no shirts. But that means we're losing a lot of money in tops so we need to replace it with bras,\" Louisa said, holding up a lacy silk bra. \"And we can't make up the costs unless we make it high-end lingerie. And we need a face for the campaign. Or a belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me?\" Ashley asked softly, resting her fingertips against her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely. You used to be a model, didn't you?\" Louisa smiled. \"And believe me, this is much better than teaching in a high school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a point. Ashley didn't feel appreciated at all when she waddled back into the classroom. In fact, she felt mocked. Here, she could get to be around beautiful men and women and have people love her for her pregnant body. Something her husband never did...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give it a shot,\" Ashley beamed. In no time, a flock of women, all big-bellied themselves, began undressing Ashley and slipped her into some red, tight lingerie. Doing so made Ashley's breasts knock against her amulet a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" Louisa smiled as Ashley turned to a nearby mirror, her belly now stuffed with 36 full-term babies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a little tight,\" Ashley cooed, looking back at Louisa. \"I think this would look better on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Louisa's turn to blush. \"L-let me look in the back for something that might fit you better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouisa hurried off with the other employees of the pregnancy lingerie store and in slinked a face Ashley hated even more than Louisa. \"Oh, you look priceless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley turned around and felt her face flush. \"You.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim laughed and ran her hands down her waist. She was still hugely pregnant, even a little more so, but was following the trends and only had on a small grey bra and short tights. Ashley hated how Kim's body made her feel. Every sensitive part of her as beginning to tingle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we're going to be working together,\" Kim cackled, crossing her arms and resting them on her belly. \"Isn't that a fun twist?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just leave me alone,\" Ashley grumbled, trying not to look at Kim and let her arousal grow any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to admit, that looks good on you,\" Kim sighed. \"You make the whole 'exhuasted milf' thing work.\" She paced around Ashley and prodded one finger into her enormous belly. \"God, I never get used to this thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please,\" Ashley whimpered. \"If you keep rubbing there, I'll...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim laughed again. \"What, this is turning you on? I guess you and your husband are a good match. Neither of you can keep it in your pants.\" Ashley moaned again and bit her lip. \"Though sleeping with your husband's mistress is kind of kinky when you think about it...I'd give it a try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I want to,\" Ashley squeaked. \"But I couldn't do that to Brandon. We...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brandon? That little wimp?\" Kim said, not admitting that she saw something in him too. \"I wouldn't put too much trust in his commitment to you.\" Kim waddled over to the nearest computer in the store and accessed PreggoMall's security system. She turned the screen to Ashley and showed Brandon walking into the mall, carrying the nearly nude Catalina in his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-he may just be helping her,\" Ashley said, trembling. \"She works with my daughter and he can be very sweet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something tells me that's not the case,\" Kim smiled, leaning in and placing a kiss on Ashley's bare belly. \"Hmm, this really will be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley let out one last moan and leapt into Kim's embrace, kissing her all over and rubbing their bellies together. \"I-In the back. Hurry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the mall, Brandon was carrying Catalina around, feeling his arms get weak as Sarah's original energy laser begin to wear off. When Catalina was hit, her womb was turned into a source of energy, resulting in it becoming weightless. But the system was incomplete and Catalina's belly was back to its old, baby-filled state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Focus, Brandon,\" he told himself, his face bright red as he saw all the pregnant women in the mall, all of them as lightly dressed as Catalina currently was. They were all smiling and looking him over, thanks to his master amulet making all pregnant women attracted to him the more pregnant they were. \"Need to restore Sarah to the way she was...there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon hurried to a nearby spa, letting Catalina down just in time. \"What can I do for you?\" the owner, a colossal, muscular pregnant woman with short hair dyed purple asked. Her belly was covered in tattoos and her belly button was pierced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My friend got a little worked up and needs to unwind,\" Brandon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your 'friend?'\" the giant pregnant woman smiled. \"Catalina Corazon is your 'friend?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon fished a wad of cash out of his wallet and handed it to her. \"Just let her rest and maybe loosen her up a little, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, sure,\" the woman grinned. \"And maybe you can come back and I'll give you one of my special massages. On the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon gulped and hurried away, looking around the mall for anything resembling an administrative center. It wasn't long before he felt a strong hand on his shoulder that began to grip tighter and tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was easy,\" Rebecca laughed, her belly rubbing against Brandon's back. \"And I like easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'd like to see Erin,\" Brandon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a coincidence: she'd like to see you,\" Rebecca said, taking a slow sip from her caf\u00e9 cup as she lead him toward the nearest elevator.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The elevator let out a low hum as it slowed down at the top floor of PreggoMall. Rebecca pushed Brandon forward with her large tan belly, rubbing the side as she led him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, I have a busy day ahead of me,\" Rebecca complained, already thinking about lying on the couch playing video games when this particular job was over. Erin may have brought her back to the mall to work but she couldn't do much about her sloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, you don't need to be so rough,\" Brandon said, his face starting to get red. He enjoyed being pushed around by Rebecca's belly quite a lot. He was surrounded by lots of dominant pregnant women and it was starting to be his preferred dynamic in a sexual relationship. And while Brandon's master amulet made all pregnant women attracted to him, Rebecca's sloth kept her at rest. \"In here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In there,\" Rebecca nodded, giving Brandon another little belly shove toward the large double doors leading into what used to be Antonio's office. \"You can find your way in, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ri-\" Brandon was beginning to say when Rebecca had already darted off, using her super spy abilities and athletics to get off work as quickly as possible. He sighed and trudged forward, pressing open the doors as he entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be shy. Come right in,\" Erin said. She was sitting on her desk, reinforced to allow a supremely pregnant woman to sit on it without smashing right through. Brandon gulped when he saw her. His longtime crush and one-time lover had gotten even more pregnant, and in Brandon's eyes, more beautiful since he last saw her. And there was also an aura of confidence and prestige around Erin he hadn't seen in her before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Erin,\" Brandon said, clearing his throat. \"I wanted to talk to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must have been important,\" Erin said, snapping her fingers. A large screen on the nearby wall showed video of Brandon carrying a barely clothed Catalina into the mall. \"You look like you barely pulled out of your latest girl when you came to see me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was unconscious. Pregnancy can have adverse effects on people,\" Brandon said, his face flushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Especially when they're caused by magical amulets,\" Erin said, reaching between her breasts to hold up her gluttony amulet. \"That's right: I know all about these, Brandon. You kept a big secret from all of us, haven't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...it rewrote history,\" Brandon stammered. \"There was no secret to keep. How could I have explained it to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somehow your sister and her lesbian business partner figured it out,\" Erin scowled. \"You made me pregnant and wouldn't even explain why or how to me.\" Erin reached onto a giant plate of turkey legs next to her and ripped a big bite out of one. \"How could you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how to control it. There's some other force at work here,\" Brandon said. \"Besides, I can't undo it now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I don't want you to,\" Erin said. \"You've given us all an amazing opportunity. I'm going to lead all the pregnant women into a new future and leave you far behind. And in this future, no big-bellied women are going to want to sleep with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erin,\" Brandon gulped. \"I didn't want to have sex with my boss's daughter. I loved you. I've always loved you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Catalina?\" Erin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...needed something from her and she was very insistent,\" Brandon blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone with a round belly will do for you, won't they?\" Erin scoffed, reaching to another plate and filling her mouth with chocolate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not anybody,\" Brandon said, his voice getting quiet. \"You know, you're more beautiful than any of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't,\" Erin snapped, heaving herself from the desk and waddling toward Brandon, pressing her belly against him. \"Don't you dare. You broke my heart, Brandon Page. I can't ever forgive you and I can't ever trust you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know my sister's...at war with your mall or whatever this all is,\" Brandon said as Erin waddled away, pacing around her desk. \"But please, I want you to trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust you,\" Erin said with a sarcastic laugh. \"You just want to fuck me again since I've gotten so much bigger. Who else have you slept with, Brandon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon gulped. \"W-well, Catalina, Zoe from my work, Ashley-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your own mom?\" Erin gasped, turning around. \"You're more twisted than I thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not my mom!\" Brandon said. \"She adopted me when I was little. I only found out about it yesterday. It was hard for me to learn and I wished I'd had you to talk to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But instead you had Ashley's big belly to sob on instead,\" Erin snarled, her mouth full of another bite of turkey. As she chewed, she looked down at a display on her desk and saw Ashley in the maternity lingerie store. She is gorgeous, I'll give him that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erin, please,\" Brandon begged again. \"I...I don't want to just go from woman to woman around the city. You're the only one I really connect with. You're the only one I really love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I could believe you,\" Erin said, looking away as her eyes began to water. \"I loved you too, Brandon. But you ruined that. Now PreggoMall is going to ruin you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon hung his head, but not before catching another video screen on a nearby desk. It looked like the same room he'd been in at PregTech's headquarters. He could clearly see Janice fuming about something or other and barking orders at some of the few male employees. Is she bugging Sarah's company? he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to say all that to your face,\" Erin said, still looking out the window and away from Brandon. \"You can go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going to have your Korean bodyguard shove me out?\" Brandon chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's...not picking up,\" Erin said, looking over her shoulder. \"But remember: I played varsity volleyball in high school and I've been toning up playing golf. I could throw you out by myself if I wanted. Now go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon turned back to Erin one last time before leaving and pointed Sarah's amulet at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt began to get warm in his hands as its colors returned. Erin's belly didn't shrink but the essence she'd stolen from Sarah was returned. Now all he had to do was return it to his sister and things should be back to normal. Or as normal as a magically pregnant super scientist sexy sister was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phase Two,\" Sarah said, pointing to the diagram of a wristband on the projected wall. \"Control over pregnancy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So new spines?\" Janice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, so much more,\" Sarah said. \"I discovered a type of...energy that I could manipulate that controls pregnancy. And this device allows anyone to wield it themselves.\" She held up the band and attached it to Maritza's wrist. \"Hope you don't mind being our guinea pig.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all. Going through corporate law books is boring,\" Maritza, PregTech's unofficially official attorney, smiled as she rubbed her own impressive pregnant belly. \"And I love the idea of controlling my pregnancy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With this, you can make your pregnancy bigger, smaller, nonexistent, or permanent,\" Sarah said. \"Give it a whirl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaritza tapped her wristband and instantly her belly swelled and swelled, ripping apart her shirt and skirt until she was a huge, smooth brown ball attached to a sexy Latina lawyer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you went with 'bigger,'\" Sarah said, gulping as she couldn't help but compare Martiza to her own hugely pregnant mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and permanent,\" Martiza cooed, admiring her new body. \"I think I like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now these are a lot harder to build so it'll take some time,\" Sarah said. \"But this will truly revolutionize PregTech.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Brandon said, bursting into the conference room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brandon?\" Sarah said, hurrying over to her adopted brother. \"What are you doing? This is an important meeting,\" she said in a hushed voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you should know before you show off any new technology,\" Brandon said, handing Sarah back her amulet. \"PreggoMall is spying on you with hidden cameras.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hidden cameras?\" Sarah said. As soon as she took the amulet, it burned in her hands and as if by instinct, she put it back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZING! PING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare they,\" Sarah growled, stroking her 35 baby belly. \"And why didn't I think of that? Why do they get all the easy ideas?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maritzas office was quite spacious, it being located in the heart of the city it was very accessible. It was also away from Pregtech\u2019s bugged factory, so now one was recording the conversation. Janice, Maritza and  Sarah stood there shocked by Brandon's news. \u201cThis is good\u201d Maritza said to her fellow pregnant business partners. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Did you not hear what is going on?Janice sternly asked the Latino lawyer. \u201cAll of our ideas are theirs now! Including the plans for full mobility! Come tomorrow they'll have produced a car for pregnant women and already have it out the door!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I always wondered why things moved a little faster in this city\u201d Maritza said as she drank from her cup of tea. \u201cNow if all of our ideas are now hers, wouldn't that mean the bad ideas would be hers to steal too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm, I see where you are coming from\u201d Sarah said as she slowly struggled to sit down. She didn't have her robo spine to rely on right now, so she had to watch her back. \u201cWe need to counter with something so technologically savvy that she wouldn't realise she is falling right into a trap.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone sat around the table and started to hash out a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, so we know that these amulets have a way of producing some kind of energy. That energy is transferer into foetuses. But over the past few days we have converted pregnant women's foetuses into fully fledged balls of energy.\u201d Sarah said as she drew on a piece of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?! When did this happen?\u201d Janice asked, confused. She had no idea what was going on. This wasn't her field of expertise. \u201cYou know what, I am going outside\u201d she left before her mind overloaded on strange sci fi crap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, so our bellies create this energy that becomes fuel for such things as the robospine, the massager and the soon to be Par.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPar?\u201d Brandon asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPregnant powered car, we can't call everything  Preg something in this town.\u201d Sarah said chuckling. \u201cActually we haven't started working on that yet. \u201cOkay here is what we do. In the next meeting I'll tell everyone that in order to run at maximum capacity, they will need a XS98 chip in each of their products.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah brought up a photo of the CPU chip and continued \u201cThis chip can be read by computers and smart phones anywhere, it was an invented by a company in Charlesburg that I used to work for. While I was there I discovered that these chips have a universal off switch. You flip that and it will shut down the appliance it is in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how are we going to get the Preggomall to use this?\u201d Brandon asked his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah drank some water and continued, \u201cWell, we will have a meeting where we declare that moving forward we would be using this and make a compelling argument. If she is as power hungry as she is, she'll \u2018steal\u2019 the idea and purchase as many chips as she can.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI get it, then what?\u201d Maritza asked, nibbling on one of the snacks she had in her drawers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe will put in a dummy chip, so that they don\u2019t get suspicious of anything. Meanwhile I get started working on basically a universal universal switch. When I flick it, everything that hey have stolen from us will go offline.\u201d Sarah said clapping her hands together.\u201d When they are startled I'll come in with \u2018The Alexandria\u2019 and help people with what is going wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, let's get this started\u201d Brandon said, looking forward to the fight ahead. If Erin was going to ruin his life, he should at\u0142east have a fighting chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to have to worry about you am I?\u201d Mara said to Joel who was sipping from his cup of tea. The two were sitting together in Grants apartment which had become a safe. Haven for them since the big pregnancy explosion. Mara was a little timid of Joel, last time they were in the same room together, he was talking weird which was saying something for a Dungeons and Dragons game. It got even weirder when he screamed and collapsed in a bar afterwords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would you? We've never met\u201d Joel said as he placed the cuppa tea down. \u201c so how do you know grant?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d Mara asked weirdly. \u201cWe played Dnd together! Just a couple of days ago!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I haven't played for the past 2 weeks, In fact I don't remember what happened a couple of days ago!\u201d Joel said as he stirred in some sugar \u201c all I remember is going to get some chicken, bumping into Brandon's mom and whoosh, nothing else until I awoke in hospital. She must of really bumped into me\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, so you don't remember talking in riddles or being all pompous, do you?\u201d Mara questioned further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, don't know what you're talking about. Hey Grant!\u201d Joel said as he saw his friend come through the door. Grant slumped into his couch next to Mara. He let out a calm sigh as he laid out his items for the next few days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey guys, all ready for the 3 day thrilling ride that will be Hexa-con?\u201d Grant eagerly asked his friends. \u201c I know we do this every year, but I think this year we will win the group cosplay award.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, looking back at these photos, it was a bad idea for you to go as a white Lando Calrissian.\u201d Mara said placing the costume album down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh ha, ha\u201d Grant smugly retorted. They gave each other a pleasant kiss and went back to planning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh so this is happening?\u201d Joel asked the two of them \u201c that's good to hear. Mara, get him to shave his back, he looks like a freakin wookie. So Grant, what costumes have you been working on for us this year?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I think we have it this year guys. The AVENGERS!\u201d Grant said as he threw Thor\u2019s  hammer at Joel, who luckily grabbed it. \u201cJoel, you can be Thor, I will be Tony Stark, Mara I out a lot of hard work over the base of 8 hours, so you can be Black Widow and Brandon, where's Brandon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe can't make it today, he is with his sister\u201d Joel said in his most reassuring tone. \u201c it's going to be okay though\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no it won't\u201d Grant said, all the life in his face fading. \u201cIt never is, Brandon is always busy and he hasn't got time for us\u201d he got up and walked to his balcony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's going on?\u201d Mara asked, her pleasant smile turning to a saddened frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI shouldn't say this, but Brandon and Grant have a bit of a history. As kids, when Grant\u2019s dad left his family, Brandon helped him feel like everything was okay.\u201d Joel whispered to Mara, \u201c when Grant\u2019s brother left for the army, Brandon helped Grant when the brother was killed in action. The problem is brandon hasn't been there for Grant since his mother and sister became pregnant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara felt sorrow for the man she was growing to like more and more. \u201c okay then, let's find Brandon, and maybe his mother too, I want to know what the hell went on in your mind!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel made a big gulp at the  thought of revisiting Ashley. It was going to be a long afternoon.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was relaxing when she felt her belly slowly start to change. She started to feel a sharp pain. Thinking quickly she went back to Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina sat in the hot tub as the hulk of a tattooed Amazon stood at the closet, grabbing some towels. She turned around and saw that Catalina was just waking up. \u201cHeh, I knew a celebrity like you would be knocked out for a while, I'm Ella\u201d the woman said as she walked over to a seat near the spa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho, are you? Where am I? Why am I here? What time is it?\u201d Catalina rambled off questions whilst trying to get a clear view of what's going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c I just said who I am, you're at \u2018The Sensual Curve\u2019, the PreggoMalls Spa because some cutie called Brandon left you here and it's 4. Tell me who is that Brandon guy, now he isn't exactly my type, but he looked like he could melt butter!\u201d Ella said starting to flush a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina started to regain her consciousness at the word PreggoMall. She was behind enemy lines and needed to get out before anyone caught her. She was unsure on what to say, she couldn't even rely on her films, except one. One of her first films was Dirty Maternal Scoundrels, a con film about two pregnant women on the Riviera that were conning old rich corruptible men. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Brandon? He is one of the freedom fighters.\u201d Cat said, hoping that would fool the muscle bound woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freedom fighters?\u201d Ella pondered curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, he is trying to pull together people from the greater Tri district area to join forces with the PreggoMall.\u201d Catalina said, getting back into the character of Lousia Jamieson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you're Catalina Corazon. Don't you work for Preg-Tech?\u201d Ella asked, her belief on the situation dropping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh yes, don't tell anyone, but I'm actually a spy for Preg-Tech. Everyone knows how large the PreggoMall is and how Preg-Tech is just a thorn in the side of this glorious company.\u201d Catalina persuaded further. She hadn't noticed but her robo-spine was starting to be affected by the water and it's incredible heat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had no idea\u201d Ella said as she rubbed her masculine chin, she looked at catalina soaking in the overflowing tub, she couldn't help but notice how large Catalinas belly was and overflowed the tub. \u201c still, I should get some of the Mud Crew.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh nonsense, you're a strong independent woman aren't you?\u201d Catalina said, attempting to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou betcha!\u201d Ella confidently stated proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" you don\u2019t take orders from no one!\u201d Catalina said boisterously, her con becoming more convincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn straight!\u201d Catalina said as she tried to get up. The robospine malfunctioned and froze. \u201cUh oh, can, ow, ooohh, can you help me get out of this tub?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh uh! I take orders from no one!\u201d Ella stated confidently, storming right out of there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie snuck into the Preggomall all quiet like,  like a fish. She had been trying to grab a wear abouts of Catalina. Her performance wasn't going to well at all. Every time she came a foot away from a belly she became a blubbering mess. She had to change it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaddling past some of the extra large security guards she looked around for where she could find Catalina. A big crowd, maybe someone was talking about her. She skulked around some more passing the gym Janice used to work for. She saw the food court where she would eat, chat with those she used to call friends and would think about playing instruments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie was pretty good at playing the clarinet before she got into the big world of business. She loved doing reports but something inside of her wanted to return to the days where she want so busy and she could just relax and play. But those days were over, and now she needed to shift her life in a corporate direction, no matter how many sexy bellies she encountered. But you know what they say,  business before pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla stormed out of her business, like an Amazon looking for its next meal to eat. \u201cCatalina, working for us? That's incredible\u201d Ella said as she passed the stealthy Katie. Taking a hint, Katie Meade her way into the exotic centre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassing some fake bamboo trees and opening some oriental type doors Katie saw Catalina struggling to escape the hot tub. After a slip and a slide she was left looking like a naked goddess on the worlds biggest almond coloured balloon. Her breasts were sweaty and Cat was exhausted. She just wanted out, that wasn't too much to ask, was it? Turning around she saw Katie. \u201cOh good, come on Katie, get me out of this mess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201c what? Not even with a please?\u201d Katie stated, hands on her hips. She knew that tattooed woman was going to come back, but she had some time to enjoy the sight before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on, you work for me, the GREAT CATALINA!\u201d The steamy actress said, her pride amulet emanating its power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c oh, I work for YOU? This isn't a partnership where I run the business whilst you make it look good?\u201d Katie said, walking over and tracing her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina winced as her finger glided along her bare skin. She was very raw from having sex with Brandon and the spa was not helping. Biting her lip she let out a \u201cp,p,pl oh I can't say the word! It's not even real, I would have heard of it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on, I'm sure a big celebrity like you have heard of the P word.\u201d Katie said walking over to her legs. Those thick, juicy legs, countless porn stars must have enjoyed Catalinas bodacious body in her past life. Maybe she could reignite them, like Brandon did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina gasped in shock as she  felt her pleasure centre being tickled Katie. \u201cNo! Not now, I can't, I need to get out of heeeoooohhhhh\u201d Catalinas panic changed to a pleasurable moan as Katie continued to do some interesting foreplay. Catalina had been brought so much in the past few days, but this was something different, something exquisite, something that was no longer happening?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, why did you stop?\u201d Catalina pleaded to her young brunette lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard footsteps, we have to go!\u201d Katie whispered as she pulled Catalina out of there. The first heave did nothing but get some space for her belly to move. The second one was a bit to loud as Katie heard a familiar voice. Erin had seen Catalina come in to the day spa and when Ella came up to her, she was furious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c Where are you, you tenacious slut?\u201d Erin ordered as she searched for Catalina, surprisingly Ella wasn't with her. The lights flickered and got a little brighter as Catalina and Katie just managed to escape he hot tub. They dashed out of the place, Catalina barely grabbing a couple of towels to cover herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie and Catalina made their way out of the mall, but as they reached the car park a shift started to happen. Katie felt it first, the energy was converting back into foetuses and it was having a strange effect on her. She was feeling contractions for the first time since the start of her pregnancy. She was on fire, it felt like her belly was filled with sharp daggers, pincers circulating over her belly. \u201c oh god, what's happening to me?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind tried to search for answers, from her studies she remembered that every action has a equal and opposite reaction. When the foetuses were changed to energy all the distress that the had been caused in the pregnancy had dissipated and the final result had rubbed her clit the wrong way. Now that the foetuses were changing back, she was dealing with an incredible amount of active babies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKatie, are you there?\u201d A voice came from behind her ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c Sarah?\u201d Katie stammered between groans. \u201cWhat's going on?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to, ask\u2026 Are you currently going\u2026. Through, contractions?\u201d Sarah said herself going through pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c yep, sounds, owwww\u2026. Sounds like you, are too\u2026\u201d Katie struggled to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, quick\u2026 Meet me in Preg-Tech. I, I think this may be permanent. We need to fix this, bed- aaaahh\u2026 before it hits the rest of the community\u201d Sarah cried out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin and Catalina started to head through the rain to the taxi rink. Everything was going okay until Catalina\u2019s robo-spine malfunctioned. Catalina's tiny pieces of clothes started to tear as the spine caused her to bend back like a yoga partner thrusting her vag towards the sky. \u201cOw, ow, ow. Little help?\u201d Catalina asked winced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeez\u2026 How can this, argh\u2026 Get any worse?\u201d Catalina said as she held Catalina<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"What do we do now?\" Katie whined as Catalina's belly pressed against her. They were trying to make their way out of the rain and to safety but with their robo-spines malfunctioning and their energy dissipating, that was near-impossible. Normally, Katie would be blissful, having a big pregnant middle rubbing her but she was also going through labor pains and had a hard time focusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the side, they could see Sarah hurrying toward them, her labor kept away by another one of her inventions but because she's slapped it together, it was on the verge of breaking apart. \"I got your message,\" Sarah said, huddling with Katie and Catalina. \"I made sure to monitor you after PreggoMall got more dangerous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're probably chasing us,\" Catalina said. \"How do we get out of here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Sarah yelled over the rain, her belly becoming slick and shiny. \"I think fiddling with our pregnancies too much has had an adverse reaction and that's why we're all going into labor. If we were back at the lab, I could try and fix it but-\" Sarah didn't get her last part out because a ripple of pain and tightness made her moan and fall to her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the person everyone least expected stood up and boomed. \"Ladies!\" Catalina said, \"you, like me, are proud pregnant women and we have what it takes to make it out. All you have to do is follow Catalina Corazon and her brave example.\" Catalina began to struggle to waddle forward. \"To the underpass!\" Her amulet was filling her with pride but it was inspiring Sarah and Katie to make their way to cover too. Their hands held their big bellies tightly as they tried to support the weight and make it to Catalina's spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Catalina's pride only went so far and the underpass only stopped the women from getting wet. They were still in labor with dozens of fetuses and largely immobile. And when things didn't seem like they could get worse, a large car pulled up with the Smallton Mall logo still emblazoned on the side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" Sarah breathed as the back door opened and Erin slowly waddled out. She was holding a small bowl filled with octopus balls and casually tossed one into her mouth. Her eyes glowed with glee as she chewed and watched the three women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well well,\" Erin smiled. \"Looks like the three of you have a little bit of trouble. Maybe you'd like a lift?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please,\" Katie said, her eyes focused on Erin's belly, desperate to take the first way out of her predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, don't trust her,\" Sarah said. \"This has gone far beyond competing businesses. She's dangerous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin rubbed her hands together with a snicker. \"Oh no, trust me, I have a way to take care of your pregnancies and make sure your labor pains go away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean stealing our pregnancies?\" Sarah replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steal our pregnancies?\" Catalina said. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie slowly reached her hand for her amulet and tried to make Erin bigger, hoping that would distract her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin's belly surged forward but her balance remained steady. \"I have to give you credit, Sarah, these pregnancies spines are very effective. And the ones we designed are far more durable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina grit her teeth, putting her hands on her hips and no longer concealing her nudity. \"What do you want with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, I can take care of your pregnancies,\" Erin said, her smile growing more and more evil. \"There's a laboratory in our basement for big-bellied ladies where they're kept stable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard some pregnant employees were vanishing at the mall,\" Katie murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess: the pregnancy converter,\" Sarah said. \"I made my own but you must have Antonio's model.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can see for yourself,\" Erin cackled as other PreggoMall employees left the car, waddling toward them with big grins. Like Ella, they were buff and looked like they could get the women into the car with no trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-now what?\" Katie trembled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm out of ideas,\" Sarah stammered just as a familiar car pulled up between them. Brandon rolled down his window and looked out. \"Brandon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah?\" he said back, turning to see Erin fuming on the other side. \"Hurry, get in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon's small car became packed to the breaking point in a flash as the three colossally-pregnant women crammed in, bellies rubbing against bellies, not that Brandon or Katie minded. He sped off through the rain and Erin slammed her fist in anger, knocking over her bowl of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After them!\" Erin barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're getting a message from the mall,\" one of her employees said, handing Erin a phone. Erin groaned and held it to her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Erin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erin, you sound a little out of breath,\" Louisa smiled on the other end. \"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was close to catching the PregTech bitches,\" Erin growled. \"We're going to go finish the job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now, that's no mature way to do business,\" Louisa purred. \"I respect that you were put in charge of this mall but those of us in the 'book club' have more business experience, remember. And besides, we have something back here that would make you more interested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Erin sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashley Page has agreed to work for us,\" Louisa laughed, petting Ashley's hair as she lay in a nearby chair, dazed as Kim rested against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could your husband have cheated on you?\" Kim said weakly. \"You're amazing. I'm so sorry for everything I put you through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know,\" Ashley sighed, stroking Kim's naked back as the housebreaker planted soft kisses in between Ashley's breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at PregTech, Sarah groaned and grunted as she tried to waddle around while hooking up devices to her main executives' bellies. Janice had been alone at the lab in labor the longest but her wrathful anger gave her something to distract her from the discomfort. \"I don't know if I can make it in time,\" Sarah moaned. \"I-I may actually deliver some of these babies soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon's face was bright red as he worried about what to do. Without any other ideas, he held up his amulet and pleaded silently. I don't know how you work but if you can stop them from going into labor...do it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA light blue mist filled the room and the four women's groans slowly settled down and Katie, Janice, and Catalina fell asleep. Only Sarah was immune because of her long exposure to Brandon and she looked at him in surprise. \"What did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure but something tells me it won't last for long,\" Brandon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine, I've got these all ready anyway,\" Sarah said, attaching the same device she gave to Maritza to their arms. \"Now we can make our pregnancies permanent or get rid of them altogether. No more sudden labors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is that it?\" Brandon gulped. \"You're going to get rid of your pregnancy? I know you didn't like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah sighed and looked at her enormous belly and rubbed it slowly. \"You know, a few days ago, I probably would have. But I've gotten used to it and I like PregTech. And besides...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides what?\" Brandon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah pressed her belly against Brandon and smiled up at him. \"If I hadn't gotten pregnant, I couldn't have seen just how much you care about me. Despite how rotten I treat you, you always try and take care of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well you're my sister after all,\" Brandon said with a nervous smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But not by blood,\" Sarah giggled, moving him into her private office. \"Just like with Ashley, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right,\" Brandon said as he traced his hands against her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...while they're asleep, I say we take advantage of our time together,\" Sarah said, removing her top and planting a kiss on Brandon's cheek. \"What do you say?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brandon stood in Sarah's office as she gently pressed her wet lips to his face over and over again. As she leaned in for each peck, her colossal pregnant belly pressed harder and deeper against Brandon and Sarah giggled as she definitely felt his erection against her roundness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So c'mon, what do you say?\" Sarah whispered again, opening one eye long enough to look over his shoulder at the other PregTech women, still resting from the trying experience. \"I don't think they're going to be getting up anytime soon to interrupt be could always go somewhere private too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah...\" Brandon said, his voice trailing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah stopped and took both of Brandon's hands, resting them against her pregnant middle. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...seeing Erin again changed things. She had a lot of...things to say to me. Things that rang true,\" Brandon said. \"Having sex right now just doesn't feel right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah let out an annoyed sigh. Her amulet began to burn against her bosom as she thought about seeing him in bed with her mother. You seemed to think it was right to shack up with Ashley not too long ago Sarah thought, fuming with envy. And based on where your eyes are looking right now, I'd say you're still in the mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I loved Erin and now-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now she's trying to destroy my company and almost kidnapped me and my other employees,\" Sarah said. \"People change, Brandon. Even you've made a microscopic improvement in your personality lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Brandon said, gulping nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, you've gone from a dweeb to a somewhat charming dweeb,\" Sarah said with a little smirk. \"Listen, I get that being broken up with sucks and learning that you're adopted is a bit of a mind trip too but you're not a bad guy, Brandon. No one's perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, I feel weird hooking up with so many women all the time,\" Brandon said, turning to Sarah. \"You'd be the second pregnant woman I slept with today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looked over at Catalina and smiled. \"I don't blame you. She's a sexy gal.\" Her eyes darted back to Brandon. \"But so what? You're making up for lost time. And Katie and I nearly jump each other a half dozen times a day so maybe that makes things equal in your bizarre morality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you and Katie?\" Brandon said, looking over at the resting pregnant brunette. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was mom...Ashley's first pregnant sex partner too,\" Sarah laughed, giving Brandon's collar a light tug to bring his eyes to hers. \"But I wouldn't pursue it. You're not her type.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sarah turned Brandon back, the two leaned in and kissed, their lips opening gradually as they met one another's. Brandon wasted no time bringing himself against his adoptive sister's pregnant belly and his hands ran down her sides, stopping at her rear. When Sarah let out a tiny moan, they broke, breathing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-In my office after all,\" Sarah said, taking Brandon's hand and waddling backward to her door. As she opened the door, she looked over at Katie for a moment and let out a small laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Brandon said, feeling his face heat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, I was just thinking about how Ashley had her first pregnant sexual experience and now...so am I,\" Sarah cooed, kissing Brandon on the neck as she closed and locked the door. The two embraced, Brandon standing behind Sarah and wrapping his arms around her belly. Their bodies swayed as Sarah removed her clothes and Brandon followed suit. As they undressed, Sarah wiggled her rear a bit and stroked Brandon's erection with her plump cheeks. He responded by tracing his hands up to her breasts and teasing them, making Sarah giggle. When the two were totally nude, Sarah turned around and Brandon, while keeping his hands on her round middle, buried his face between her breasts, kissing and licking madly as he moved from nipple to nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah let out a series of giggles as she heaved herself onto her desk and spread her legs. Brandon readied himself to enter her but hesitated. Instead, he knelt down and placed himself in her lap and began to lick and kiss at her sensitive sex. Sarah let out a surprised cackle and purred, running both hands up and down her belly slowly. As he brought her closer and closer to orgasm, Brandon stood up before they reached the big moment and began kissing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you've done a good job,\" Sarah smiled, tussling his hair before lowering herself and turning around. \"Now you can have your fun too.\" Brandon gripped the sides of Sarah's belly as he thrust inside her, getting an excited squeal from Sarah in reply. They could both feel their amulets getting warmer and warmer as they shook each other around. Sarah bit her lip and clutched one hand to the recent tech she had strapped to her wrist. \"Y-you want it bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Brandon groaned, feeling himself overcome with waves of excitement and anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how big?\" Sarah panted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-as big as you can get,\" Brandon said. \"B-bigger than Ashley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's envy responded to that line well and she turned up her amulet, feeling her womb swell and swell until she was pregnant with 40 full-term fetuses. From where she stood, bending over, her belly button was now touching the floor. As corresponding hormones filled her, Sarah's ass began to push Brandon back because it was so large and her breasts each approached beach ball proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good?\" Sarah purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look so sexy,\" Brandon managed to get out, feeling himself twitch and hit his last strokes. \"You're b-better...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better?\" Sarah grunted, feeling her muscles ready to contract around Brandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-better than Ashley,\" Brandon grunted as he came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she reached her size, Brandon and Sarah both climaxed, with Brandon hugging Sarah tightly as he released inside her and Sarah gripping her desk so hard she nearly broke pieces off. \"T-that was great,\" Sarah wheezed with a big sweaty smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Brandon said, the mix of emotions in his head more chaotic now than ever. As he tried to catch his breath, Brandon heard his cellphone ring in his dropped pants. He hurried to pick it up and answered the call. \"H-hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brandon? It's Grant,\" Grant said. \"You okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah just...went for a run,\" Brandon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the rain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I went to a gym,\" Brandon lied as Sarah giggled and held him close. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing much. Joel, Mara, and me were going to go out of town to a convention and we thought we'd just ask if you wanted to go. We know that's not the sort of thing you'd want to do,\" Grant said, his voice trailing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, that sounds like fun,\" Brandon gulped as Sarah nodded to him. \"I'll...talk about travel plans with you in a little bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, excellent,\" Grant said. \"See you then, dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing,\" Brandon said, hanging up and tossing his phone back. Sarah smiled and kissed him on the shoulder. \"I shouldn't have said yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should have,\" Sarah said, holding her fingers against his chin and turning Brandon to face her. \"You're acting like you've got the weight of the world on your shoulders and you need to relax. Go have fun with your friends and try to sort your head out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?\" Brandon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Things are crazy in this town, whatever they're calling it now, and it'd be good for you to get out,\" Sarah smiled. \"And it's not like I need your help here at PregTech. No offense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Brandon chuckled, letting out a sigh and kissing Sarah on the cheek. \"Thanks. You may not be my sister but you've got lots of good sisterly advice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Sarah said, rolling her eyes. \"I'm a genius, after all.\"</span></div></div>",

Grant carved out EVA foam matts and Joel glued them tiger painfully, with a hot glue gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDAMN IT!\u201d Joel shouted as he got boiling hot glue on his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCareful Joel, this isn't something you just pull together\u201d Mara said as she sowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, I know. It would just help if Brandon were here right now\u201d Joel grumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe'll fret no longer, that was the Luigi to our super Mario bros. Brandon is on his way\u201d Grant said, putting his mobile down. \u201cYou know, I'm just realising this will be the first time I go both days to this con\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, how else are we going to meet the warrior princess Hayley Hewitt and sexual bounty hunter Ashlee Byron. I mean Hayley has the curves of a goddess with long black hair flowing halfway down her back and How tall is ashlee?\u201d Joel asked, his anger turning to a drooling lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c6,6, and Hayley is 5,0 last time I checked\u201d Mara said like it was implanted in her brain. \u201cWhich is hilarious, because Amazonian women are very tall. They had some excellent episodes about it in Ezra: the Amazonian Queen\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing Grants directions Brandon parked his car at Mara's and went up to her apartment carrying bags of goodies. \u201cHere's Johnny!\u201d Brandon said in his best Jack Nicholson voice to his three friends. Closing the door behind him he saw the effort they had been putting into the costumes for their collective cosplay. \u201cJesus, I had no idea you guys put this much effort in!\u201d He said looking at the finely moulded materials.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, get out of that maternity butler perspective and have some fun\u201d Joel said as he applied hot glue to his armour. \u201cAH! Damn it, I hate hot glue, it hurts worse than season four of community!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next couple of hours flew by as the four geeks joked and laughed reminiscing over past video game and con experiences.  As clock struck 4 most of the costumes were finished, only a minor prop remained. \u201cOh shoot, I completely forgot, here's  the ticket to tomorrow's expansion release at the con!\u201d Joel said as he passed the ticket to Grant. \u201cI mean you get to see Ashlee twice tomorrow! Once in that Amazonian outfit and again at the photo booth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, you know I never asked how things went with you and Catalina\u201d Grant asked innocently. Mara shot a look of jealousy straight at the bearded man who realised his mistake. \u201cYou know what, never mind\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou had sex with Catalina?\u201d Brandon asked Joel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on guys, not right now\u201d Mara stated, annoyed by what they were talking about, she didn't want to hear about some pregnant slut.<br>\r\n\u201cActually I had no idea, let's go outside and you can tell me\u201d Brandon said as he grabbed a few drinks from the fridge and they walked out onto the balcony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon was still fresh from having sex with Catalina and Sarah. Sex with Catalina wasn't bad, but it was intense, like he was going down on a woman at gun point, and the person with the firearm was the woman. It was wild, and sweaty and adrenaline pumping. As great as it was, he couldn't do it again, Catalina just was too much of a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah on the other hand had that sort of sex you remember only in your dreams, like finally getting to be with that girl next door. It was an emotional ride, that never felt like it was going to end. Her belly was so smooth and firm, yet so beautifully plump. She gave Brandon that longing, desired look with a touch of naivety that made you feel like you could go on forever, she would bite her lip and brush some of the hair off her face as she moaned, caressing her breasts. Sex with Erin was memorable, the time he spent with Ashley was unbelievable, but Sarah, Sarah gave him the ride of his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, when I exchanged that ticket for sex with Catalina, I thought I was going in for the ride of my life\u201d Joel said as he lounged out on one of Mara's chairs. \u201cIt was pretty good sex, but there was something about it that felt off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Brandon asked as he sat in the other chair. \u201cI mean, wasn't she a porn star in another life?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, she is, but do you realise the amount of sex she had to do in one day just to get the right takes? All while a series of cameramen looked at you?\u201d Joel answered, swishing the drink in his bottle, \u201c after I fu- who am I kidding, after Catalina had sex with me, I started to realise how intimidating pregnant women can be, do you remember Grace the nurse?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah\u201d Brandon said, a filthy grin forming on his face \u201c you didn't have sex with her too, did you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and Grace, she just, she broke me!\u201d Joel said throwing his hands in the air. \u201cI just can't deal with pregnant women right now\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't worry man, tonight we head into charlesburg, party at the hotel and then tomorrow morning, it's CON TIME!\u201d Brandon boomed, excited for tomorrow's events. Just as he went to take another sip, his phone started to ring. Katie was on the other line. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey BP, do you have a second?\u201d Katie said, panting on the other line. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh yeah, sure\u201d Brandon replied \u201cwhat's on your mind?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, everyone's feeling much better after the contraction problem, we start producing the \u2018Matern\u2019 car and that new battery that Sarah was raving about. Urrgh, Sarah and Catalina have already left for the day\u201d Janice said, groaning uncomfortably. \u201c Hrmphh\u2026 but I am stuck here with Janice and we kind of got into a sticky mess. Do you think you, hey! Watch it Janice, do you think- hold on, yes, I'm asking him, do you think you  could come around?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, wait, you want me, to unplug two massively pregnant women from some kind of situation?\u201d Brandon asked, confused by what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen here boy\u201d Janice said, just managing to grab Katie's phone, navigating through a pillowy, plump like space. \u201c there's no time to explain, ooOOOOOOOHHHH- Katie! Ju-ju- just grab a friend and we can get through this faster, alright?\u201d She hung up the phone and looked at her name friend \u201cokay I admit, this was fun, but I'm not having sex with you in a shower again, and why did you bring honey?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon looked at his friend, \u201cdo you think you could help me out with something?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The music was electric and the audience had their eyes glued to the curvaceous figures of Ashley and Kim as they showed off the new lingerie line that would be available to the public in the coming days.  A couple of guys whistled and ladies looked upon the models with awe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the cat walk came to a close Local news reporter Ray Roberts came on stage to cover the end of the show. Sweat formed on Rays perfectly chiseled face as he saw Kim and Ashley walk up to him. \u201cIt would seem after an awkward beginning to their day, Preggomall has pulled off a fantastic end with a sex- successful lingerie walk. Kim and Ashley are the new faces of this fine establishments products. What have you got to say models?\u201d Ray said, resisting the urge inside his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we said we wouldn't tell the press, but for you Mister Roberts, we would do anything\u201d Kim said with a purr, not noticing the cameras filming her. \u201cToday is the launch of our clothing line, tomorrow afternoon we will be showing people how to cook those cravings away, plus a special surprise in the morning  for some of our customers who can't drive to our lovely mall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou just love all guys in sir 40\u2019s don't you?\u201d Ashley whispered to Kim rubbing her belly against hers.  They looked up to see Erin standing from her office, giving them a smugly powerful  stare. \u201cDo you think she wants to see us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think so\u201d Kim whispered back. \u201c Ray, I\u2019m sorry but we have to wrap it up, these bellies need to be rubbed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, this has been Ray Roberts, coming to you live from this fantastic Occasion\u201d Ray said, finishing the interview. As the cameramen started putting their cameras away Ray walked up to Ash and Kim \u201cAs a local celebrity I would be happy to rub one of our pregnant overlords, uh I mean models\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would love you to, but I can't explain how much I need to go right now\u201d Kim said as she saw Wendy walking  up to them. \u201c here, take something for later\u201d Kim slipped Ray some digits and waddled over to Wendy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay was about to leave the floor when he saw a sea of pregnant women closing in on him. He had heard rumours of men being hunted down by pregnant women, that men were being oppressed, what was he going to do.  He looked at his cameraman and signalled him to get the hell out of here, he went to run straight for the exit sign but slammed straight into a large Australian lady. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fierce look on the Aussie lady\u2019s face  formed as she brought her fist to her chest. Tapping it twice she let out a long breath. \u201c aaahh, stupid heart burn, OH! Ray Roberts! Can you do something for me?\u201d Ray looked up from the ground as women all around started reveal their bellies. \u201cCould you sign my belly?\u201d She said pulling out a sharpie. <br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you want to lock me up or something?\u201d Ray stammered out, his confident machismo like coat of paint trading in for a yellow stripe of fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would we do that? You are one of the few men who love pregnant women in this town!\u201d The Aussie woman said as she helped him up. \u201cLet's hear it for Ray Roberts everyone!\u201d The crowd gave a thunderous amount of applause as Ray found out who his true fans were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm in heaven\u201d was all Ray could say\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes her holiness want me?\u201d Kim asked sarcastically as she met us with Wendy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, she wants you both, you two were supposed to have your meeting with her at 2, not 2:30\u201d Wendy said, her arms crossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sorry, it's just the crowds love us\u201d Ashley pleaded, trying not to get on their bad side.\u201d Besides, we were, busy\u2026\u201d The two heavily pregnant women giggled like school girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c don't you start, it's amazing that she picked you in the first place, just get up there and don't dordle!\u201d Wendy ordered, pointing at the elevator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two just made it into the elevator, but there was barely any room to breathe. Their back were stuck to the wall, their bellies were rubbing up against each other and you would never believe how overflowing their bras were.  But all this weight was not good for the elevator, it strained as it tried to get the two beautiful models up a single floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator shook as it halted. They were stuck, with no clue of what to do.<br>\r\n\u201cOh great, I bet Erin is going to give us hell because her lifts don't work.\u201d Ashley said, rubbing her temples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno, I mean have you seen her? When she sits around the boardroom table, she sits AROUND the boardroom table\u201d Kim said laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley laughed a little. As much as she hated her for ruining her marriage and breaking her family up, she had to admit, she was kind of funny. Hell she had been throughout the a bit today. Brandon's friend had bolted at the sight of her, she was loved by all for her sexy curves, he'll she even got a job at the Preggomall as a high class lingerie model with KIM of all people! Not only that, Kim fucked her in ways she had never experienced! What was happening to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did you do it?\u201d Ashley asked her equally curvy friend \u201cwhy?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was Ray Roberts! Come on, you have wanted to screw celebrities before, haven't you?\u201d Kim said, squeezing down to the ground, getting a good spot to relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not that! Why did you have sex with me? With my ex husband, with everyone you'd freaking see?\u201d Ashley's soft voice becoming a loud scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh seriously? I thought we were over this!\u201d Kim annoyingly snapped back. \u201c what do you want me to say? I\u2019m sorry? Because I won't! I enjoyed it, I enjoyed screwing your husband and you just as much as I enjoyed screwing anyone else!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo the fact that you broke up the marriage between a perfectly happy couple doesn't phase you?\u201d Ashley stated to her co-modeller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWere you happy?\u201d Kim asked, looking over her juicy belly to see her fellow prisoner in the elevator. \u201c be honest. Were. You. Happy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley had to think, that was a big statement to make, was she happy with Tanner? The man who provided for their pregnant family, but didn\u2019t want anything to do with her sexual. Breathing out she slumped back to let out a small \u201cno\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim really felt for her new friend, she really had pushed chaos into her her court. \u201cHey, it's okay\u2026 Look it all began about 7 or 8 months ago. Women were getting pregnant left right and centre and they were seeing me as some kind of sexual object. I was just a college graduate with a degree in marine biology.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBullshit, you're a model!\u201d Ashley said, wiping a tear from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell yes now, but back then I was coming here for the cheap rent whilst I worked in Charlesburg. The problem is after I had my first taste in sex, I couldn't stop! As pregnant women continued to pop up around the area I started to ask myself, \u2018do they really like me for me? Or me for my body?\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know how that feels\u201d Ashley added, understanding her pain. \u201c you know my \u2018son?\u2019 She's actually my ex lovers\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, really?\u201d Kim asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, we ended up having sex last night, but I think it's a one time thing\u201d Ashley claimed, another long breath came out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy? I mean you can do better, but why?\u201d Kim asked, she just had to know more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is only interested in pregnant women, and to be honest, what mother would date their son\u201d Ashley answered, putting her head in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c hey hey, Ashley, stop! You are a beautiful woman, anyone, would be lucky to be with you, forget Tanner and Brandon. You're on the winning side now!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Ashley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally really\u201d Kim said, \u201c we are the better side anyway\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not about that, I meant \u2018anyone\u2019\u201d Ashley asked again tracing her finger along Kim's huge, soft midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally understanding what she meant, Kim smiled and said, \u201cdefinitely\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, they elevator started moving again</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ashley could already hear Erin cackling as she waddled down the hallway. Kim let out her own little laughs each time Ashley's colossal belly wobbled over and bumped against her. Days ago, Kim would have complained but her opinion on pregnancy, and Ashley especially, had changed considerably since then due in no small part to the two of them becoming active lovers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Erin's office, she was lounging on a large couch with a plate of various snacks balanced on top of her own large round pregnant belly. One hand brought each morsel to her mouth while the other stroked her stomach, shiny from creams and oils. At the end of the couch, Barbara and another pregnant employee were massaging Erin's feet with intense focus. \"Ah good, Kim...Mrs. Dale. Come in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not Mrs. Dale anymore,\" Ashley grumbled, her hand resting against the side of her belly as she felt her children kick. \"I'm just Ashley from now on.\" She was still glaring at Erin. Despite making up with Louisa, Ashley still harbored plenty of distrust for her family and worried about what kind of affect Erin had on Brandon. Ashley may not be treating him as a son anymore after they had sex but she still cared deeply about his well-being and was protective of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat distrust went both ways, since Erin now had a sore spot for the whole Dale family, and whether Ashley liked it or not, Erin still saw her as connected to Brandon. \"I don't know if we can market you as well with just a first name,\" Erin purred. \"The world of pregnancy doesn't have a room for its own 'Cher.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call her 'Assley,'\" Kim giggled, giving Ashley a light spank on the same plump region she alluded to. \"That's how I think of her.\" Ashley let out a little gasp and turned to Kim, quickly smiling back at her and looking Kim's curvy, tanned body over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy you two,\" Erin said, waving to her attendants to leave her be. Wendy opened the door to the office and ushered Barbara and her friend out as Erin took the plate of snacks off of her belly and rested it in the seat beside her. She grabbed a few more bites and chewed on them as she walked toward Ashley, pressing her belly against Ashley's much larger bump. \"I can't have you two playing grab ass when we do the big announcement tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if it gets it all out of our system?\" Kim grinned. \"If I know I'm ever in a situation where I won't be allowed to masturbate, I go wild the night before so my mind's off it. Same thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you think will work,\" Erin sighed, eyes still on Ashley. She could see her cheeks starting to heat up. \"That's right. You have an over-active libido. Maybe getting you to not make a scene tomorrow is impossible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have self-control,\" Ashley said, trembling as Erin's navel started to rub against hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, like when you slept with Brandon,\" Erin said, clicking her tongue against her teeth. \"He's...he's good looking, sure, but still...you raised him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was kind to me when no one else was,\" Ashley said, her voice starting to strain with stress. \"You understand. You dumped him, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin started to push back against Ashley's belly as her eyes burned. \"Brandon broke my heart. I thought he really loved me and I wouldn't have to raise these babies all by myself. But then I found out the only thing that he liked about me was the fact that I was pregnant and single. He slept around with any big-bellied bimbo he could.\" Erin scoffed and gave Ashley a once-over. \"At least I found out he fucked you after I cut it off. I might have thrown up on the spot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley clenched her fists. \"I knew I should have never let Brandon date you. I told him over and over again that you were no good. Even Tanner knew that much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies, ladies,\" Kim said, putting her hands on Ashley and Erin's shoulders. \"We're all on the same team now, aren't we? We've all been wronged by men and embraced by pregnant women. That's what PreggoMall is all about, am I right?\" Ashley and Erin kept eye contact before breaking it with a huff. \"Tomorrow, we're going to advertise all your new products with that new fancy computer chip and we're going to blow PregTech out of the water. Once we run this town, you two will be too happy to argue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never thought I'd hear her make so much sense,\" Ashley sighed, looking over at Kim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a lot you don't know about me,\" Kim smiled, kissing Ashley on the cheek. \"I'll see you and the belly tomorrow morning.\" She stroked Ashley's enormous middle and pinched her navel before leaving. As Ashley panted from the contact, Erin kept looking her over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you trust me?\" Erin finally said in a quiet voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your family was so rich, I thought you looked down on us,\" Ashley said. \"I mean, look at us. I got pregnant with Sarah when I was barely out of high school and then I got...well, abnormally pregnant. And neither Tanner nor I made all that much.\" Ashley let out a little chuckle. \"Honestly, I don't know where Sarah gets all her talent from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin sighed and put her hand on Ashely's forearm. \"I never looked down on all of you. I thought Brandon had a great family. Sarah was smart, you were fun and beautiful, Tanner...seemed nice enough I suppose, and Brandon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brandon's a special kid,\" Ashley smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Erin said in a small voice, hands clutching her belly. \"I really do have to take care of this pregnancy on my own now. It would have been nice if I had someone to go through everything with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have your mother,\" Ashley said as the two of them sat down on the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin scoffed. \"She's...not good at that sort of thing. Louisa can be a little too shallow for appreciating having a big belly. It's an old way of thinking, I guess.\" Erin blushed and looked down at her belly. \"What's really hard is not having anyone for...you know...sex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley laughed and nodded. \"For a long time, I didn't have anyone for that either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I've only done it once since I've been pregnant,\" Erin said, looking up at Ashley. \"With Brandon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's the only man I've had pregnant sex with,\" Ashley smiled. \"He really...knows how to care about the belly. Like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You care about the belly?\" Erin said, gingerly touching Ashley's roundness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do,\" Ashley breathed, leaning close to Erin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show me,\" Erin said, her lips touching Ashley's. The two shifted closer together, kissing as their hands traced their bellies and breasts. The door to Erin's office opened a crack and Rebecca peeked her head in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boss?\" Rebecca said, seeing Erin and Ashley deep in the throes of passion. \"Oops. I'll come back.\" She closed the door, her stealthy skills making everything quiet, and thought for a moment. \"I guess I'm free for the rest of the day in that case...think I'll go see a movie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, at PregTech, Sarah was finishing up her own plans for the next morning. Like she'd planned, PreggoMall had installed her own \"extra-efficient\" computer chips into all their products. Little did they know, Sarah was well aware of their spying and had in fact showed them a series of duds that would go off at the stroke of her switch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are Janice and Katie?\" Sarah asked. The boardroom was just Maritza and Catalina, both of whom just shrugged. \"Oh well, this meeting is mostly a formality anyway. The point is, when PreggoMall shows off their 'new' products in their showcase tomorrow, we pull the plug and take them down at their most vulnerable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no chance of us being sued for that, is there?\" Catalina asked Maritza, the company's legal advisor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not without them admitting they spied,\" Maritza grinned. \"They'd open themselves up to much more serious charges if they did that. No, this is about as perfect a plan as you could imagine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sarah was planning to pack up for the day, another of PregTech's employees, a young Indian woman with decatuplets, hurried in as quickly as she could with her belly and robo-spine. \"Did you all hear the news?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"News? What, about PreggoMall?\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They announced who their spokeswomen will be tomorrow,\" the Indian woman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd hate to be them,\" Catalina cackled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you should see,\" the Indian woman said before leaving. The three of them searched on their computers and Sarah's jaw hung down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah...is that your mother?\" Maritza said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the woman my father cheated on her with,\" Sarah said, still stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we still going through with it?\" Maritza asked. \"This will seriously embarrass her on stage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it'll be live-broadcast,\" Catalina said, still grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what'll it be?\" Maritza said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah stood still, her eyes darting around as she thought. One hand carefully stroked her belly before she got her answer. \"Ashley made her choice. We're going forward with the plan.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I wonder how Grant and Mara are doing without us,\" Joel said, resting his chin in his hand as he gazed lazily out the window of Brandon's car. He was anxious to get back since he was looking forward to the upcoming convention so much. The past few days had been stressful to say the least. There was all the drama with Janice, his accident and subsequent hospitalization, and his new-found trauma when it came to pregnant women. Plus there was a roughly day-long gap in his memory even though Grant told him he'd been totally social and even played Dungeons and Dragons with the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis convention would give him some much needed relaxation with his friends, his hobbies, and best of all, it would get him out of this crazy city for a few days. He couldn't imagine the concentration of extreme pregnancies would be anywhere else in the area, though that was a concern he harbored too. Joel shuddered as he pictured pregnant women at a comic-book convention, with huge bellies in cosplay. A week ago that would have been as close to a fantasy as he could picture but now it only terrified him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure they're doing fine. Grant said Mara is handy with costume-making,\" Brandon said, eyes on the road. \"Besides, I'm not that good at arts and crafts so it's probably better that they don't have me in the way when they're working. Any clue what they're making, by the way? I haven't gotten to see for myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They wanted us to be the Avengers,\" Joel said. \"Actually, Grant never got to tell me who you're going to be before you called me to leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope I get to be Spider-Man,\" Brandon said, a little grin forming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spider-Man's not in the Avengers,\" Joel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure he is. In the comics, he comes and goes all the time,\" Brandon said, turning to Joel with a puzzled look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think Grant's just focusing on the Avengers in the movies,\" Joel sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's not fair,\" Brandon grumbled as he turned to park in front of Katie's house. \"I like Spider-Man...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Joel slammed the door, he looked over the house, not recognizing it from any visits to Brandon's place. \"Um, Brandon, where are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I needed some extra help with something,\" Brandon said, smiling nervously. \"It shouldn't take too long. A co-worker of my sister's\u2013\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A 'PregTech' thing?\" Joel said, clearly worried. \"Dude...I told you, that stuff freaks me out now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll just be quick,\" Brandon said, pressing his palms together. \"Please? I need another person's strength, according do the call. And there must be some part of you that still wants to at least help a pregnant woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno...with my past luck, pregnant women have acted almost rabid around me,\" he thought with a shiver, reminded of how Catalina and a super-charged Grace chased him down. \"I don't want that to happen again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon thought about Katie's behavior around other women and her lack of attention to him. \"I don't think you'll have a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two entered Katie's house and followed the sound of grunts. \"Brandon? That'd better be you,\" Katie's muffled voice yelled from down the hall. \"Because those footsteps are too soft to be a pregnant woman's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me,\" Brandon said, eventually making it to her bathroom. \"Oh...you said you were stuck but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah,\" Katie sighed, rolling her eyes. She was wedged between the sides of the door to her shower, totally naked and still a little wet. \"No time for modesty. I could really use a hand out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I brought an extra pair of hands, if that's okay,\" Brandon said, stepping away so Joel could enter. Joel walked in slowly, his breath starting to pick up as he walked in. \"How are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I think,\" Joel murmured. \"I guess...I can't tell that she's pregnant from behind, so that's good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a nice compliment,\" Katie chuckled, barely able to turn her head to see them both. \"Now, if you wouldn't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel and Brandon both grabbed one of Katie's shoulders and gave her a tug. After a few moments of resistance, Katie stumbled back, knocking Brandon a few steps into her sink. As Katie fell into his arms, Janice tumbled out behind her and against Joel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Janice?\" Joel croaked, looking at the massively pregnant fitness instructor in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You,\" Janice angrily grumbled, locking eyes with Joel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They have some history,\" Katie said, grabbing a nearby towel and covering her breasts. \"Let's give them some privacy, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good,\" Brandon said, eyes on Janice's wet, naked, pregnant body as he followed Katie out of her bathroom and nearly missing the doorway as he left. \"You and Janice...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were just cleaning each other up,\" Katie smiled. \"We had a workout of our own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...see,\" Brandon gulped. \"Sarah said you liked pregnant women too but now I get confirmation, I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie chuckled. \"I've done well for myself so far,\" she said, stroking her exposed belly. \"And I hear you've been getting friendly with pregnant women in the area too. Including several of my co-workers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon blushed. \"It's been...nice, sure. Well, I don't have to tell you. I think we have the same taste in women.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We sure do,\" Katie grinned, moving closer so she could touch his amulet. \"This must have seemed like a godsend, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon froze. \"You...know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured it out long before anyone else,\" Katie smiled. \"I'd estimate about half of your mom's belly is thanks to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Brandon said slowly. \"You know...she's actually my adopted mom. And she and I got...intimate a few days ago too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie raised her eyebrows. \"You got to ride the Ashley express too, huh? And I'll bet she was bigger for you. Nicely done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's weird, right? The two of us getting this amazing pregnancy dream come true right in our laps,\" Brandon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's weird for sure,\" Katie laughed. \"But I'm just enjoying the ride. And seeing how much money I can make at the same time.\" Her amulet gleamed as her greed riled up inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in the bathroom, Janice kept jamming her finger into Joel's chest. \"You can't even look at me when I talk to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...it's embarrassing, don't make me say,\" Joel whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Embarrassing? What, now you're embarrassed that you got me pregnant and started hitting on other women while I was swollen with your children?\" Janice growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm kind of afraid of pregnant women,\" Joel said weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You weren't afraid when you were flirting with Ashely Dale,\" Janice said, squeezing part of Joel's chest muscle. With her wrath amulet, she could let out a lot more strength at once and Joel nearly fell to his knees in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some things happened!\" Joel cried out. \"Catalina and Grace...they terrified me. I had no idea a human being could be so ravenous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina...there's a name I know all too well Janice thought to herself. \"Who the hell is Grace? Let me guess: another pregnant bimbo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel slowly nodded. \"I'm sorry, it's been a crazy week in this city. And I didn't even know I got you pregnant for a long time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice was about to open her mouth to retaliate but stopped. She tried to bring up the exact memory of her impregnation to call out Joel but it just wouldn't come to mind. She couldn't remember getting pregnant. In fact, part of her started to doubt whether Joel was the father at all. He wasn't the only man in her life nine months ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Janice said with a long sigh. \"Let's just call it all off. I don't even want you in these babies' lives and I get the feeling you don't either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's what you want,\" Joel said, shuddering as Janice started to press her belly more tightly against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I want one thing to make us even,\" she scowled. \"I want to have sex with Brandon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With...with Brandon?\" Joel said, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You cheated on me so I'm going to sleep with your best friend,\" Janice said. \"Besides, he's kind of cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If...if that's what you really want,\" Joel said, opening the bathroom door. \"Uh...Brandon? Janice wants to have a word with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you two should wait for us in the living room,\" Janice said with a snake-like smile, poking her head and belly out of the doorway. \"C'mere Brandon. We haven't talked in a long time.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The meeting ended and everyone left the factory, all save one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah sat down in her office  with a bucket of fried chicken and a bowl of ice cream  next to her as she looked at her new pregnancy device. It worked well on her fellow Preg-Tech  employees, Sarah was now making a powerhouse, her company evolving by the minute.. A few restless kicks from her babies started all over her belly\u2026 \u201cDamn it\u2026\u201d She said, putting the piece of delectable dinner down on her belly, she began to soothe the restless sleepers with a good belly rub. The phone rang next to her as the babies calmed down.  Looking over she saw the Doctor Shultz was calling, that eccentric man who helped fund Preg-Tech. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood evening my fair lady, how has your new business been coming along?\u201d  Dr Schultz asked from his office in Charlesberg. \u201cMy assistant sent me some news about a protest that erupted in your city from yesterday, I hope no one was hurt\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo sir, I assure you I'm looking at the numbers and our costs and not only are we meeting expectations but we are going above and beyond\u201d Sarah confidently said, finishing her chicken piece. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInteresting, you see businesses aren't able to be up and running and turning a profit within weeks, let alone a day or two, are you sure you aren't telling fibs?\u201d The doctor replied looking at the paper work that Preg-Tech sent him over the past 48 hours. \u201cIt's okay, I can understand if you guys can't handle what's going on right now\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally the amulet would start tampering with Sarah's mind but Preg-tech was something Sarah had built from the ground up. She grew envious and almost furious at the remark of what Dr Schultz said. \u201cOh are you kidding me?\u201d Sarah exclaimed, failing at keeping herself together \u201clisten, you come here tomorrow at midday and I will show you how a well oiled, powerhouse this company is!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent, that's exactly what I wanted, thank you and see you tomorrow\u201d Dr Schultz said hanging up. As Sarah hung up she realised that is exactly what he wanted. He could have simply asked or just dropped by but that was not how the doctor rolled. He wanted Sarah to ask him to join, so that if anything was going right, he could take in the fame for her effort. If they were falling behind, it would be an opportunity for him to take control of, well, everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah needed to show the doctor hat she had made some progress with the amulets and its affects, so she worked hard trying to find something new and innovative. Her mind and body ran like clock work, so far she had made the Robo-spine, the Belly  Massager with the Sleeping Mask, both of which she used on that strong Asian lady back when there were troubles at that now god forsaken Preggomall. Today she had the Pregnancy-Changer finally fixed, but she already showed that to Dr Schultz\u2026 She needed something new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking through her past schematics, she had done everything before, then she remembered something. Sarah had been affected by the Preg-Converter by Antonio Greene and she had started working on a prototype that was used at the protest yesterday. Looking at her amulet and the Pregnancy Changer, she realised she could finally convert her belly to pure energy, PERMANENTLY! No more unborn foetuses kicking her bladder in the middle of the night, no more dealing with cankles and swollen feet from the sheer weight of her belly, no more strange cravin- well maybe she could keep the icecream and fried chicken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her watch, she realised this new project would take her all night, so Sarah grabbed her pen and note pad and got to work<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel went to leave Janice and saw Brandon walking in. \u201cbrace yourself\u201d joel whispered to his friend walking into yet another horizontal pelvic dance. \u201cHuh?\u201d Was all Brandon could say before Janice glommed he unsuspecting fool. As the door closed all Joel could hear was \u201cHey! What the? Ohh, oooOoooohhh\u2026 Ow, wait!\u201d  From Brandon's voice. He saw banging on the door but it stopped and after a few seconds, more passionate love making.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel sat down next to Katie, trying to get more accustomed with his once fond fetish. \u201c hi\u201d Katie said, turning to the tall innocent ginger\u201d so you're Brandon's friend huh?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I, I-uh\u2026 I\u2019m Joel\u201d Joel stammered out, trying not to see the large expanse that was Katie's belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're funny, you know that?\u201d Katie asked, a humorous look formed on her face. \u201c so, what have you two been up to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were just getting ready to go to this con tomorrow\u2026\u201d Joel said, trying not to look at Katie wearing nothing but a skimpy bra and shorts that she threw on. Her nipples were poking through the fabric, still erect from the action she had with Janice a while ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that Galacti-Con?\u201d Katie asked eagerly, her inner geek showing \u201c I know it has gone by other names, but OH MY GOD I wish I could go!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel looked over to see the eager look on Katie's face, it was almost borderline crazy. \u201cYeeess\u201d he said slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDaymn, I wish I could go\u2026\u201d Katie said slumping back into her chair. \u201cAshley Byron will be there and she is just so freaking amazing\u2026\u201d. Katie continued talking, trying to ignore what was going on in the other room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoud noises could be heard from the other room where Brandon was being pulverised through an endless cycle of sex and pain. \u201cOw! Okay, hold ooohhhhhh fuck!\u201d Brandon yelled from behind the bathroom walls of Katie's apartment. Janice started to moan more and more as she rode Brandon viciously. Brandon had heard of rough sex, but this was unbelievable!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice brought her leg over Brandon's shoulder and turned as she continued to thrust herself on him. Janice's belly hit Brandon again and again, which he enjoyed, but was leaving a tole on his now sore belly. He came a while ago but Janice was a yoga master, she kept him erect using some old yoga technique as she continued riding him until he couldn't walk anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie and Joel continued talking about Ashley Byron and their favourite characters that she played. \u201c i know I will be getting a signature tomorrow, did you want one?\u201d Joel asked Katie, wondering what she might say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie was about to answer when a loud ALLELUIA!!! Came from Her breasts. Shocked Katie pulled her phone from between her giggly vibrating bosom, apologised to Joel and answered. \u201cKatie speaking\u201d she said with a gleeful joy. The look of happiness lulled  when she found out it was her parents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi sweety\u201d Katie's father answered \u201care we still on for tomorrow? I can't wait for this news you're promising to tell us\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey dad, yeah I assure you, it will come as a shock, can we meet at the caf\u00e9 opposite of Charsleberg Quay?\u201d Katie asked in a school girl type voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, remember 11 am tomorrow, oh and we have a surprise for you too\u2026\u201d Katie's father answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two family member said their goodbyes and hung up. \u201cWhat's the surprise?\u201d Joel said, his hands not leaving Katie's mid section. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,just this new job\u201d Katie said with a smile \u201cand hopefully not is belly\u201d she added under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel and Katie looked longingly into each other's eyes, their love for geeky things had made a bond between the new companions. \u201cYou know, for a guy, you're really cool\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel was about to reply but was stopped by a hot steaming Janice bursting down the door from the bathroom. She was primal, with a look of a warrior in lust, almost satisfied from what she had given to Brandon. Speaking of the devil, Brandon was brought out of the bathroom by his left leg, they were both completely naked, the only difference was Janice could feel her legs. \u201cJoel, I broke your friend\u201d Janice  grunted as she walked towards them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel squealed like a little girl and ran for the door. Janice threw Brandon over to the lounge with tatters of his clothes plus his phone and wallet  in tow. \u201cow\u2026\u201d Was the only word to escape Brandon's lips as Janice dragged Katie in. Thinking quick Katie chucked an XXL shirt from her laundry t Brandon and picked up the coconut oil again. \u201cLet's not forget this, I don't want to get stuck again\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The sloth amulet was in full affect, with the massive seats installed for the cinema, she was comfortable as can be. The once proud assassin was shoving milk duds in her mouth and drowning them in fanta. The tale was very interesting, it was surprising to see so many people become pregnant at once, including men! \u201cWhat cruel God would make a man pregnant? That's a job for women, no man could go through that pressure\u201d Rebecca said as she reclined comfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to get back to her food when she felt her phone vibrating from her cleavage. Pulling the mobile out she saw it was  a text from the yoga instructor she had coffee with earlier today. &lt;Hey, I am making a roast for dinner, did you want to drop by?&gt;It read. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;sure&gt;  Rebecca typed back &lt;just let me finish this movie first, a bikini contest just started and I don't want to miss the climax&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later she felt that all too familiar buzzing. \u201cGee, he is an eager beaver\u201d Rebecca said opening the message up. &lt;Sure, and maybe we can talk about your work, I still have so much to learn about what makes Rebecca, well, Rebecca haha&gt; the yoga instructor replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;okay see you soon&gt; she typed! Finishing the convo. As she went to put the phone away, Rebecca got another text. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;hey, have received word that Sarah has been getting funding for her projects from someone that lives in Charlsberg, a man by the name of Dr Schultz. I would tell you more but I've left the mall with a special someone.  Can you head over there tomorrow and \u201cpersuade him\u201d to stop funding? Thanks, Erin&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;yeah, Can do! But with all this extra work I better see a raise&gt; Rebecca answered, before shoving her phone back between her breasts. With work ready for tomorrow, Rebecca went back to her movie. \u201cMan, there are a lot of belly dancers at this thing\u201d Rebecca said to herself as she shovelled more snacks in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon breathes heavily as he lay in Katie's lounge room. It was fairly near but overly spacious. \u201c I guess\u2026 I guess when two\u2026 Heavily pregnant women\u2026 Live together\u2026 You  get.. tired of knocking\u2026  things over\u2026\u201d Brandon said between puffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon rolled onto the floor and grabbed Katie's XXXL t shirt and put it on. For a girl who was once petite, she had really grown into something else. Sadly he couldn't find any of Janice's bras to call a \u2018trophy\u2019. Looking through the tatters of his clothes he found his phone, remarkably unscathed from the vicious sexual encounter with Janice, the yoga mistress she met a week ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was barely able to press fingers on the screen until Joel's name came up. Bringing the phone up to his ear was no simple task. After a few tries he got the phone up there to hear Joel say \u201chey, Brandon, how are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I'm fine, you just LEFT ME HERE WHILST YOU SQUEALED LIKE A LITTLE GIRL!\u201d Brandon screamed into his phone. \u201cOw ow ow ow, come get me, please\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cOh alri-\u201d Joel started before Brandon hung up. Brandon just managed to get himself up and sat on the couch as he waited for Joel to return to Katie's apartment. After Joel came back and rescued his friend they both made it to the car and headed back to Mara\u2019s.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was packed and ready to go at Mara's. Brandon was just finishing up some snacks he could bring to the con when Joel came in, drenched with \u2018Terror Sweat\u2019. \u201cJesus Christ, what's wrong with you?\u201d Mara said as she came over to check on her friend. \u201cAnd where's Brandon?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is in the car, dealing with pain. Me, I had a bad Ex-perience\u201d Joel said, taking a moment to drink a cup of water. \u201cAre we good to go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, let's go\u201d Mara said as she dragged Grant out of bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three went down stairs and lugged half of their costumes over to the car. Brandon had recovered a bit by the time they reached the car so he helped with the second half of the load. \u201cAwesome shirt man, I didn't know you were into women's fashion\u201d Grant laughed when he saw Brandon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up, we need to head to my place, then we can head to the hotel in Charlesberg.\u201d Brandon retorted as they drove over to Brandon's place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A limo was parked outside the front. \u201c that's weird\u201d Brandon thought to himself as he exited the car. Fully recovered from his injuries,  Brandon walked up to his place and snuck in through the side door. Looking around he saw the place was trashed. \u201cWhat on earth?\u201d He asked as he walked around. On closer inspection Brandon saw bras and clothes lying all over the place. Then a moaning came from upstairs. At first it sounded like one woman, then another feminine voice called out, a familiar voice. It was Ashley, and her voice was coming from Brandon's room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon tippy toed up stairs, trying not to release a creak from the stair below him. As he got closer, he could hear Ashley squeal and laugh. \u201cOH! How the hell, ooooohhh, fuck me faster, you sexy beast!\u201d. Ashley never called Brandon a sexy beast before\u2026 Who the hell was in there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly he opened the door to his room, only to see it was pitch black. He got down on his hands and knees as he crept towards the closet to grab a spare set of clothes. \u201cHehehe, stop it you!\u201d Ashley said laughing. \u201cIf you don't quit it, I won't remove the gag from your mouth!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGag?\u201d Brandon asked himself as he looked up. Through a slither of light he could barely make out the silhouettes of two heavily pregnant women. He was nearly at the closet, he just had to brush some chip packets away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the wind blew the door shut behind him. WHAM! It slammed causing the two lovers to stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on, I thought I closed that door\u201d Ashley said waddling over to turn on the light. Thinking quick Brandon eagerly ducked into the closet. Unfortunately he dove a bit too quickly and hit his head. \u201cOwww\u2026.\u201d He cried out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrap! Brandon? Sweetie?\u201d Ashley called out as she tuned in the lights. Brandon turned around rubbing his head to see Ashley's secret lover spit out her gag. \u201cHello Brandon\u201d A naked Erin said, rubbing oil over her huge seductive belly. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his ex lover and his ex mom both making love to each other, Brandon was filled with<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nBrandon was frozen in place, his eyes wide with surprise. He couldn't look away, partly because the two naked women in bed were so enticingly beautiful. Brandon had a powerful crush on Erin for years and had only gotten the opportunity to see her nude in his embrace a couple of times before things blew up between them and her pregnancy had progressed by leaps and bounds since then. And as for Ashley, well, she was one of the first super-pregnancies Brandon's amulet created and set all of this into motion. Plus, she wasn't the face (and body and belly) of PreggoMall's lingerie line for nothing. Even if she was struggling to cover herself up with the bedsheets, which was not very successful since it wasn't meant for two colossally pregnant women, Ashley still revealed plenty of her smooth skin and curvy physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon also struggled to avert his eyes because this scene was so confusing. Here, his adopted mother had chided him from years against dating Erin and after everything had grown more complex with Sarah's company and Erin's seizing of the mall, they were now caught in flagrante delicto, as it were. He already knew Ashley was more than happy to sleep with pregnant women as well as men but her choice of partner in this case could not have come as a bigger shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...um...\" That was all he could manage to get out of his mouth, his mind still racing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brandon,\" Ashley sighed again, covering her face with one hand. \"I'm...I didn't mean to embarrass you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be sorry,\" Erin said with a giggle, moving closer to Ashley and kissing her on the cheek. \"Besides, he probably already had sex with another preggo earlier in the day. That's how you work, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon felt his fingertips tingle as his body went numb, still working to process what was going on. \"S-Sarah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley lowered her hand. \"You and...well, if you and I could make love then it isn't that surprising that you and Sarah would take care of one another too.\" She hesitated for a moment. \"I just want you to be happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you really felt that way,\" Brandon started to say before one neuron spark finally gave him the push he needed to leave the bedroom. His clumsy body zigged and zagged down the hall until he made it to his own room, searching for his luggage with the desperation of a foraging animal. Had he stayed to finish his sentence, he would have taken Ashley to task for not permitting him to date Erin. \"If you really feel that way, you would have let me tell Erin how I feel a long time ago,\" he muttered to himself, taking in deep breaths to keep his head level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce packed, he hurried out of the house and hopped into the back of the car, bumping against Mara in the back seat. \"Oof, you're in a hurry,\" Mara said with an awkward laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine with me,\" Joel said, turning around from his place in the driver's seat. \"We can make better time this way.\" He turned to Grant in the passenger seat to make sure the GPS was all set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" Mara repeated, seeing the paleness in Brandon's face and his strange breathing. \"You look like a mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine,\" Brandon panted, nodding slowly. But as he sat, he realized something else that unsettled him. Finding Ashley and Erin in bed together had aroused him far more than he anticipated. Brandon's erection was painfully strong and it was taking over his better judgment. One eye passed over at Mara and his other hand moved to his amulet. I wonder how she would look pregnant Brandon thought to himself as he tapped the edges of his jewel. But because of Mara's infertility, instead, Ashley and Erin swelled up by a pair of twins each back in Ashley's bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?\" Grant said, turning around. \"You do look kind of rough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, I just tripped on the stairs and it startled me,\" Brandon said. \"Let's go.\" This weekend vacation was going to be a lot longer than he expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in Ashley's room, Erin was cooing and running her hands all around Ashley's new and, some would say, improved larger baby bump. \"I can't believe you aren't using anything to get your skin this good. It's a good thing you work for PreggoMall now because if we relied on you to buy our beauty supplies, we'd go bankrupt. You're a one-woman boutique.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erin...sweetie...I think we need to talk,\" Ashley said, taking Erin's hands and holding them in her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great, you're not going to start getting clingy, are you?\" Erin sighed. \"Just like a Page. You'll say you love me one day and then fuck your way through a maternity ward's worth of pregnant women the next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you may be my boss now but you're in my house and you'll show some respect, young lady,\" Ashley said with a booming voice. Erin looked at her with surprise and clammed up before Ashley's face relaxed again. \"Erin, I think what I did was wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, having sex with your boss or having sex with your son's old girlfriend?\" Erin said. \"Or do you not call Brandon your son anymore? That'd be a little weird, seeing how you two shared some personal moments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our relationship is a little different now,\" Ashley said slowly. \"But I don't mean what you and I just did. I'll never say that was wrong. It was beautiful and amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin let out an aroused purr and rubbed her belly against Ashley's. \"That's some nice pillow talk but you didn't need to butter me up for another round, sexy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was wrong of me to ever keep Brandon from you,\" Ashely said, meeting Erin's eyes. \"Very wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin groaned and fell against Ashley's heaving chest. \"Ugh, you should have kept a better eye on him and saved me a lot of heartache. All Brandon wanted was a big belly to rub.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not true,\" Ashley said, hugging Erin closely. \"I know Brandon much better than you do. He is one of the sweetest people I've ever known and he cares deeply about many people. And for more than just their belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, right,\" Erin scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am right. I knew when he started fawning over you when you were both kids,\" Ashley said. That shut Erin up. \"He wanted so badly to tell you how he felt and I could tell that you felt the same way. But I wouldn't let him. I thought your family was too...it always felt like you looked down on us and I despised you for it. And maybe things would have been much better if you had been together all those years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I wouldn't have gotten pregnant when I did,\" Erin said quietly, not wanting to reveal to Ashley how much she knew about the amulets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how things would have turned out but it was wrong of me to stop him,\" Ashely said. \"Brandon loves you and I think deep down you still love him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he loves me so much, why did he sleep around on me?\" Erin sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley stopped to think about it. Maybe being raised by Tanner let a little something sink into him? Maybe she didn't know Brandon as well as she thought he did. But there was one way to find the answer. \"I think that's something you two need to talk about with each other,\" Ashley said, kissing Erin on the forehead. \"But for now, you said something about a Round 2?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dr. Schultz hummed a German tune from his younger years \u2013 disco, what else? \u2013 as he packed up his files for the night. While the historical and archeological discoveries he made interacting with Sarah and seeing her amulet for himself were fulfilling steps in his academic life, he'd come to this town with one specifically goal in mind: make money. And by investing in PregTech, he had done just that. In less than a week of its launch, PregTech had broken any record Dr. Schultz had seen of an upstart's investment return. Things weren't showing any sign of slowing as competition between PregTech and the mall appeared to be stimulating the creative imagination of his golden goose, Sarah, even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled to himself, unable to avoid the realization that the amulets were responsible for this economic boom that tied in so well with PregTech and PreggoMall's own expansions. In his own financial assessments of the city, being the shrewd businessman that he was, Dr. Schultz couldn't help but see that the mall's previous owner, Antonio Greene, was on the verge of launching a similar pregnancy-centric product-line push. It was his bad luck that he had to step down before this could all fully get off the road, though he was doubtless making some sum of money, even with Erin at the helm instead of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Had I known how lucrative this could all be, I would have tracked down the amulets myself and used them years ago,\" Dr. Schultz laughed out loud in his office. \"Maybe Mr. Greene had the same idea at one point too. A lot of good it did him, if pregnant women ended up overthrowing him. He should have had a better corporate spy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He had the best there is,\" Rebecca said. Dr. Schultz flinched and, miraculously, he wasn't startled too badly to try and run away from the voice behind him. But as his muscles expanded and readied themselves, Rebecca's hand had already caught his shoulder and was applying just enough pressure to keep him in place. \"He just didn't know how to motivate me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Schultz was covered in a cold sweat, feeling a round, taut belly pushing against his back. \"What do you want with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a sec,\" Rebecca said, stretching her body out while lifting her other arm. \"Your hotel is super boring, you know that? There's no arcade, the pool is tiny and doesn't have a jacuzzi, and all the restaurants are so snooty. I didn't have anything to do while I waited for you to come back to your room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...it's meant for mature adults to stay in, not families and children,\" Dr. Schultz replied, not sure where Rebecca's going with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pssh, whatever. I can play games on my phone but it eats up battery like crazy. And when I lean my hands on my belly, my phone gets hot and irritates my skin,\" Rebecca said. \"So...wait, why am I here again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an uncomfortable silence as Rebecca held Dr. Schultz in place, stroking her belly as she thought while looking around the room. Dr. Schultz kept trembling nervously, unsure of what she was willing to do to him. He'd caught the pregnant women riots in the local news and worried this woman may be a fanatic, out to eliminate anyone who wasn't pregnant. \"L-let's just talk about this,\" he stammered. \"You know, I have a lot of connections inside PregTech. I can make this whole trip worth your while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PregTech! That was it!\" Rebecca said with glee. With one hand, she threw Dr. Schultz stumbling into a nearby chair, almost tipping it over. He clung to the armrests for dear life and looked over Rebecca in fear. Not only was she pregnant but she was one of the most pregnant women he'd seen in the entire city, which was saying something. And between her ample breasts was another amulet, identical to Sarah's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The amulet...\" he said weakly. \"Oh, I'm such a fool to be blinded by money to see what's really going on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, I want to get this over with quickly,\" Rebecca said, both hands stroking her large bare belly. \"I have a dinner date and I wanted to get everything off my plate in case I need to sleep in tomorrow, if you know what I mean.\" Dr. Schultz's face was drained of all color as he looked fearfully at her. \"Guess not, whatever. Look, I'm with PreggoMall and I've been asked to convince you not to invest in PregTech anymore. And while you're at it, leave town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two factions at war with one another,\" Dr. Schultz said, shaking his head. \"All over again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, all over again?\" Rebecca said, scratching her golden skin as she her eyes drifted to her cellphone, charging in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's what the amulets do. It's not enough to create the chaos of new and unanticipated pregnancies. They spit the seven apart and make them fight, resulting in more chaos for the demon Yaral to grow in power. And it shows no sign of slowing down this time around,\" Dr. Schultz said, his voice getting more and more terrified. \"There's only one way to stop it and that's the wielder of the master amulet. It requires incredible emotional balance and bravery but it would take someone of great character to turn all of this chaos into peace and order. And I don't think a person like that exists in this city. Not from what I've seen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca finished her long yawn and patted her hands against her belly. \"Oof, they always get feisty when I feel like falling asleep.\" She waddled closer to Dr. Schultz and gripped his wrists in her hands. \"Look old guy, it's just a yes or no question. Will you stop giving PregTech money and go back to wherever you're from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started squeezing his wrists, making Dr. Schultz immediately cry out in pain. \"Yes, yes, I promise! If the clash is coming, I want to be as far from this city as possible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, that was easy,\" Rebecca said, letting go of him and waddling toward her plugged-in phone. As she bent over, she groaned and cradled her belly, spreading her legs to accommodate its size. \"Hey, would you mind handing me my phone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-whatever you ask,\" Dr. Schultz said, rushing over and giving Rebecca back her cellphone. \"Just please leave me alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect,\" Rebecca said with a beaming smile, tussling his hair. \"Later dude. And try to relax some. You look like a nervous wreck.\" She waddled out the door with her usual slow pace, rubbing her belly as she called the yoga instructor on her phone. \"Hey! I'm about to head over. I just had to take care of some business for the mall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, I was worried you'd forget,\" the yoga instructor replied with a little laugh. \"You have a habit of that sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do n\u2013...wait, I meant to ask him to invest in PreggoMall instead,\" Rebecca said, turning around to look at Dr. Schultz's hotel room door, five feet away. \"Eh, it's too far of a walk and we're doing fine. Erin's unveiling her new line of products tomorrow so everything should turn out alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, well I'm looking forward to seeing you,\" the yoga instructor said with a breathy giggle. \"All of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca chuckled. \"I could use a good belly massage when I get there. Think you can do the job?\"</span></div></div>",

The stage was set and soon Louisa \u2018Erin's mom\u2019 was pitted against Barbara, one of the models that used to be the big gossiper in the old book club. But those book club days were no more. Louisa grunted as her wet breasts and huge belly rubbed up against Barbara's plump boobs and triplet filled belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're lucky your daughter isn't here to see you fail\u201d Barbara said as she grabbed Louisa's hair and pulled her down. The large mother lost her grip and slid to the floor. Wiping mud off her face she came straight down on Louisa, sitting on her face. Erin's mother tried and tried to escape, but in the end tapped out. Barbara won the match, and realising the power she held she marched over to Wendy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImpressive, walk with me\u201d Wendy said leading her into the mall. \u201cTell me Barbara, do you know who used to own this company?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome old coot I heard.\u201d Barbara shrugged as she walked beside her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll have you know that old coot is the father to my unborn child!\u201d Wendy struck back giving Barbara a stone cold look. \u201c I know many women here don't care about anything but their pregnant bodies however this child is Heir to the Greene empire. Antonio has collected a treasure trove of priceless pregnant artefacts and those will belong to me and my unborn son.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you telling me all this?\u201d Barbara asked her superior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I need someone to help me with a little bit of mutiny.\u201d Wendy answered, \u201c I won't get squat if Erin rules this mall for much longer. She runs a good business, but she is powered on hunger,that hunger will ultimately destroy her.  I on the other hand could make Antonio's empire run forever more. But first we need to take out some competition.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon, Grant, Joel and Mara barrelled out of the car as they reached the hotel in Charlesberg. Checking in they lugged a hundred kilograms of outfits up to their room. Joel was first in and as he switched on the lights, to his surprise he was surprised to see how boring the room really was. A basic living room, with a TV and a couch that looked like it had seen it's fair share of nights. As he went to the kitchen, he wasn\u2019t too impressed, complimentary mints were left on the counter and lastly a balcony that was covered by some curtains. The bedrooms were okay, by the looks of things, Grant and Mara had a bed whilst Brandon and Joel had a bunk bed. A bunk bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he hit the bathroom. He was amazed by what he had seen. A large spa bath with jets on the far end, accompanied with a shower that looked like it could fit a hippo! And obviously a toilet and a sink. \u201cHow the hell is there a such a bathroom in a boring hotel like this?\u201d Joel stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Joel, when you are with a woman on vacation, there are three things you want, a good clean bathroom, a comfy bed and room service! Who wants to eat?\u201d Mara asked pulling up the phone. \u201cI've been here before, for the last con, make sure you don't order the beef or the chicken, they have unbelievable seafood though.\u201d Maria said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I could go for some fish and chips, how about you Brandon, what do you want?\u201d Joel asked his now fully recovered friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't know what I want\u201d Brandon sighed as he walked out onto the balcony. He hadn't been listening to the conversation, he was too busy concerned with the predicament he was in. He had more sex in the past 4 days than he ever had. Every sexual experience was unique in its own way. Sarah's was by far the best sex he had, but it wasn't that intimate. The sex she had with Catalina was really hot, that fear of getting caught and that rush of adrenaline was something else, but she wasn't what she was looking for in a woman. He could go on, but he realised the woman he cared for was Erin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Erin was gone, she was with Ashley now, and maybe she was truly happy then. Maybe it was a good thing that he was taking this break from Small- Freyjaton, it would give him time to have fun, enjoy the sights. If Erin was having fun, then so would he. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back inside he saw everyone in swimmers ready to  head down to the pool. \u201cWhat's going on?\u201d Brandon asked his friends<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re off to a charity auction\u2026\u201d Grant said sarcastically. \u201c what do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe pool closes in half an hour, we\u2019re gunna go relax\u201d Joel said as he checked his swimmers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I don't have my swimm\u201d Brandon started. He wasn't even finished with the word and his friends were gone. Looking around he decided to fix the problem in his bedroom. Picking up the phone he called to ask about switching beds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later an eloquently dressed woman from room service came up with a handyman to help turn the bunk beds into two separate beds. A quick fix, but Brandon couldn't help but look at the lady that was serving him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill that be all sir?\u201d The woman asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon had to think quick, before the buxom woman left he almost yelled \u201cwait!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA \u2018yes?\u2019 Escaped from the waitresses large, seductive lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould I get a couple of Long Island iced teas?\u201d Brandon quickly said, thinking of the first drink that came to his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCertainly\u201d she replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, uuuhhh\u201d Brandon started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorderlia\u201d answered the waitress \u201c I'll be back in ten with your drinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cordelia closed the door Brandon spun around the room, becoming the worlds quickest cleaner. As he finished putting everything in there respective areas he heard a knock at the door. Cordelia came in with the drinks and placed them I front of the TV. \u201cEnjoy\u201d she said with a polite smile she started to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on\u201d Brandon said, trying his best not to test the poor woman's patience. \u201c I have these two Long Island iced teas and no one to share them with and I can tell you have been on your feet all day, why not sit down and relax?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice try, but I can't drink while I'm on the job\u201d Cordelia said with a little laugh. \u201cIn 15 minutes I should be able to\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I am sure there there is something we can do until then\u201d Brandon said reclining on the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh sweetie, you're cute, but I\u2019d need those two long islands before we do anything\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh screw this\u201d Brandon said, getting tired of the back and forth. He pulled out his amulet and decided it was time to speed things up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoohh\u201d Cordelia moaned. The sight never ceased to amaze Brandon. Her blazer was the first to burst, revealing a very tight strained shirt. Her belly grew further and further out, as each of the buttons popped off, one by one. Her belly plumped up to 7, 8 and finally 9 months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat familiar ping came to Brandon once again. Cordelia took a couple of steps back, compensating for her new weight, but in her mind, she was due with a baby in a week. \u201cOh my god, I'm sorry, I had a bet with a co worker about wearing this. What can I do to make up for it?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you could spend the last few minutes making sure those beds in there work\u2026\u201d Brandon said pointing to his and Joel's room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sly grin Cordelia waltz/waddled in that direction, slowly removing articles of clothing as she made it there. Brandon followed in suite, accidentally tripping over his own trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina rested in a spa of her massive hotel rooms ensuite back in Freyjaton. It was nice to rest after a hard day of work. She took on some new clients, had a good fuck and now, and she didn't get to enjoy that hot tub experience in that weird Preggomall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sat, she heard a knock at the door. \u201cOh come in, it's unlocked\u201d Catalina said, as she grabbed a glass of water. In burst 14 eager fans of Catalinas movies. \u201cOH MY GOD! CATALINA, I LOVED YOU IN \u2018ONCE BITEN, TWINS SHY!\u2019\u201d One pregnant 18 year old squealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCAN I HAVE A LOCK OF YOUR HAIR?!\u201d Another pregnant woman screamed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU WERE PHENOMENAL IN EZRA: THE AMAZON QUEER! ESPECIALLY THE SCENE WHERE YOU SCREWED THE WARRIOR PRINCESS!\u201d A guy called out.<br>\r\n\u201cWait a second, she wasn't in a warrior princess movie!\u201d One pregnant fan yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lone man in the sea of pregnant women realised he was the only one who knew about Catalina\u2019s past and ran out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did he know about my past?\u201d Catalina said before the fans swamped around the hot tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina was about to shoo them off but then her amulet started to kick in. These die hard fans loved and glorified her. A perfect pedestal for her to become the ultimate celebrity, not one that just sits high above the rest of the celebrities, but has her very own pregnant entourage too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of the hotel room Wendy stood with one of Barbara, now clean and clothed. \u201cOkay, if you want all this to happen, you will firstly have to do some tasks. Make sure Catalina doesn't leave this room, by ANY means necessary.\u201d Wendy ordered to her pregnant worker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she saw Barbara enter the room she started monologing. \u201cOnce, the book club turns on Erin, she will have no one else to back her up\u201d Wendy said to herself as Barbara entered the room posing as a fan. \u201cAll I need now is an opportunity to strike\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Guys?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around to see Grant mouth the word sorry as he closed the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat\u2026\u201d Joel said as he walked over to the fridge to pull out a drink.

Cordelias moans became beckoningly loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon flipped Cordelia over and started taking her from behind trying to stop her from being so vocal. \u201cThat's better\u201d he said as he heard the three guys get back to the hotel room.  \u201cDamn it, They're back from the pool\u201d Brandon whispered to his latest conquest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what?\u201d The buxom Room service mistress stated \u201caren't you having fun?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon was enjoying it. His fingers traced over Cordelias large backside. The problem was her vocalisations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but wouldn't you have more * nnnggghh * more fun if we had some coconut oil?\u201d Brandon answer whilst thrusting into her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm, true, but you can't finish now!\u201d Cordelia ordered \u201coooohhhhh, I'm almost there\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia continued to pant as Brandon thrusted into her. Cordelia\u2019s legs went weak as she began cumming. \u201cOooooooOooohhhhHHHHHH GGGOOOODDDDDD\u201d she bellowed as her bottom half quivered, shaking from impact of Brandon\u2019s member. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa\u2026\u201d Brandon said as he collapsed beside her. The quake from Cordelia died down and she placed her hand on Brandon's chest, lightly tracing it as Brandon touched Cordelias belly. It was smaller then his usual tastes, but there was much more her could do with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two fell asleep, naked basking in each other's body heat. With a big smile on his face and his right hand groping Cordelias breasts, he fell asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the night went on everyone hit the sack around the two cities. Sarah collapsed due to tiredness from overworking, her belly being used as a massive waterbed. Janice and Katie lay together naked on the living room flaw, covered by one massive blanket. Rebecca was in bed with her new lover, stir fry seemed to be a delight with the spy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina slept in an almost nest of fans, she was not going anywhere anytime soon. Lastly Erin lay in Brandon's bed, spooned by Ashley. She looked over at he bed side table to see a laptop. Trying her best not to wake her lover, Erin gently  unspooned Ashley and opened up her old friends laptop. On the background was a photo from Brandon's 21st. Everyone was in costume, Dressed up as their favourite movie character. A James Bondish Joel was feeding a frodo like Grant Beer through a funnel, Sarah was dressed up as April O\u2019niel, chatting with some of her cousins, up the back was Ashley and Tanner dressed as John Mclane and his wife from Diehard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cIt looks like the only loser here was the \u2018motherfucker\u2019\u201d Ashley said with a little laugh. She then made her way to the centre. Amongst all the friends and family were three figures. Erin was happy and drunk, dressed as Ariel sitting on a muscular jock dressed up as Vin diesels character from the Fast and Furious. Off to the left was Brandon, sitting with a drink, looking at Erin longingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe photo made Erin think. She did lead Brandon on for a long time. Maybe she was too harsh on Brandon. Looking at the users she found out that she could access Sarah's user on his laptop. She knew nearly everything about Sarah's business from the hidden spy cams, but this could give her access to EVERYTHING! Thinking quickly she shoved the Laptop into her bag and went back to spooning Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night rolled through and the sun rose. The question is, who woke  up first?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Like an earthquake, the ripples of kicking and movement spread from inside Ashley's womb, traveling across several feet of smooth, round belly until it was enough to wake her from her pleasant rest in Erin's arms. She smiled before opening her eyes, feeling Erin's belly resting on top of her own. It was the only way the two women could effectively spoon, after all, since they were both carrying close to 30 fetuses each and showed no signs of slowing down thanks to the amulets nestled between their naked breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley struggled to turn over and face her one-night lover, not wanting to rock Erin awake or smother her with Ashley's own pregnant middle. As she moved, she realized she had the added obstacle of Erin's vice-grip around both of Ashley's plump butt cheeks, which were starting to resemble a pregnant belly in their own right. But with some adept moves, Ashley was able to reposition herself and began to stroke Erin's hair, breathing softly as she studied her face. For so many years, she'd tried to keep this young woman away from her son, despite their obvious affection for one another. Maybe she'd secretly been jealous of them this entire time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ashley saw something that drew her attention away from her own lust, which at this point was nearly impossible. Erin's bag had changed places in the room and was now slung over a chair. Ashley could tell the differences because when they two of them undressed, they threw everything to the floor in an attempt to get intimate as quickly as possible. She would not have had the time or the focus to place her belongings somewhere with that much care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ashley could move again to try and get at the bag, there was a massive growl that tore through the air and made Ashley scream with surprise. Erin's eyes slowly opened and she began rubbing circles on her belly, now clearly the source of the noise. \"Mmm, I'm hungry.\" She looked up at Ashley's shocked face and smiled. \"Hi there. Good morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning,\" Ashley nodded back, starting to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My tummy didn't wake you, did it? I know it can seem a little intense at times,\" Erin said, patting her maternal weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, you're fine,\" Ashley purred, moving her hand to join Erin's. \"I know you're an animal, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin laughed and nuzzled Ashley's breasts, lightly biting at her skin before tapping her face against Ashley's amulet, and with a PING, both women's bellies continued to surge, putting them both at a nice, round 40 babies a piece. \"Breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me get you something,\" Ashley said, kissing Erin on the forehead. \"You're a guest in my home.\" As Ashley waddled out, making sure to sway her naked ass as much as possible as Erin watched her leave, she made a bee-line for Sarah's bedroom. It was empty and Ashley immediately guessed Sarah must have spent another late night at PregTech. Making her way to the kitchen, Ashley grabbed the phone and called Sarah's cell. She saw a figure move outside around the mailbox and she nearly covered up until she saw the mail carrier was a pregnant woman. Ashley made damn sure the woman at the door got a good look at her naked, round body as she dropped their postage off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nyello?\" Sarah's sleepy voice slurred on the other end. \"Mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi sweetie,\" Ashley said, crossing her arms. \"I didn't wake you, did I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure did,\" Sarah sighed, rubbing her eyes as her envy amulet started to pulse and burn. \"It must've been nice to have a real bed to sleep in last night. What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley took in a deep breath, unsure how to explain how she came to her information. \"I think Erin...may have one of your laptops.\" There was a pause on the other end. \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of my laptops. Okay,\" Sarah said, clearly tense. \"I can remotely delete any important files...how do you know this? Have you been watching my security footage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, she kind of...slept here last night,\" Ashley said, biting her lip and looking up at her bedroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom...Mom you let the head of my rival company spend the night at our house? Are you out of your mind?\" Sarah said, starting to raise her voice. \"You didn't let her stay in my room at least, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She and I...shared a bed,\" Ashley finally said, her other hand rubbing her big belly. \"A-and while I'm admitting to things...I also slept with Kim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad's mistress,\" Sarah sighed. \"Okay...okay, I'm not mad. I know you have a very...magnetic personality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah, sweetie, please...you're a very beautiful young woman too,\" Ashley said. \"I-I looked just like you when I was your age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While we're on the subject...I should admit to something too,\" Sarah said, taking in a deep breath. \"I had sex with Brandon. And I know you did too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley blushed, surprised by this development. There was a short pause before she spoke again. \"He's a very special young man, isn't he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's something,\" Sarah chuckled. \"But thanks for the heads-up, Mom. You really saved me a lot of trouble. Maybe you and I could have dinner soon when I'm not as busy with PregTech. A regular mom-and-daughter dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like that, though we're not exactly a regular mom and daughter,\" Ashley laughed. \"Love you, sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love you too, Mom,\" Sarah said before hanging up. She redialed to get Katie, still huddled on the floor of her apartment with Janice. She reached out from under her shared blanket and grabbed her phone as it rang. \"Get up you two. Big day today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm or you could join in,\" Katie purred, arching her back and stroking her enormous belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah narrowed her eyes. \"Excuse me?\" she said in a deep voice. \"Is that what you want to say to your boss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie's eyes popped open and her cheeks burned. \"N-no, sorry, just dreaming.\" Her amulet may have been pumping excess amounts of greed, along with babies, into her body so she wasn't about to lose such a big career over an errant flirt. \"Janice, c'mon, up and at 'em.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't be so sleepy if you hadn't been so pestering last night,\" Janice growled and she stood up, hands on her toned naked hips. \"Do I have time to go on a run? I have to do my daily 10K.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make it fast,\" Sarah said. \"Today's PreggoMall's big launch of their stolen tech from us and it's the same day we throw the switch and make all of their new pregnancy gear useless. We'll finally put them out of business and PregTech can truly dominate the city...anyone know where Catalina is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll find her!\" Katie said, hopping to her feet. She may have had over 100 pounds of belly in front of her but the prospect of being alone with the Catalina Corazon once again gave her the energy to push through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll probably regret this but go ahead,\" Sarah nodded. \"I've got my own work to do first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the Page house, Ashley was pushing her bedroom door open with her bottom as she carried a massive plate of food. \"Breakfast in bed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Erin said with a smile, now sitting up in bed with her naked breasts and belly sticking out. \"But what will you eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will...\" Ashley said as Erin took the plate and began to chow down by herself. \"I can always get something later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as Erin ate, there was a look of masked melancholy on her face. The images she saw of herself with Brandon on the computer, one of the few photographs Brandon had thought to save, stayed with her. She may have been the CEO of a quickly growing company and was in bed with an otherworldly beauty but she couldn't help but feel that things were better for those few days she was with Brandon. After tearing through half the plate in about 90 seconds, she turned to Ashley, now sitting on the edge of the bed petting her stomach. \"Do you know where Brandon is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brandon?\" Ashley said, a little surprised since she knew Erin hated him passionately now. \"He's out of town with his friends at a convention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Erin nodded, knowing exactly the event she was referring to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aren't thinking of...visiting him, are you?\" Ashley said, a smile starting to form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, I was just-\" Erin began to say before Ashley kissed her on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go,\" Ashley whispered. \"You two have been apart for far, far too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Erin was about to open her mouth, her phone began to buzz. Quickly she snatched it up and switched to her CEO voice. \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erin, it's Wendy,\" she said, a crafty smile on her lips. \"The big release event is soon. Are you coming?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I coming? Don't you know who you're speaking to?\" Erin barked back. \"I'm the brains of this whole company. I'll be there.\" She looked over at Ashley and smiled. \"And I'm bringing our new secret weapon with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, just checking,\" Wendy said before hanging up. Her smile grew as she rested one hand on top of her budding belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for the big event,\" Erin said to Ashley. \"Ready to be there as our company arm candy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lust in her amulet began to build up again and Ashley felt a shiver run down her back at the thought of modeling her expectant body for everyone to see. \"I'm ready.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The main floor of the mall's central plaza had no standing room available as reporters and pregnant devotees filled the hall. None of the pregnant women minded having their bellies shoved against the firm, fertile middles of their fellow sisters-in-maternity but the few women in the city who weren't expecting and the few men not too scared off to attend were less than happy about the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is worse than covering a campaign speech,\" one cameraman complained to a colleague holding a microphone on the end of a long pole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it. The only one who loves getting their hands this dirty on a report is Jennifer Armstrong,\" the boom mic operator said. \"Say, where is she? I'm surprised she'd miss something like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Focus you two,\" Marita Cardona, one of the city's other intrepid female reporters (and currently its most pregnant reporter) said, straightening out her maternity blouse. After the \"accident\" a few days ago, she tried to get something larger to accommodate her massive pregnancy but with 15 babies that were days away from delivery, she didn't have many options. Her bright red maternity blouse only covered her dark brown belly up until her inverted navel. Then it was anything goes. She at least had a jacket on over top to draw attention away from how pronounced her chest had become over the course of her pregnancy. \"It looks like they're about to come out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the front of the plaza was a stage, first used nearly a week ago now for Catalina Corazon when she was still working for the Smallton Mall under Antonio's thumb. But now the display was far different. Louisa walked, or rather, waddled up to the podium, flanked by Kim and Ashley, both dressed in only lingerie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, I'm Louisa Parker, chair of PreggoMall's board of directors,\" Louisa said, turning her hips so her large belly stuck out far past the podium. \"But I have another, much more important title because from inside this belly came the young woman who will lead pregnant women all over the world into the future!\" The mostly-pregnant audience cheered, though many just cooed and stroked their round middles with glee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see,\" she continued, \"For so many years, pregnant women have been treated like second-class citizens. We aren't allowed to work, or move around on our own, or be considered 'sexy.'\" Louisa turned to Ashley and smiled. \"My friends and I can speak to that from personal experience, since all of us at PreggoMall have children of our own, with the exception of our CEO and Ms. Kimberly here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley and Kim walked out farther toward the crowd, walking around like models to show off their revealing outfits and their maternal curves. As they passed, both smiled at one another and Kim snuck a quick kiss on Ashley's cheek. \"Did they just kiss?\" the cameraman whispered to his coworker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno but they've got some incredible bodies,\" the microphone operator said with gawking eyes. \"I mean, if they weren't pregnant...I'd be losing my mind right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush,\" Marita said, her cheeks turning red as she watched the women on stage, enamored by their beauty. She'd always considered her round body ugly and weird but now she wondered if she looked that good pregnant...maybe she should even try and get bigger, if that was even possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can see from our models here, pregnant women are none of those things. They are strong, they are independent, and they are damn sexy,\" Louisa said to another chorus of cheers. \"That is what PreggoMall stands for, and with our technology, pregnant women can become even stronger, braver, and yes, sexier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarita's hands started rubbing her belly faster, rolling up more and more of her blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now would you please join me in our unveiling ceremony for the future of pregnancy by giving a big hand for our CEO and the fruit of my womb-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Louisa stopped when she saw Wendy walking out instead. Let's rewind a few minutes:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Louisa was going out on stage, Erin was pacing back and forth behind the scenes, her hands traveling all around her belly. Or at least as much of it as she could reach. Normally when she had to give a big speech, whether at her old work or in school, she got butterflies in her stomach as many people do. But what she felt now was not butterflies, though the near-endless fetal kicking she felt could easily be mistaken for that sensation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, Erin felt a very particular unease. Her mind was filled with thoughts of Ashley (not helped by the buxom bombshell now parading in lingerie with a 40-baby belly hanging out) and especially Brandon. Memories of going to previous Comic-Con and Comic-Con equivalents kept seeping into her mind and she thought about how much fun those all were. With a sniffle, she wiped away a single tear that was forming and waddled over to Wendy, who was hard at work typing on a private tablet, built to be half a decade ahead of anything on the market now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wendy,\" Erin said, her voice trembling, \"I-I can't go out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, nerves?\" Wendy said, not looking up. \"Put on one of those massage helmets we're going to unveil. They work, don't they? We copied PregTech's design to the T.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I mean...I have somewhere else I need to go,\" Erin said, shaking all over. \"I...I'm sorry.\" Erin waddled away as quickly as her massive body could take her, fishing a phone out of her cleavage. \"Dana, it's Erin. I need a ride. We might be gone for the whole weekend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDana was a private driver for Smallton Mall and stayed on as an employee when the gravid uprising took place. She was a good looking young woman with olive skin and dark hair she kept in a ponytail. Now that she worked for Erin, she was far more pleased with her treatment and her increased pay and even took on a double role as Erin's personal assistant, which she did quite well. And also she was extremely pregnant and couldn't love the experience more. Erin had never seen her even attempt to cover up her bare belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing boss,\" Dana chirped on the other end. \"Where to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give you the directions when we meet up,\" Erin said. \"But we'll also need to stop by a costume shop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack behind the stage, Wendy let out a long breath. This wasn't how she expected the day to go but it was better than she could have hoped for. Now she was in a much better position to take control of PreggoMall if she was leading the flagship product launch. Wendy was even more averse to public speaking as Erin but she placed one hand over her small belly and sucked in a new breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can do it,\" Wendy told herself in a low, quiet voice. \"You have part of Antonio inside you. You have his power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy nodded and walked out on stage as Louisa met her eyes. \"A-a big hand for our...director of operations, Wendy...\" She leaned away from the microphone and whispered. \"Hey, I don't have your last name written down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greene,\" Wendy said with a smirk. \"From now on, call me Wendy Greene.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we're about to hear from another official in the PreggoMall company about what they're offering,\" Marita said to the camera. \"Again, I'm Marita Cardona, reporting live.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, she's showing a lot of belly,\" Katie said, staring intently at the TV in the PregTech office. \"Though I wish they'd focus the camera more on Ashley and that other woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my mother and the woman who broke up their marriage,\" Sarah grumbled. \"If you couldn't find Catalina, then you can at least be quiet.\" Katie clammed up and decided to ogle the women in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When do we pull the plug?\" Janice said. \"I can't wait to teach these cows a lesson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soon,\" Sarah purred. \"We just need to wait for the right moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile all that was going on, Brandon and friends waited in the massive line leading into the convention center, all dressed up in their Avengers costumes, when they finally got near the massive building's entrance. \"Okay, we're finally here!\" Grant said with excitement. \"I've been waiting for this all year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When we get inside, should we stick together or all split up?\" Mara asked, adjusting her Black Widow suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you stick with me,\" Grant said, giving her a kiss on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that answers that,\" Joel said, rolling his eyes. \"I'll split up. Brandon, you want to stick with me or walk around solo for a bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Brandon said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brandon?\" Joel repeated. But Brandon was looking off to the side, distracted. He could have sworn he saw a woman in a Supergirl outfit who was...well...pregnant. Blue t-shirt and red skirt but nothing to hide a big, round belly. When he looked again, he couldn't find her in the sea of other costumed nerds. There couldn't really be pregnant women here too...could there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll walk around alone for a little while,\" Brandon said vacantly. \"I-I'll text you guys.\"</span></div></div>",

As he got close he paced himself and took a look at the woman. She looked like she was supporting decatuplets, almost.  But the fact she put the fort into still wearing the costume whilst in this state was impressive. Her large rear was getting a major wedgie from wearing her undies on the outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped closer and recognised her face. It was Grace, the nurse that helped out Joel after his unfortunate brain injury. The same woman who gave him her number after the weird accident at the mall.. \u201cMan cons are fun but the merchandise always costs an arm and a leg.\u201d Grace said under her Breath as she flipped through DVDs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaving trouble?

Hey\u2026\u201d Brandon said rubbing his arm. \u201cI'm sorry I forgot to call\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're a real ass face you know that?\u201d Grace said, an angry look on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Grace continued to embarrass Brandon in front of everyone, an extremely sexy bodacious woman in a Jane costume walked confidently walk over. The costume was a bright yellow and very Victorian, but she made adjustments to show off a lot of cleavage. She threw her dark brunette wig over one side as she swayed her hips. It was Becka McLean, or as she was more commonly known in the cosplay community as, \u2018Princess Becka\u2019 for her various Disney cosplays. Most notably she cosplayed Belle, Ariel, Jane and Elsa, all female characters from various Disney entities. However now that Marvel was bought out by the happiest company on earth, she decided to wear something more daring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say Becka was a commanding person was an understatement. She knew how to manipulate and rule geeks with an iron fist and voluptuous chest. She had managed to over take every other female cosplayer, even Jessica Nigri! Now she stood proudly on her ivory pedestal, and she wasn't going to let any other cosplayer take her place. She saw Grace trying to pull off her costume but struggling with nine babies inside her. But Grace had a little bit of a following behind her. Graces pregnant cosplays had gained her some fans that were more interested in her belly than anything else. This made Becka FURIOUS!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Joel saw the very seductive Becka and  walked over in his Thor costume, swinging  his hammer the same way  he swung his penis, like a cricket bat. \u201cPrincess Becka, it's such a surprise to see you not as belle. Why is that?\u201d Joel asked suavely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause all the guys act like gaston\u201d Becka snapped back, not being able to muster some fake politeness. Like a homing missile Becka directed herself at the large target that Grace was. She may have been short at 5\u20192 but she strode confidently like a Queen. \u201cwell if it isn't Miss Preggy, have you found your Kermit yet?\u201d She smugly said miraculously talking down to her as she looked up at the pregnant superhero. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeez\u2026 Brandon thought to himself, that was low but how could I embarrass her? He thought about making her pregnant, causing her to burst out of her dress, but reality would change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up, you have no idea how hard this is to be pregnant, or how this  affects my life!\u201d Grace stammered back shaking her large belly as her angry face changed into one that was upset. Brandon's guilt for the pregnant cosplayer was really piling on. He caused so much chaos in this world and was enjoying it, he never realised someone may have a bad affect on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when he saw Joel. Joel used to love pregnant women until they scared the shit out of him. His friend was now feeling lonely. Maybe he could do something about it. That's when the announcer spoke up. \u201cHELLO CON GOERS! I HOPE YOU\u2019RE READY TO MEET THE TALENTED HAYLEY HEWITT FROM EZRA: AMAZONIAN QUEEN AND THE VERY BEAUTIFUL ASHLEE BYRON, WHOM YOU MAY REMEMBER FROM TITAN HUNTERS: THE BOUNTY OF ANDROMEDA. THEY WILL BE GIVING THEIR TALK ON WOMEN PROTAGONISTS AT STAGE THREE IN FIVE MINUTES\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shit, I forgot about that\u201d Joel said as he ran over to Brandon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDON\u2019T FORGET AT 1PM WE WILL HAVE OUR COSPLAY COMPETITION, JUDGED BY THOSE LOVELY LADIES! WHO KNOWS, MAYBE YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS WILL WIN AN EVENING WITH THEM PLUS THE MANY OTHER STARS HERE AT GALACTI-CON\u201d the announcer echoed through the con before ending his announcements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't think about joining the cosplay Comp, your belly couldn't handle the competition\u201d Becka said laughing as she walked away, boobs and arse jiggling as she strode forth. Brendan was furious, he wanted to pregnate her so badly but she kept her cool. In order for him to humiliate her, he was going to need to reveal the secret of the amulet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace slumped in her costume, depressed with what just happened. \u201cHey, don't look so sad, I think you look beautiful\u201d Brandon said patting her on the shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand\u201d Grace said \u201cBecka is the most famous cosplayer here. If I do anything like claim she was harassing me, her Vulture like friends would attack me!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if I told you I could take your pregnancy away and give it to Becka?\u201d Brandon said smiling. That's when he saw Joel come by. Brandon realised he couldn't let Joel know about his amulet so he quick turned to him and said \u201cJoel, could you give us one second?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSsuuUUURREE!!!\u201d Joel said as he saw who he was talking to. He saw Graces very pregnant belly, turn tailed and bee lined away from them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Grace asked, not noticing Joel. \u201cWhat, do you have your own tesseract?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomewhat\u201d Brandon said as he revealed his amulet. Grace was mesmerised by the beauty the amulet held. It had been a while that he actually looked at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I remember this, from that time in the mall. shouldn't we be doing this behind closed doors?\u201d Grace whispered to Brandon, trying to be secretive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah it's cool, this thing rewrites reality for all those who don't know what it does.\u201d Brandon said, \u201cnow look.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace looked down to see her belly add an extra five babies inside, almost tearing the costume. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Whoa, what are you doing?\u201d She almost yelled, huffing with all the newly found weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoops, sorry force of habit, here\u201d Brandon said as he reduced her belly to the point where she wasn't pregnant at all. Her pregnancy, all 15 foetuses sucked into the Amulets many gems. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace looked down and saw her body was back to normal. She was almost at the point of tears. \u201cThank you! Thank you so much Brandon!\u201d She said hugging the star spangled man. \u201cHere, I have an idea.\u201d She said as she wrapped up the amulet and put it in an opaque  box with a blue light inside. \u201cNow it's apart of your costume!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel stopped running for time had been rewritten. He walked back to Grace and Brandon, with a memory of having sex with Grace, but without her pregnant. \u201cSo what happens to the pregnancies?\u201d Grace whispered to Brandon as she saw Joel heading back towards them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt stores them, ready to be transferred to someone else. I have a plan for them But for now, I think you and Joel should chat.\u201d Brandon said as he walked off to Ashlee and Hayley\u2019s talk on women protagonists. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u201d Joel said suavely to a cute petite Grace. \u201cI didn't know you liked geeky stuff\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Let's say I'm like the doc from back to the future. My love for all geeky things is larger than 1.21 Jigawatts.\u201d Grace answered with a sly grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two cosplayers had fun talking about their passions, meanwhile\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Squeezing back into the back seat of the limo she adjusted herself inside as Dana  zoomed off onto the highway. \u201cYou\u2019re okay for me to get dressed in the back of the car right?\u201d Erin asked as she unbuttoned the pantsuit she was wearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah sure\u201d Her driver  answered delightfully. The barrier went up and Erin got started. Dana happily listened to some tunes enjoying the drive to Charlesberg.  All that changed when they pulled out onto the highway. \u201cOh no\u2026\u201d She said as she pulled on the breaks. \u201cWe had a problem\u201d Dana  said winding down the window to see Erin with a breast free and taking everything off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWIND UP! WIND UP!\u201d Erin called out as she dropped pieces of her costume. The barrier went back up and the comm came on. \u201cSorry about that\u201d Dana said over the intercom. \u201cBad news, the radio says there was a car crash outside of Charlesberg\u2026 I'm checking the GPS and it looks like we won't get there for another 2 hours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat, we may as well turn back and I can cover the rest of the presentation\u201d Erin said as she slumped in her chair, looking at her brunette wig and red dress. She remembered how much Brandon liked Peggy Carter from Captain America. Sure she wasn't in a slave Leia costume, but she remembered what Brandon liked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the car was about to turn around they both saw the traffic was equally bad both ways. \u201cForget it, let's just go to Galacti-con. stupid Antonio, not investing in any help-freaking-copters\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin slumped back into her seat defeated as her large breasts bounced on her plump juicy belly. Placing her juicy breasts back into their confined bra she flipped a switch and down came a TV with the coverage of Preggomalls latest \u201cinventions\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst up we have the Lazylady\u201d Wendy said as she pressed somewhere on her high tech tablet. Curtains revealed a very Kim comfortably sitting in a perfectly shaped couch, curved to her every shape. \u201c this one was developed by some of our scientists\u201d Wendy said as she turned to the sexy model \u201cKim, could you press the purple button?\u201d. The Kim did as she was told and pressed the button whilst she groaned, her babies were once again kicking. A small bit of calming spray came from behind the chair.  Almost instantly the babies calmed down and Kim started to fall asleep.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs she okay?\u201d One of the reporters asked, concerned with the model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh she is perfectly fine, the scent is a combination of Aloe Vera, cinnamon and several calming fragrances imported from China and Africa\u201d Wendy said with a big smile \u201c100 percent o natural, no chemicals just what you and your baby need. Up next we have A Mudams Best Friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA curtain came up to reveal Ashley soaking in a perfectly modelled mud bath. \u201cIf you are a woman who wants to keep looking like a sexy goddess whilst your pregnancy is causing break outs and other unpleasant skin irregularities then this is right for you.\u201d Wendy confidently described to everyone \u201c It doesn't matter if you are here for 20 or 50, this bath will make you look like a Emma stone or Jennifer Lawrence, whilst pregnant of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan normal people use this mud device?\u201d An obnoxious reporter asked, annoyed that he had to cover this event. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, you are at the Preggomall, you shouldn't remind you to have an idiom of respect.\u201d Wendy sternly said with a glare at the now shocked reporter. \u201c But I am afraid this is, just like every device here today, pregnancy focused, because WE CARE FOR THE MATERNAL WOMAN.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audience erupted in a thunderous applause. \u201cWe love your products!\u201d A pregnant woman called out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh please, they aren't my products, I'm just the one that runs the business side of things, Now Erin, she came up with these great ideas. Let's get on with the show\u201d Wendy declared with a little bit of fake bravado. She knew by saying that she was setting herself up for any problems that these items may have. If one product failed, she could say It was Erin's fault. That one line secured her spot for any situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet's move onto the next item, we are only one third of the way through, but I assure you, we are doing much more than those guys at pregtech.\u201d Wendy laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's sat in her chair, trying to be calm but it wasn't working. She was happy to see her mother accomplishing something, but she hated the fact that the Preggomall was doing so well. She was supposed to get a visit from Dr Schultz, but she still heard nothing from him\u2026 The strain was starting to take its tole on the sexy inventor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLET ME AT HER!\u201d Janice said as she leapt for the TV. Katie grabbed Janice's leg but the force was too great. They barrelled over each other like a sack of potatoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOi! Get back here\u201d Sarah ordered as she reclined in her chair. \u201cIf you  are going to be here, you are going to learn some self restraint. AND THAT GOES FOR THE BOTH OF YOU!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was angry, so far Wendy had announced nothing that Pregtech had been producing, she wanted to launch the virus there and then, but she knew she couldn't. A virus that would short circuit every one of Pregomalls stolen items at once can't be used until everyone has purchased the new products. That way the virus affects EVERYONE. No one will escape the city wide shutdown. Everyone will have faulty new products and who will they blame? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Preggomall. With that much hatred on the streets Preggomalls stock will plummet and it will go bankrupt. There will be chaos\u2026  once there is complete disarray Pregtech will come in, rescue the city  and make a new order. Sarah knew Both companies couldn't work together, there would always be one side trying to one up the other. But her goal was something wonderful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt will be one where pregnant women, oh let's face it, women and men can feel safe together, where the only piece of disorder is not knowing what to have for dinner. A paradise for pregnant women and men in unison, and she will be the one who made it happen. Her greatest invention, \u2018Peace\u2019 on a dynamic scale. She would have made the biggest impact to the city and she would be envious no more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem is, she needed her spokesperson to help her with Pregtechs rescue plan, so\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere was Catalina?<br>\r\nWhere was Dr Schultz?<br>\r\nWhere would Pregtech be by the end of the day? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Katie was hard at work at her desk in the PregTech headquarters, her nose buried in the numbers. With Sarah's rousing pep talk, as well as a smattering of implied threats from both Sarah and the especially-vicious Janice, combined with Katie's libido presently satiated after a night with the wrathful fitness instructor, Katie was back on track as PregTech's key financial whiz, helped on by her own \"greed\" amulet. Between PregTech and PreggoMall, her side had more sin-promoting amulets but so far it wasn't slowing them down any. And that wasn't counting Brandon's but no one, not even Sarah who first cracked the way to manipulate the amulets' energy, knew what his was capable of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Sarah?\" Katie said at one point. The broadcast of the PreggoMall showcase had been moved far away from Katie's desk, lest the parade of bellies and babes distract her anymore. She lifted her head and called out louder. \"Sarah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Sarah yelled back from her viewing room, with Janice and their lawyer Maritza by her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop shouting,\" Janice growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There there,\" Maritza said, giving Janice's belly a light rub. \"We can all be calm, okay?\" Janice huffed in response, not wanting to show just how relaxing a belly rub was to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah tapped the PregTech logo lapel, which she had redone as a short-wave communicator between employees inside the bustling PregTech office and factory. \"What's up, Katie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've just been going over the figures for next quarter and...there's a problem,\" Katie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A problem? What sort of problem?\" Sarah said, turning her eyes back to the television screen, just in time to see her mother Ashley strut out in some new maternity clothing that she had to admit was very alluring, even if it was coming from a competitor. \"Now's a bad time to have problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's our investment capital. It's gone,\" Katie said, tapping her laptop to refresh. \"Yeah, whatever money that Schultz guy promised us to start the year with is no longer in our coffers.\" She heard Sarah start to breath heavily on the other end. \"I mean, we still have his initial investment so it's not like the doors are going to have to shutter soon but we don't have enough to sustain the kind of growth we've planned for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about if sales go through the roof?\" Sarah said, the envy in her amulet burning as she watched how well PreggoMall's showcase was going. \"Once I crash the mall's party, every big-bellied woman in the city is going to be banging on our doors begging to buy from us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not with the inventory we have now,\" Katie sighed, her fingers moving a mile-a-minute as she typed out calculation after calculation. \"We'd have to show some sort of whole new company service to open up a new lane of patronage, or even attract new customers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah fell back into her seat, letting her mind go clear. She shut her eyes to the events going on at PreggoMall and focused her genius mind on the problem at hand. And at the end of her mental firestorm, she came to the only answer. \"I was hoping to wait longer for this,\" Sarah said, \"but looks like I have no choice. Dr. Schultz either got wet feet or PreggoMall intimidated him somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you do have a plan?\" Katie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I've had this plan for a while now,\" Sarah replied. \"I'll send you the figures now for you to crunch and get back to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beautiful and smart,\" Katie purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get distracted now,\" Sarah said, standing up proudly. \"This is PregTech's most crucial moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit down. Your big belly's blocking the screen,\" Janice grumbled. But Sarah paid her no mind as she stomped to her office and pulled out the massive external hard drive she'd kept locked away under several layers of security. Even Rebecca couldn't break into this. With her pregnancy-supporting robo-spine, Sarah made her way through headquarters to Katie's desk and dropped off the multi-terrabyte hard drive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think you can handle it?\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie plugged it in and gasped when she saw how much data was waiting for her to sort through. \"This will be...a challenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you can do it,\" Sarah purred, leaning down to whisper in Katie's ear. \"Do a good job and I'll reward you. After all, you and I still haven't...you know.\" Sarah let her tongue slip out just slightly to tickle Katie's earlobe. The young businesswoman's eyes opened wide and her amulet heated up, adding more than a few fetuses to her already sizable litter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm on it!\" Katie said, slamming her fingers against her computer's keyboard as she worked as quickly as she could. Sarah chuckled and strode to her own lab, letting her belly and ass swing with each step. Inside was her \"secret weapon\" against PreggoMall. It was something she'd kept so secure, she hadn't been in for days, which was why PreggoMall could never even install spy cameras inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the culmination of all her research into pregnancy energy and the power of the amulets. A massive antennae that would send out the same signal of both the amulet and the pregnancy energy converter. Once activated, every woman \u2013 not just every pregnant woman \u2013 would be affected by its powers. They would become comparable with the other devices Sarah created to control pregnancies. With just the touch of a button, a woman could make herself as pregnant as she wanted to be. Want to be six months pregnant with one fetus? Done. Want to be full term with 50? Done? Want to have unprotected sex without any risk of impregnation? Done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's more, the antennae would also make it possible for women to convert their pregnancy into energy. Not only would this allow pregnant women to power the city, with just one woman with triplets containing enough power for an entire year's worth of power for all of Freyjaton, but it would make them healthier, stronger, and allow them to carry their pregnancy indefinitely before turning the energy in their wombs back into fetuses and giving birth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was possibly the biggest discovery in the history of mankind and it would make PregTech more than just a company. It would make them a historical force. Sarah knew it would be a game-changing announcement but also knew PreggoMall was likely working on similar kinds of technology. She had to pick the right time to release it but it seemed like her hand was being forced by Schultz' withdrawal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, this was a big project and just because her time table was being changed didn't mean Sarah could be easy-going with it. She needed the rollout to work. And that meant a PR campaign. Which, in turn, meant she needed Catalina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maritza,\" Sarah said as she walked back into the viewing room. \"I need you to find Catalina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" Maritza said with shock. \"You're sure? You already sent out Janice and Katie and they couldn't find anything. Besides, I'm not as important to the company as you all. Why me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frankly, Janice and I need to stay here and monitor the situation at PreggoMall and...you have a clearer head than those two at the moment,\" Sarah said. Katie was obsessed with sex and Janice was fuming with rage, after all. \"And as an outsider, you may be able to think about these things better than any of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do my best,\" Maritza nodded as she heaved herself up. In her time with PregTech, she'd had her pregnancy increased and her 20-fetus belly now protruded far out of her usual conservative corporate dress in a massive brown bump. As she left the headquarters, she thought to herself. \"Maybe the Catalina Corazon fan network can help...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore joining the PregTech team, Martiza had already been a big fangirl for Catalina, feeling inspired by the pregnant movie star. In her past career as a lawyer, Maritza found herself discriminated against for being a woman, a Latina, and pregnant: all things Catalina embraced with pride. And, like almost everyone in the city, Maritza had a bit of a crush on Catalina as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Maritza's surprise, as she went through the internet history of Catalina fandom, there were too many dead-ends. Some of Catalina's most devoted fans hadn't even posted a Tweet since last night, which was not normal. She stroked her chin with curiosity and saw that many of their last Tweets were from the same location: a hotel in the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I know where to start,\" Maritza said to herself, stroking her belly as she hailed a taxi.</span></div></div>",

Ironically, it was his bumping-into Grace that calmed him down when normally meeting the extremely pregnant young woman would have put him into a nervous fit. And of course, calling Grace \"extremely pregnant\" was going off of any kind of standard that fit into medical propriety. Sarah and Ashley made a woman pregnant carrying 20 fetuses look like a walk in the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut by meeting Grace, Brandon assuaged his fear that the \"pregnancy epidemic\" he had set into motion was confined only to Smallton, or as his actions caused it to be known, Freyjaton. At least, that's what he hoped. A small itch of doubt remained in Brandon's heart as he walked through the convention floor, pushing past other enthusiasts in their own elaborate costumes. Thankfully, his was a little more compact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow that's a nice accessory,\" Brandon heard someone say from his right side. He turned to see a young woman in a full Harley Quinn costume bending over to inspect his \"tesseract.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh, thanks,\" Brandon said, worried about what was actually inside it causing it to glow. \"But the, um, lightbulb inside is pretty hot so you should probably not touch-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too late. The curious woman touched Brandon's cube and reacted with the amulet inside. Her latex suit groaned to stretch and fit the triplet-sized belly that pushed out from her body. There were a few rips and tears along her waist but she otherwise stayed covered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I'll be careful,\" she said with a little giggle and a pat of her belly. \"Gotta watch out for other cosplayers with spikes and swords too, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right,\" Brandon said with a gulp. \"Y-your costume is good too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" she said with a smile as both hands held her belly. \"I'd already bought the costume before I found out I was pregnant but it works just as well. It's canon that Harley had a baby anyway...though it probably wasn't this many.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon nodded quickly and hurried along as he tried to keep himself distract. The amulet was getting more dangerous as time went on, it seemed, and putting it away inside the model tesseract was not doing much good in keeping it out of harm's way. Brandon tucked it under his arm a bit more tightly but only ended up activating it once again. Across from him, two bikini-clad women dressed as Yoko Littner and Starfire respectively suddenly became very out-of-character as their tight stomachs changed in large, round pregnant middles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh oh,\u201d Brandon mumbled to himself, still snatching a few errant peaks at the attractive pregnant geeks as he hurried along. Brandon made his way into a less crowded room where he was immediately shushed for his loud steps. He hurried to an empty seat in the back as he focused on the stage. It was a small table set up with a moderator and two others sitting next to each other, speaking into microphones. Brandon instantly recognized the two of them: Hayley Hewitt and Ashlee Byron, two celebrated actresses in the world of sci-fi and fantasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of the table was a banner for their panel: 'Women in Geek Culture'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What we've been fighting to promote is the fact that women have been a part of writing and movies since the beginning,\" Hayley said, looking out into the crowd. \"This is not a recent phenomena. All we're asking for is the chance to prove ourselves and have our own stories be valued.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But unfortunately, the way the market has been segregated, a lot of people will hear or see that a woman is involved and lose interest,\" Ashlee said. \"And you have a virulent anti-feminist movement going on now that furthers that. I think the low attendance here is proof.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon heard what they were saying loud and clear. But at the same time...he had planet-sized crushes on both actresses for as long as he could remember and he felt his hands get closer and closer to his amulet until!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The discrimination really kicks in when pregnant actresses are ignored for roles they can still do,\" Hayley said as her growing belly pushed the table forward. From where he was, Brandon couldn't even tell how pregnant he'd made them but he felt like he'd added more than usual. \"Just look at the rising star Catalina Corazon. Clearly there is a market for pregnant actresses even in action roles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a reminder that Hayley and Ashlee will also be meeting with the winner of today's costume contest,\" the moderator said as a hand touched Brandon on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't help yourself, huh?\" Grace asked him in a laughing whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wha?\" Brandon stammered. In the flurry of pregnant women he'd had sex with since the amulet came into his life, she was one of the few close pregnant friends he hadn't gotten intimate with, though if he had to admit it, he wished he and Grace could have slept together. Even without her belly now, Grace was an absolutely gorgeous young woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Their bellies. I notice these things now, remember?\" Grace chuckled. \"Hey, wanna get out of here and head for the costume contest? There's someone I really want to see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon hoped he'd have another chance to see Hayley and Ashlee's pregnant bodies but he was curious about the contest too. In the main theater, it was packed as pop culture fans were seated and ready for the costume contest that always came to Galacticon. Brandon edged his way in, with only standing room available, as he prepared to watch the show himself. It would be a good distraction from the recent craziness surrounding himself and the amulet. And besides, it would be fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe costume contest was divided into men and women as the men started walking across the stage, each in detailed renditions of their favorite characters, whether it be a complex piece of armor for a character from a fantasy game or a full sized X-Wing for someone to stand in or a mostly-functional Iron Man suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lot better than your friend's,\" Grace said to Brandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi again,\" Brandon said. \"I thought you were walking around with Joel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, Joel wanted to check out some booths and he wasn't that interested in the costume competition,\" Grace said with a shrug. \"Besides, I wouldn't want him to see this side of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What side do you mean?\" Brandon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace turned to him with a nasty grin. \"The side of me that'll jump for joy when Princess Becka gets humiliated on stage when that giant belly of hers explodes out of her costume!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Technically it's your belly,\" Brandon said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace leaned into Brandon. \"And technically, you and that amulet of yours gave it to me from someone else so I wouldn't bring that kind of attention on yourself, pal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough,\" Brandon said with a gulp. He didn't even know if he had caused Grace's pregnancy or if it was one of the other seven amulets in the city. Hell, it could even have been due to Sarah's experimentation with the amulet's powers. \"You really hate Becka, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, every year she would single me out to mock my costume,\" Grace sighed, fluttering her costume's skirt. \"I mean, this doesn't look that bad, does it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no,\" Brandon said, getting permission to look Grace up and down. \"You look very nice.\" He felt himself getting more flustered and lost his internal filter. \"S-so...do you feel better now that you're not pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace sighed and touched one hand to her flat stomach. \"Sure, now I know I won't be raising nine babies at once. It's a big relief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right,\" Brandon said, feeling embarrassed about the situation his amulet set into motion. Then again, no one seemed to be close to giving birth either so maybe she would have been fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you know that weird company back in town, PregTech?\" Grace whispered, leaning in close to Brandon with a big smile. \"I hear rumors they've developed some way to let women carry their pregnancy indefinitely. Now that would be interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon felt himself start to shake more and more as the crowd cheered at the crowning of the men\u2019s contest winner. Grace clapped along, her mind not focused on her conversation with Brandon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow we can begin our women\u2019s costume competition,\u201d the announcer, a host of a well-known video podcast on \u201cgeek culture,\u201d said as the line of participating women formed. From their spot in the back, Brandon and Grace couldn\u2019t make out Becka in her Jane costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh!\u201d Grace suddenly said, grabbing Brandon\u2019s forearm and squeezing it tightly. \u201cI just thought of something!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what?\u201d Brandon said in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know how we can REALLY embarrass Becka! Why don\u2019t you make all the women competing pregnant?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon was totally nonplussed by her suggestion. \u201cW...why would I do that?\u201d he finally managed to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause if she\u2019s embarrassed about competing with a big belly ripping out of her costume, imagine how much more embarrassing it would be to her if she lost to another pregnant woman!\u201d Grace cackled. \u201cAw c\u2019mon dude, please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-that just doesn\u2019t seem like a g-good idea,\u201d Brandon said, looking around quickly in hopes no one was overhearing their conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can just reverse it afterwards, can\u2019t you? You did that to me, after all,\u201d Grace said, rolling up her shirt to show off her detailed abs on her noticeably not-pregnant midsection. At that, Brandon\u2019s face went totally pale and he gripped the cube containing his amulet. He could see all the women in line start to swell up as his heart raced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-there,\u201d Brandon said. \u201cAnd I think I can turn it all back after.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better,\u201d Grace said with a grumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Brandon asked, turning to see Grace holding a new pregnant belly, this one even larger than her last. \u201cOops.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops indeed,\u201d Grace said with a sigh.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Grace sat there as the first contestant walked up on stage. She remembered the first time she cosplayed. As she rubbed her swollen middle she thought how funny it was to dress up as Misty from Pokemon, in a sea of people cosplaying the  very same costume. She was friends with Becka back then, but as Galacti-con reached its second and third year, Becka got more enthralled with being the idolised cosplayer.  She was absent minded as the first cosplayer waddled off stage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo years ago Becka really started to hammer in the insults. There were five cons around Smallton and Charlesberg and whether it was the events dedicated to gaming, movies, anime or board games, Becka was there to put her down in some way. But Grace could never make a come back. Every time she saw the buxom beauty, grace was filled with nostalgic moments of how they would stay up late marathoning Sailor Moon with bowls of twinkies and m&amp;ms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot had changed since then, and she no longer needed Beckas approval, she had a thin body with long luscious legs\u2026 looking down she remembered she was reunited with a very large belly. 18 big ones kicked and shuffled around in there. But she could get those babies removed, she could enter the competition and STILL beat Becka! But that would be through cheating. So many cosplayers were up there that put time and effort into their costumes. She couldn't take victory from them because they were now pregnant. Even if she did win, would  winning fuelled her satisfaction or just her hatred for Becka?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHey, You alright?\u201d Brandon said turning to the gorgeous nurse/cosplayer.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, just thinking\u201d Grace grumbled back at Brandon, looking at the tesseract.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo why aren't you in the competition? I thought you would like to have met Ashlee and Hayley. \u201cBrandon said as he placed his shield down in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I was lucky enough to get the Supernova pass, which means I get to cut all lines, priority seating, which I would have taken if it weren't for this huge belly in my way, and I get to go to the actors dinner tonight too!\u201d She said with a squeal at the end. Her tone soured when she looked down to see her dominant belly, rubbing up against several other con goers.  \u201cHey, why don't you just take care of this back pain generating ball of flesh  now?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that's a good Ide- HEY, WATCH IT!\u201d Brandon said as an overweight man barged into him. The force caused Brandon to accidently drop his tesseract armoured amulet, which bounced off his shield and flew into the crowd. Panicking Brandon dived for it, but it was too late. A cute geek accidentally kicked it closer to the stage, her belly expanding from underneath her Star Wars themed t shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting his shield on his back and looking like a blue turtle he scurried for the bright blue box. He ended up right near the stage when he saw the amulet be picked up by a woman in a police outfit and red hair. As she stood up, her belly started to accelerate out massively. Arching her back up the Amy pond cosplayer was pregnant with quintuplets. \u201cOoohh, look at this marvellous prop\u201d she said, rubbing her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry miss pond, but this is one blue box you don't want to have.\u201d Brandon said as he snatched the amulet back. A security guard came up and placed his hand on Brandon's back. \u201cCan you come with me please?\u201d The guard quietly said in his mono tone voice. Brandon's face went pale as he was brought behind the stage as everyone else welcomed the next pregnant cosplayer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin sat impatiently in the limo as she watched the TV. Unfortunately for her, she had eaten all the complimentary snacks that was in the back. \u201cDani, I need an ETA!\u201d She shouted as she lowered the barrier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are getting there, but it looks like it'll take another two hours.\u201d Dani replied, looking out to the road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT? You said it'll be two hours ages ago!\u201d Erin shouted, frustrated with her situation. She slumped onto her back, tired with everything. Luckily for her, she adapted the robo spine to Sarah's battery blue prints, and she had a spare head massager in her car, hooking up the spine to the massager she managed to power both items with the one device. She fell asleep as she left the TV on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow we're up to round two of our presentation!\u201d Wendy said as everyone came back from the first break. Now, who here has problems when travelling around with such a massive belly?\u201d Wendy asked her audience. Several hands went up, including Marita. \u201cWell I have great news for you! We call it the Belly Ring!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim came out, wiping lipstick off her face and quickly adjusting herself as she walked out in a bikini wearing a tiny belly ring in her popped navel. \u201c now as you can see here with Kim's belly ring we have one of our Tiniest inventions. Our biomedical and engineering teams have come together to build a device that acts as a sonar device, helping pregnant women navigate without having their bellies bump into anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are you able to make such a device that small work?\u201d one reporter asked, fixated on the swaying belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the belly ring is implanted on the belly button. Due to the bellies reaction to the device it retracts into an innie. From here Ring can detect how close your belly is to objects through the subtlest of vibrations.\u201d Wendy said as she picked up one of the items from her podium. \u201c Kim here can't even feel her belly ring can you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, but I will admit It was a little incredible as my belly button got pierced\u201d Kim answered with a wink. The wink was lost on everyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow so?\u201d Marita asked trying understand her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim realised how vanilla the crowd was. \u201cWell, when the ring was attached, it's vibrations were so intense I cam-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on!\u201d Wendy blurted out, trying to stop Kim's sexual deviancy. \u201c I mean, why don't you come up here and we can test this on you. Surely a beautiful reporter like yourself can understand how important this can be to have\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarita threw down her microphone and climbed the stage. A couple of assistants helped Marita up and started to apply the belly ring. One of the lovely dressed assistants switched the item on as another applied rubbing cream to her almond skinned belly. \u201cNow you're going to feel a slight prick but afterwords you the vibration will be so incredible it will feel like the best sex you've ever had.\u201d Said the male assistant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh please, you professional types are always so cautious\u201d Marita said with a little laugh. \u201cNow attach this little gem to me!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assistant did what they were told and attached it to her belly button. The Belly Ring began to vibrate almost incredibly, sending vibrations down to the reporters clitorus. \u201cWhoa\u2026 Okay, that's\u2026 Ohhhhh\u201d Marita barely breathed out as she clutched her belly. Standing up she tried to remain professional but it was not working well. \u201cIIII-I-I am fine, I can understand, fuck\u2026. I can understand, oh God\u2026. What Kim was talking ab- excuse me one second.\u201d Her legs wobbled as She quickly moved behind stage and just dropped to the floor. She panted and panted as she came over the backstage floor, her legs now spasming as she quivered with delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy knew she would have to continue presenting or she would lose supporters. \u201cWhilst Marita collects herself, I'll present you with our next great invention! \u201c Wendy said as Ashley came up holding a curve shaped phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts hard keeping track of everything when you're pregnant. You have to know what to eat, what appointments to keep, where the nearest bathrooms are and all this silly stuff meaning you have no time for you.\u201d Wendy said as she carried on, making the life of someone who is pregnant sound daunting. \u201c But now with the malls new smart phone you can keep track of all this stuff and have more time for relaxation. This phone run by our own OS, and using our very best in battery technology (thank you Sarah\u2026) we are making this a Pregnant friendly world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audience erupted in applause as they saw the new device. Marita composed herself and waddled back on stage to cover the new invention. \u201cThis is truly astounding news. Move over apple and android, the new phones coming for two!\u201d She announced in front of the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy came over wearing a microphone and asked Marita \u201chow does the belly ringfeel?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I can't feel it, is it still there?\u201d Marita asked, trying to look over her huge bump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is, haha. Just come by the podium for a second.\u201d Wendy said as she guided e news reporter over. \u201cNow with our new phone, you can let it speak with your belly ring, change its vibration level or how close you have to be to something in order for it to vibrate.\u201d <br>\r\nMarita stopped a couple of inches from the podium as she felt a pleasant vibration come from her belly. \u201cOh you're right. And it's so subtle too!\u201d <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah was trying to keep her composure as she watched what unfolded. Her preg phone was being developed along side her \u201cbelly-bot\u201d. Not to matter she reclined back and tried to calm her envious state. She looked over to Janice and Katie and saw that they were staring at her like a couple of worried puppies. \u201cWhat are you looking at? Don't you have something better to do?\u201d Sarah barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSarah, you have to relax, it's okay for you to be jealous of them\u201d Janice said trying to be the voice of reason for once \u201cremember we wait until Frejyaton is under Preggomalls spell and BOOM!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah calmly stood up, waddled over to Janice, smiled her and pulled Janice up by her pony tail. \u201cDon't, EVER, call me jealous Janice. You don't know what true envy is. Now, you and Katie go find Catalina and DON\u2019T COME BACK UNTIL YOU HAVE HER.\u201d She let go of Janice who had a look of shock in her eyes. She grabbed Katie and they left.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah left the boardroom and entered her office. She looked at her past three years of work on the walls. Inventions she took so much time to construct. She rubbed her belly as she picked up her prototype of the \u201cbelly-bot\u201d or \u201cbelly ring\u201d as Preggomall called it. As she looked at the cute little design her eyes began to water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would be known as a knockoff for what she had invented. What the Preggomall was too much for her to handle. She yearned for a hug, if only she had Brandon to hold her\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon was guided behind stage where Princess Becka and several pregnant cosplayers were ready to take the stage.  It was dark and the \u2018tesseract\u2019 slipped between Brandon's fingers and fell to the ground. It slid across the floor and over to one of the pregnant contestants. As the pregnant Yoko Litner picked up the tesseract, her belly surged forward a little more. Becka saw the very pregnant cosplayer hand over the tesseract to Brandon before waddling on stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, whats that?\u201d Becka said as she bent over looking at the amulet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon was starting to get smug. He looked at the busty cosplayer and said \u201cit's a device that makes women pregnant\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cha, don't bull shit me.\u201d Becka retorted \u201cI know that's the Tesseract. I just want to know how you made it\u201d. Brandon had no idea what to say, Grace was the one who made it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I would tell the \u2018great Becka\u2019\u201d Brandon answered, trying his best not to pregnate Becka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Becka could come back she was called on stage. Grumbling she buried her anger deep down and put on her fake smile. Getting on stage she wowed the audience by giving them a little wave. She made it to the centre of the stage and gave her little umbrella a twirl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd here we have Princess Becka dressed up as Jane from Tarzan!\u201d The spokeswoman from Pop Culture announced to the crowd. Grace was excited, Yet restrained herself. The announcer continued, \u201cso, Becka, how did you make this lovely costume?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Jennifer, I- oohhh\u201d Becka started but was cut off. Peering from a slight viewing area Brandon focused on making Becka big! Becka was in shock as she watched her midsection inflate like a balloon filling with water. Her breasts followed in suite. Her already large breasts were now over flowing her bra whilst her expanding belly was starting to break the seams on her dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs everything okay Becka?\u201d Jennifer asked, as if nothing was wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god, you can't see what's going on?\u201d Becka almost squealed to the host of Pop Culture. She touched her triplet filled belly as it continued to expand. \u201cOh god it's huge\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes we know it's a huge crowd but for someone carrying ten babies, I'm sure your fans are supporting you every step of the way!\u201d Jennifer confidently reassured her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019M PREGNANT WITH TEN BABIES?!\u201d Becka screamed as her breasts burst through her top, jiggling in front of the amazed crowd. Becka tried to cover her growing breasts but they flopped over her arms. Her belly was continuing to grow  beneath her pillowy cleavage. She could feel her arse expand underneath her large dress. Slowly her expanding body ripped her costume to shreds until she was wearing nothing but tatters. Becka was horrified. \u201cI, I, it was captain America\u2026\u201d Was all that could escape her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh please, we all know Tarzan caused that belly\u201d a random man Called out in the crowd followed by laughter. Embarrassed and overwhelmed Becka was escorted off the stage by some security guards that put a blanket over her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are sorry about that, we understand that our pregnant cosplayers should be reasonable with their costumes when expecting, Becka will be alright don't you worry, once she is properly clothed she will be back for us to declare a winner!\u201d Jennifer said trying to throw what just happened under the table. \u201cBut now we have a special gift for all of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrendan walked around, thinking about what just happened. Sure he just stopped a bitch from being on the pedestal again. But at what cost. That's when a group of pin up girls in red white and blue outfits came up to him. \u201cAre you ready for this or do we have to go on without you?\u201d One of the sexy buxom dancers asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cwhat?\u201d Was all Brandon could ask.\". Oh one second\u201d Brandon said as he focused on making everyone pregnant. There was a sound like a a balloon blowing up to bursting point, and a few of the pin up girls let out a gentle \u201cOoohhh\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou gals still okay to do this?\u201d Brandon said as he readjusted his helmet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, this may be Captain America\u2019s song, but don't forget we are doing this for two of the best female actresses on tv.\u201d One woman proudly said  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey're in the same boat we're in, so don't sink this performance, okay?\u201d One red headed performer ordered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the stage hands grabbed Brandon as the pregnant pin ups went to their stations. \u201cYou ready?\u201d The stage hand asked Brandon<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess?\u201d Brandon answered\u2026 He'd seen captain America thousands of times, he should know \u2018Star Spangled Man\u2019 off by heart by now\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light for the stage switched off\u2026 All except some distinct ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trumpets and other instruments started to play. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women took the stage, ready to perform<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon was pushed on stage<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the spotlight shun on him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho's strong and brave, here to save the American way!\u201d The ladies sung<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot all of us can carry a gun or fight against the enemy\u201d  Brandon confidently quoted his second favourite hero. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho vows to fight like a man for what's right night and day?\u201d They continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon walked about doing his best manly impressions as he continued to quote Captain America.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWho will campaign door to door for America, Carry the flag shore to shore for America\u2026\u201d The women said as they danced in unison. \u201c From Hoboken to Spokane, The star spangled man with a plan!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women danced on in red, white and blue outfits as Brandon took a look around the stage. He could see Jennifer from Pop Culture standing there. With a simple thought Jennifer's belly started to expand. Her unbuttoned flannelette shirt drifted out ways as the bottom of her tank top rose, revealing a triplet laden belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the song went on, he couldn't help but make more women pregnant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy one<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStalwart and steady and true\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201csee how this guy can shoot, we tell ya, there\u2019s no substitute!\u201d the girls sang as they began the can can. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon saw his opportunity and increased the pregnancies of each of the busty sensational pin up models. Their outfits strained as their bellies blew up larger and larger. Time was being rewritten so quickly ant robospines appeared on their backs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree pregnant women got on top of a motorcycle and Brandon realised what had to be done. He saluted the audience and walked over knowing he would break his back. As he got behind the bike, he saw that the bike was strongly secured with tones of invisible wires. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTHE STAR SPANGLED MAN\u201d the women sang gracefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe motorcycle started to lift and brandon quickly grabbed underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWITH, A, PLAN!\u201d Everyone sang out loud. Brandon was amazed by what he had seen as he pretended to lift the motorcycle. He had stumbled into one of the best performances of his life! The audience erupted in applause. Words couldn't describe what Brandon was thinking when he walked up to Jennifer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was quite a show Cap, do you have anything you would like to say to the people?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I do\u2026\u201d Brandon said as he removed the helmet from his head. \u201cI'm afraid I'm not the person that was meant to be performing here tonight, but I will say this. Geeks are the way of the future!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people could not get enough of Brandon! He went in to give Jennifer a hug whilst the judges (mainly Ashlee Byron and Hayley Hewitt) looked on with glee. As he let go of Jennifer Brandon noticed his amulet and shield was missing! Where did it go?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the scuffle caused by the production of the Captain America recreation and the ensuing pregnancies that were created over the course of the cosplay contest, Brandon's small model Tesseract that contained his master amulet was lost in the fray, sliding and bouncing around throughout the vast backstage of the convention's main theater. It was kicked around with the help of numerous newly pregnant women who could no longer see their legs and feet to know what they were hitting and moving. All problems that could be avoided with the help of PreggoMall's belly-ring, of course, but that's neither here nor there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when the glowing box came to a stop, a very pregnant woman groaned and slowly bent down, clutching the sides of her belly as she worked her way down to inspect and clutch the small, strange object. As soon as she picked it up, she felt her belly expand and quiver with a new and unexpected flurry of kicking and movement inside her womb. The difference was, she was well aware of the change and did not have her perception of reality altered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this? It looks familiar...\" The woman said. And it makes sense that she found it familiar. The one who took Brandon's amulet in the prop was none other than Catalina Corazon. How was Catalina at the convention? To answer that, one has to go back in time a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, Catalina awoke in her nest of adoring pregnant fans, cooing and drinking in the celebrity worship. One hand caressed her enormous brown belly, colored with the lipstick of all the women gathered around her. She was literally off the ground with so many big-bellied women around her, all of who were still asleep, big smiles on their smeared lips as they held close to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy ladies,\" Catalina giggled, struggling to reach one foot down to the floor. With each movement, no matter how small, she could feel the hands and bellies of her adoring throngs against her warm skin. Catalina was totally naked, save for her amulet safely nestled between her colossal breasts. As she made her way to a closet and put on an unbuttoned shirt to give herself a bit of coverage, the dogpile of women began to stir awake, feeling Catalina's absence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Catalina!\" one of them squealed, stretching out as she watched her idol pace around. \"Come back! We miss you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate it but a star needs to burn brightly,\" Catalina chuckled, stroking her enormous round middle. \"And that means working.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I gave up my trip to this year's Galacti-con to hang out with you!\" another girl pouted, both hands mimicking Catalina's movements on her own belly. \"I even had front row tickets to the costume contest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina stopped, her ears perking up. \"Costume contest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, you know, cos-play. Men and women dress up as characters from pop culture. Most people just do it for fun but there's an award for whoever has the best too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina's amulet began to burn as her chest swelled with pride. \"That's the kind of thing I should be at. I'm a movie star, aren't I? Catalina Corazon defines pop culture and it would be wrong of me not to attend and show that I am the best. Otherwise, my fans will lose confidence and I do everything for my fans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls began to gyrate with excitement. \"That's a great idea!\" they all cried in unison. \"Can you get us exclusive passes too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too little time, ladies,\" Catalina snickered as she buttoned up the shirt as best she could, only getting her breasts sufficiently covered. And even then, without a bra, her dark nipples completely showed through. \"I'll have to stop by my home for a costume but I'll be able to get there shortly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Catalina opened the hotel door, she was stopped by another belly, though not one anywhere near as large as her own. \"Hello there, Catalina,\" Barbara cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another fan?\" Catalina sighed, looking around. \"Fine, where's a marker? I'll autograph your tummy, dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not here for that. I'm with PreggoMall and you're a valued client of ours, Ms. Corazon,\" Barbara said, putting her hands on the small of her back and pushing it out in an attempt to make her belly look larger than it actually was. \"We still have more service for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can hold onto that. My public needs me,\" Catalina said, attempting to waddle away when Barbara stopped her again. With her mud wrestling toning her body and her use of a functional robo-spine, Barbara sufficiently outclassed Catalina in strength. \"Seems there's a miscommunication.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somewhat. I'm afraid it's our boss's insistence that you wait here,\" Barbara said, smirking back at Catalina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, tell Erin that I don't have any real interactions with that Brandon boy. She can settle this with his sister, my boss,\" Catalina said, rolling her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erin's not the one pulling the strings anymore,\" Barbara replied, giving Catalina a shove with her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'll have to remember that, Catalina thought to herself. Sarah would reward me handsomely for that sort of information. \"Look...what's your name, beautiful?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara blushed as Catalina pet her cheek. She was married to an older and less attractive man with money so she hadn't been pampered by a good-looking man or woman for a while. \"B-Barbara.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barbara...why aren't you the one modeling for PreggoMall? You certainly have the looks for it,\" Catalina said, accentuating her lips as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just the way it is, I suppose,\" Barbara said, looking down at her belly. It was currently covered with a very tight pink sweater but Catalina's hand undid that quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that can't be. Look at that lovely belly skin,\" Catalina said, petting Barbara's maternal curves. \"Say...I'm still looking for a co-star in my next big picture. Interested?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-me?\" Barbara stammered. \"I mean...I don't know how to act.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pshh, ever see a Russ Meyer movie? You don't need to know how to act, gorgeous. All that matters is the look,\" Catalina said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you can't act?\" Barbara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina's smile vanished for a moment. \"I never said that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara gulped. \"I-I'd love to be in a movie. I've always wanted to be a big star.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you will be,\" Catalina said, patting Barbara's belly. \"But if I'm going to contact my agent...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Of course!\" Barbara said, waddling to the side so Catalina could leave. \"You're free to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you~\" Catalina said, blowing Barbara a kiss as she waddled away, letting her plump rear wiggle in Barbara's clear view as she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the present, Catalina continued to inspect the cube as her stomach swelled. As a security guard passed, she ignored her obvious pregnancy issues and waved him over. \"Excuse me, how do I enter into the contest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Contest is done, ma'am,\" he said, looking her over in surprise. \"Are you...you look familiar somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure I do,\" Catalina chuckled, striking a pose. She was wearing an unbuttoned khaki shirt lined with pockets and a wide dark brown skirt to be in character as her starring role as an adventuring archeologist in \"Fertile Treasures.\" \"I'm Catalina Corazon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. You look smaller in the movies,\" he said, making Catalina's cheeks burn some. \"And you dressed up as...yourself? That seems like cheating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll let the fans decide,\" Catalina scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the contest is over and they're about to pick a winner,\" he said as Catalina rolled her eyes again and pushed him out of the way. With stunned looks, the whole backstage crew watched as Catalina strutted out and made it to the main stage. The audience was frozen with shock as she picked up the nearest microphone. \"Look, do I win this dumb contest or not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire auditorium erupted with applause as Jennifer cautiously walked toward Catalina. \"I-I guess we have our winner,\" she said, looking at the other staff with a perplexed look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God damn it!\" Becka screamed, her voice rivaling that of the microphone's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, thank you,\" Catalina said, bowing. As she bowed, her amulet slipped out and touched Brandon's tesseract in her hands. The power of both were magnified and the already expanding bellies in the room doubled in size rapidly. Brandon, still confused as to what was going on, watched in dismay as Grace's belly reached levels he hadn't seen since his adoptive mother and sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" Brandon murmured to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you again!\" Catalina said, waving to the audience as she waddled away with a belly now approaching an excess of 60 babies. \"I should have done this years ago. It's so easy!\"</span></div></div>",

That's the whole problem!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie was an absolute Janice-worshipper, just like she was with essentially every pregnant woman, but even she was annoyed with Janice's constant state of extreme aggression and, more specifically, wrath. Janice had no issue with being furious at Katie as the two of them struggled to get through the hotel door at the same time, with bellies that were big enough to fit a few pregnant women inside. With a mix of a compromise on Katie's part and a burst of impatient energy from the muscular and powerful Janice, both stumbled forward and smoothed out their clothes as they waddled forward, trying to look unassuming as they did so. \"Fine, we're here,\" Janice growled, looking at her wrist-mounted phone for texts from Maritza that alerted them to Catalina's likely location at this hotel. \"Now where is our nosy lawyer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nosy? Since when?\" Maritza said, waddling over and stroking the exposed curves of her big brown belly, a playfully offended smile on her plump lips. Katie's irritated look vanished into a bright smile when she saw Maritza, one of the few pregnant women in the upper echelon of the PregTech company that she had yet to have sex with, which was something she desperately hoped would change. Maritza had it all: the full butt and thighs, the heaving breasts, the smooth, warm skin, the gorgeous face, the kind eyes, and of course, the big belly. As someone who was not an amulet carrier and a relative latecomer to PregTech, Maritza's swollen womb was nowhere near Katie or Janice's pregnant size, but something told Katie that was not going to be the case for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense, you're a wonderful, bright young woman,\" Katie smiled, putting one arm around Maritza's shoulders and pulling her in closely so their bellies touched. From this angle, Katie also got a look down Maritza's canyon-like cleavage from under her shirt, which made her heart flutter, which in turn made her fetuses begin to kick inside her belly. \"Now then, did our brilliant company lawyer find what room the prodigal actress is staying in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked around and, after pressuring the hotel staff with a lawsuit for not having a pregnancy-friendly facility, I have the exact room number. And a key to boot,\" Maritza said with a grin, reaching into her cleavage and pulling out a plastic key card. The action of removing it almost made Katie faint but she kept the courage to stay upright and patted the bottom of her belly to keep herself stimulated enough to stay conscious. \"Follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gladly,\" Katie purred, walking behind Maritza with her eyes on her swinging butt. Janice swatted Katie on the forearm and glared at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you be a little more subtle about wanting to fuck our lawyer?\" Janice sneered quietly at Katie. \"Especially when I'm right in front of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you already had sex with another guy while I was in the apartment. Remember, Brandon? Squirrely little nerd, brother of goddess-on-Earth Sarah Page?\" Katie said, stroking her belly with glee. \"I was under the impression we had an 'open relationship.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have no relationship, it's just...gauche is all,\" Janice fumed. \"And you can't blame me for having sex with Brandon. He has this...magnetism about him that makes my belly tingle. You must feel it too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie shrugged. \"Eh, he's not the most handsome guy but sure, if I was into men, I could see myself giving him a belly ride.\" She leaned back to Janice to whisper more quietly as Maritza stopped at one of the hotel doors and fiddled with the keycard, struggling with her belly in the way. \"But what I'm getting from you is that Maritza and I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want her? You can have her. Go wild,\" Janice said, rolling her eyes and stroking her belly as Maritza finally got the door open. \"Finally. I can't wait to give Catalina a piece of my mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fitness instructor burst into the room, only to stop and look around shocked. Katie followed her in and froze, gripping Janice's forearm. \"Oh my god, Janice...it's heaven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside was the pile of pregnant fans that Catalina had left, all still naked and gyrating against one another sleepily. \"Hiya~\" one of the cooed, looking up at Katie. \"Wow, you've got such a big belly! Can I feel it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely,\" Katie said in a dreamy voice, waddling over before Janice grabbed her wrist. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We aren't here for that,\" Janice growled as Maritza stepped forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're looking for Catalina Corazon,\" Maritza explained. At the mention of her name, the girls all squealed and began to rub against one another more. \"You've...heard of her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're her biggest fans!\" another girl purred, laughing as two other women kissed her on the nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm the biggest, actually,\" Katie said, patting her belly as she assessed her own pregnant size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was she here?\" Maritza asked, still prying for answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was but she had to leave,\" they all said with a pout. \"Said she was going to Galacti-con to win the costume contest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Figures. Wherever there's a chance to win and appeal to a big crowd of merchandise-obsessed geeks, you'll find Catalina,\" Janice sighed, rubbing her belly. \"Well this was a waste of time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnnnnot quite,\" Katie said, stepping closer to the soft pile of pregnancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus Katie, I thought I said to quit it!\" Janice barked but Katie held up one hand to silence her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You,\" Katie said, pointing at Barbara in the midst of the pile. \"You're on the PreggoMall board of directors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I am,\" she said, removing one pregnant girl who seemed to be trying to suck Barbara's cheek right off her face. \"You're all from PregTech, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure are. What...what are you doing here?\" Katie said, placing her hands on her rounded hips and drinking in Barbara's beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Catalina promised me a role in her movies if I let her go without alerting my boss,\" Barbara grinned. Janice, Maritza, and Katie all laughed and looked at one another. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She uses that excuse all the time around the office,\" Maritza said with a chuckle. \"'Maritza, if you clean out the break room's dishwasher, I'll give you a role in my next movie! Maritza, if you throw away this trash for me, I'll let you meet The Rock!'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a bunch of nonsense,\" Janice snickered. \"We're all too clever to fall for it but you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara's face was red and coursing with bulging veins. \"That...big bellied...fat...overly pregnant...cow! How dare she fool me like that! Oh, I am going to get her so badly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, easy,\" Katie said, waddling over to stroke Barbara's belly and getting a multitude of kisses on her own round tummy from the fangirls. \"Sarah will be sure to punish her for skipping out on the company for the day so we've got you covered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess we'd better head back to the office too. No point driving all the way to some convention for Catalina,\" Maritza sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Maritza and Janice waddled out, a hand grabbed Katie and stopped her from leaving. \"Hey...how about you stay and spend a little time with us?\" one of the fangirls purred. \"We'd love to hear what it's like to work with the real Catalina~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie sighed and turned back to watch Maritza waddle out. \"Sorry girls, maybe some other time. But for now...I have another task ahead of me.\"</span></div></div>",

I thought we were making driverless versions, just like Pregtech\u201d Erin said, a little disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were until we noticed how much of this \u2018pregnant energy\u2019 can be transmitted to fuel.\u201dWendy started. \u201cThen we remembered how you wanted this \u2018pregnant feminist movement\u2019 so we realised that being able to drive has its own type of power to it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay that sounds fair\u201d Erin said, convinced by her soon to be backstabbers persuasions. \u201cYou are sure we tested it?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it turns out that the car can only be driven by pregnant women, one of our henchmen, Bill tested it out today and it crashed on the freeway. Don't worry he isn't injured, the friend he was with was though.\u201d Wendy stated, trying for it to not sound all bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJesus, did it have any of Preggomalls logos?\u201d Erin asked not worried about the mans life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, but chances are it may be why you're in traffic right now.\u201d Wendy answered \u201csee the car hooks up to the belly ring and from there it can help the driver detect any traffic or chances of collisions.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh right, we'll make sure to mention that men can't drive it, otherwise we may have a lawsuit on our hands\u201d Erin said before saying goodbye and hanging up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy went on and gave a thrilling presentation about the new car. Everyone loved it, they were just begging for more at this point.  With five fantastic inventions shown it was time for the grand finale. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, I can't give you all these fantastic inventions without leaving you wanting more.\u201dWendy politely said to her audience \u201c Now I present to you a place to store your new car, our final item for today, we present to you Preggomalls Home-suite!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hologram of a house came up with a series of purple cords throughout it. \u201cNow you can charge your home appliances, have the perfect security and you will no longer have a care in the world for any chores with your new home plan!\u201d Wendy said as she rotated the house around, and englargened it for everyone to see. \u201cWhat was scifi a decade ago is now only a purchase away, the Home-Suite is a cleverly inbuilt system that will make anyone feel safe and comfortable at home, with as much freedom as possible.\u201d Wendy announced to the drooling public. \u201c Our systems detect a hostile person, man or woman in each house and will emit a high pitch noise that will incapacitate the Subject if they don't leave imediately. It will also render any of their Preggomall items ineffective until it they leave.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy went on and on and when she was finished people were thrusting cash towards her. \u201cUh, uh, uh\u2026\u201d She delightfully turned back. \u201cWhilst you all were here we had all of today's items brought in for you to purchase and have in your home by the end of the day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople ran out the door like a stampede. The room was empty in seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo we have enough?\u201d Kim asked Wendy, worried that they would run out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKim my sweet, we have enough for half off he country\u2026\u201d Wendy said with a grand smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace struggled to get out of her chair as her belly laid firmly on the ground. Her giant orb of flesh took up a good four feet in circumference in front of her. Trying to push up with her legs all she ended up doing was falling forward and rolling on top of her belly. She tried to bring her mini skirt back over her now large arse as she sighed in defeat. \u201cWell it's not like things can get any worse\u201d Grace said sarcastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen, we now present to you a two hour marathon of My Little Pony, in this hall.\u201d The announcer called out. \u201cWould all the bronies please file in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!\u201d Grace screamed as she wailed her legs. Desperately she pushed her belly along the smooth concrete floor. After a minute of trying she managed to gain momentum. The neck beards and the fedoras were swarming the hall as she tried her best to leave. She wished she hadn't have given Joel her robospine\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood afternoon m\u2019lady\u201d one particular Brony said, as he tipped his fedora. \u201cCan I get a picture?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, no, wait, I said no!\u201d Grace shouted as the guy took the photo. \u201cFuck off!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, bitch\u2026\u201d The guy said as he walked over to sit down. Grace was furious, when she gets her hands on Brandon, he would have a lot to pay for. Looking around she saw Becka sobbing off stage. If she saw grace in this state, all hell would break loose! That's when she saw a couple of familiar faces. Grant! It was Joel's friend from the hospital. \u201cGRANT!\u201d Grace called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant and Mara were walking through the shops when Grant heard his name call out. Turning to the hall he saw a great ball of flesh with a Grace attached. \u201cOh great.\u201d Grant said under his breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it honey?\u201d Mara asked, as she adjusted her cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh nothing, I just saw someone I know.\u201d Grant grudgingly said. \u201cLet's go see her\u201d he dragged her over, trying not to show off his displeasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh who, OH GOD\u2026 Grace?\u201d Mara asked as she saw the immensely pregnant woman before her. \u201cTony didn't do this to you, did he?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, you two know each other?\u201d Grant asked confused with the situation. \u201cWhose tony?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrace and I used to play DnD together with Tony\u201d Mara started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, we stopped hanging out after I broke up with Him\u201d Grace added. \u201cCan you guys help me with this?\u201d Pointing to her belly, she groaned as she felt a baby kick\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, we'll help. Right Grant?\u201d Mara said looking at her handsome \u2018iron man\u2019 boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoohh, alright\u2026\u201d Grant resigned to answering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn three the three costumed heroes lifted the massive belly and took her away from prying eyes. \u201cThanks guys. Can you go get Brandon for me? He has my bag and I am craving some food right now\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Grant and Mara searched around for Brandon, Ashlee and Hayley were walking over to an incredibly pregnant Catalina. \u201c Catalina, what a pleasant surprise. Who knew you would come in and steal the show, like you always do.\u201d Ashlee said as she rubbed her significantly smaller belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you know me, I can't help it if I do that\u2026\u201d Catalina said with a pleasant smile. \u201cI understand you two B-grade celebrities have such a hard time drawing in the crowds\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's okay, don't worry Ashlee, our \u2018superior actor\u2019  here will obviously have her hands full when she gives birth.\u201d Hayley said as she pressed her petite belly against Catalinas gargantuan one. \u201cDoesn't matter anyway, Catalina obviously understands the rules behind being a celebrity at a con\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRules?\u201d Catalina asked as her ears perked up. She was Queen Catalina, she didn't need to obey rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes.\u201d Ashlee said as four Galacti-con security guards came up to her. \u201cAs a celebrity at a con, you must sign and get a photo with every last one of your trusting fans! Let's just make sure the belly doesn't take up the entire shot.\u201d She said as she slapped Catalinas jeep sized belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina was shocked, no one should mistreat her belly like that!  Breathing in she said\u201cOh is that so huh? Well I'm sure you wouldn't be all high and mighty if you were as pregnant a- \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before Catalina could finish, Ashlee Byron and Hayley Hewitts bellies surged out at an phenomenal rate, a few metres away Brandon could hear what sounded like rubber stretching. He walked towards the noise saw his two favourite celebrities bellies expand out tremendously.  Ashlee had to take a few steps back her belly was rubbing up against Hayley's and Catalinas. 57, 58, 59\u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me start that again.\u201d Catalina said as she cleared her throat. \u201cWe may be the same size, but that doesn't mean we are on equal grounds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm afraid you are\u201d Hayley said with a smirk. \u201cNow, sweetie, let's get you prepped. There's three hours left of today's session of the con and I'm certain you won't be here tomorrow. So let's make sure EVERYONE gets photos and signatures from you!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBu-bu-but\u201d Catalina  started<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut nothing!\u201d Ashlee said dominantly \u201coh and boys remember, don't believe what she says about giving you a role in her up and coming film\u2026 It's just her pathetic way of getting people to do what she wants.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you\u2019ll pay for that\u201d Catalina called out as she was lead to her table to sign autographs.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That was it, It was all over. Sarah stood up, turned off her Tv and walked outside. She had shouted, got mad, ordered and cried. She was still envious of that blasted Preggomall and she knew she was steps away from victory, but she knew the only way she could achieve that victory was by biding her time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back through her life she had remembered every moment she lost out on an opportunity because of someone richer than her. Her father Tanner helped her study day in, day out for a chance to be on the robo olympics, only to lose from some rich kid from Charlesberg who had bought a more expensive processing system. In high school She found out that James, the quarterback on the schools NFL team broke it off with her to be with Vivian Qwong, the bitchy Asian girl whose father ran the fourth highest accounting firm in Northern America.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, she sat with her many inventions stolen from underneath her. She spent so much time building up these concepts, testing the inventions and buying patents, but Preggomall swooped in and took the lot! But if there was one thing she knew, it was that she was clever! The problem was that she had sent off everyone that could help her, so now she has no one to help her with the final stage of her plan. She needed to go around the edge of Freyjaton and place antennas that would transmit the deactivation command. She needed to find someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went back in to see the Pregtech crew hard at work. Unfortunately a lot of the women there were off at collective ultrasounds. She realised that the men there did not appreciate the pregnant form, but Sarah would soon change that. Unbuttoning the top of her blouse she accentuated her valley of alluring cleavage. She let down her hair and rolled up her skirt, giving a new definition to the term \u2018mini skirt\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men working there weren't too happy with Sarah. She had no work ethic to anyone that wasn't a woman and to add onto that they just found out this morning that they hadn't been paid for the time they've worked. One muscular worker by the name of Tony had been putting some research into the matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Tony\u201d Sarah breathily said to the well built worker. Biting her lip slightly she continued \u201cI need, a favour\u2026 If you can by any chance help me put up these pillars in my car, I promise I can make it worth your while\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo can do missy.\u201d Tony said, leaning against the first aid box. \u201c you my friend haven\u2019t payed us in ages so we have no reason to be working.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Sarah shockingly asked,  her whimsical, sexual self behind. \u201cThat can't be, we have one of the richest men alive funding us.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh really?\u201d Tony asked with a sly grin on his face. \u201cHow about we go to your office and find out for ourselves..\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony and Sarah walked into her office and they both looked up the status of Pregtech\u2019s funds. A unintelligible sound of fear came from Sarah as she saw The number that appeared on screen. What was originally in the seven digit figures had plummeted to less than ten thousand dollars. Her company would be bankrupt by sunrise tomorrow. She needed to act fast. Grabbing Tony and the antennas they both ran down to the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon stood there as he watched 3 astronomically pregnant women head their separate ways. He already had the entr\u00e9e, but now Brandon wanted the main and dessert of pregnant celebrities. Lining up he looked at how far the queue was until he would get a photo with the two sensually sexy celebs. It wasn't looking too good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before he knew it, he got a tap on the shoulder. It was Mara! \u201cBrandon\u2026 You\u2026 Oh god\u2026 You need to\u2026 Ugh\u2026 Go see\u2026 Grace\u2026\u201d Mara panted in her Black Widow costume. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrap\u201d Brandon said, looking as another twenty people started lining up behind him. \u201cCan you keep my spot as I wait?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, just let Grant know where I am. \u201c Mara said as she took his spot in line.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finding out where Grace was, Brandon ran over to her location. The first thing Brandon could see as he made his way over, was her perfectly toned legs. History had rewritten so that he legs were much more juicy now, but they still retained definition. Up next was he now huge derri\u00e8re. It bounced a little with every movement that Graces legs made. As the crowds started to thin he could make out her huge pale belly that she was resting on and lastly her now furious face which had seen Brandon coming a mile away. That's what happens when you wear a bright blue costume. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Grace meniacally growled to the hero of our story. \u201cChange me back right now!\u201d She ordered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, I'm sorry\u2026\u201d Brandon said, quickly transferring the chaotic energy back to his amulet. His tesseract started to give over a reddish glow, but he thought nothing of it. Graces belly continued to shrink, she got up as the belly became more manageable. It shrunk and shrunk until her belly was flat again and her well worked out six pack abs came back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you\u201d Grace said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m still quite annoyed at you, but all I want right now is to hold Joel. Let's exchange numbers just in case this happens again.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they exchanged numbers Brandon headed back to the line. On the way over he noticed his tesseract was feeling a little different. He opened up the box and saw that the amulets gems were glowing bright red and it had started humming. If Brandon had read the manual he would have realised the amulet could hold up to five pregnancies, 40 was way too many for such a fragile magic device to handle. Brandon played it off as nothing and continued walked back to Mara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecka tried her best to keep her now very tight zero Suit Samus Costume together. Thank Christ she went with the two piece, work out suit rather than the one piece high heel outfit. A brief breeze brushed up against her exposed belly, causing her to shudder. Trying to manage a quintuplet sized belly was one thing but her outfit was straining her breasts. Her cleavage was over flowing and her butt felt like two watermelons trying to hide in a thong. She was having the worst wedgie! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she waddled through the con, trying her best to pose for photos, she tried to pin point how she became pregnant. She remembered there wasn't many pregnant people at the convention. There was that captain America cosplayer who said something about pregnant devices, he was a bit weird\u2026 He was also hanging out with Grace, maybe one of them could undo what happened to her belly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRey? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With her skin-tight blue costume barely holding together thanks to the recent mass pregnancy transfer, Becka waddled toward Brandon fuming. She was waddling but determined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou!\u201d She began to say, pointing a gloved finger at the young man now holding an amulet with different, unnerving colors. Becka stopped once she actually lay eyes on him. Now that she was pregnant, the master amulet changed more about Becka than just her maternal state and she didn\u2019t realize how attractive Brandon seemed to her. Her jaw began to relax as she gazed at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d Brandon said, his voice choking a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head and got back on track. \u201cYou did this somehow, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Her non-judging finger patted her belly, which only made Brandon\u2019s blush grow. \u201cI saw you talking with Super-Preggo and things kept getting weird.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Brandon said, looking around for one of his friends to help him find a way out of this confrontation. Mara and Grant were out testing video games or standing in line for over-priced autographs. Joel and Grace were hitting it off too well for Brandon\u2019s fellow pregnancy fetishist to get distracted over Becka. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t play dumb. I did my research. Grace is from that pregnancy town and you are too. Something really weird is going on,\u201d Becka said, her belly pressing against Brandon and shoving him back a few steps. \u201cNow spill it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrandon, there you are,\u201d Catalina\u2019s booming voice said as she waddled over, pushing both Brandon and Becka away with her absolutely colossal belly. Brandon marveled over her silently, now getting a better look at the 60-baby-carrying actress. Her outfit was essentially tatters now, and not just around where her stomach and hips needed room. A few days ago, Catalina\u2019s belly was the size her breasts were now so there was no scrap of fabric untorn by her latest transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC-Catalina, hey,\u201d Brandon said, his mind immediately turning to their past sexual encounters and wondering if she would take him up on another round. He also began to think of his other recent pregnant trysts and how they would go if the women in his life were as big as Catalina. Ashley, Sarah, Janice, and of course, Erin. Brandon felt himself get light-headed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI finally got a break from signing autographs. I swear, no one here knows how to treat a celebrity. Or a pregnant woman, for that matter! Everyone keeps bumping into my belly,\u201d Catalina fumed, putting her hands on her wide hips and looking over the convention floor. \u201cI was actually relieved to see you. You know how to be polite around a big-bellied woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes he now?\u201d Becka said, raising an eyebrow and turning back to Brandon. He continued to turn red, but not out of arousal. Too many people knew about the amulet and its powers already and if Becka let the cat out of the back, what would happen? Would the reality changing undo itself? What kind of chaos would that unleash? He could feel his amulet pulsing as the questions crossed his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait\u2026I know you\u2026\u201d Catalina said, pointing at Becka as she stroked her belly. \u201cYou\u2019re that cosplay star, aren\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecka\u2019s ears perked up. If anyone rivaled Catalina in their love for fan attention, it was Princess Becka. \u201cWhy yes, I am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou never played any of my characters,\u201d Catalina said with a low growl, prodding one finger into Becka\u2019s big belly. \u201cWhat, stuck playing women who were never even pregnant?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No, you don\u2019t understand, this just happ-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill\u2026this may be a perfect opportunity,\u201d Catalina said, her plump caramel lips turning into a smile. \u201cIf I give you access to my real costumes, you could start a real trend. Move over Star Wars and comic books, Catalina Corazon will be the new go-to for conventions and Halloween!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Becka, this sounded like a chance to increase the attention she got, maybe even a potential paid gig. \u201cLet\u2019s talk, Ms. Corazon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina put her arm around Becka\u2019s shoulder and turned her around, getting ready to waddle away. \u201cWait, before I forget.\u201d She reached between her swollen breasts and handed Brandon a card. \u201cI won an invitation to dinner with these two nobody actresses. Take this off my hands, will you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith trembling hands, Brandon took the card and read it over. A private dinner with Hayley Hewitt. And Ashlee Byron. Both of who were now as pregnant as Catalina thanks to the mix-up with the amulets. He looked over his shoulder to see if he could find his friends, then checked the card again. \u201cOnly room for one guest\u2026sorry guys, looks like you\u2019ll have to spend your night without me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, outside the convention center, Erin\u2019s limousine had just parked. Due to the massive foot traffic, they had to be dozens of rows back, which meant a lot of walking for Erin. She still had her robo-spine but it would be a trek even if she wasn\u2019t pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was a hell of a drive,\u201d Dana groaned, stepping out of the car to stretch out, her belly jutting out far and pushing her shirt up and her pants down, though she didn\u2019t seem to pay it any mind. \u201cSorry, guess your chauffer shouldn\u2019t complain like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo worries, you\u2019re right,\u201d Erin said, wiping barbecue sauce from her lips. \u201cYou didn\u2019t complain when I kept asking you to pull over for food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, if I had a belly like yours, I bet I\u2019d be hungry too\u2026ma\u2019am,\u201d Dana said, looking at Erin\u2019s much larger pregnant stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin chuckled and looked toward the main building where the event was taking place. \u201cAny plans for the rest of the day, Dana?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I think I\u2019ll just find us a hotel and relax, maybe waddle around town,\u201d Dana said, stroking her fingers around the device attached to her navel. \u201cThis makes that a lot easier after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave fun,\u201d Erin nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll contact you if I need anything.\u201d Dana got back in the car as Erin began her walk toward the convention. As she walked, passersby noted her Agent Carter costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat red dress is wrong. It's not period-accurate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, okay,\u201d Erin said, nodding at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd her pregnancy isn\u2019t canon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, whatever,\u201d Erin sighed, rolling her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd your neckline s-shouldn't be so low,\u201d one noted with a nervous gulp. \u201cYou know, to be comic-accurate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy neckline is just fine,\u201d Erin said, glaring back at them. \u201cNow leave me alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRich girls,\u201d they said with a scoff, shaking their heads and going on their way. Erin groaned again and refocused her efforts on the convention hall before thinking about Brandon and checking how much of her cleavage was being revealed. She was more than satisfied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Erin was getting closer, Sarah was letting out a relieved sigh as she and Tony planted the final antennae in the outskirts of Freyjaton. Both were covered in sweat, though Sarah was much more worn. \u201cWhat are you so tired about? I did all the heavy lifting,\u201d Tony snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, this belly isn\u2019t full of hot air. It\u2019s heavy,\u201d Sarah panted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not full of hot air,\u201d Tony grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing. So about my payment-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnce this is done, people will be flocking to PregTech and our profits will more than make up for the lost investment,\u201d Sarah said, tapping on one of her remote controls. She still wasn\u2019t sure why Dr. Schultz\u2019s funds vanished but she was sure it had something to do with PreggoMall. It wasn\u2019t the time to worry about such things. Her moment of triumph was at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not reassuring. I need payment. Real payment,\u201d Tony said. \u201cOr else\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah stopped and looked over at him. \u201cOr else what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClearly you have some way to remotely fuck with PreggoMall\u2019s products. A quick phone call and they may be able to stave the tide, so to speak,\u201d Tony said with a growing smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood point,\u201d Sarah said, rolling her eyes and reaching into her bag for her personalized tablet. With a few taps, she showed Tony the screen. \u201cThere, I transferred half of my shares in the company to you. That enough collateral?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould be,\u201d Tony cackled. \u201cNice doing business with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHappy to. And you\u2019ll need it to support your new family,\u201d Sarah said, reaching for another remote control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFamily? I\u2019m a happy bachelor, Ms. Page,\u201d Tony said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you still will be,\u201d Sarah said, pointing a new device at Tony. \u201cI suppose now is as good a time to test this as any.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTest what?\u201d Tony said just before Sarah powered it up. A beam of yellow light hit Tony and he cried out in surprise. His outfit contorted, with certain parts becoming too roomy and certain others becoming far too tight. Tony\u2019s musculature shrank as his chest and belly grew and grew. In just seconds, one of Sarah\u2019s few male employees was now a very, very pregnant woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust as I feared. It\u2019s a little too effective and not practical,\u201d Sarah sighed. \u201cOh well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do to me?\u201d the woman outside the car squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I already had your company file changed to \u2018Tonya.\u2019 I know you\u2019ve been planning on selling me out to PreggoMall and obviously I wouldn\u2019t let you get away with it,\u201d Sarah said. \u201cAny more complaints?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no ma\u2019am,\u201d Tonya said with a quick nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, now then,\u201d Sarah said, grabbing a third remote control. \u201cTime to turn PreggoMall\u2019s lights off.\u201d And with that, she started up her antennas and hit the switch.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah hit the switch and watched as the newly propped-up antennae whirred to life. A tiny light at the tip began to glow red, working in conjunction with the other needles planted around the city. One hand gladly stroked her hugely swollen belly as Sarah grinned, turning to her personalized tablet and bringing up the virus she'd created for just this occasion. \"You should be thanking me,\" Sarah said to her dysfunctional employee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanking you?\" Tonya chirped, still getting used to not only being a woman but also hugely pregnant. Sarah's initial plan was to create new customers out of the city's male population or possibly rehabilitate those who were unable to function in a pregnant matriarchy, but as she admitted, it was a little too effective and Tonya was pregnant with 35 babies, edging on Sarah's own size. It may be good for business for Freyjaton to have as many pregnant women as possible but it probably wasn't a good idea to have so many be that big right off the bat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, thanking me for not changing you earlier. If you'd been disloyal and pregnant before, you would likely be using PreggoMall devices and then you would be in for quite the surprise right about now,\" Sarah said, uploading her virus. The final Domino was now tipped: she'd waited for Erin's financial empire to start using her specially designed microchip and now that half the town was buying PreggoMall products, her virus would react with those chips and shut them all down...now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight on cue, as Ashley and Kim walked through the private management suite in the mall, they felt something going wrong. For one, they could not waddle nearly as easily as before. Both women were already too large for the robo-spines to completely eliminate the mobility difficulties they faced but this was much different. Ashley let out a long sigh and steadied herself against the wall, cradling her belly from below. \"You okay?\" Kim said, gingerly reaching out to the belly of her erstwhile lover. As she reached, Kim's belly ring felt the proximity of Ashley's enormous pregnant middle and buzzed to let Kim know. \"W-whoa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Ashley asked, grunting as she turned her wide hips, keeping herself upright by pressing her firm, enlarged ass against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-nothing, it's just a lot s-stronger than I remember during the exhibition,\" Kim said, running both hands down her belly, looking down at her colossal stomach as she brought her hands as close to her navel as she could. The buzzing was only getting faster and it was so loud even Ashley could hear it. \"A-and it's getting stronger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim cried out in ecstasy as the ring continued to stimulate her, which made Ashley's face heat up. The lust amulet between her plump breasts burned hotter and hotter as Sarah's mother thought about pouncing the woman who, days ago, had ruined her family life by sleeping with her husband. \"C-can I do anything to help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, get it off!\" Kim panted, her hands pawing at her flimsy bikini top from the exhibition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley gulped. \"I-I don't want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me either,\" Kim whined as the two dove into each other's arms, falling to the ground and rolling around like rabbits in heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown the hall, in the main suite, things were just as bad. Women's robo-spines failed as they stumbled around, their bellies knocking over furniture and a few even collapsing into couches. Louisa's attempt at giving herself a relaxing head massage was now a nightmare as the helmets PreggoMall sold malfunctioned and was threatening to rip every hair on her head out by its roots, with several other book club women trying to help her as she screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmidst it all, Wendy sat in the center, a look of fury even Janice couldn't match on her face. She had attempted to call Rebecca multiple times for whatever help she could offer, but of course, the new PreggoMall phones had stopped working too. For someone only a handful of weeks along in her pregnancy, Wendy didn't have many PreggoMall devices but the fact that her one product failed her only made Wendy angrier with the irony of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wendy?\" Marita panted, her belly ring similarly acting up as she waddled toward the acting head of the company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Ms. Greene,\" Wendy hissed, a blood-shot eye turning slowly to Marita.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Ms. Greene,\" Marita said, her free hand gripping her shirt until her knuckles turned white as she held a recorder for reporting purposes. \"H-how do you e-explain the recent...oh god that's a strong one...hiccups being reported with PreggoMall inventions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a...temporary bug,\" Wendy said, looking around the room. All her PR women were currently either unable to walk or in the throes of sexual bliss. \"No further comments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Further. Comments.\" Wendy barked, finally getting up from her chair and storming out of the room. \"If you have any questions, you should ask Erin Parker. She's in charge, after all, and it's her responsibility.\" When she shut the door behind her, Marita finally fell to the ground, removing her shirt and running into the arms of the nearest big-bellied beauties, which in this case were the Polish and Indian models employed by the mall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'll finish the story soon,\" Marita told herself as she allowed the two women to kiss her breasts and belly. \"E-Erin Parker Responsible For PreggoMall Launch Failure. U-until then, I don't know what's going on but I need about five or six more women over here pronto!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware of all of this, Erin finally made it to the convention center, hands proudly on her hips as she beamed to the woman at the ticket counter. \"Hello there. One ticket for entry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The convention's wrapped up for the day, dear,\" the woman said with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I guess you don't recognize me outside of my city,\" Erin said with a chuckle. \"I'm the CEO of a, let's say, swelling business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird way of putting it,\" the woman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird but accurate and I'm very wealthy so I think I can make this worth your while,\" Erin said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't help you, Ms. Rockefeller,\" the ticket holder said, rolling her eyes. \"We're all sold-out anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sold out, huh...\" Erin pouted, stroking her amulet absent-mindedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, now if you don't mind, I'd like to close down and head home,\" the woman said, standing up to reveal her octuplet belly. \"It takes me a while to get around, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph,\" Erin said, looking around. \"Well...fine then. Thanks for your help. And you might want to try buying a pregnancy robe-spine to help with the waddling. PreggoMall, look into it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll look into it,\" the woman said as Erin left. \"What did she say again? Preg...something. I'll just google robo-spine Preg and see what comes up. There can't be more than one, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin waddled around on her own, arms crossed as she fumed. She couldn't go inside to find Brandon and she wasn't even sure if she wanted to see him yet or not. Erin tried to call Dana a few times but for some reason her phone wasn't working. And worst of all, Erin's robo-spine seemed to have worn out because she was not walking as easily as she used to. Finally, as she struggled down the road, looking for a store to get a phone from, a taxi cab pulled up beside her. \"Are you okay, miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine. I'm just...a little lost is all,\" Erin said with a light grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cab driver sighed and opened the back door. \"Here, I can't stand to see an expectant woman struggle. Get in, I can take you wherever you need to go nearby, no charge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not necessary,\" Erin said, before feeling a strong kick that shifted her weight into her lower back. \"Actually, sure, thanks.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure where to go, Erin had the cab driver look for the best hotel in the city. She could afford it now that she ran PreggoMall and she wanted to be comfortable. Surely they had a working phone so she could contact Dana or at least someone else at the mall for help tracking her down. Erin had her window down and looked around the city. It was quaint and orderly, just like Smallton used to be before...well, you know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Erin's nose caught a strong whiff and her gluttonous amulet perked up. \"Stop here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here?\" the cab driver said. \"You sure?\" It was a large country club with lights and guards up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got the attire for it, don't I?\" Erin said, gesturing to her red dress. \"Stop here.\" She reached into her purse and got out some \"emergency money\" courtesy of PreggoMall. \"Here, keep the change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, thanks lady,\" the cab driver said in shock, driving away as Erin waddled inside. It was full of men and women in tuxes and dresses, but more importantly, there was a huge buffet. Erin took no time digging in, her amulet pulsing strongly. Eventually, as all eyes were on her, a guard went over and stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oo am I?\" Erin said with a full mouth. \"I'm here...I'm part of the...this. I'm part of the thing that this is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh,\" the guard said, crossing his arms. \"The charity gala?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, exactly,\" Erin said with a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scoffed. \"Something tells me you aren't a PGA-level golfer, ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin's eyes opened wide and a large smile spread across her face. \"This is a charity golf game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I thought, you have no idea what this is,\" the guard said, grabbing Erin's arm. \"Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, I'm here for the golf game alright,\" Erin said with a smile. \"Tell you what: if I win, I can stay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you win? You know how many champs are here?\" the guard said with a chuckle. \"You've got a deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" Erin said. \"Point me to the green. And bring a few plates of this filet, will you? There's a great lemon butter they must have used on it.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Erin grabbed a club, a club sandwich and exchanged her high heels for a golfing shoes. Taking off her dress and wig she stored them in a locker. She thought about reducing her pregnancy when she realised she never actually looked at her new figure before, not at this size at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin used to have a real problem with trying to like her figure. When Erin was 17 she was in a relationship with this stupid hulking Quarterback that was all ego and didn\u2019t understand the word no. She was so concerned about her body image, it was hell.  That went from when they finished high school all the way to Brandon's 21st. 4 years of hell, trying to be skinny, trying to fit in and just not being happy. Well she wasn't always unhappy, Brandon was always there for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her clothes off she waddled to the mirrored section of the locker room. Her breasts, belly and butt rubbed up against the sides of the door frame as she squeezed by. She threw her sports clothes onto a bench and looked at the wall sized mirror. Erin couldn't believe the size she had become, her midsection was large with 40 babies crammed into what was once a toned, slender belly. Her breasts were gargantuan, her once E cup breasts were so juicy and plump now, with a dash of perkiness to them. As she turned around she noticed how her previously  bulbous butt was now other worldly. Her huge arse bounced with every movement, she was impressed and a little turned on by how great it felt to smack it. Her once thigh gap had disappeared. She had the thickest thighs without a trace of imperfection, they were smooth and perfect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to get closer to check out her face but her belly and breasts prevented that. She noticed a subtle double chin had formed from her over eating. \u201cDamn, if it weren't for the double chin I would say I'm finally happy with how I look.\u201d Erin said as she moved about. \u201c if only I could play naked!\u201d She giggled as she got changed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe afternoon sun was beating down on Erin walked down to the caddy shack. Using her newfound confidence she persuaded one of the teens to be her caddy. \u201cYou there, come carry these clubs for me.\u201d Erin said persuasively to the long greasy black hair teenager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh okay, but ummm, shouldn't pregnant women not be playing any sports or something?\u201d Said the Caddy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin rolled her eyes at the stupendous remark. \u201cLook, what's your name?\u201d Erin asked with a tone of annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's Steve, and what's your name?\u201d The Caddy answered as he put some chewing gum in his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErin Parker, as in the Erin Parker who owns Preggomall in Freyjaton, as in the same Erin Parker whose father works with the other high class citizens in Freyjaton and the same Erin Parker who won Freyjatons golf tournament just last week, so I think I will be fine\u2026\u201d Erin answered manipulatively. <br>\r\n\u201cAh, okay let's get this done\u201d Steve said as he easily picked up the heavy golf bag and they walked over to a golf buggy. The first few holes were alright, Erin scored a series of Birdies a Par and came really close to an Eagle. Her score was looking really good, but she was coming 13th, she was up against high ranking professionals and this was an up hill battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As Erin reached the 9th hole her mind started to wane again. As she brought her golf club back for the swing, Erin remembered how a year ago she was playing putt putt with Brandon on a warm evening by the local swimming pool. She remembered out hard Brandon was trying to get the ball past the chomping crocodiles and was about to give up. That\u2019s when Erin got Brandon to relax, she snuck up behind Brandon, placed her hands where his were on the golf club and after a gentle count of three they tapped ball neatly between the closing jaws of the fake lizards and it plopped in the hole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin shake her head, the heat was getting to her. Steve came over with a bottle of water for her to drink. Erin downed it in seconds and was ready to swing again. Her mind became focused, well centred\u2026 Her breathing slowed and her weight lay in her legs. Everything came down to her, the club and the ball. Erin brought her club back\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHACK!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white ball shot off into the distance. Over sand traps it curved as the wind blew in from the east. It landed on the green but it hadn't finished moving. It slowly rolled closer and closer to the flag until\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA hole in one!\u201d Erin squealed out in joy. She was so proud of herself! If only Brandon saw her now\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie, Maritza and Janice Parked in Pregtech's driveway when Maritza got a call from Sarah. \u201cSarah, how good to hear from you, here let me put you on speaker.\u201d Maritza said as she does with her phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, okay girls, it's time! As my plan entails I will need Janice to take care of that chubby Asian pregnant woman that can break a mans spine in half\u201d Sarah started. \u201c up next I need Maritza and Katie take the truck and  go to the Preggomall with our products, Tonya and I will be meet you there to help \u2018deactivate\u2019 the virus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhose Tonya?\u201d Janice asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cSorry, Remember the sleazy muscle bound guy that works for us? I used Project Lazarus on him\u201d Sarah said biting her bottom lip. \u201c Once people start ditching the knockoff products I need you guys to set up the stands, the first one that sells our products and the second that reveals that Preggomall has been stealing our designs.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe finally made project Lazarus?\u201d Katie said astonished \u201cheh, could you imagine what Brandon would look like as a juicy, plump pregnant woman?\u201d Katie started drooling, her greed getting the better of her. Since Brandon was the sole owner of the master amulet, he was seen as a sexual God to all straight pregnant women, but just the thought of Brandon as a pregnant woman sent Katie and her greed amulet insane. Realising  her present company and composed herself. \u201cI, um, let's get started!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice got in the company car whilst Katie and Maritza got in the company truck, both of which were fitted to their ever expanding sizes. As Janice got word from Sarah about Rebecca's whereabouts, Katie and Maritza headed to the Preggomall. The trip was quiet, minus from the noises outside. Women all around were starting to get raw from the sheer amount of orgasming that had been going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Maritza\u2026\u201d Katie playfully said looking at the lawyer as she drove the heavy vehicle. \u201cWe would be the youngest people to work for Sarah, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight\u2026\u201d Maritza said as she turned down Main Street. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd in this business savvy world, we have to deal with loneliness and when it's time to relax, there's no one to turn too.\u201d Katie continued, watching as Maritzas bountiful breasts bounce as the truck drove over a pot hole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's your point?\u201d Maritza asked, her interest risen, but her attention diverted(driving does that to you)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm just saying you should loosen up, we can go out for drinks now at we don't have to worry about giving birth, and maybe we can do something after the drinks\u2026\u201d Katie added seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKatie, I know how you work and it's not going to happen\u201d Maritza said assertively as the Preggomall appeared in the distance. \u201c besides I've never even kissed a woman\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you like to?\u201d Katie asked, leaning in, exposing a large valley of cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, it's always sex with you\u2026\u201d Maritza said as she park the car in front of two large fleshy orbs. \u201cBut if we make it out of here alive, I'll let you buy me that drink.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I am sure a woman as intimidating as yourself can do that\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, you can count on me\u201d Janice said as she pulled up outside of Rebecca\u2019s place<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the way, how is someone so vengeful a yoga teacher?\u201d Sarah grinned, poking the blonde bear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up.\u201d Janice said as she hung up. Walking up to the door, she had no clue what she would say, it wouldn't be until she knocked on the door that Janice would know what to say. A sloth like Rebecca waddled slowly towards the door, clutching her large belly. She was the smallest of all the female amulet holders, but her recent weight gain had changed that. She was far from the assassin she used to be. At least for now\u2026 The door knocked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney are you okay?\u201d Rebecca's lover asked, getting changed from a day filled with love making. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm fine, you just stay there my yoga champion\u2026\u201d Rebecca said, rubbing her double chin. She opened the door to see a confident Janice, with her belly inches away from her own. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh yes, I was hired by the Preggomall to help you get back into shape, I am Jackie, your yoga instructor\u201d Janice said to the exhausted Rebecca. \u201cMind if I grab my belongings?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUuhhh, sure\u201d Rebecca said, \u201cjust bring them in.\u201d She waddled back into the front room thinking how familiar her face looked. Trying to remember where she saw that blonde haired woman, Rebecca decided to head over to her desk. At her work station was a a bunch of files on her targets from Pregtech, but what was the most interesting was a letter and a bunch of photos that she had found in a red envelope, from one Wendy Greene. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDear Rebecca, what you're about to read is highly classified and should not be talked about with anyone. The piece of jewellery is not what you think it is\u2026\u201d Rebecca said as she trailed off. Janice walked in to see  Rebecca reading, with pictures of the Pregtech crew in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c Okay, let's get started!\u201d Janice said trying to distract Rebecca, but it wasn't working. \u201cUm excuse me\u201d Janice asked, slowly creeping towards the assassin. Little did she know what she was getting herself into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Frank\u201d Rebecca called out. \u201cIs it alright if you head out for a while, I have a yoga class right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, I thought I was your yoga man!\u201d Frank called out from the bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, if you come back at 8 I will explain it all to you!\u201d Rebecca almost yelled out, whilst her eyes remained focused on the letter at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll, um, I'll just get changed\u201d Janice said, taking her bag into the open bathroom, closing the door behind her. Frank came out, kissed Rebecca and headed out as Janice tried to put her old yoga outfit on. After ten minutes she finally made it out, in a bright pink tank top that barely contained her bountiful cleavage and couldn't hide any of her belly. Her yoga pants on the other hand were starting to tear  due to her tremendous thighs and her glorious behind could not be completely contained, with her arse jiggling at every step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked out, Janice noticed her \u201cstudent was nowhere to be seen, and the letter she had read was on the ground. As she continued to set up her yoga equipment, she could hear the front and back doors locking. Janice's heart started to race as Rebecca returned to the front room, in her own yoga outfit. Tell me where did you get that amulet, Janice?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, don't remember- hold on!\u201d Janice said realising her mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I know who you are, next time, don't use a stupid name like Jackie!\u201d Rebecca said as she started to pace towards the Pregtech employee. \u201cNow I am sure you know who I am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, no\u201d Janice nervously said, \u201cand what's this mask?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh this thing?\u201d Rebecca asked as she placed the thing on. \u201cI'm sure you know Erin Parker. She used this on Sarah a couple of days ago, now I am going to do something similar to you. Rebecca pressed a button on the mask, and a beam hit Janice's head, making her forget everything about Pregtech. This time however instead of taking Janice\u2019s belly, Rebecca gave hers to the poor yoga instructor. Janice grew to a total of 50 babies in her belly. As The poor yoga instructor rolled onto her huge stomach, her amulet fell out of her now massive cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the amulet on the ground Rebecca grabbed it and attached it to her necklace, Rebecca was overcome with a fury about how everyone kept her back, Pregtech, that idiot Antonio Greene and the pricks at the Preggomall\u2026 She was also frustrated with the fact that Wendy only told her now that she was holding the sloth amulet. Maybe it was time she was given a taste of laziness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon was chilling in the games section of the convention. 4 o clock had just come around so there was an hour left of the con, and with the celebrity dinner at 7 Brandon would have plenty of time to hang around before being escorted to one of Charlesbergs finest restaurants. He just finished playing a match of Super Smash Brothers when a petite girl dressed up in Samus\u2019s workout outfit came strolling by. \u201cImpressive button mashing\u201d said the cosplayer. \u201cMind if I have the next round?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure\u201d Brandon said, not seeing the blonde wigged beauty sit down next to her. The first few matches were evenly scored. Brandon won a couple and the other cosplayer won one. \u201cSo, why is your tesseract red? Everyone knows that cube was blue in the movies\u201d the cute gal asked as Brandon looked down to see that his amulet was behaving oddly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't worry about that, try worrying about winning a match!\u201d Brandon answered with a big laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOhh, is that so? Well then  let's make things interesting, care to  make a wager?\u201d The Samus lookalike asked cunningly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, well firstly whoa\u2026\u201d Was all Brandon could say as he saw the short cosplayer in a revealing outfit. \u201cI, uuhh okay. Firstly what's your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJaccara\u201d the cosplayer answered politely<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Jaccara, if I win, I get your phone number.\u201d Brandon said as he grabbed his tesseract. In seconds Jaccaras suit was starting to strain as Jaccara became heavily pregnant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooooohhhhhhh\u201d Jaccara let out, as her hips widened making room for a large belly. A juicy amount of cleavage formed as her top started to tear. Her once petite and bouncy booty had grown to the extent that would make Kim Kardashian jealous<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she was pregnant with 8 large overdue babies. With that came a massive amount of sexual tension between the two cosplayers. \u201cOkay, then, but if I went, you get to take me behind the Galacti-con stage and go down on me for a good fifteen minutes!\u201d Jaccara said as she rubbed her newly expanded middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon agreed, but was slightly worried. He had never pleasured a woman using his tongue before. He looked down and saw the sexy feisty woman that was sitting next to her, her huge belly out in the open, a straining blue crop top that barely contained two pale yet I enticing breasts that were overflowing their tight compartment. For someone so small her thighs were spilling over the seat, barely containing a box that yearned to be explored. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI win.\u201d Jaccara said as she put down the controller<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, what?\u201d Brandon asked confused by what just transpired<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou, my captain weren't paying attention\u2026\u201d Jaccara said with a big grin. \u201cAnd now you're going to pay the price for trying to beat a professional gamer\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The area had just had its final show for the day so there was no one in the vicinity. Jaccara looked into Brandon's eyes as he started to go down on her. Realising this she brought the guys face back up. \u201cHey hold on a second solider, you have to put some romance into it\u2026\u201d Jaccara said with a little bit of a chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealising his mistake he got back up and laughed a little before starting to make out with her. At first they were gentle, light fully tracing each others body. Brandon could feel Jaccara smile as his fingers brushed up against her sensitive breasts. Their making out started to become more ferocious as Jaccara grabbed the back of Brandon's head. Brandon took the Samus wig off, revealing wavy Mousey blonde hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaccara shook her hair free as she pushed Brandon against the wall. Grabbing a shoulder she brought him down so she could ferociously make out with him. Brandon was amazed as Jackie\u2019s tongue danced around with his. \u201cMmmmm\u201d she moaned as Brandon opened up her bra, freeing her well endowed breasts. He slowly moved down her curvaceous body, lightly biting at her delicate, pierced nipples. The cosplayer screamed in delight as Brandon played with her massive breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving down he playfully kissed Jaccara\u2019s pale, sexual belly. Her hands traced around the large expanse that was her midsection. He had to sit down in order to get to her short shorts. As his fingers dug into the blue fabric, he could see a damp area in the centre, he knew she hadn't had this in a long, long time. Jackie angled her pelvis upwards, as Brandon Brought both the shorts and panties down. He traced the moist area around her vagina, as the sexy naked pregnant woman before her bit her lip, trying her best to savour the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon took a moment, then brought him self back up. A confused look formed on Jaccara\u2019s face, she was about to ask what was going on when Brandon's fingers started to penetrate her sensitive opening. \u201cOoooooOOHHHHhhh fuck!\u201d Jaccara breathed out, panting as sweat formed on her face. Her hands clutched Brandon's back as she forced herself on him. She crammed her tongue into Brandon's mouth as his fingers did the same for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cfuck me\u2026\u201d She cried out, her panting increasing by the second. With one last kiss she shoved Brandon back down on his ass so he could go down on her. At first he hesitated, but then went for it. Jaccara screamed in delight as Brandon's tongue rubbed up against her clit. Her legs buckled and she fell to the floor, her bodacious booty providing plenty of cushioning. Her fingers scratched the carpet and her back arched as Brandon sped up. \u201cDon't stop, don't\u2026 freaking\u2026 Stop......\u201d Jaccara panted as she clutched her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want you in me!\u201d Jaccara screamed a little bit too loudly. \u201cOooooooOoooOOOOOOHHHH\u201d she orgasmed for the first time, and Brandon sat back as he saw his latest creation. The once humble delicate ice skater known as Jaccara was now heavily pregnant, naked and quivering on a very wet carpet. Her legs were shaking and there was a look of ecstasy in her face, but she barely breathed out \u201cmore\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon nearly ripped the rest of his costume off as he got ready to penetrate the curvaceously petite madam. He started off slowly, noticing that she was almost raw at this point. Jaccara's panting started to give pace as Brandon started thrust into her harder and harder. Her panting turned into sharp gasps as Brandon continued to shove his member inside of her. \u201cJesus\u2026\u201d Jaccara barely made out, as tears of joy formed on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir movements became one, as they secretly screwed in the emptiness of the backstage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaster and faster their bodies grinder up against each other\u2026. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon looked in Jaccara\u2019s hazel eyes\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she looked into  his\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor one long moment\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf pure bliss...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I-I'm, cu\u2026mming...\u201d She whispered as she finally lost whatever was left of her self control. Her nipples erect, legs quivering and a face of pure ecstasy, Jaccara was spent, the last bit of life was sucked out of her. She lay there heavily breathing, trying to get some energy after the past marathon of love making. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon was shocked, first his amulet is glowing like some kind of nuclear waste, now she was able to give unbelievably incredible sexual experiences to random people? She went to check on the person he nearly destroyed orgasmically when he turned around to see<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He turned around to face Becka, both hands on her new, colossal pregnant belly as she looked down at Brandon and Jaccara hunched on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d Becka murmured, her eyes wide with surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-Becka, h-hi,\u201d Brandon said, doing up his pants as quickly as he could. \u201cWhat are you, um, doing over here? Anything I can do for you?\u201d The two were far from friends and Brandon couldn\u2019t think of how to get her away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWere you seriously having sex in the convention center?\u201d Becka said, her tone turning sour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what? Me? Are you nuts?\u201d Brandon said with a phony laugh. \u201cT-this girl just stumbled and I was trying to help her up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith your pants down.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon opened his mouth but couldn\u2019t think up a response quickly enough. A moan from Jaccara distracted Brandon and Becka\u2019s gazes down to the pregnant cosplayer lying on the floor. \u201cMmm, I\u2019ve still got tingles, Cap. You were something else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon turned back to Becka, who narrowed her eyes at him. \u201cHey, you,\u201d Becka snapped, still focused on Brandon. \u201cGet up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaccara slowly got to her feet, one arm cradling her massive belly, before she saw Becka and let out a loud gasp of her own. \u201cOhmigod, Princess Becka? I am such a fan. You inspired me to try cosplaying!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah yeah, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re an admirer. You could have sprung for a better costume,\u201d Becka said with a scoff before looking down at Brandon\u2019s glowing cube. \u201cSo you really can control women\u2019s pregnancies, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you, that\u2019s crazy,\u201d Brandon said, shaking his head. Still, a nervous chill fell over him as he looked at his amulet\u2019s strange color. Was something changing with his pregnancy transferring amulet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo this girl just decided to leave the home dressed like a video game character when she was swollen like a hippo?\u201d Becka sneered, gesturing to Jaccara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re one to talk,\u201d Jaccara chuckled back, her octuplet belly still not as large as Becka\u2019s large, round stomach. \u201cAnd yes, I did leave the house like this. I\u2019ve been pregnant for\u2026for\u2026\u201d Jaccara paused and looked at Brandon. \u201cWait\u2026I don\u2019t remember being pregnant before today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I think it\u2019s time for you to go,\u201d Brandon said quickly, putting his hand on Jaccara\u2019s back and ushering her away. \u201cD-do you want my number?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t bother,\u201d Jaccara said. \u201cThere\u2019s something fishy going on with you\u2026even if you are great at pleasuring pregnant women.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecka blushed as Jaccara waddled away. As part of the amulet\u2019s effects, she had found something about Brandon suspiciously charming since she gained the belly. And now that she\u2019d heard and seen that he was good with pregnant women\u2026her curiosity was perked even more. \u201cSo, I have hard evidence now,\u201d Becka said when Jaccara had gone. \u201cYou really can control women\u2019s pregnancies somehow. And\u2026you even like having sex with pregnant women.\u201d Brandon\u2019s blush continued to flair up. \u201cSo then why\u2019d you take away dumb Grace\u2019s belly? She may have no style but I can see how someone\u2019d find her attractive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon sighed, not seeing any way around the issue now. \u201cGrace is a good friend and she wanted the pregnancy out of her way. Plus, she and another friend of mine may be going out and I wanted to give them both a chance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmph,\u201d Becka said, putting her hands on her widened hips and pouting. \u201cYou\u2019re all so boring. \u2018I did it for my friend,\u2019 \u2018I wanted to be nice,\u2019 blah blah blah.\u201d She stepped closer, shoving Brandon a little with her pregnancy. \u201cSo then why\u2019d you give me a belly, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon gulped. \u201cSometimes it happens by accident,\u201d he lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecka nodded and started to rub her belly against him. \u201cSo if you can take away Grace\u2019s pregnancy\u2026can you make mine bigger?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he was really getting flustered. \u201cB-bigger?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, maybe I\u2019m starting to get the hang of it,\u201d Becka purred, finding the tip of his new erection with the underside of her large belly. \u201cI\u2019d like to see what it\u2019s like to be the biggest pregnant woman in the building. I\u2019ve got a long way to go to catch up to that diva Catalina, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon hesitated. He knew the more pregnant she got, the more she would want to sleep with him and, as a champion cosplayer, she was very good looking. Brandon\u2019s hands started to grip his tesseract before-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Brandon said, stepping away and maneuvering around Becka\u2019s enormous swollen middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo?\u201d Becka pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Brandon repeated with a nod. \u201cAfter all you did and said to Grace\u2026you don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d He turned around and hurried away before he changed his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecka stomped the ground with her foot, chewing on her bottom lip. Now she was stuck with an octuplet pregnancy and no one to satisfy this new craving inside her. Guess I\u2019ll have to find someone else who likes to sleep with pregnant women, Becka thought to herself. But where can I find someone like that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer train of thought was derailed as Catalina swung her arm around Becka\u2019s shoulder and gripped her tightly. \u201cHey! Don\u2019t keep running off on me. It\u2019s hard enough to move around with a belly this size, even with the robo-spine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRobo\u2026spine?\u201d Becka said, always intimidated by Catalina\u2019s huge belly size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLong story. Anyway, let\u2019s talk about planning your next convention and which of my characters you\u2019ll cosplay as,\u201d Catalina said, stroking her enormous curves. With each step, her hips swung and her rear and belly smacked against Becka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-sure,\u201d Becka said. \u201cBut how about we talk over dinner? It\u2019s getting late, anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDinner,\u201d Catalina said, stroking her belly in thought. \u201cSure. There\u2019s a country club nearby that should have plenty of wealthy admirers. I may not even have to pay if we go there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good,\u201d Becka said, putting one arm under her sore belly. Anything to sit down and not be smothered by this enormous woman\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, after scurrying around, Brandon met up with Joel, Grace, Grant, and Mara on the main floor of the convention. \u201cThere you are,\u201d Grant said with a sigh. \u201cWe really got split up, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Brandon said, breathing heavily. \u201cW-was it all fun for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, we had a great time,\u201d Mara said, she and Grant giggling. \u201cCan\u2019t wait to come back tomorrow. But for now, I am tired and I am hungry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDinner then?\u201d Joel said. \u201cWe can take our costumes off, shower, and then eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Brandon could chime in, a convention employee jogged over, just as out of breath as Brandon. \u201cThank god\u2026I finally found you\u2026\u201d he said, bending over. \u201cThis year\u2019s convention is such a chaotic mess\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026can I help you?\u201d Brandon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were given the ticket to the celebrity dinner tonight, yeah?\u201d the employee said. Brandon reached into his pocket to see the ticket Catalina had won after gifting it to him. \u201cPerfect, let\u2019s go. Ms. Hewitt and Ms. Byron have been waiting long enough already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon\u2019s face turned bright red. Both women were preposterously pregnant thanks to a run in between Brandon and Catalina\u2019s amulets and they were already his favorite actresses when it came to\u2026personal fantasies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan my friends come?\u201d Brandon said with a shaking voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, just one person,\u201d the employee said. \u201cYou should have talked this over earlier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon gulped and told his friends sorry before following the convention employee to a date with two sexy pregnant women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess the rest of us are just going to get dinner on our own?\u201d Joel said with a shrug before his phone rang. \u201cSorry, one sec\u2026hello?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Joel,\u201d Janice\u2019s voice said on the other end. Joel immediately froze. She\u2019d been extremely angry lately and always left him trembling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-hi Janice,\u201d Joel said. Grace\u2019s eyebrows rose as she turned to him. \u201cW-what\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve just been thinking,\u201d Janice said with a sniffle. She\u2019d been crying. \u201cAbout how I\u2019m carrying your babies inside my belly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen, Janice-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll 40 of \u2018em,\u201d Janice said. Joel froze in place, not remembering the number being that high. \u201cBut we have been through our ups and downs and with PregTech\u2026I can be my own woman and I can be independent. I\u2019m just calling you to let you know that I have no intention of giving birth to these babies anytime soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel paused. \u201cI\u2026don\u2019t understand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut as far as I\u2019m concerned, you gave up your rights to be their father when you started hitting on Sarah\u2019s whale of a mother while I was gestating these babies,\u201d Janice said. \u201cGoodbye Joel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood\u2026bye?\u201d Joel said as the receiver clicked off. He looked at his phone, confused. None of her usual wrath was present in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAn old friend of yours?\u201d Grace grumbled, still glaring at Joel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026sorta?\u201d Joel said as Grace turned her back and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrant, Mara, can I drive with you two?\u201d Grace said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe took the same car,\u201d Mara said as she hurried after Grace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant followed suit, flashing a quick look at Joel. \u201cNice going, dude.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what\u2019s going on?\u201d Joel mumbled to himself. How was Janice\u2019s wrath gone? And where did it go?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rebecca\u2019s foot stomped into a puddle in the PreggoMall parking lot, Janice's wrath amulet wrapped around her neck. Before all of the pregnancy incidents, Rebecca had been a more than formidable agent in Antonio\u2019s organization. But with the sloth amulet, her abilities had been restricted but when she actually did her job, it went off perfectly. Now she had Janice\u2019s wrath amulet and she was no longer Antonio\u2019s effective spy and commando. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she was dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca stormed into the mall, pushing past writhing pregnant women still dealing with the malfunctioning PreggoMall devices and the ensuing furor of fear and hormones. As she bumped into their bumps, her new amulet made up for the fetuses she'd transferred to Janice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca didn't totally steal anyone's pregnancies, but with the explosion of magic and technology in the town as of late, most women were carrying quadruplets at the least. As they slimmed down by a few inches each, Rebecca's belly swelled, its golden smooth bulge pushing out past her shirt. By the time Rebecca made it to the main lobby, she was pregnant with 30 babies and each addition to her womb only made her anger grow and grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey there,\" the muscular pregnant spa owner wheezed, one hand clutching her big belly as the other gripped the door frame to her business. Her belly ring was buzzing like crazy and putting her mind on one thing and one thing only. \u201cYou\u2019re Rebecca, aren\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca sneered, remembering how careless she was with the other employees in the mall while she had her sloth amulet. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said you might want a private massage some time,\u201d the woman said with a sultry laugh, waddling forward and touching her belly against Rebecca\u2019s. The wrath amulet glowed and Rebecca\u2019s belly surged forward again. \u201cWhat do you say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca looked the woman over a few times. Like Rebecca, this woman had clearly trained her body but she got to have a life of frolic and luxury while Rebecca was dedicated to silent duty. That enraged her and she grabbed the woman by the strap of her tank top, making her breasts fall out naked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll call you when I need a massage, not the other way around,\u201d Rebecca growled. \u201cAnd you\u2019d better bring some better looking friends when I do. Understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spa owner squeaked a reply and nodded quickly as Rebecca released her. A bemused chuckle left Rebecca\u2019s lips as she turned around, stroking her belly as she headed for the main office. With all the fallout from the PreggoMall technology crashing, conquering this place would be even easier than Rebecca had expected. Maybe she wouldn\u2019t just have to get revenge. Maybe she could make some money off of this as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the CEO\u2019s office, Wendy was sitting in a large chair, originally built for Erin\u2019s specific pregnant weight, but she was taking charge now. Hurriedly, Wendy was tapping away at her private computer, hooked up to a separate system from the rest of the mall. The news of the disaster was already spreading and she was doing her best to do damage control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it,\u201d Wendy hissed as she kept learning of the full extent of the damage to the company. \u201cI\u2019m losing millions every second. All my good employees are pregnant and useless. And where the hell is Rebecca?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou called?\u201d Rebecca said as the doors to Wendy\u2019s office broke down and skidded across the floor. Rebecca had a ferocious grin across her face as she waddled in, her arms outstretched and flexing. \u201cOh, we certainly have some things to discuss, Wendy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRebecca,\u201d Wendy said, standing up and straightening her skirt. \u201cGlad to see you were not affected by our\u2026malfunction. It seems someone has hit us with a cyberattack of sorts and I have one good guess as to whom the culprit is. Start-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Wendy could continue, Rebecca had smashed both fists down on her desk, breaking the legs and making the whole structure crash to the floor. Her belly pushed against Wendy\u2019s, forcing the diminutive woman against the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get to call the shots anymore,\u201d Rebecca sneered. \u201cOr Antonio. Where is he, anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAway. Far away. And there is no need for him to come back,\u201d Wendy said. \u201cI will take charge of his legacy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen you will take the blame,\u201d Rebecca said, lifting her fists again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not the one you should be angry with,\u201d Wendy said, holding out her hand and stopping Rebecca in her tracks. \u201cI am here to correct the path of PreggoMall. The one who led us astray was our last CEO\u2026Erin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Erin wasn\u2019t the one who kept me chained up with the amulet,\u201d Rebecca said, lifting the sloth amulet into the air, dangling it in front of Wendy. \u201cI know all about these now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy gulped. Her letter to Rebecca had backfired. \u201cYes, it was a mistake to suppress you like that but the amulets needed to be with those we could trust. And I trust you, Rebecca. No woman is more competent.\u201d She placed one hand on Rebecca\u2019s. \u201cNo woman is better suited to lead this company.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Rebecca growled, angry at the thought that Wendy was trying to manipulate her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean this company will need strong leaders for our true purpose to come into fruition,\u201d Wendy said. \u201cA world of pregnant women, with us as the financial queens. Imagine it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca looked into Wendy\u2019s eyes. Her training could not detect any deceit coming from her. \u201cThen maybe you should take this amulet,\u201d Rebecca said with a sneer, pushing the sloth amulet forward. \u201cJoin me with a big belly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Wendy barked. It was so loud and fierce that Rebecca stepped a few feet back. Wendy placed her hand against her flat stomach. \u201cI will only carry Antonio\u2019s child inside me. No chaotic magic or PregTech super science will interfere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAntonio\u2019s child\u2026\u201d Rebecca murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd once she is born, I will train her to take charge of this company in my place,\u201d Wendy said, looking at her midsection. \u201cAnd I will let no one stop us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo one, huh?\u201d Rebecca said, looking down at the display from the PreggoMall security cameras. It showed Sarah, Katie, Martiza, and Tonya headed toward the mall in the parking lot. \u201cI think I see a few who want to try.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rebecca turned around to leave, Wendy stopped her. \u201cWait, let them think they can shut us down. They don\u2019t know about my secret weapon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSecret weapon?\u201d Rebecca said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA device to transfer pregnancy into energy,\u201d Wendy said with a smile. \u201cIn the basement. I\u2019ll show you\u2026later. First, let them get their attack in. Then surprise them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca grunted. \u201cYou had better let me go on the attack soon. I can\u2019t contain all this rage for long and I may just lash out at you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPatience,\u201d Wendy cooed, stroking Rebecca\u2019s bare belly. \u201cYou will get to go on a rampage, I promise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca gave Wendy a sickening smile before leaving the office. Wendy chuckled and walked to her crumbling desk and hit the intercom. \u201cAshley? Please come to my office. I feel we need to discuss\u2026your daughter.\u201d Wendy got a moaning affirmative reply and walked around the office, cackling to herself before touching one hand to her stomach again. \u201cWith our technology, I could make you grow to full term in an instant, couldn\u2019t I? But no, I want to savor this. Feel you gestate inside me. After all, once PreggoMall is back up and running, you will be the last natural pregnancy in the world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack downstairs in the mall, Sarah was hiding in one of the least trafficked parts of PreggoMall: the shoe store. Now that women couldn\u2019t see their feet, there wasn\u2019t much interest in what shoes they wore. Sarah had her laptop hooked into the mall\u2019s network and was preparing to hit them with one last strike before PregTech stepped in and reaped its massive reward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Katie, Tonya, and Martiza were making their way to the sea of bellies to convince the women to start buying from PregTech instead. \u201cIt\u2019s like heaven,\u201d Katie said with wide eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, because they\u2019re new customers or new bellies?\u201d Maritza chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoth,\u201d Katie giggled, turning to Tonya. She may have been a burly man a few hours ago but Sarah\u2019s invention had turned her into quite the appealing pregnant woman. \u201cSo Tonya\u2026how do you like being pregnant?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026weird,\u201d Tonya whimpered, cautiously touching her own belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell listen, if you ever need any help or want someone to talk to,\u201d Katie said, placing one hand on Tonya\u2019s belly. \u201cI\u2019m always here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you wanted to go out with me,\u201d Maritza whispered to Katie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Katie whispered back. \u201cJust a little friendly advice. Besides, we\u2019re getting that drink tonight. I\u2019m sure of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaritza chuckled as her blush grew. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho does Rebecca find and confront?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ashley\u2019s legs were weak as she waddled slowly into Wendy\u2019s office. Eventually she made it into the room and landed belly first onto the broken down doors. Ashley once again looked over the office, filled with artefacts and painting all depicting pregnancy. From modern art to early aztecan models, the room was swimming with fertile curves. \u201cHi Wendy, how are you?\u201d Ashley barely made out trying withhold her orgasmic pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy on the other hand knew it was going to be a struggle for Her model to annunciate with the devices attached to her. \u201cRebecca!\u201d Ashley said clicking her fingers and pointing at the tanned beauty. Rebecca gave a pretty loud growl as she waddled over and detached all the products from today's expo. Rebecca really had a hard time getting to obey Wendy now that she had the wrath amulet. She had to keep her place though, so she placed Ashley in one of the \u2018chairs\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy dear Ashley, look how nice and big you've become! 40 babies and you still haven't given birth yet, you must be a fantastic role model for all middle aged mothers out there!\u201d Wendy said with a convincing smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was quite proud of how far she had come. Taking a deep breath she said\u201cYeah, it's good to finally feel good about myself, after Tanner left me I didn't think anyone would want me again\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes of course, hell I fired 98 percent of my male workforce because of their piggish ways.\u201d Wendy said remembering Bill, her lab assistant that built gadgets using a gem from Catalinas amulet. That same gem was now the centrepiece of her necklace, stopping chaotic energy from changing her. \u201cYou see, there's a price for being so popular\u2026\u201d She continued as she flipped a switch on her desk. Ashley's arms and legs became strapped to the confines of the steel chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAH! What are you doing to me!\u201d Ashley squealed, trying to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see your daughter has cause all this mess, and now I need to fix the cards so that they play once more, in my favour\u2026\u201d Wendy menacingly said topped off with a cackle. \u201cREBECCA, GO GET- Rebecca?\u201d Wendy turned around to see the elevator in front of her leaving the top floor. \u201cDamn it, why do all the hot ones disobey?\u201d. Frustrated with her staff, Wendy grabbed her laptop and started creating a video link. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca got off the elevator and ran like a woman on a mission to the outdoor parking lot where Katie, Tonya and Marita were set up. A huge crowd of women who were able to stand had formed and it would nearly be impossible to reach the 3 Pregtech employees. The plan from PT was simple; they sell their \u201cbetter version\u201d of their products at a reduced cost in exchange for Preggomalls items. Then they take those back to the warehouse, swap the batteries and then sell Preggomalls equipment without paying for heavy machinery costs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca realised that shouldn't carry all three PT employees at once, but she needed some way to pick them all off, one by one. Looking at how the employees were placed, she realised the easiest to pick off first would be Katie. In Katie's profile Rebecca had read that she was a bit too overly fond of pregnant women and if by any chance she had an amulet, it would either be Greed, or Lust. Rebecca unbuttoned some of her shirt making sure she had a seductive valley of cleavage and suggestively walked over to greed filled brunette. \u201cHey\u2026\u201d Rebecca whispered into Katie's ear \u201cwhat brings a pretty girl like you here?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey yourself, aren't you familiar?\u201d Katie asked the raven haired assassin. She swore she looked familiar, but with all the chaotic energy floating around, it was starting to affect her memory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can believe you remembered! I used to be one of your customers!\u201d Rebecca convincingly lied, she had to act fast before Katie's memory kicked in. \u201cYou remember how you promised we would exchange some things next time we met up?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie was quite confused by the ordeal, on one hand she couldn't quite place where she saw Rebecca before. On the other hand she was really hot and would give anything to snatch herself another beauty. \u201cHmmm, yeah I get you. Tonya, Marita I just gotta check up on Sarah, I'll be back in five!\u201d Katie called out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem, hurry back!\u201d Marita replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie grabbed Rebecca and ran into the indoor deserted parking lot. All the other women were outside trying to get a more reliable product at Pregtech. Rebecca was about to knock Katie out when she was welcomed by two of the sexiest lips she had ever faced. Katie launched herself on the Preggomall employee, knocking her to the ground in a flurry of passionate kisses. With three of the amulets close together the two pregnant women swelled to new proportions. 40, 50, 60, 70 babies filled each of the women. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca had been overwhelmed by new found emotions, but quickly snapped out of it. Trying her hardest she rolled onto her feet and knocked out Katie. Rebecca could feel her newly found extra weight as she tried to walk around, that was even with the support from the robo spine. Rebecca realised she couldn't lift up Katie and pulling wasn't an option, so slowly but surely she pushed Katie over to the service elevator where she would meet her fate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was time to grab the other two employees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was having a fantastic time in the shoe store. She was one click away from shutting down her competition. All the back breaking work, the backstabbing and endless hurdles had lead her to this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n [EXECUTE ENERGY SHUT DOWN?]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw the command on her computer. With this, she would nail the final coffin on Preggomalls schemes.

With her amulet and gun at the ready and her tablet nuzzled in between her bountiful breasts, Sarah was not going to be fucked with, and neither was her mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made it to the elevator and pressed the basement button. After a couple of strange sounds and camera movements, the elevator proceeded to take her down. As the doors opened she saw Katie, Tonya and Katie down there, immensely pregnant. Tonya and Marita each had 40 babies inside of them whilst Katie had 70 on her own. Sarah also noticed that Katie had lost her amulet as she lay there, trying to sit up. The robo spines were starting to reach their limit and Sarah wanted to help them, but she knew that would mean becoming bigger herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKatie! Wake up! What's going on?\u201d Sarah panically asked the massive beauty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSexy Asian\u2026 destroyed me\u2026 Save yourself\u2026\u201d Katie breathed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I'll get you out of here, somehow, just let me save my mother first\u201d Sarah passionately replied. She got up and snuck down the laboratory halls underneath the popular mall. She could hear muffled \u201cHELP\u201ds far down the hall. Walking past the first couple of doors she could see scientists and assembly lines unaffected by he chaos outside. Only men worked the lines, making sure everything was in order, a couple of women lay over to the side, trying to handle items they thought were safe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther down she could her a strange hum come from a room that was giving an unearthly grow. She peered through the window to see several incredibly pregnant women orgasming over and over, their naked bodies raw and glowing from the ordeal they have been through. There were a couple of models, a mother and daughter and a news reporter that had been lured in by Erin\u2019s charisma. Little did Sarah know of the history Brandon had with a couple of the women. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose poor women\u2026 it looks like they've been in there for days.\u201d Sarah sadly said to herself, shedding a tear. \u201c There must be a way to turn this off.\u201d She followed the cables to a T intersection. The cables went one way whilst the cables ran another. Sarah\u2019s envy amulet was pulsating, almost calling for her to go hunt down the machine that was manipulating the pregnant energy. \u201cSorry mum, I gotta take down the competition!\u201d Sarah regretted as she ran the opposite direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 10 minutes of running Sarah collapsed at the door where the cables lead. Opening the door Sarah got a wicked sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu. She remembered climbing into that restaurant a week ago, only to be tested on the same machine that stood in front of her. Waddling over she observed the intimidating nature of the gargantuan machine. At the dead centre was 8 strangely shaped holes that looked oddly familiar, but over to the left hand side was a series of levers and buttons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge input and output lever on the far end that was down in output mode, a series of strange lights and buttons determining energy production and storage and lastly a big red button that said \u2018Master Off Button\u2019. She knew what to press.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon put his costume in a specially allocated locker and put on the exquisite suit that was given to him. He left the green rooms and was about to jump in the limo to see two of the Sci Fi worlds hottest actresses when she saw Grace angrily scrunching up flyers. \u201cHey what's up Supergirl?\u201d Brandon asked jokingly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh its you whose up!\u201d Grace frustratingly stammered. \u201cYou make these pregnant women pop up everywhere and just before I think Joel and I are going to be happy together, he gets a call from some floozy!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, hold on, how did you know a girl was calling him?\u201d Brandon asked, try to grasp what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell this wasn't the first time I've hung out with Joel\u2026\u201d Grace said, dropping her head. \u201cWe may have done stuff\u2026 but now that we might be serious, I found out he has another girl<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, you must think of Janice right?\u201d Brandon asked as he lead grace over to a bench under a lamp post. Grace angrily nodded at him \u201cAnd you know that He didn\u2019t really knock her up, this was all work from my magical little device right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeahhhh, I guess so\u2026\u201d Grace submitted, realising her anger was somewhat over the top. \u201cBut that means he is the type of guy to leave a girl if anything happens!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't think so\u2026 Remember the riot?\u201d Brandon said as he pulled out his phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I was there!\u201d Grace answered with a bit of a chuckle. \u201cSo was Joel.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee that was back when he liked pregnant bellies\u201d Brandon said as he loaded a YouTube clip of the riot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I ask what happened that turned him away from the \u2018big curve\u2019?\u201d Grace asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI haven't a clue, but I do know that this is what Janice is like.\u201d Brandon said as he loaded a video of Janice viciously putting people in their place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace was shocked as she watched Janice fight off several police guards. Clearing her through Grace said \u201cI can see why Joel would not want to spend his life with someone like that, what does she do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYoga instructor\u201d Brandon said. The two cracked up laughing as Grace\u2019s remaining anger left her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what, maybe it's not so bad, as a nurse I could probably help Janice out\u201d Grace said getting up from the bench. \u201cHey before I go, can I ask you a personal question?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShoot\u201d Brandon answered getting up as well<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what, I'll ask after your dinner with the bounty hunter and the Amazonian Queen\u201d Grace said with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what? We can make a quick detour\u201d Brandon said as he grabbed Graces hand and lead her to the Limo.  Getting in, Brandon tapped on the drivers barrier. \u201cHey, do you think we could quickly stop off somewhere before we get to the restaurant?\u201d Brandon asked the driver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure\u201d the driver answered as he drove off. As the car headed to he hotel where Brandon's friends were staying, Grace decided to go on Facebook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey look at this, apparently a really pregnant woman won the Charlesberg charity golf in!\u201d Grace said as she went to show her friend the article, not realising she had passed hundreds of articles the Preggomall in a foul and notorious light.  Brandon on the other hand was distracted by the sights of the city they were in. For so long Brandon lived his life in a small town, only leaving to go to uni in another city miles away, but this place was magnificent! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm? What's going on?\u201d Brandon asked as Grace tapped her on the shoulder. Before Grace could reiterate the limousine had pulled up outside the hotel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm afraid this is your stop lil\u2019 lady\u201d the driver said as the barrier came down once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll good, have fun and make sure you keep your tesseract close by\u201d Grace said with a smile and a wink. The amulet was still pulsating and glowing oddly, so Brandon decided it would be best to keep it in the confines of the box. After a deep breath he was ready to meet his two biggest crushes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was almost a recipe for delight when she found out who she was sitting next to. When the hosts of the tournament found out the legendary Catalina Corazon was coming with a plus one, they just had to invite her in, especially after her hit comedy \u2018A Hole in One, Golfing for Two!\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou realise the champions table is a special area for people who have won golf tournaments\u201d Erin belittled her neighbour as she piled corn cobs on her plate, with a huge side of butter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't mind Erin, Becka\u201d Catalina said as she stole one of the remaining cobs from Erin's grasp. \u201cA true celebrity never belittles fans, or spectators. They already know how important and valuable they are\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin almost quipped back, but chose to bite her tongue. As she continued to eat, she was approached by a large greasy man with a badly stylised wig.  With a slur in his speech and sway in his step, anyone could tell that this big man, was drunk. He slowly came up behind Erin and planted his arse down in the seat next to her. \u201cHey love, what are you doin\u2019 in tha champions table\u2026\u201d the drunk bellowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire room was mortified, the only waiter out there was a poor petite girl that would have no chance in stopping a man of that size. Sadly no one could do anything about it, for this was Reggie Bohorn, one of two Billionaires from Chalesberg and owner of the few casinos in the city. Anyone who would try to face him, would not find themselves in a good place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor once in her life Erin was lost, she didn't know what to do. If she acted poorly, the Preggomall would be no more. On the other hand, she really didn't want to deal with this man. \u201cOoohh Bohorn, let's get you out of here, and get you a nice jug of water.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina couldn't believe what she was seeing. The way this man was behaving was completely atrocious, yet no one would do anything about it. She almost felt bad for her competitor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, ho HO! Looks like someone else wants to be my future ex wife!\u201d Bohorn loudly shouted before laughing excessively before smacking Erin on the bum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked, Erin swung her hand around, trying to slap the man, but was unsuccessful. Reggie raised his hand in an attempt to strike back when he was struck in the back of the neck and knocked out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up she saw Catalina standing before a now unconscious Reggie. \u201cWhen you become famous you learn particular moves that keep stalkers at bay.\u201d The two got up and left the dining hall as the waiters took Bohorn to a comfortable bed. The two walked around the huge manor, talking as they looked at the interesting art pieces and trophies. After about 20 minutes of walking they found a balcony where they could just relax and chat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, you may be a Pregtech employee, but you're an alright woman, helping me out like that.\u201d Erin said with a small smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I've always considered myself to be a feminist.\u201d Catalina replied. \u201cBefore my acting days I really could have used the woman I am today to help me out.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? How come?\u201d Erin prodded as they made their way onto a balcony overlooking the golf course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWell, I felt quite lost back then, but you know, today\u2026 Today I am CATALINA CORAZON!\u201d Catalina shouted out loud with a huge grin. The two chuckled until silence fell upon them both. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I ask, why did you leave the Preggomall?\u201d Erin piped up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it would have to be Antonio Greene, he was a sleaze ball who didn't respect the proud woman I am today.\u201d Catalina answered, a growling angry tone in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecka barged through the door, huffing and puffing. \u201cDamn this belly sucks\u2026 I was looking everywhere for you\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d Catalina asked, worried she missed something<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo I just wanted to learn more\u201d Becka stammered as she collapsed in one of the chairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, don't interrupt!\u201d Catalina said, her pride getting a rise out of her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know he no longer works there\u2026\u201d Erin said leaning over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, but I\u2026\u201d Catalina slowly said, her mind tracing off<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlus every Wednesday we do mud wrestling\u2026\u201d Erin persuaded a little more. She was quite close to Catalina when the actress pulled away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on\u201d Catalina butted in \u201c what is your problem with Preggomall anyway?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh it's a competition thing, plus I had a thing for the owners step brother.\u201d Erin sighed as she threw her head back. The two started talking about Brandon, there was a variety of emotions tossed about from anger and comedy to lust and love. It wasn't until that concept of lust and love at came up that Erin really started to feel like her emotions were tugging at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, Brandon is a good guy, technically for so long he helped out his family whilst they were pregnant\u201d Erin said as she looked out onto the golf course. \u201cCan we stop talking about this? I mean I haven't talked to anyone about this sort of thing since, well Brandon! Haha, but you're still a Pregtech person, you know?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, I guess we can\u201d Catalina answered \u201cI guess we could agree that he has a cute butt\u201d. The two cracked up laughing right in front  of Becka, unbeknownst to them that Becka tried to screw Brandon earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey where are you staying tonight? Obviously not here with the drunk pig staying in one of the suites.\u201d Catalina asked patting her new friend on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, is there room for one more at yours?\u201d Erin asked turning to the actress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I've got a booking at \u2018the Equilibrium\u2019 in their Penthouse!\u201d Catalina said with a bring grin. \u201cI even asked if they could get me my best performed films!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way! I was hoping to catch the last part of \u2018Heads or Tails\u2019! Were you able to get a role in that film?\u201d Erin asked, her excitement growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly time will tell!\u201d Catalina said as all three of them decided to leave the manor<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two headed over to the hotel as Sarah\u2026</span></div></div>",

She had limited time to study the mall\u2019s original device but with the work she had done in energy conversion, Sarah believed she had enough expertise and knowledge to shut down the process. At least she hoped so. It was all theoretical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe connected with the proper network and flipped through the walls of security to see the controls of the device. It was definitely different from what she was used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d Sarah said to herself, tapping the keys of her computer. \u201cMaybe\u2026this\u2019ll work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown in the room where the women connected to the pregnancy convertor, moans of pleasure echoed throughout the room. Clara and her daughter Kristina watched as their bellies swelled outward, bumping against the two other models Erin had sent in there. All the captive pregnant women became even more gravid but none were growing as quickly as Jennifer Armstrong, the intrepid reporter Erin deemed a risk. In no time, she gained a belly larger than the rest of her body and a full 1/5th of the room was just her pregnant weight while her breasts and buttcheeks became larger than her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the energy convertor filling their wombs with power instead of fetuses, the jolts stimulated the women and made their groans and gasps uncontrollable. Clara and her daughter embraced the models while they all fell against Jennifer\u2019s colossal pregnant stomach, all writhing in ecstasy. The sudden burst of energy flooded the mall\u2019s circuits and the lights all began to flicker, with a few bulbs near Sarah bursting in a flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess that wasn\u2019t the right one,\u201d Sarah said with a wince, hoping things didn\u2019t go badly for the captive women. She began to type lines of code again and try her shut-down using a different method. \u201cOkay, how about\u2026this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like a bad idea to me,\u201d Rebecca said. Sarah\u2019s body tensed up and she looked at Rebecca out of the corner of her eye. Sarah was slightly crouched so she could use her massive pregnancy as a table for her laptop but in this position, even with her robo-spine, she wouldn\u2019t be able to run away from Rebecca very effectively. Then again, even if she wasn\u2019t pregnant, Rebecca could likely still have caught her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah smirked. \u201cSo you\u2019re telling me this won\u2019t shut down the power?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it might shut down the power. I\u2019m not sure on how all of this works,\u201d Rebecca said with a shrug before stepping forward and scowling at Sarah. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t want me to send you to meet Wendy with your jaw wired shut, then taking another crack at the mall\u2019s power system would be a bad idea.\u201d She placed one hand on Sarah\u2019s earlobe and began to squeeze. Even on such a small piece of skin, with Rebecca\u2019s immense grip strength, it made Sarah suddenly gasp with pain. \u201cThere are a lot of ways to hurt you without hurting your little rugrats inside you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, okay, enough,\u201d Sarah grunted, slowly making it to her feet. \u201cLet me just go get my mother and the rest of my employees and we\u2019ll be out of your hair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot gonna cut it,\u201d Rebecca said with a vicious smile, patting Sarah on her bare belly. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just come with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY\u2019know Rebecca, you have a good point,\u201d Sarah said, slowly reaching down to her wide hips, which had a metal, PregTech-model belt wrapped around them. \u201cWendy and I really should meet soon. Talk face to face.\u201d She held her finger over a concealed button on the belt, waiting for it to activate. \u201cFirst, I\u2019m curious to know: how did you know to look for me here and not with my mother?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you\u2019re into technology and figured your first concern would be to mess around with PreggoMall and learn about what we\u2019ve built here,\u201d Rebecca said. \u201cPlus, you\u2019re an envious little brat who probably fights with your bombshell of a mother all the time so you wouldn\u2019t mind making her wait for your rescue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood call,\u201d Sarah said with a little laugh. \u201cAnd you\u2019re right on the money wanting to stop me from messing with your energy convertor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca sighed and began to fume. \u201cI\u2019m getting tired of this. Do I really have to ask why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, just humor me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I already figured out how it works.\u201d Sarah\u2019s belt beeped, signaling that it was done with the conversion. A crackle of bluish electricity enveloped Sarah as she converted the dozens of fetuses in her womb into pure energy. It was not so potent as to give her a crippling orgasm but it was enough power to throw a hard shove at Rebecca. The skilled assassin reflexively blocked but was pushed back several feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah darted toward Rebecca, who was still in front of the door, and reached her arm back to try and hit Rebecca on the shoulder and bring her to her knees. But as Sarah flung down her hand in a chop, Rebecca lightly parried it and used Sarah\u2019s momentum to trip her up before putting the young scientist in a submission hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice trick. I\u2019ll have to get one of those,\u201d Rebecca panted, her face starting to turn red as she got angrier and angrier. \u201cBut there\u2019s more to a fight than just brute strength and clearly they didn\u2019t teach you that at science camp.\u201d She tightened her elbow around Sarah\u2019s armpit joint and chuckled. \u201cNow then\u2026you said something about wanting to see Wendy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon was trembling as he walked through the lobby of the Equilibrium toward the private dining room reserved for himself and two guests. He had been nervous before meeting beautiful pregnant women before. Erin, Ashley, Sarah, Catalina. The list went on. But these weren\u2019t sexy pregnant women. These were his all-time celebrity crushes and fantasies. Hayley Hewitt and Ashlee Byron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t know what to do or say. Should he compliment them on their movies? Should he ask about their pregnancies? For most people, the amulet rewrote reality so did they believe they had people in their lives who impregnated them, like Janice did with Joel? Then again, the amulet did seem to allow him to woo pregnant women with ease so maybe it still wouldn\u2019t be a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon had the door to the dining room opened for him by a hotel employee and his jaw nearly dropped when he saw the two of them. There was an enormous round table laid out, with both women sitting sideways in their chairs so they could fit with their enormous bellies. Thanks to his run-in with Catalina, both Hayley and Ashlee were carrying 60 babies inside their swollen wombs each and neither were making any effort to cover up their bare stomach skin. Like everyone else touched by the amulets or Sarah and PreggoMall\u2019s technology, they had no stretch marks and their bellies glistened in the light. Hayley\u2019s light tan skin now made her look like a bronze goddess with her pregnant glow and Ashlee\u2019s bright red hair softly curled down and teased her freckled pale skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, there you are!\u201d Hayley said with a booming voice. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind that we started eating without you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Brandon said with a nervous laugh. \u201cI\u2019ve got a pregnant sister and mother so I know all about cravings.\u201d He left out the detail of how he was adopted and had had sex with both of them in the past week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, both of them at the same time?\u201d Ashlee said with shock. \u201cI\u2019ll bet they aren\u2019t as big as us, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re getting there,\u201d Brandon said with a nervous gulp. By the time he returned to Freyjaton, who knows what size they would be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you sound like you\u2019ve got a very interesting life right now,\u201d Hayley said. \u201cCome sit and talk!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon pulled out a chair but Ashlee reached across the table and touched his arm. \u201cNo, not there.\u201d She patted the empty chair between herself and Hayley. \u201cHere.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, he sat between them and both actresses scooted closer, their butts and breasts sandwiching him. \u201cI-I\u2019m a big fan,\u201d Brandon squeaked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, how sweet,\u201d Hayley said, picking up a plate and holding it near Brandon. \u201cHave you eaten yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-not yet,\u201d Brandon said as Ashlee picked up a piece of meat with her fingertips. \u201cI-I really like how you\u2019re both championing more roles for women and non-white actors. Especially in geek-culture kind of shows and movies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm, I like him more and more,\u201d Ashlee giggled. \u201cHere, open up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo fair, I want to feed him,\u201d Hayley said, taking a sandwich triangle and putting it near Brandon\u2019s mouth. \u201cHere you go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be so pushy,\u201d Ashlee said, wrinkling her nose at Hayley. \u201cYou can\u2019t just have him all to yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley sighed and put down the sandwich, cupping Brandon\u2019s face in her hands. \u201cI suppose we\u2019ll just have to share you. How does that sound?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon\u2019s face was bright red and he slowly grinned. \u201cT-that sounds like a good compromise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshlee laughed again and kissed Brandon on the opposite cheek. \u201cHe\u2019s adorable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth women slowly stood up, their bellies shaking and jiggling with each small movement but they quickly began to stroke their middles to stop the movement. \u201cEat as much as you want but meet us in Penthouse C in 10 minutes. Or we start without you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t say that,\u201d Ashlee smiled, lightly pushing her pregnant middle against Hayley\u2019s. \u201cThat\u2019ll make him want to show up late.\u201d Both women laughed and waddled out of the dining room as Brandon checked the time on his phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c10 minutes,\u201d Brandon said. \u201cGlad I learned how to eat fast from Erin.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brandon swiped the key for Hayley Hewitt and Ashlee Byron at their insistence. After all, both women\u2019s pregnancies were far too massive for them to easily reach the door \u2013 a fact that Brandon could see all too clearly and made him even more excited and anxious for the night they seemed to be promising him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the door unlocked and he opened it, Ashlee thrust her wide hips forward to shove Brandon inside their penthouse suite with her titanic pregnant belly. He stumbled inside as she giggled and waddled inside with lusty grace. \u201cSorry, I got a little over-eager,\u201d Ashlee said, stroking her wet lips with one finger as she watched Brandon scramble around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou and me both,\u201d Hayley said once entering, both hands rubbing the front of her belly in large, slow circles with sensual hands and an intrigued look on her face. \u201cAfter all, who knows how long we have before our water breaks? We need to have as much fun with these swollen pregnant bodies as we can before the big moment comes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshlee pushed her hips forward again, but this time pouted and groaned as she rubbed her lower back. \u201cI just wish we could move a little faster. I love having this big tummy but it\u2019s just so damn heavy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-If you buy from PregTech, they have gear to help pregnant women move easily,\u201d Brandon said as he got to his feet slowly. \u201cM-my sister runs it and they have lots of products for women even as big as you too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, you said your sister and mother are heavily pregnant,\u201d Hayley said with a chuckle. \u201cBut to think your sister also runs a company for pregnant women\u2026a love for pregnancy seems to really run in your blood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-adopted mother and sister, actually,\u201d Brandon said, trembling as Ashlee got close to him, running one hand over his shoulders and chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can tell us all about your family later, sweetie,\u201d Ashlee said, bending down so she could nibble on his ear. \u201cFor now, how about you give us a hand and walk us to the bedroom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ve got a better idea,\u201d Hayley said, stroking Ashlee\u2019s round maternal stomach as she cooed. \u201cWait here until we call for you in the bedroom, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-okay,\u201d Brandon said, nodding as he watched the two pregnant actresses waddle away. His heart was racing and he nervously clutched the amulet around his neck. It still had its pulsing red color, different from the usual light blue glow it contained. He worried about what it signified, since the amulet constantly displayed new features he wasn\u2019t aware of, but figured it was just due to strain. He had been using the amulet\u2019s powers far more than usual lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re ready~,\u201d both women loudly squealed in unison. Brandon gulped and checked his phone, wondering if he was missing out on some kind of other obligation. After all, this all seemed too good to be true. The last time one of his dreams came true in this way was when he had sex with a pregnant Erin. But that felt like a lifetime ago now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no messages on his phone, Brandon took a deep sigh and hurried to the bedroom, almost losing his balance from nervousness. Once he opened the door, he saw he was right to be on edge. Both had changed into costumes reminiscent of their on-screen personas, though heavily sexed up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley was wearing a skimpy chain-mail bra with a loincloth around her curvy hips and two leather belts crossed on her enormous pregnant belly. Ashlee was wearing a simple black mask that only covered the space around her eyes while she had a red cape draped over her shoulders. And that was all she was wearing, though she was using the cape to conceal her naked breasts for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said you were a fan,\u201d Hayley said with a chuckle, waddling toward Brandon and sticking out her belly as far as she could. It was twice the size of a yoga ball and her skin was glowing and smooth all over it. As she got closer, Brandon got a better look at her exposed chest, with each breast roughly the size of his head and the metal bikini top she had on only managed to cover her nipples. She put one hand on his back and he felt how physically strong she was in training for the role. Hayley gave him a light shove that managed to push Brandon onto the bed and into Ashlee\u2019s arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what do you think?\u201d she asked with a smile. \u201cA little much?\u201d Brandon took a moment\u2019s hesitation before putting his face between her breasts, which were even larger than Hayley\u2019s, and began to kiss and lick her exposed skin. She shrieked with laughter and fell against the giant mattress, running her hands all over his body as he fondled her. Hayley joined in and helped her acting partner undress him until all three were naked, with the exception of Hayley\u2019s belts and Ashlee\u2019s cape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m such a big fan,\u201d Brandon said again, gasping as Ashlee ran her lips against the length of his erect shaft. \u201cR-really, I\u2019ve followed your careers for so long and-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShh,\u201d Hayley said, putting one finger against his lips. \u201cTonight isn\u2019t about that. You\u2019ve made your point, dear.\u201d She lowered him onto the bed and shifted her hips toward his face. \u201cNow, if you want to do something with your mouth instead\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon quickly obliged, gripping the sides of Hayley\u2019s thick thighs as he lapped at her naked sex, feeling the incredible weight of her pregnant belly pressing down on him. Just before he felt himself about to come from Ashlee\u2019s fellatio, he tapped Hayley on the thigh quickly, making a loud slapping sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops, sounds like he\u2019s ready,\u201d Ashlee said as she removed her lips. Hayley stood up and all three changed positions so Brandon could penetrate Ashlee as she sat down on him. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to give me a few spanks while you\u2019re at it,\u201d she said with a laugh before sitting down and grunting as Brandon entered her. Obliging, Brandon slapped Ashlee on the rear as he pumped against her, even patting the sides of her belly as he drank in her sheer wonderful pregnant size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he pumped against her, Hayley put her belly in Ashlee\u2019s face and the redhead sucked on Hayley\u2019s swollen belly button, making Hayley groan and pant loudly. The faster Brandon went, the faster Ashlee suckled and both he and Hayley grunted with pleasure at the same time as he released inside Ashlee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere, that was fun, huh?\u201d Ashleey laughed as Brandon collapsed against the bed, covered in sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no,\u201d Brandon panted. \u201cI\u2019m not done yet.\u201d He gripped his red amulet, lying on the floor, and made a silent plea. More energy\u2026more power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt himself get a second wind and he grabbed Hayley, bending her over and preparing to thrust inside her. \u201cIf you\u2019re ready, go for it, cowboy,\u201d Hayley laughed as Ashlee positioned herself to let the female warrior eat her out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Brandon wasn\u2019t done. Not only did he get the energy he wanted, he also focused on making both women larger. And larger they became, swelling by 10 babies each until the bed creaked. Once they both moaned with surprise at their growth, Brandon went inside Hayley, making her cry out with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Brandon\u2019s amulet was glowing redder than ever and was having unforeseen effects. In the adjacent room, Erin was on her laptop, looking into PreggoMall\u2019s current state of affairs with shock while Catalina and Becka talked celebrity in the bedroom and Dana rested. Then, Erin and Catalina\u2019s amulets began to glow and their bellies expanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina bolted out of the bedroom and turned to Erin. \u201cWorshipers! I need more worshipers!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s get a lot of room service! You can entertain the bellhops and I\u2019ll eat!\u201d Erin said, her hunger now a ravaging monster inside her as she took heavy, clumsy steps toward the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at PreggoMall, as Sarah was led into the room where Wendy stood and her mother was tied to a chair, all the gathered amulets began to glow. Ashley\u2019s belly pushed forward and she began to moan loudly, her nipples becoming hard under her bra and her seat getting wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah, struggling as her robo-spine adjusted to the new weight, felt a great sense of jealousy for Wendy\u2019s position of power. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening to her?\u201d she asked, pointing to Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-someone had better touch me or I-I think I\u2019m going to explode!\u201d Ashley cooed, her cheeks getting red hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWendy!\u201d Rebecca growled, clutching her growing belly as her eyes became bloodshot with rage. \u201cWhat the fuck is going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy saw their glowing amulets and looked at the sloth and greed amulets Rebecca had brought to her. \u201cThe plan is entering the next stage,\u201d Wendy said with a confident smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Brandon thrust time and time again inside Hayley, he couldn\u2019t help but reflect on all the pregnant beauties he\u2019d been with. Thanks to the amulet, he was able to have this amazing life, like something out of an erotic fantasy. And he thought about the women he wanted to have sex with next. Kim, Katie, those models PreggoMall hired. But his mind kept going back to Erin and how he wanted just one more time with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt his memory of Erin, Brandon lost control and came inside Hayley. That made the glowing and growing stop in the two cities and he collapsed back into the bed with the enormous pregnant actresses. They moaned and caressed their new bellies, wasting no time in cuddling together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched them and saw how they clearly paid him no mind. He felt a brief sting of jealousy, then remembered that\u2019s how Erin must have felt when she thought of his betrayal. Brandon wiped himself off and got changed, heading out the door to go walk around the hotel and gather his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he left, he saw someone leave the suite one over and gasped. \u201cErin?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned and gasped back. \u201cB\u2026Brandon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an awkward pause, both spoke up in unison. \u201cCan we talk?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Erin waddled down the hallway as Brandon slowed his pace to match hers. \u201cYour robo-spine not working?\u201d Brandon asked with a little smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin looked down at her enormous belly, now filled with 50 babies, and how clumsily it wobbled with each of her heavy steps. \u201cYeah, something\u2019s\u2026happened back at the mall and I think our main OS needs to be rebooted or whatever. I\u2019m not really in charge of the technical aspects.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm,\u201d Brandon nodded, the two staying quiet as they waited in front of the elevator. \u201cProbably would have worked if you\u2019d stuck with Sarah\u2019s invention instead of making your own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, dude, we\u2019re having a nice conversation for the first time and you already turn it into a Mall vs. Tech argument?\u201d Erin said, putting her face in her hands. \u201cCan we just not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good to me,\u201d Brandon said. He was out of the loop when it came to most PregTech events anyway. \u201cBut how have you been\u2026lately?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin shrugged. \u201cGood, I guess. That last growth spurt I had was a little unexpected. Your doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy doing?\u201d Brandon asked with a gulp. The cat was out of the bag when it came to the amulet and Erin but he wasn\u2019t aware of his master amulet ripening for its final duty. \u201cNo, why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed and stroked the sides of her massive round stomach. \u201cNever mind. I shouldn\u2019t expect you to totally understand all this magic junk anyway.\u201d Erin patted the top of her belly, smiling as she felt a playful kick against her palm. \u201cBut yeah, I\u2019m good. They feed me really well at the mall and have a great selection of private chefs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon remembered her appetite and the spirit inside his amulet told him about the \u201cvices\u201d associated with the other seven amulets. Clearly Erin was saddled with gluttony. \u201cDo you want to go get something to eat and talk over a late dinner?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I actually went a little crazy up in my room not to long ago,\u201d Erin said with a smile, wiping some sauce from the corner of her lips. \u201cBut thanks for the offer. That\u2019s\u2026sweet.\u201d Brandon blushed and grinned, looking down at his feet. \u201cSo, what are you doing in a penthouse? I thought you and the usual gang were at the convention together?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were but I\u2026\u201d Brandon hesitated, knowing his sexual escapades with other pregnant women were the reason for his and Erin\u2019s break-up in the first place. But if they were going to talk like adults, they needed to be honest. \u201cI got invited to have sex with two actresses at the convention.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Erin said, rolling her eyes as the elevator stopped and she shoved her belly forward to get off. \u201cLet me guess: they were both pregnant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon bit his lip. \u201cErin, I never cheated on you.\u201d She scoffed and rolled her eyes. \u201cPlease, you have to believe me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI saw plenty of evidence. Don\u2019t treat me like an idiot, Brandon,\u201d Erin said in a deep voice, trying to hurry away but her pregnancy slowed her down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy boss\u2019s wife and her pregnant daughter both blackmailed me into getting intimate with them but it never even went far,\u201d Brandon said. \u201cKristen, Clara, I don\u2019t like them at all! And Grace was just a friend and still is!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin paused. \u201cYou said their names are Kristen and Clara?\u201d She had dealings with both of them as investors in the new PreggoMall. They certainly had\u2026devious personalities. \u201cBut! It was probably less than a day after I walked out on you during that D&amp;D game that you started fucking every pregnant woman in sight! You were just in it for sex from the beginning!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I started having sex with pregnant women because I was hurt and I needed something to fill that hole in my life,\u201d Brandon said. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful and I wanted to be with other beautiful women. But I\u2019m not friends with any of them and I wouldn\u2019t want to spend time with them just talking and chatting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin pursed her lips, her fingers gingerly moving lower and lower. \u201cI do miss having someone to talk to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd when I found out I was adopted\u2026that stirred up a lot of crazy emotions too,\u201d Brandon said. \u201cSo Ashley, Sarah, Catalina ended up in there somehow\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to apologize for sleeping with Ashley,\u201d Erin said, biting her lip and turning away. \u201cShe\u2019s\u2026hard to turn down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cYou\u2026you had sex with Ashley?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin gave a little grin and blushed. \u201cI mean\u2026she\u2019s a whirlwind of a woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue,\u201d Brandon said with a nervous laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd she was even bigger when I was with her, so that\u2019s one up on you,\u201d Erin said with a chuckle, nudging him with her belly. He laughed and pushed her back, but ended up stopping and rubbing her belly. Both stood in the hallway of the hotel, breathing slowly as Brandon stroked Erin\u2019s stomach in slow circles. \u201cI\u2019ve been\u2026thinking about you a lot lately. I miss\u2026us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI miss us too,\u201d Brandon said. \u201cNot just for the sex. I miss you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWithout you\u2026I\u2019ve become kind of callous and cruel at the mall,\u201d Erin said, crossing her arms. \u201cI made women compete in wrestling contests. I bark orders and spy on your sister. Hell, I kidnapped women and used their wombs as an energy source!\u201d She fumed and shook her head. \u201cNo more. When I get back, there are going to be some changes at PreggoMall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe\u2026time to call a truce between you and my adopted sister?\u201d Brandon said, touching one hand to her chin so they could meet eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin smiled and moved closer toward him, hugging Brandon and kissing him on the neck. \u201cSo\u2026how\u2019d you like to start dating the world\u2019s youngest CEO?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, I read about some teenager in India who\u2019s a CEO of an IT company. And it\u2019s a multi-national, which I don\u2019t think PreggoMall\u2013,\u201d Brandon started to say before Erin put one finger over his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, most pregnant CEO, how about that?\u201d Erin purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen Sarah lately so she may be\u2013,\u201d Brandon started to say before Erin pinched his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe just nod your head,\u201d Erin said, bending him down as they kissed. Erin slid her tongue into Brandon\u2019s mouth while guiding his hand to rub her belly exactly where she wanted it most. \u201cSo\u2026whose room should we go back to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you alone?\u201d Brandon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, Catalina tagged along and brought some pregnant friend of hers who\u2019s dressed up like a cartoon character,\u201d Erin said. \u201cPlus there\u2019s about two dozen bellhops she convinced to have sex with her so it\u2019s kinda crowded.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy room has two gigantic pregnant actresses, if you don\u2019t mind the initial awkwardness,\u201d Brandon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d Erin said, playfully glaring at him. \u201cWho are they?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHayley Hewitt and Ashlee Byron,\u201d Brandon said. Erin stopped in place and swung around, knocking Brandon over with her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you serious?\u201d she said, a huge smile on her face. If there was a bigger fan of both women than Brandon, it was Erin. \u201cOhmigod, you have to introduce me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould be my pleasure,\u201d Brandon said. As Erin helped him up, both hurried to the elevator, with Brandon wrapping one hand around her hip to aid her movement. They made it back to Brandon\u2019s room and entered to hear Hayley and Ashlee both going at it in the bedroom. \u201cM-maybe we should give them their privacy,\u201d Brandon said with a bright blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a better idea,\u201d Erin said, taking Brandon\u2019s hand and dragging him to the bedroom. On the bed, Hayley and Ashlee were laying in a 69 position, only both were sucking on the other\u2019s pregnant navels. \u201cHi there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat up slowly, with their bellies weighing hundreds of pounds each, as they smiled. \u201cBrandon, you brought a friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, long story short, I got back with my ex-girlfriend,\u201d Brandon said. \u201cThis is Erin and\u2013\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I am such a huge fan!\u201d Erin said, rubbing her belly quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProve it,\u201d Hayley said, spreading her legs and stroking her hands on her thighs. Brandon and Erin both looked at each other with surprise. \u201cC\u2019mon, you both got back together, right? Time to celebrate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon and Erin crouched down to whisper. \u201cShould we?\u201d Erin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMight be\u2026good for our relationship if we both have a thing for pregnant women,\u201d Brandon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, from now on, if either of us see someone we like, we have to consult the other,\u201d Erin said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll discuss it from there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good for now,\u201d Brandon said. \u201cThough I have one quick request.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Erin asked, eyeing Ashlee as she fondled her swollen breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s this employee at PregTech named Katie. She\u2019s not into guys but if you convince her to get into some sort of m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois situation or even let me watch\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin giggled and kissed Brandon on the cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do,\u201d she said as she turned to the two writhing pregnant actresses on the bed and hurried into their embrace.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah lay flat on her back, her belly weighing down on her, realising now how screwed  she was. Sarah would have to find a way out herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy came down from her throne, the wrath and greed amulets secured in a box. She cackled like Cruela De Vil, a villainous smug look on her face as she waltz over to Sarah. \u201cLooks like you're dealing with a huge amount of energy\u201d Wendy said as she held the scientist\u2019s midsection. She felt a warm pleasant glow from the energy emanating in Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cDid you know Antonio, that man that converted you originally started working on turning these unnatural unborns into energy stores since a devastating event that happened in Europe? These very amulets caused a massive baby boom during the Cold War.\u201d Wendy said, leaning down to Sarah. Looking at Sarah\u2019s face made her think of something. Standing up she called out to Sarah's mum \u201cTell me, Ashley, before you got married, what was your name?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEriksson\u201d Ashley weakly answered, her legs shaking from the built up lust inside of her. \u201cOoh where\u2019s Kim when I need her..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA Swedish name! Of course! I'm guessing your mother travelled here\u201d Wendy happily replied before turning back to Sarah. She whispered softly \u201cHold on, your mother has no idea about the amulets, does she?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah tried to say something but her breasts were weighing down on her. Struggling, she sat herself up. She had to think hard, if she said no, Ashley would be told, but if she said yes, then it would be likely tested\u2026 \u201cn\u201d Sarah started but was cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAshley, have you ever wondered where that piece of jewellery you have came from?\u201d Wendy asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease stop\u201d Sarah cried out as her options became limited. The last thing she needed was her mother to know about all this\u2026 Looking between her plump breasts she found her answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEver wonder why you have spent the past 8 months dealing with a neglectful husband?\u201d Wendy askee, walking over to the modelling mother. \u201c haven't you thought you look a bit too good for a 45 year old?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d Ashley asked, her lust fading as old hurt \u2018memories\u2019 started to form in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, let's just say-WHAT THE?!\u201d Wendy shouted as Ashley\u2019s belly shot up in size, knocking the soon to be CEO on her butt. Turning around she saw Sarah\u2019s large belly diminishing to the point where She wasn't even pregnant in the first place. With the weight having left her,  Sarah was trying her best to make her escape. \u201cRebecca! GET HER!\u201d Wendy shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca looked at the escaping scientist and realised she had an amulet around her neck. Rebecca quickly sprung into action putting her focus into her amulet. Sarah grew at an astonishing rate, her belly swelled rapidly once again. Her belly was too big for the door frame, as she impacted with the small hole Sarah was flung back, skidding back bigger than ever back onto the floor. She tried to use her amulet against Rebecca's, but the constant flow of chaotic magic wouldn't have it. Just like a river flowing down stream, the chaotic energy was unable to change direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled onto her belly as it grew larger and larger, growing higher than Ashley's and Rebecca's massive midsections. Sarah started to sweat from the constant body change and she could see Wendy trying to grab her amulet, caught between the brunettes very large breasts. Sarah grabbed her amulet and unclipped it from her necklace chain<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou'll never grab this!\u201d Sarah exclaimed, squeezing the amulet. Unfortunately rhe amulet slipped out of her sweaty grasp, bouncing onto her ever growing belly and into Wendy's hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like I just did.\u201d Wendy said as she touched her iPad. The surrounding walls fell apart opening up to a huge underground warehouse. She saw so many captives converterd to create energy and once again she heard Wendy\u2019s cackle. Sarah's body started to slow down in its growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy walked over to her captive citizen, waving a detection wand over Sarah's midsection she discovered she had a whopping 120 FOETUSES! Sarah kicked and wiggled, trying to free herself but couldn't. She sighed and gave up in defeat as she remembered that familiar sound similar to a balloon being blown up to maximum capacity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed to escape, thtinkingn quickly Sarah grabbed every trinket she could, trying to find a way to macguyver herself out of the situation she was in. She pulled out the gun she used to transform Tony into Tonya, she detached her Robospine, grabbed her mobile phone,  tablet and some spare wires from when she was working on her belt. Sadly due to her now incredible figure she was unable to reach past her waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe hell is she doing?\u201d Wendy asked, no longer concerned about revealing a horrific truth to Ashley. She tried to look over the huge flesh orb that was Sarah's belly, she knew there was but one simple way of stopping her. Rebecca and Wendy rolled Sarah slightly over, causing all her belongings to slide off onto the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looked in horror as every last piece of her inventions fell. She just managed to grab onto the tablet, but everything else was no more. Realising she had two new \u2018batteries\u2019 Wendy called in some mechanical support to help hook the Page mother and daughter up to their systems. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sarah could see several prisoners that were there for days, a news reporter, a few models and another mother and daughter couple. But when Sarah and Ashley were placed in a new location, Sarah could see a couple of familiar faces. Katie, Marita and Tonya were all dispersing energy, but she couldn\u2019t believe what she saw next to them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Grace, Grant, Mara and Joel all sat on the couch drinking and watching Ezra: the Amazonian Queen and playing drinking games. Chinese food and alcohol were spread over the table in front of them, even though they had quite a bit to drink, the alcohol hadn't hit them yet.  Joel sat on one side of the couch,  trying to get Grace\u2019s attention on the other side. \u201cPlease, listen I'm no dead beat, I know my past is a bit awkward but you gotta trust me, I mean, you remember the fun we had, right?\u201d Joel pleaded to toned gal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMara, can you tell Joel that whomever he was talking to on the phone would say otherwise\u2026\u201d Grace said, as she took another drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, talk to me like I'm a human being!\u201d Joel shouted, leaning over Mara and Grant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh fine, let talk outside.\u201d Grace said as she walked onto the balcony. <br>\r\nA cool breeze passed by as the two looked out onto Charlesberg. Joel was tried to think of what to say. His big mouth and his little head got him into so much trouble, he was worried he might say the wrong thing. Breathing out he looked at Grace and remembered why he liked her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrace, you are one of the awesomest women I know. We've known each other for past few days and it's been fun, but you should know I have a history with pregnant women.\u201d Joel confessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace was about to remind him about having sex with her whilst she was pregnant, but realised he didn't know about the amulets. \u201cGo on\u201d she replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would want to be with every single one, but then a few days ago I was struck with some strange virus.\u201d Joel said placing his beer down. \u201cAfter being the womaniser I was, I hit a point where I realised i didnt want to be that. I like you and only you Grace, I just don't want to screw anything up.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, thank you for telling me. I really like you too, it's just there are things that I just don't know about, like who did i hear you talking to on the phone?\u201d Grace asked, her voice slightly filled with a tone of tension. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel had to take a breath for the next thing he would say would be no easy feat. \u201cHer name is Janice and she and I are having 80 children together\u201d He seriously said, believing he was in some kind of hell. \u201cI thought we were in the clear, but she called me up and put me through this entire guilt trip\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n80 children. Grace couldn't help but snigger. She knew that this wasn\u2019t Joel's fault, just a silly mishap that Brandon's thingamajig created. Joel caught Grace's snigger and gave her one shocked look. \u201cYou think this is funny?!\u201d Joel stammered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no\u201d Grace said trying to compose herself. \u201cDo they have names?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! They are Jane, John, Tony, Jen, Ken, Tim, Brandon, Francis, Jack, Nemo, Jess, Amanda, Tara, Jim, Nicole\u2026\u201d Joel started before Grace stopped her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's alright, I shouldn't have put you through all that stress.\u201d Grace said, patting Joel on the shoulder. \u201cWhy don't we change the subject. You told me earlier that you were a fan of movies made in the 50s and 60s\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, that's where my smooth talking mouth learned how woo women\u201d Joel said as he calmed down. \u201cCoincidentally it's why I old women want their way with me\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace giggled at the thought of Joel trying to escape a bingo game filled with women who thought he was a ginger Walter Matthau. She also remembered why she liked him so, his humour and flirtatious behaviour gave off a neat kind of confidence. She listened as the man talked about a movie called the Front Page, a comedy about a reporter trying to leave the business so he could marry a gorgeous piano player only for the news piece of the century to land right in his lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I may not be Jack Lemon, but I do feel like I'm trying to escape Freyjaton.\u201d Joel said as he looked longingly into Graces eyes. Grace almost wanted to be swept away, but realised that Joel couldn't leave Janice. She wanted a real relationship with the guy, but if Janice gives birth, Joel's life would be down the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJoel, we need to, Ooohhh God\u2026\u201d Grace said as she got up to fast. The alcohol finally hit her and Joel. They walked in and saw Grant and Mara making out on the couch. \u201cHehehe, looks like we will have to wait till sun up to find Brandon.\u201d Grace said as she looked over at Joel. His toned face looked sexy in the dim lighting, his arms were quite large for a geek like him. Smiling she realised she had a few hours to spare; grabbing Joel\u2019s hand Grace dragged him into the bedroom.</span></div></div>",

Beside her, Erin, the girl he was finally with, giving consent to this awesome moment! He felt the heat emanating from Hayley\u2019s thighs as his fingers traced down the curve of her belly, down to her moist vagina. Now that Brandon had time to cool off, he could approach this with more finesse\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his fingers slowly moved down ever so softly, he could feel Hayley relax as moans escaped from The short actress\u2019s lips. Brandon's left hand grabbed her juicy thighs, his fingers slightly digging in as he used the fingers on his right hand to lightly trace over Tracy's sensitive and tingling pleasure region. Hayley took a long breath out, trying to settle the sexual energy pulsating inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErin?\u201d Brandon cautiously said, inches away, trying his best not to immediately succumb to the sex crazed  celebrity that was Hayley Hewitt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah Bee?\u201d Erin said as she stopped locking lips with the red headed Ashlee Byron. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cthank you\u2026\u201d Was all Brandon could say as began to finger Hayley. He knew she was extensively raw from round one. The poor petite woman was a single actress, trying to get a sixth season of her show. Now she was like her role, a queen but one of seductive, mouth watering sex. Hayley yearned for yet another moment with the fan, one that hadn't touched her in the way she had before! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMMMmmmm\u201d Hayley hummed as she felt Brandon, play with her. She couldn't understand it, she never felt this way! She bit her bottom lip as Brandon sped up. Her breathing quickened to sharp gasps as Brandon changed from his fingers to going Down on her. His tongue felt incredible! Hayley leant back on the bed, trying to get as much of the moment as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, I, i\u2026.\u201d Hayley barely said, gasping as she grasped the bed sheets. \u201cI want, you\u2026 I want you inside of me\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon did as he was told, he unbuckled his belt and thrusted down his pants. Erin looked on a Brandon took hold of the position with much gusto and confidence. \u201cWhy didn't I see this sooner?\u201d Erin asked herself as Brandon readied himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike times before him, he slowly entered, making sure he was in the okay. Slowly, he would start to thrust into Hayley, as she grinned and moved her hands across her sexy midsection. She grabbed a bottle of oil and rubbed it into her belly, giving it a nice shine. Brandon looked down as he continued, leaning over the belly and bringing his hands to Hayley bountiful cleavage. \u201cFuck me Brandon\u2026\u201d Hayley said \u201c do unforgivable things to me!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon picked up his pace, slapping the celebrities thighs. He increased the pace, as sweat formed on his forehead, he looked over and saw Ashlee taking over Erin, tying her wrists to the big bed that all for of them were on. Hayley's breasts jiggled, bouncing with every movement. Brandon saw the woman he had embraced was in full bliss he saw as she mouthed the words \u201coh, OH, fu-uu-uck!\u201d As he went harder and harder. <br>\r\nHayley raised her hand for one second as an idea came to her mind. She carefully rotated onto the floor and presented her derri\u00e8re to Brandon. The fan completely knew what she was thinking. He re-entered her and immediately picked up the pace once again. \u201cOoo-oo-oohhhh\u201d Hayley moaned as Brandon thrusted harder and harder into her. He saw Hayley scratch her fingers down the floor as she moaned in pleasure. He slapped the short celebrities butt, hard. An \u201cAH\u201d escaped from the  brunette. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshlee looked over as she saw her friend go into pure ecstasy, cumming over Brandon's hard member. Brandon's Amulet started to pulsate again and was affecting everyone in the room. Ashlee broke away from exploring Erin luscious curves and tackled Brandon whilst Hayley was busy quivering. Her sheer belly forced Brandon to the ground as the red headed celebrity got on top of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin looked over about to protest when she saw Hayley on the ground, her legs spasming from the sheer shock that Brandon gave her. She waddled over and waited for Hayley to stop cumming before making love to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh fuck me, you stallion!\u201d Ashlee screamed, riding Brandon as hard as she could. Brandon was in pure bliss. In the heat of the moment he was losing his mind, and something else was taking over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is not how it works\u2026\u201d Came from Brandon, his voice changing. Getting up he continued to screw Ashlee, but went from being submissive to VERY dominant. His Amulet continued to pulsate as a red wave of light came from within. It struck the women in the room, doubling their size. Then it hit everyone in the top floor, Catalina, Becka and several rich families. The energy proceeded to take over the entire hotel, giving women between 18 and 50 varying degrees of pregnancy. From a cheerleading team that turned into a maternity group, to a CEO\u2019s wife holding 30 babies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin could see the mess that it was creating. Struggling she tried to free herself from the bed, but it was no use. She sat and accepted her rapidly growing belly. It felt fantastic, but she knew she as in too deep\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon continued to screw Ashlee until they both finally climaxed and both fainted due to the rush of energy flowing through them. With Brandon unconscious the energy dissipated, with its latest victims not realising the predicament they were in. Hayley, whose butt was now lightly touching the ceiling as she lay on her belly said \u201cwhoa, wasn't that something?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim waddled up to Wendy's office above the mall. Chaos had reigned through the streets of Freyjaton, women had crashed their \u201cfuturistic cars\u201d, others couldn't stop orgasming due to their belly rings. With the faulty inventions and their machines busted, this was leaving riots on the streets. Kim looked out onto the parking lot and saw there was a small peaceful patch down where a truck was parked. Violence seemed to have stopped. Using a telescope in the office, she discovered it was a Preg-tech truck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe loved her new life. Sure Kim no longer talked to her old friends but she was having an amazing sex life with Ashley now. She had a very reasonable salary and was in one of the most comfortable positions in Freyjaton. But something didn't seem right. She took, took and took and it was very helpful to her, but it was causing pure chaos across the city! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKim!\u201d Wendy called on the telecom. \u201cWhat are you doing in my office?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust chilling, waiting for this to die down\u201d Kim answered as she lounged on the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I need you to come down and take a box back up to my headquarters.\u201d Wendy ordered confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?  Aren't there hundreds of scientists that you could choose from?\u201d Kim responded lazily, rubbing her bare belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I don\u2019t trust them like I trust you, my dear Kim\u201d Wendy answered \u201cand don't question my orders again!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe comm died and Kim took the elevator downstairs. Arriving she saw a huge football field sized warehouse filled with massive fleshy orbs. Moaning could be heard throughout the halls, as she waddled towards Wendy and Rebecca. \u201cWhat's going on here?\u201d Kim asked as she lightly touched the belly of Sarah Page, feeling the energy pulsate inside of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are looking at the energy source that is powering all of Freyjaton.\u201d Wendy confidently declared. \u201c30 women containing Gigawatts of energy, cumming all for the sake of energy\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, these women volunteered?\u201d Kim asked, seeing nothing but the gigantic bellies of prisoned women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, sure volunteered\u201d Rebecca laughed before being slapped by Wendy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet's just say some where persuaded.\u201d Wendy said with a childish grin. \u201cNow I need you to take these amulets up to my room.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim couldn't believe herself. These poor women were being used as slaves, not having the opportunity to live a normal life. She needed to find Erin quick. Grabbing the box she took it over to the elevator. Getting inside she saw the amulets that Wendy had taken. Unbeknownst to her, she was holding the sloth, envy and greed amulets. \u201cAshley and Erin were wearing these, maybe they knew what they can do.\u201d She said to herself, trying to call them to no avail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew Erin was out of town and Ashley was no where to be seen. The last time she remembered she was heading to\u2026 Wendy\u2026 Putting two and two together she realised the predicament Wendy was in. Putting an amulet around her neck, she headed to Charlesberg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut which amulet did she use?</span></div></div>",

Its multi-colored gems dazzled in the sun and she couldn\u2019t resist slipping it over her neck and letting it rest between her swollen breasts. Once on, it began to pulsate with chaotic energy again, aware that it had a new host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo commemorate its new owner, the amulet transferred more pregnancies into Kim\u2019s womb, making her grow with 10 additional babies. Since nearly every woman in Frejyaton became pregnant with an ever-increasing number of fetuses, clothing that revealed one\u2019s belly became common-place so Kim\u2019s mocha tan belly could expand out without any interference from her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim let out a surprised grunt as she began to stroke her middle, feeling all the kicking inside her, and paused. Tendrils of doubt began to fill her mind as the greed amulet did what it did best. \u201cWith all this turmoil at the mall\u2026now could be the perfect opportunity for someone else to take control,\u201d Kim purred to herself. \u201cAll I need is to get Erin back and use her influence as leverage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cackled and waddled to the mall\u2019s line of vehicles. Thanks to Sarah\u2019s trickery, none of the self-driving cars for pregnant women were operational but there were still prototypes available that didn\u2019t use her computer chips. They were clumsier and required all the controls to be moved in order for a pregnant woman to reach them but Kim knew it would have to make do. All that was missing was an energy source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown in Wendy\u2019s generator room, which was more like a dungeon at this point, Kim looked over each of the women whose wombs were being used to power the mall. Stroking her amulet and feeling its desire for wealth guide her decisions, Kim stopped in front of Clara, the wife of one of the city\u2019s tech millionaires and a business expert in her own right. \u201cHere, you come with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara hesitated and looked over to Kristen, who was lying on the ground with her belly sticking high up in the air, stroking her curves while groaning. \u201cTake my daughter instead,\u201d Clara said quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault she\u2019s in this mess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever you want,\u201d Kim said with a shrug, undoing the wires attached to Kristen\u2019s pregnant belly and helping her to her feet. \u201cJust remember my generosity down the road.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the prototype car, there was an interface to allow Kim to use the energy that now resided inside Kristen\u2019s belly to power the car. When she \u201cplugged in\u201d Kristen, the spoiled girl let out a whimper of ecstacy but remained mostly quiet and cooperative as Kim drove toward Charleston, where she hoped to find Erin. \u201cW-what\u2019s happening?\u201d Kristen said after a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to take Wendy out of the picture and become the new CEO of PreggoMall,\u201d Kim said, patting Kristen on the stomach. \u201cDoesn\u2019t that sound better that the current management?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristen shifted in her seat and looked down at herself. \u201cBut why am I only in my underwear?\u201d Thanks to Wendy\u2019s use of the energy device, all the women\u2019s bellies expanded and tore through their clothing, leaving Kristen in her lacy lingerie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have time to change you. Or really care to,\u201d Kim answered as she sped up the car faster and faster. \u201cBesides, you\u2019re a good looking girl. When you\u2019re free, maybe you should join Ashley and me as models for PreggoMall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you wanted to be the CEO,\u201d Kristen said, letting out a moan as Kim\u2019s acceleration excited the energy inside her womb once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim chuckled. \u201cI can multi-task.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the mall, Wendy sat in the executive office as Sarah, Janice, Katie, and Ashley lay in front of her, restrained in their seats. Rebecca paced back and forth behind Wendy, eyeing their captives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what is this all about?\u201d Sarah asked, trying not to look intimidated by Wendy\u2019s super-pregnant super-soldier. \u201cYou want me to undo my virus on your system or give you more of my company secrets?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s all over now,\u201d Wendy sighed. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have you all here at the same time so this makes everything much easier.\u201d She tapped on her computer and, on a large screen mounted on a side-wall, brought up graphs detailing PregTech and PreggoMall\u2019s holdings. \u201cThis is about the end of PregTech.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKatie, can you interpret all this for me?\u201d Sarah whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, business-stuff isn\u2019t all that clear for me right now,\u201d Katie mumbled, eyes firmly locked on Sarah\u2019s belly. Her greed amulet was gone and now all that she focused on was Sarah\u2019s 120-baby belly, which exceeded all of her pregnant fantasies. She was also carrying close to 80 fetuses herself and wished her arms weren\u2019t restrained so she could rub her gigantic middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith you all here, there\u2019s nothing to stop me from absorbing PregTech and running both companies,\u201d Wendy said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s only part of the plan. I have everything I need to finish Antonio\u2019s great vision.\u201d She held up the envy and sloth amulets, dangling over her desk. \u201cAnd with Rebecca and Ashley\u2019s amulets, that\u2019s half of them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause. \u201cWhat about mine?\u201d Katie asked. She was the first one to discover the power of the amulets from the manual and was more aware of their nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMs. Page\u2019s business partner and lover seems to have made off with that one,\u201d Wendy said, looking over at Ashley. \u201cI gave the three employees I was most suspicious of a box containing the amulets but each one only contained one real amulet and two decoys with trackers in them. So while Kim may have an amulet, she is leading me to the others.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe others?\u201d Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErin, Catalina, and your adopted brother,\u201d Wendy said with a wicked smile. \u201cHe\u2019s been the most helpful of all. If it wasn\u2019t for his perverted nature awakening the amulets, it would have taken longer for so many of the city\u2019s women to become pregnant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley blushed. \u201cHe certainly loves pregnant women. That\u2019s for sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is this big plan of yours anyway?\u201d Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s always been simple: use the amulets to make the world\u2019s women pregnant and cater to their needs exclusively,\u201d Wendy said. \u201cBut thanks to your inventions, we can go even further. Pregnancies that can last indefinitely. Turning men into pregnant women. You\u2019ve even made advances in Antonio\u2019s energy convertor.\u201d She stepped toward Sarah and straddled her colossal belly with her legs. \u201cThanks to you, I won\u2019t just become rich. I\u2019ll become Queen of the Earth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re insane,\u201d Janice spat, still a little flicker of wrath left within her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me I\u2019m insane when my plan comes to fruition,\u201d Wendy said. \u201cOnce I have all seven amulets gathered together and the master amulet around my neck, then the master plan with be complete.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s her plan,\u201d Kim said, sitting at a table with Brandon, Erin, and Catalina gathered around. Brandon was still a little shaken from Kim knocking on the hotel door and pulling him and Erin from their embrace with Ashlee and Hayley but clearly it was for something important. \u201cYou can see it all here on the company files I downloaded before I left to come here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIncredible,\u201d Erin said in a hushed voice. \u201cI was probably never meant to be the real CEO. Wendy wanted to use me from the beginning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon was trembling, thinking of his adopted family in danger and how, in a way, this was all his fault. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t used the amulet\u2026and been so obsessed with pregnant women\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could finish, Erin put one hand over his. \u201cDon\u2019t blame yourself. This is all chaotic magic and diabolical schemes,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd trust me, as someone who was pregnant in the former Smallton, we appreciate your care.\u201d She kissed him on the cheek and rubbed her belly against his thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill, we can\u2019t let Wendy get away with this,\u201d Catalina said, the pride from her amulet welling up inside her. \u201cThere\u2019s only one woman who\u2019s meant to be queen and her name is Catalina Corazon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen we plan a takeover of our own,\u201d Erin said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn one condition,\u201d Kim said, holding up one finger. \u201cI get to be CEO of the mall when we return.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s fine. It was fun while it lasted and\u2026I have a new life to move on to.\u201d She gripped Brandon\u2019s hand and smiled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s fine with me,\u201d Brandon said, glaring at Kim. \u201cYour affair with my dad broke my family apart. How can I trust you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause all I care about is money,\u201d Kim cackled. \u201cI wanted money from Tanner and I want money from the mall. Whether you believe me is up to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs someone who loves money, I can tell you she\u2019s being honest,\u201d Kristen said, waddling up and stroking her exposed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI also have my reservations about you,\u201d Erin said. \u201cYou helped break Brandon and me up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I\u2019ve been locked up thanks to you and turned into a pregnant battery but I\u2019m focused on bigger things now,\u201d Kristen said, rolling her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo we\u2019re a team?\u201d Catalina said, rubbing her brown tummy and grinning. \u201cIt\u2019s just like my upcoming movie, \u2018Swollen Squad Alpha,\u2019 about a team of pregnant commandos, each with their own skills. Mine is espionage, because that\u2019s the role that gave me the most lines and let me-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s great, Catalina,\u201d Erin said, cutting her off. \u201cFor now, let\u2019s plan our strike on the mall and a way to take down Wendy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon gulped, remembering something Lania told him. In the past, when the amulets were used, there was a war between two sides. And he worried if that was happening now.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He cursed under his breath and tossed it onto the bed, rubbing his hands together with panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Ashlee purred, leaning in the bedroom door as one hand caressed her colossal, glistening belly. After last night, she and Hayley were now carrying close to 100 fetuses inside her swollen womb and each baby only doubled the already stunning actresses\u2019 beauty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing a little more quality time won\u2019t fix,\u201d Hayley chimed in, squeezing in between Ashlee and the doorframe, her breasts and belly rubbing against Ashlee\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, it\u2019s a little too complex,\u201d Brandon said, blushing as he looked the two women over. \u201cA-as much as I\u2019d like to\u2026\u201d He hesitated, questioning what his new relationship with Erin meant. They had finally gotten back together and while Erin wanted to engage in a four-way with the actresses, Brandon wanted to respect his girlfriend and her feelings. Miscommunication about him sleeping with other pregnant women led to their break-up in the first place, after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re leaving now,\u201d Erin said, patting both women on the shoulders to cue them to let her waddle into the bedroom. \u201cIt\u2019s been nice meeting both of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame for us,\u201d Hayley giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you ever come to Freyjaton\u2026look us up,\u201d Erin purred, running one hand down Hayley\u2019s waist, around the curvature of her rear and settling on her plump butt cheek. \u201cBut for now, it\u2019s urgent that we leave as soon as possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should have known something was up after she woke us up so rudely,\u201d Ashlee huffed, turning to look at Kim in the main room of the suite. She was going over financial documents on a computer, still invigorated by her newly acquired greed amulet. \u201cMaybe have her join in when we visit your city.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon blushed, imagining having sex with the woman his adopted father slept with to fracture their family. But Erin smiled and placed one hand on Brandon\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI think she\u2019s in a relationship\u2026with his mom.\u201d Erin turned to Brandon and grinned. \u201cYou\u2019ve missed out on a lot of changes down at the mall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-sounds like it,\u201d Brandon said with a gulp as he and Erin grabbed their bags and headed out the door, with Kim following behind. Catalina was in the adjacent room, filled with her legions of fans, as well as Becky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime to go, I\u2019m sorry everyone,\u201d Catalina said, blowing them kisses. \u201cI\u2019ll come to the next convention, I promise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-it\u2019s morning?\u201d one of the hotel staff members she got to come to her room said, weakly sitting up. \u201cCrap, we need to get back to work!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you can present all this to our company lawyer back in town,\u201d Catalina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure can. It\u2019s all up here,\u201d Kim said, tapping her temple with one finger. \u201cBut we\u2019d better hurry before Wendy tests some new inventions on your CEO.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they all left, Brandon stopped in place, feeling a strange sensation. His amulet was glowing but it wasn\u2019t the usual blue or red. It was more like a dim pulsing, so faint it seemed as though only he could see it. But instinctively, he knew there was another amulet nearby and one he was familiar with: wrath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownstairs, a newly energized Rebecca was stomping into the hotel lobby, her eyes flicking around at every person she saw, giving them a light visual scan. Weapons, training, spying, anything that made them out of the ordinary. Rebecca made her way to the front counter, not seeing anything that would cause alarm, and grabbed the staff member by the collar. \u201cI need to know what room a certain guest is staying in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-are you with the police?\u201d the young woman choked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca smirked. When Wendy took control of the world, she imagined herself as a kind of general, ensuring order across the globe, but for now she could only threaten people the usual way. \u201cNo, but I have the only authority that matters here.\u201d She raised one fist, accidentally bumping her amulet in the process and giving the clerk a quintuplet belly. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll warn you: I won\u2019t pity you just because you\u2019re pregnant.\u201d Rebecca bent her hips to show off her own enormous belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what\u2019s the name?\u201d the clerk said quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the information, Rebecca started to rush to the penthouses but hesitated to think. If Kim had left, she assumed Erin would already have the information on the take-over of PregTech and Wendy\u2019s grand plan. So Rebecca turned around and checked Erin\u2019s room number against the parking deck logs. Finding her limousine from the mall, Rebecca ran in and stopped the long black car just before it left the hotel grounds and punched her fist through the window. \u201cStop,\u201d she said in a low, threatening tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDana hit the break and lifted her hands. As a PreggoMall employee herself, she knew about Rebecca but she had never seen her like this. \u201cI-is there a problem?\u201d Dana asked. \u201cIs this about the belly rings malfunctioning yesterday? That gave me a hell of a problem\u2026though the orgasms were nice for a little while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word, Rebecca reached in to unlock the doors and opened them up in the back. Instead of finding a backseat packed with enormous swollen pregnant bellies, she saw Joel, Grant, Mara, and Grace. \u201cWho are you people?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sight of Rebecca\u2019s truly colossal belly, Joel was rendered speechless so Grant stepped in. \u201cWe\u2019re Brandon\u2019s friends. He said he won some sort of free limo service and to make up for ditching us, he was going to let us take it back to Smallton\u2026I mean Frejyaton.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you better pay for the damages to the car because we sure aren\u2019t,\u201d Mara said, huffing and crossing her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a scream of anger, Rebecca headed back to the hotel, storming up the stairs until she burst into the rooms registered to Erin. One was empty but she saw based on the carpet tread that there was a lot of traffic between the two of them. Rebecca showed a snarling predator\u2019s smile and broke through the door. \u201cErin! Where are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErin?\u201d Ashlee said, reclining on a large couch with Hayley in her arms. \u201cShe left a while ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you look pretty good too,\u201d Hayley said, stroking her finger around one of Ashlee\u2019s exposed nipples. \u201cWant to join in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca was huffing and puffing and her rage was about to boil over. But her sneering smile wasn\u2019t going away and she took a step toward both women. \u201cSure, I need to blow off some steam before I crack. But I\u2019ll warn you too: I\u2019m rough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe actresses cooed as Rebecca ran into their embrace, knocking over the sofa and making all three women writhe around on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Brandon\u2019s friends headed back to the city in the limo and Rebecca had the angriest sex in the world with Ashlee and Hayley, Brandon was shuddering as he drove Grant\u2019s car toward PreggoMall. In such a relatively cramped space, he was being touched by multiple bellies as Erin, Catalina, Kim, and Kristen all tried to fit inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t built all that comfortably,\u201d Erin groaned, constantly shifting in her seat, rubbing her belly and hips against Brandon in the process. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad our mall\u2019s pregnant car didn\u2019t work out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got our own design in the works,\u201d Catalina said. \u201cOops, I guess that\u2019s a corporate secret.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. We\u2019re all on the same team at this point,\u201d Kim said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll need to work together if this is going to be pulled off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith Kim here now, we\u2019re tied up in terms of amulets. Four-to-four,\u201d Erin said. \u201cBut at least we\u2019ve got Brandon and his master amulet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-right,\u201d Brandon said, still unsure how it all worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that\u2019ll put a big target on his back. Wendy\u2019s a crafty woman and she\u2019s not slowed down with a belly like the rest of us,\u201d Kim said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd Rebecca won\u2019t be fooled for long,\u201d Catalina said. \u201cSo much raw emotion\u2026she\u2019d make a charismatic actress, though she\u2019d be pretty hard to work with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFocus,\u201d Brandon yelped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying,\u201d Erin said with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was talking to myself,\u201d Brandon said weakly, feeling Erin\u2019s belly rub against his erection again and make him nearly drive off the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, as the remaining pregnant women planned inside the car, Wendy was plotting by herself, looking over the data she had. The acquisition of PregTech couldn\u2019t happen just yet, not before the others arrived at the mall. And she didn\u2019t want to take control before she had all the amulets anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s the real threat here?\u201d Wendy said to herself. \u201cErin, Sarah\u2026or Brandon?\u201d There was limited information on him, since he wasn\u2019t an inventor or CEO like the others, but he was a wild card and that made him even more dangerous to her plans. And there was the matter of his master amulet\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to wield the master amulet so quickly and spark the other amulets into action, he had to have a certain\u2026affinity for pregnant women. Wendy grinned and realized his obvious Achilles heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressing one finger to her intercom, Wendy called for one of her trusted assistants. \u201cGet me Ashley Page and her amulet. And gather the most attractive mall employees together for me.\u201d She cackled and touched one hand to her slowly growing belly. She didn\u2019t have the belly to stun him but with some round bombshells and the lust amulet in her corner\u2026she may just get what she wants.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once again Wendy grabbed the Preg Tech crew but this time she lead them towards the Preg Converter. The machine lay running, powered by the energy that the countless huge pregnant women produced. Bill, Wendy\u2019s lab partner sat in front of the machine, trying to understand one of the inventions that Sarah had made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, this looks kinda similar to that gun I used on you\u201d Bill said with a chuckle, looking straight at Sarah. \u201cBut does this thing work?\u201d He said pointing it at Sarah and pulling the trigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFfiizzzzzzzzzz<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing happened. He pointed it at Katie<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFffffiizzzzzzzzzzz<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain nothing. Wendy was getting tired of Bills testing, she had become impatient with the town, with how her old lover treated her and how today went. She walked over snatched the gun from Bills hand and said. \u201cLook, we've been friends since Antonio hired us ten years ago, but believe you me I cannot tell you what this does until it's hooked up!\u201d She said as she shoved the gun back in his chest. \u201cIf you do this today you can become the new head of Scientific Projects for this company okay?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm sure, I just need to detach some of the parts and connect it to a bridge in the conversion sub-processor , just give me five minutes.\u201d Bill said as he opened up the machines inner processing unit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah rolled slightly forward on her belly to get a closer look. Inside she saw one of the most beautifully set up pieces of machinery. Wires labeled and heading in every which way. The converter subprocessor itself was another matter. Bill had to put on gloves as he delicately interpreted Sarah\u2019s gender transformer into the machine. Unattaching the master suppressor he connected the new components. Before he could reattach the suppressor a harmful glow came from the machine. A flash of light came from within the machine!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZAP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill fell to he ground at in instant! His lab coat covering the barely conscious body. Wendy watched as he lay on the ground, with little a care of whether he would wake up or not. After a few minutes she decided to walk over and check on him. After a couple of light kicks a delicate hand came up and reached from within the large mans  lab coat. A petite woman came out dusting herself off and adjusting her glasses. The poor woman only had a massively large shirt and coat to cover herself with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god\u2026\u201d Bill said, looking down at her breasts and her slightly shapely butt. She almost screamed when she looked at her reflection! Wendy embraced Bill in her new form, cuddling the poor petite woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh please, don't get so dramatic\u2026\u201d Wendy said with a grin on her face \u201c can't you see how beautiful you are now?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill took another gander at her figure. \u201cWell, atleast I'm not pr-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on queue her belly, breasts and booty exploded in size. This wasn't a gradual growth like the previous transformations. Her once baggy clothes became stretch thin in micro seconds.  Bill was flabbergasted, all she could say was \u201c I won't think that again\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe patted \u2018Jill\u2019 on the back then pushed her out of the room. With her old lab assistant gone she waltzed back to her captives. \u201c don't worry my swelled up beauties, Your inventions have changed the world. Now whenever anyone comes within a 10 mile radius of Freyjaton, they will expected to be expecting!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing the sloth, envy and Greed amulets into the Preg converter she readied her hand over the ignition button. \u201cSSTTTOOPPPP!\u201d Sarah called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy sighed and groaned out an annoyed \u201c what?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c don't you realise if you push that button, you will begin the removal of a major part of our society.\u201d Sarah pleaded, trying to talk some sense into the woman. \u201c I know men suck, so many times they are idiots but we need them just as much as they need us. If you eliminate them from the gene pool, you will be destroying an entire culture, people won't see you as a revolutionary, they'll see you as an extremist! An exterminator of a male way of life! I admit, you have won Freyjaton but you have to admit there needs be a limit. Can you really look at yourself as you drastically change the lives of everyone in this town?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u201d Wendy answered as she pushed the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the pleasantly villainous halls of the Preggomall, men in press vans, government buildings, in homes, anywhere in a ten mile radius started writhing on the floor, completely unsure whether they were experiencing a pleasurable sensation or a painful one. Bodies morphed, changed in various sizes. In a matter of seconds their male forms had gone, every man at any age had instantly become a woman. Screams could be heard across the streets as new women surveyed their bodies, the adults between 18-50 had something more to come\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOffices started to shut down as pregnant belly after pregnant belly formed in the city. Breasts and butts ballooned out at an accelerated rate! Men across town were just coming to terms with what happened when their bellies ballooned out. Everyone in Freyjaton had become immobile from their sheer belly sizes and with no functional robo spines or belly rings in sight, it was going to be like that for a long time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust outside town a limousine was driving down a valley, heading straight for the city. Inside were Brandon's friends, sad that they couldn't spend another day at the con but confident that they could help their friend Brandon some how. Mara looked out on the city and was shocked to see what was going on. Smoke was starting to form in certain areas around town as anger and tension started to build up. There were sirens going off around the city from Policemen and the fire brigades, but sadly most of their workforce just changed sex and became incredibly pregnant, so no help there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to tell her friends but saw Joel and Grant become quite ill. \u201cWhat, the hell\u2026.\u201d Grant said as he looked at his beefy fingers grow and become delicate. As Grant\u2019s body became taller, Joel stayed the same height. He felt his manhood disappear as his short red hair grow into long curly locks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace who had remained silent gasped as she felt an all too familiar presence grow in her belly. One by one every woman in the car watched as their bellies grew. Grace was first, her belly filled with quadruplets. Grant came next as his German female body welcomed Quintuplets. Joel screamed seeing the bellies before him, I'm sorry, her. Her belly was the next to grow. She felt every last foetus swell inside of her, move around and kick. She couldn't stop screaming, everyone was freaking out. Then Mara waited, she knew she was next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d Mara sighed, \u201cJoel becomes pregnant and I'm still left like this?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDana the limo driver heard the commotion from the front side of the limo. She was so distracted by the commotion she didn't see the on coming car drive by another man just affected by the Preg Converter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrap!\u201d Dana shouted as she swerved out of on coming car. Panicking she tried her best to take control of the car. Gravel flew everywhere as the limo skidded towards a tree. \u201cHang on!\u201d Dana shouted as she gave it everything she got. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBang!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe back right side of the Limo hit the oak tree harshly. Mara woke up to see how everyone looked. Luckily enough everyone was safe, minus the current transformation that her friends had been in. whilst everyone else regained consciousness Mara walked outside to review the damage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking around she knew how everyone came out unscathed. The tree managed to demolish the right rear tyre and t right side of the boot. \u201cLooks like we aren't taking the limo home\u2026\u201d Mara said as she rested her backside on the car. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brandon had never concentrated on anything this much before. Driving back home he realised if he took one peek at the flesh heaven that was all around him, the car would crash in no time. The road  turned and twisted, every curve winding down the valley as large as the women he had sex with recently. His life was so pleasant before this, when he came home from Uni he knew he wanted to get away from a stress filled environment. Yeah right\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he drove ever closer to Freyjaton he came across the old Smallton sign. Slowing down Brandon saw a couple of the hottest Pregnant women he'd seen! Outside a broken down Limo they were clutching and running their pregnant bellies, that's when he saw Grace stuck in the side door  of the Limo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling over he knew he just had to help them and meet these two damsels in distress. Catalina became concerned as Brandon pulled the car over. \u201cWhat's going on?\u201d Kim asked, trying to look over her caramel breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI gotta go help some people I know\u201d Brandon answered closing the door. He walked right over to Grace whose belly and breasts were stuck in the door frame. \u201cI thought you hated being pregnant.\u201d Joked Brandon as he put his hand on the other door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBRANDON!\u201d Grace called out as her belly freed from the compact space. \u201cYou have to change me back.\u201d Brandon thought it was a simple enough request. Absorbing her massive pregnancy into his amulet was easy, Grace was happy to see her toes again. Sadly after a sigh of relief her centre of gravity reverted back to what it was before. In seconds the belly, breasts and butt were back to a massive size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you going to take the pregnancy or not?\u201d Grace furiously interrogated the poor man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did I swear!\u201d He said showing the amulet pulsating once again. This time it was fading between a deep red and a bright purple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it Brandon I can't stay like this!\u201d Grace pressed harder, she really hated the situation she was in. She looked over and saw poor Joel and Grant. She didn't know what on earth was happening, but the sooner she and Mara could change those two back, the better.  Mara walked over, seeing Brandon meant she could finally get some answers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Brandon, what's going on with this pregnancy epidemic, and why am I the only one not with child?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon didn't know what to say, so many people knew about the amulets, if she found out it might be the straw that broke the camels back.  He needed to change the subject, that's when he remembered the attractive ladies they were with. \u201cWho are the hotties you two are taking with you?\u201d Brandon said taking a quick peek over Graces shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose aren't- I mean you're the wild stud why don't you figure it out\u2026\u201d Answered Grace, giving him a little wink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon knew this was a grey area right now, he didn't want to get on Erin's bad side again, and he wanted to stay faithful, but a pregnant red head is a pregnant red head! Walking over Brandon made sure he wasn't in anyone's line of sight. Trying his best not to look seedy he took a deep breath in and asked \u201cExcuse me ladies, need any help?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant quickly spun around so quickly his belly knocked Brandon to the ground. Joel looked over and saw Brandon sitting on his chubby butt. He almost cracked up laughing but had a better idea. Going to Grant he whispered \u201cgo ahead, flirt with Brandon, let's see how deep he can dig himself\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon got back up and dusted himself off. Grant knowing the predicament he was in gave a girlish laugh and cutely said \u201coops, sorry honey, are you okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing that my washer and dryer can't fix\u201d Brandon replied, trying not to look down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAaawwww isn't he just the best?\u201d Grant said as she grabbed Brandon with her now large hands and brought her in for a bear hug. Brandon flew directly into Grants cleavage and massive belly. It was unbelievable, sinking into the three rosey and fleshy globes. Brandon let out a simple smile as he nuzzled them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Brandon didn't expect was Joel coming up behind him, and rubbing his giant belly against the unsuspecting Brandon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what do I call you two?\u201d Brandon asked, in half a daze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrant and Joel.\u201d Joel said, leaning in and whispering In Brandon's ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Brandon asked, not understanding what was going on. \u201cYou two can't be Grant and Joel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah? Look!\u201d Joel said as he lifted his left arm to reveal his Transformers Tattoo on the underside of his bicep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO, ERIN HELP!\u201d Brandon yelled out, weirded out by the fact he was in between his greasy geeky friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin waddled out of the car and up to the three of them in quite the compromising situation. \u201cBrandon\u2026 What's going on?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's Grant and Joel! They're women and they're being really weird!\u201d Brandon called out trying to get his arms free from underneath Grants massive breasts. Erin took a moment, it may have been the strangest concept, the two women were wearing men's clothes and knowing his friends Erin knew this is the type of shit they would pull on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay boys have fun.\u201d Erin said waddling back to the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT?!\u201d Brandon screamed, trying to squeeze his way out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know we're cool now, but I think this is the perfect punishment for objectifying pregnant women\u201d Erin said with a chuckle. \u201cI'll go talk to Mara.\u201d As much as she loved the poor sod, she found the predicament he was in to be most hilarious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst Brandon tried his best to contain his confused boner Erin waddled over to Erin, Dana and Grace. \u201cHey girls, how are you three handling everything?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it sucks we can't drive, but it seems as if no one is injured.\u201d Dana said looking out for Bruises on Mara. \u201c do you have any idea how we are going to get home?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I think There's little luck in getting any form of automobiles or trucks right now\u201d Erin said as she looked out on the large valley. \u201cOn the other hand my Country Club has its own helicopter, with plenty of pilots!\u201d Grabbing her phone she quickly dialled. After a few rings a feminine voice came from the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHello?\u201d Said the lady<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, may I please speak to Duke?\u201d Erin requested politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErin? It's Duke! Look, something has gone drastically disastrous at the club. I believe all the men have taken the same fate as you and your mother.\u201d Duke said thanking God he was over 50.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would explain the feminine voice\u201d Erin replied. \u201cLook I was wondering if anyone was able to take the helicopter over to the Smallton sign and pick up some people I know.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure that sounds simple enough, but I need to ask a favour from you in return.\u201d Duke said as he grabbed the right flying equipment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, make it later though okay? Just make sure they get back to the country club safe\u201d Erin said before hanging up. \u201cOkay, he'll be here in an hour or two, depending on fuel and stuff. He needs a copilot and measure how much he can carry.\u201d She couldn't help but look at Grace and Dana whilst saying that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin said her good byes and returned to Brandon. Grant and Joel had so much fun teasing their friend, plus with their added sizes they had tons of fun pretending to get all sexual with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on guys, You know I like pregnant women, but pregnant women who were once guys is just disturbing!\u201d Brandon cried before his head got shoved into Grants breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know as a former short guy it feels so satisfying to do this to someone else!\u201d Grant said as he brought Brandon up for air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay guys, let him go!\u201d Erin said standing there. Brandon who was out of energy barely made it out from between them and fell into Erin's embrace. Happy to be with Erin again Brandon playfully bounced Erin's breasts. After a minute or two he looked up to see Erin say \u201cyou finished?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a nod the two lovebirds kissed and went back into the car. <br>\r\n\u201cDude I hadn't had that much fun in ages!\u201d Grant happily said punching his fist in the air. He turned to his now petite friend who had his eyes fixated on Brandon. \u201cDude, you okay?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, uh yeah, haha that was wicked!\u201d Joel agreed absentmindedly trying to shake Brandon from his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Joel are you okay? I mean you liked pregnant women, then you were scared, now you ARE one! How are you handling all this?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel looked down at his sexy small yet very curvaceous body and let out a small sigh. \u201cYou know man, I think it was just a matter of getting perspective, you get me? After being scared of these pregnant ferociously intimidating beasts, I realise that I never viewed things from their perspective.\u201d Joel started to tear up at the thought of treaty Ashley wrong. \u201cOh god I was the real monster! And now my emotions are out of whack!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting in the car Brandon started driving again. After 15 minutes of slow arduous turns they finally drove into town. A look of curiosity formed on Brandon's face as he saw the chaos coming right towards them. Pregnant women furious at what had happened to them were looting and rioting in the streets.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The mall is that way\u201d Erin exclaimed as everyone held tight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, where all the amulets are, but I need the book that came WITH this amulet!\u201d Brandon said as he drove into his street. \u201cI tried reading it, but it was super boring. But I am almost certain that book holds some kind of key to all this mess!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon pulled up outside his place, remarkably unscathed from all the chaotic energy that had been within its walls lately. \u201cOkay everyone, take a room.\u201d Brandon said as the barely clothed women tumbled out of the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright ladies! Take a room each, we are going to find this thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy laughed as she took a gander at her tablet, displaying most sections of Freyjaton. Chaos ruled the streets wherever she tapped. She was having so much fun, she didn't realise the herd of angry ex male employees of the Preggomall that had rounded up behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Boss!\u201d One of the angry pregnant women furiously yelled. \u201cWhat the hell do you think you're doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy turned around, knowing exactly her predicament. She stood in front of the crowd as they slowly circled in. She knew only one way to deal with a group like this. She confidently stood with the Pregconveter to her back. There was no way she was backing down. Clearing her throat she looked out to the 40 angry women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMen, I understand what you are going through\u2026\u201d Wendy started as her eyes moved around the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo you don't!\u201d A random woman said in the crowd. Everyone started to grumble again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI SAID MEN!\u201d Wendy shouted into the audience. \u201c before you take me, I just want to tell you my motivations behind all this. I have met each and every one of you and I know where all of you come from.\u201d She stepped lightly, rubbing her 6 month bump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can't go and mention each and every one of you but I have reasons for why you should stick with being a pregnant female. If by the end of this, you feel the same way, I can change you back\u2026\u201d Wendy continued as she climbed on top of the machine for a better view<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirstly, Smallton was a town that was just getting by before all this, but today Freyjaton is a bustling city filled with tons of pregnant women! Your home is safe and as pregnant women you fit right in! You guys don't want to be the only men in a world filled with large bellied women, do you?\u201d A few mumbles could be heard from the audience. Wendy had to do more than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay secondly, you realise that we are facing an energy crisis, in the next fifty years we could destroy this planet if we stick to fossil fuels, and as scientists I'm sure you agree, you all know that this machine changes the babies into pure energy.\u201d More people agreed, but she knew she only had support of half the crowd. The retail staff would really need persuading. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c alright lastly, I know how much pregnancy and being a woman means to many of you. John, I know your wife couldn't have kids before this, now you are both pregnant and about to have a massive happy family!\u201d John nodded in agreement. \u201cWalter, you told me how many of the people in the store are trans, this must be an amazing moment for them.\u201d More people agreed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan't you see that this is the best out come for all of you? I realise you all have a lot to deal with but we at the Preggomall will compensate you for all your troubles!\u201d Every woman started applauding Wendy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy was very pleased by how well she managed to persuade the angry mob to be on her side. \u201cLet the cleansing begin\u2026\u201d She quietly said under her breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---- <br>\r\nRebecca collapsed in the hotel\u2019s halls. She had never had sex as wild as that. Rebecca tried to move her legs but her thighs were so raw she winced in pain every time they rubbed up against each other. Slowly she stood up and tried her best to walk down the hall. After three steps she collapsed on her belly again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, defeated, she saw a woman in a sci fi outfit. Becka lightly closed the door behind her, ready for a new day at Galacticon. \u201cDamn I wanted to say goodbye to Catalina\u2026\u201d Becka cursed before letting out a long sigh. Turning around she saw a poor Asian woman lying on her belly. \u201cOh, sorry about that, let me help you up.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecka waddled over and pulled Rebecca back up on her feet. Rebecca stood up and used Becka for support. \u201cExcuse me, did you say you knew a Catalina?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecka looked at the well dressed woman, thinking she could get more followers said \u201cyes, I'm friends with the actress Catalina Carazon, lucky me right?\u201d Placing a hand on her hip she shook her hair off to the side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh really? Maybe you can introduce her to me\u2026\u201d Rebecca said, wincing in pain as she took a step towards the pregnant cosplayer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually that's not a good idea\u2026\u201d Becka answered politely, taking a step back. Rebecca smiled, knowing she was ready to take another victim she grabbed Becka by the hand and spun her into a grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, I insist\u201d Rebecca cunningly said, an air of Determination to her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile at Branons place</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amazingly, the weight of several hugely pregnant women didn't upset the balance of Erin's personal helicopter and it was able to land on the street in Brandon's neighborhood. With every woman (and now, every man) growing at least three feet of pregnant belly in front of them, no one was driving up and down the small residential street and PreggoMall's pregnancy cars were solidly out of commission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon looked through his own bedroom, knowing that would be the mostly likely place to find the manual. When he first had the amulet, he looked it over and admired its unique dazzling design. But he couldn't maintain the focus necessary to understand how to control the amulet and open the world up to the banquet of pregnant sex he now enjoyed. Then again, if he had discovered its full and awesome power back when he first found it, everything happening now would have been totally different. Sarah would likely not have experimented with its powers, he would have impregnated several women besides Erin, and his two male best friends would definitely not be gorgeous pregnant women right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Find anything?\" Brandon heard Erin call out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing. How about you, Grant?\" Joel yelled. Brandon winced a little and poked his head out of his bedroom door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Grant? Joel? Can we maybe come up with some different names for you two?\" Brandon said as his friends slowly waddled toward him, neither one lucky enough to get a hold of a PregTech robospine before undergoing their significant transformations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joel is still kind of a feminine name. Maybe I'll just change it to Joelle,\" said Brandon's tall, pregnant friend who now had long, flowing ginger hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...the only feminine version I can think of is 'Grace' and that's kind of taken,\" Grant said with a pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If the rest of the town is like you two, I think a lot of women will have to double up on names,\" Catalina chuckled, stroking her middle as she passed by. She found it far more fun to eavesdrop than to work. And she was happy about the sudden sex change in the town. If there were no men, that meant no male actors. And if there were no more casting calls for male actors, her chances of getting more movie roles increased dramatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like Gwen,\" Mara said, leaning in and rubbing her former boyfriend's large pregnant belly. \"Gwen\" let out a coo and held Mara's hand over her swollen middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still want to be together? Even if I look like...this?\" Gwen said, motioning to her breasts, belly, and womanly hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I can get past it,\" Mara said with a wide smile. \"In fact, I'm a little jealous. You turned out to be a pretty hot woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Focus,\" Brandon said, getting a little flustered. He'd just wondered what it would be like if he was transformed into a pregnant woman and was more aroused than he cared to admit. \"We need to find that manual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Brandon? You may want to come downstairs,\" Kim called from the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You found it?\" Brandon said excitedly, darting down to the pregnant bombshell. He looked her over before noticing that her hands were empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I didn't find the manual but I did find something that was missing,\" Kim said, turning to Brandon as she pointed out the window. Brandon turned and gasped out loud. Walking up to the front door was Tanner Page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" Tanner mumbled as he stepped inside his house. \"Who are all you people? Kim, why are you so...huge? Brandon, what is going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I've gained a few extra fetuses since we last met,\" Kim chuckled, patting her tan stomach slowly. \"But don't worry. I won't pretend they're yours anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon trembled some. A lot had happened in the past days. He knew Tanner, the man who raised him as a father all his life, was in fact an adulterer and a financial criminal. Hell, Brandon learned that Tanner wasn't his biological father. But also knew Tanner had missed out on a whole lot of craziness in the city while in prison. But amidst all that torrent of insanity, the first thing that came to Brandon's mind was \"Why aren't you a pregnant woman?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanner looked at Brandon even more confused than he was previously and he already looked like he was in a waking nightmare. \"What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's take a step back: how did you get out of prison?\" Kim asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanner took a deep breath. \"The only people still in the prison after that mob of pregnant women came through were men. Then, suddenly, they all turned into women with enormous swollen bellies! It was like a horror movie.\" He shuddered, his aversion to pregnancy clearly still not worked out of his system. \"Since I was the only one not affected, the women running the place just shrugged and let me out. They said it's a new age in the city and there was no point in keeping me here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may have some answers,\" Mara called down from the second floor. She had the door open to Sarah's room and looked over all the inventions she had gathered in there. \"I'm guessing these sex changes are thanks to your sister. Well there's a ton of gadgets in here and they're all still pretty warm. Your dad may have been immunized from her weird experiments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes about as much sense as anything else going on now,\" Brandon sighed. He was about to call Tanner \"dad\" but stopped himself. He appreciated Tanner for raising him but he couldn't forgive him for the way he treated Ashley. \"Tanner, listen, a lot's happened recently but Ashley and Sarah and probably the whole city are in danger. We need to go help them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah? And Ashley?\" Tanner said. \"What's happened? I have to go save them.\" He saw Brandon's hesitancy and groaned. \"Look, I can tell you don't like me very much but they're still my wife and daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, she's with me now,\" Kim said, wiggling her eyebrows. \"And I don't think you want to know who else she's slept with recently.\" Brandon blushed, not wanting to give Tanner that sort of information just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Tanner, we need to find a manual I brought home when I bought this necklace,\" Brandon said, holding up his amulet to show Tanner, trying carefully not to touch it in the wrong spot and give everyone new pregnancies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that thing? I saw it laying around and thought it was paper trash. It's in the recycling in the garage,\" Tanner said. Brandon rushed out to dig it out from a pile of old newspapers. One good thing about the chaos in the city was it delayed trash collection. Opening it up, however, Brandon was less optimistic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">What's up, kid? Maybe you've heard of me by now: Yaral. Yeah, I get to rewrite the rules as I choose and I think your window of opportunity for reading this is closed. Not that I would have let you read anyway. But look, I do want to make some things sporting and you've already given me lots of chaotic energy to feed off of so I owe you one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere's what's going on: when the eight amulets are nice and warmed up with constant use (Nice job on that, by the way. We should work together more often), then they're ready to be rejoined. Once all the amulets are together, they can be fused back into one single master amulet. Whoever wears that has total control over pregnancy. And I mean total. And for kicks, I'll throw in the title of my emissary in your dimension. Cool, right? Anyway, now you now what you're getting yourself into. Have fun, kid.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon watched as the ink on the page slowly faded until the entire manual was just blank, white paper. With a nervous gulp, he went back to the living room where everyone was now gathered, stroking their bellies in silence. Except for Tanner, of course, who was as far away from a pregnant belly as he could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd it say?\" Erin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" Brandon said, choking out his lie. \"We just have to keep the same plan and save our friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And stop Wendy,\" Kim said with a nod. \"Okay, let's do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still coming along,\" Tanner said, his breathing a little heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Tanner, you should stay and rest,\" Brandon said. \"Being in jail so long clearly took a lot out of you. If you get some rest and still feel like coming along...then we'll see you at the mall. But be careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pff, 'be careful.' How tough can a bunch of pregnant sluts be?\" Tanner spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd be surprised,\" Erin murmured as she took Brandon's hand and the group left the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, we should come up with a cool action movie team name!\" Catalina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll leave that to you,\" Kim chuckled as they loaded into the helicopter.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>From her office on the top floor, Wendy looked out the window and saw the approaching helicopter carrying the mall's previous CEO, Erin, and several the amulets she needed to execute her plan. One hand lightly caressed her budding pregnant belly, largely hidden under her suit and shirt. When she saw all of her employees with their hulking stomachs, massaging their curves as babies, sometimes dozens of them, kicked inside them, Wendy sometimes got the urge to use the PreggoMall technology to advance her pregnancy and feel Antonio's child inside her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she wanted this pregnancy to be as detached from all that mystical nonsense as possible. Once she had the amulets, this would be the last naturally born human in the world as no corner of the globe would be free from her tendrils. From the busiest mega-city to the smallest, oldest village, everyone would be waddling slowly with a gigantic pregnancy, dependent on her products and hers alone. Wendy chuckled at the thought, even considering lowering the power of the new line of robo-spines so women would have to struggle more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe polish and Indian models Erin had originally initiated into the company hurried in, their clothes and hair disheveled from the orgy Sarah's virus kicked into motion. Wendy turned from the window and smiled at both women. \"Ola, Malati. Did you do what I asked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth women nodded and stroked their bellies, eyes fixated on Wendy. \"W-we did what you asked,\" Malati whimpered. \"Now can we...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes,\" Wendy said, lifting a small remote and pointing at both of them. Instantly, both women's bellies began to slowly swell until they were so big, they pushed each other away with their size. \"There. Five fetuses each for both of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\" Ola gasped as both women clumsily ran out, their hands fondling one another as they exited the doors. Wendy chuckled, glad that she had managed to find gravidophiles in her ranks. Erin may have hired both women but Wendy found a way to buy their loyalty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, time to spring the trap,\" Wendy said to herself, looking down as the helicopter landed and the women on-board slowly made their way off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;hr&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mall's doors were unlocked and open. Brandon didn't know why he expected any different. It was still an operating business, after all, and it wasn't like people could go to PregTech's shopping center to buy anything. Its employees were either locked up inside the mall or waddling with Brandon inside Wendy's headquarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's our actual plan?\" Joelle finally chimed in. \"I mean, maybe you all formulated something but me and Mara and Gwen are new to a lot of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, the city is weirdly quiet,\" Mara said. \"I guess we missed a lot at the convention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's for sure,\" Kim chuckled, one hand on her chest as she felt her greed amulet continuing to pulsate. \"I think our best option is to split up. Half of us try to find Sarah and the rest of the PregTech crew and free as many of them as we can. The other half should try to meet up with Wendy and strike some kind of a deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A deal?\" Erin repeated, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me. I've got the head of business,\" Kim smiled, her greed amulet filling her with plans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go on the rescue mission,\" Catalina volunteered. \"I want to take Joelle and Gwen too. They still have some of their strength from when they were men.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have training as a nurse so I should go with you,\" Grace nodded, stepping with Catalina's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll go with Kim to find Wendy,\" Erin said. \"Brandon, your amulet makes you kind of a wild card so you come with us. And Mara, maybe seeing a non-pregnant woman will throw Wendy off-guard. You come with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I guess so,\" Mara gulped. \"I don't even know who Wendy is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worry more about recognizing Rebecca,\" Erin and Kim said in unison, before Kim added. \"She's gotten a lot meaner since any of you met her so watch out. Hopefully she's still a few hours away in Charleston.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that plan in mind, both teams split up and hurried inside the mall. It was dead empty, which only made Brandon more nervous. As he jogged through, he heard a familiar voice calling his name. It belonged to Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brandon! Help!\" it was faint but as Brandon followed it, the voice got louder and louder. Soon, Brandon found himself inside the mall's famous pregnant spa and was separated from Erin and the rest of his team. But, inside, was Ashley, loosely tied to a chair, wearing nothing but enticing lingerie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hi Ashley,\" Brandon said, blushing a little. Ashley now had a belly that carried close to 100 babies and she had become even more buxom on top of it. Since she was sitting down, he couldn't see if her rear was rounder too but he had a good feeling about it. \"Glad I found you. I could hear your calls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I didn't say anything,\" Ashley whimpered, biting her lip. Even now, her lust amulet was glowing and sending energy through her body and it had been a long time since she saw the last man to have sex with her. She wanted to warn him but she also wanted him to jump into her arms and ride her like a stallion. \"Brandon, run,\" she slowly managed to get out. \"It's a...a...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think the word she's looking for is 'trap,'\" said Ola, closing the door to the spa behind her. Out from around corners and behind counters came all of the mall's pregnant models, all with cooing smiles on their face. \"Hello Brandon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hi,\" Brandon squeaked out. Everyone here was unbelievably gorgeous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're cute up close,\" Malati said, pressing her round stomach against Brandon. \"This doesn't just feel like a job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A job?\" Brandon said but Malati pressed her finger to his lips and shushed him. Other pregnant beauties came over and began to slowly undress Brandon, making sure no inch of skin was not in contact with one of their bellies, butts, or breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just relax,\" Ola said, moving to Ashley and undoing her straps. \"We're all here to have a good time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, I have to go,\" Brandon stammered. \"I-I have to stop Wendy from taking over the world!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, but doesn't her world seem more fun?\" Malati purred as she kissed Brandon on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Move,\" Ashley weakly said. The women continued to toy with Brandon so she sucked in a deep breath. \"Move!\" Ashley said with a roar. The pregnant models quickly darted away, differing to the colossal Ashley. Each waddling step shook the room as she got as close to Brandon as she could with her belly in the way. She shivered when she felt the tip of his erection touch her tight, round stomach. \"Do you remember the first time we had sex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Brandon yelped. \"How could I forget? It was amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley fondled her breasts, bouncing her glowing amulet around, before settling both hands on her belly. \"Then let's do it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon wanted to say no. He had to save Sarah and Katie and Janice and so many other women. He had the master amulet and all the responsibility was on him. And he was loyal to Erin now. But he couldn't resist. He bent down to start kissing Ashley's exposed navel. She moaned and repositioned herself so she was on top of him. With a groan, she lowered herself and let Brandon's erection enter her once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Brandon felt a tight clench and was stuck in place. \"Get ready! Hold on!\" Ashley bellowed. He did as he was told, tightly gripping her belly as Ashley stood up, holding Brandon suspended with her vagina. With a yell, Ashley ran at the door. Some of the models tried to stop her but it was like a bowling ball going through pins. Ashley charged past them, made it out the door, and headed into the mall plaza before she had to stop. Her muscles relaxed and Brandon fell to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how the hell did you do that?\" Brandon panted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been having a lot of sex lately,\" Ashley said with a wink. \"My muscles down there have gotten pretty handy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon sighed and looked around. \"I need to find Wendy's office. Do you know where it is?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Head for those elevators. The top offices need a password. It's 'Antonio,'\" Ashley said, pointing off in the distance. Brandon nodded but before he could get up, Ashley scooped him up in a big hug. \"I missed you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I missed you too,\" Brandon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Erin left the mall to go find you,\" Ashley said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon paused. \"She found me. We're...back together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you'd better not sleep with the next pregnant beauty you see,\" Ashley scolded him. She may not have been his biological mother but she could still impart some parental advice. \"Now go, hurry. Before I try to pin you under me again and finish what we started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon obliged, making a mental note to ask Erin about sex with Ashley at a future date.</span></div></div>",

Kim just smiled and kept walking with the others. Erin made it to the corporate elevator but found that the top floors were locked out from access. \"You don't happen to remember the code, do you?\" Mara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure do. I changed it when I took over to my favorite meal: an entire stock pot filled with spicy linguine,\" Erin said, typing in her complex password.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't spicy food induce contractions?\" Mara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin paused. \"When Brandon and I broke up and I took over, I wanted my pregnancy to be over and done with as soon as possible so I tried to speed things up. Not that it worked, clearly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...is it still your favorite food?\" Mara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. I have a different favorite food every hour,\" Erin chuckled before the keypad flashed red. \"Shit, password's not working. Wendy must have changed it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we have to take the other way up,\" Kim sighed. \"The stairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The stairs aren't locked out?\" Mara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a mall built for pregnant women. The stairs don't get a lot of use,\" Erin said with a sigh, stroking her belly as she waddled toward the nearest emergency stairwell. \"Ooh, the food court is totally abandoned to. It's like an all-you-can-eat buffet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Focus,\" Kim said, putting one hand on Erin's shoulder to redirect her to the stairwell. \"I know it's not going to be fun but let's make our way up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly both pregnant women struggled up the steps, their bellies jiggling with each labored move. Erin and Kim both kept one arm cupped under their bellies to help add support but the accompanying kicking from inside them only evened out the discomfort. Sweat dripped down their bodies and Kim took no time in stripping down to just her bra and underwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After I got...possessed or whatever, I found that I actually enjoyed wearing less,\" Kim said with a shrug when Erin and Mara questioned her clothing choice. Erin considered making the same decision to make things easier for herself but her belly was so large and it had pushed away so much of her clothing already, she doubted it would make much of a difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile both pregnant women tried to slowly ascend the steps, Mara was able to stay ahead of them easily. She was not in great shape but compared to Erin and Kim, she was as light as a feather. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, all three made it to the top and entered Wendy's office, where she seemed to be waiting for them. \"Hello everyone,\" Wendy said with a smile. Brandon wasn't with them so Wendy assumed her trap to use recordings of Ashley's voice to guide him to the spa worked. \"You seem winded. Can I get you something to drink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but some food would be great,\" Erin panted, wiping her brow with one hand before resting it back on her bare belly. \"I love to talk business over a dinner meeting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have my personal chefs start right on that. It's the least I can do for you since this will mark the end of your time in PreggoMall,\" Wendy said, tapping her computer to send an email. \"But Kim, I didn't expect to see you back so soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sent Rebecca after us so you must have had some suspicions,\" Kim mused, stroking the side of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some,\" Wendy agreed with a smile, walking toward them and eyeing their bellies. Finally, Wendy stopped on Mara. \"And who might you be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mara,\" she said, not used to Wendy's terrifying aura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't get the memo?\" Wendy said, unbuttoning her blouse to show her curved stomach. \"All my guests were supposed to be pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm infertile. Result of a surgery I had when I was little,\" Mara replied with a gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to hear that. Would you like me to correct that?\" Wendy said, lifting the remote she'd been using to add to women's pregnancies. \"It's very easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thank you,\" Mara said. \"My boyfriend...now girlfriend...is really pregnant now and I think she needs my help getting around. But maybe later...I would consider it. Everyone seems to be having fun being pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see?\" Wendy said, turning to Erin with a grin. \"I'm making people's lives better. This company should remain with me, and while we're at it, PregTech should remain with me too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about that,\" Erin said. \"Maybe Sarah should get control of PregTech. Competition in business is always good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't about business anymore,\" Wendy said. \"It's about changing this world inside out. And I'm going to stand at the top of it all.\" She placed her hand on her now exposed belly. \"With my daughter by my side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must be hard, all that pressure,\" Kim said, slowly walking up to Wendy until their bellies touched. \"Maybe you should divide your tasks and delegate responsibility.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you have in mind?\" Wendy said, raising one eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about letting me run the operations here at the mall?\" Kim smiled. \"After all, I get the job done. I brought you Erin, didn't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin's face lost all color. \"Kim...you betrayed me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I go where the money is,\" Kim chuckled, her greed amulet glowing brightly. \"Now, Wendy, would you like to know where everyone else is headed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an idea,\" Wendy said, turning on a video screen on the wall. Catalina, Grace, Joelle, and Gwen were waddling around near the basement. \"Getting awfully close to our power supply. Though I don't recognize most of these women.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two of them used to be men, thanks to you,\" Mara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. Quite an improvement, I'd say,\" Wendy laughed. \"Let's watch a little of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown near the basement, Catalina skulked around as Grace, Joelle, and Gwen slowly moved, huddling together. \"Where exactly are we?\" Grace asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The mall has secret compartments beneath the main plaza. When I worked here, I heard about some of them. If they've hidden away Sarah and the rest, this is where they'd be,\" Catalina answered. \"Come on, let's move quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy for you to say,\" Gwen grumbled, patting her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina rolled her eyes. \"I'm bigger than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...right,\" Gwen said, noting the difference in the size of their pregnancies. Joelle noticed it to and made a mental note to find ways to get bigger. Grace, on the other hand, was fine where she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDescending one more level, Catalina saw a long hallway, lined with dozens of solid metal doors. They all peeked inside and gasped when they saw pregnant women inside, with cords hooked up to their navels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Janice is in this one!\" Joelle yelled, banging on one door. All four hurried over and opened the cell, where Janice and Katie were both laying naked. They unhooked them and both women cooed and started to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...who are you?\" Janice said slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...a long story,\" Joelle said. \"But I'm Joel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joel? You mean...\" Janice noticed Joelle ginger hair and height and gasped. \"Sarah turned Tony into Tonya...so you really are Joel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still going by that name, sorta,\" Joelle chuckled. \"And this is Gwen, formerly Grant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there,\" Katie finally said, looking both women up and down. She'd met them a few times. Katie wondered, since neither were especially handsome men before and they were gorgeous pregnant women now...what would happen if this sex-change technology were used on a seriously hot guy? Katie had never gotten so turned on by the idea of an attractive man before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have lots of other things to tell you but we'd better move quickly now,\" Grace said. \"Do you know where Sarah is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have the answer to that,\" a woman's voice said. They poked their heads out of the cell and saw a small army of pregnant women in torn clothing. The one in front had on a lab coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh,\" Gwen quietly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina noticed the name tag on the lab coat. \"Bill?\" she asked, remembering him from her time at the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I go by Jill now. And I think you should all come with me,\" Jill said with a grin. \"As for Joelle and Gwen, I've wanted to do some tests on a transformed pregnant woman for a while now but I didn't want to work on my coworkers. But you two should do nicely.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brandon walked around the mall, his amulet in one hand and the book in the other. He knew at this was the only way that \u201cYaral\u201d would talk to him and if he was going to make any final decisions, he could use the book to his advantage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snuck past a couple of pregnant looters, grabbing some baby wears and things, head he lurked deeper into the Preggomall mall he made his way onto the next floor, hearing footsteps behind him. Brandon needed to find a way to get up to Wendy's office, but he had no idea where said office was! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking through the book he tried to see if there were any other pieces of information, but there was nothing. Frustrated with his time and effort put to waste he slammed the book shut. Looking at the cover he saw a large pregnant belly with the amulet at the centre. He carried on, not realising the noise that he caused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn assassin like Rebecca had always learned to tread lightly, it was what made her so great at executing plans. The assassination of Captain Mel Matthau, the theft of masterpiece known as \u201cfruitful life\u201d, the Green Pike Offensive were some of her famous missions. Now she was hunting down some chubby engineer to claim an ancient artifact. \u201cMy talents are wasted here\u201d Rebecca thought to herself \u201cbut if everything goes as planned, the payoff will be incredible.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lurked behind her pray, her pregnant belly was quite the hinderance, she had to delicately manoeuvre around the damage that everyone had left in the wake of the riots. With power low in the mall, she knew what the excess power was being used for alas it was hard for any ordinary man to see. Slowly she stalked her pray, the unsuspecting Brandon on his exploration of the Preggomall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking a turn just past the place he took Ashley and Sarah to for maternity wear, Brandon found himself at a dead end. \u201cDamn it\u201d he cursed under his breath. Looking around he saw some building equipment, machines used to help expand the mall itself.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind Rebecca lurched over shatter potted plants and broken cords. Her pace quickening, a grin forming as she knew Brandon was all hers. The unsuspecting victim was ready to turn around, not knowing his impending doom. Seconds felt so much longer as Rebecca made every one count. Using her strong toned legs she leapt into the air, ready to take down the last threat in her goal of victory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon felt a cold breeze flow past the back of his neck, he turned around to see what it was, but regretted it. Rebecca came crashing down on him, damaging the floor tiles in progress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooowww\u2026\u201d Brandon winced out, his hazey vision introducing himself to the Asian assassin. \u201cOkay who the\u2026 Devil are you\u2026?\u201d Brandon asked, feeling the full extent of Rebecca's massive 70. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you don't need to know about me\u2026\u201d Rebecca said as she punched Brandon in the face. \u201c I just need to take your sorry ass to my boss\u201d she hit Brandon once again, delighted she finally got her job done. She got up picked Brandon with one hand and dragged him to the elevator<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTechnically this was good for Brandon, but bad for the situation was in. As soon as he went up to face Wendy, he would lose his book, his amulet and whatever spell was happening to Freyjaton, would happen to him too. \u201cSo you're gunna carry me, an adult male, whilst  carrying everyone else over to your boss?\u201d Brandon asked as he looked around for things he could escape with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up\u2026\u201d Rebecca said, kicking her prisoner before pressing the elevator button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I guess whilst my friends free the rest of Pregtech, you will just be happy dealing with me.\u201d Brandon pursuaded a little further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSilence!\u201d Rebecca shouted, twisting Brandons arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw,ow ow\u2026 Okay I just thought an impressive woman like yourself would want anything tarnishing your career, I mean look at the fashionable stealth suit!\u201d Brandon continued, getting ready for whatever Rebecca did next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe asian assassin stood there for a moment, she could keep Brandon tied up with current prisoner, then come back and take him to custody. Grabbing her walkie talkie she asked \u201cBill, is there any disruption going on down there in the lab?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirstly, it's Jill\u201d Jill said on the other said from he other side of the line. \u201cSecondly yes we just caught some intruders.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, wait do any of them have any odd jewellery on them?\u201d Rebecca asked, a hint of concern in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot that I know of\u2026\u201d Jill said as she looked over the her captives, \u201cno wait, I can see one.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201coh god they won't stand a chance\u2026\u201d Rebecca said as she put Brandon in the sleeper hold and took him to the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy, Erin, Mara and Kim waddled (or in Maras case, walked) into the massive lab under the mall. As they entered they saw Janice, Tonya, Katie and Sarah dealing with their new roles, as women attached to giant bellies filled with energy. Walls started to close down as the basement started looking more like a hangar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never wanted it to turn out like this\u2026\u201d Erin sadly said. Sure she wanted revenge here and there, she hated herself for a long time, but she never wanted this much chaos to ensue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome now, you've helped start the new world!\u201d Wendy said with a laugh. \u201cSure Antonio is the one who had the plan to rule the world, but he never liked pregnant women. Now, I will be an Empress to a world in my favourite image!\u201d She tapped her iPad and the largest wall of the centre dispersed. \u201cWelcome to my end game.\u201d Wendy said as she revealed a massive satellite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is what will take my domination from some inland city, to a global event. One beautiful pregnant woman will take control of the satalite and pilot across the USA and around the world, powering the Preg-tator they will change city after city, changing their populations to entirely pregnant women!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, that's great and all but aren't satellites supposed to have solar panels?\u201d Kim asked looking at the huge thing that lay infront of them. \u201cIs that what helps them stay up there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's where the beauty of this all comes into play!\u201d Wendy happily answered, the look of madness in her eyes growing. \u201cIt turns out I can't use solar power to convert the worlds populous, I need an energy store on the inside.\u201d Walking over she picked up some of the inventions that the Preggomall actually made. Wendy couldn't decide what to pick up, that's when she saw the mask that was used on Sarah and Janice to erase certain memories. \u201cGuards, hold Erin for me\u201d Wendy said as she placed the mask on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Erin could react, two guards came up behind her and grabbed her by her arms. \u201cLet go of me!\u201d Erin screamed as she struggled to break free. As the now Ex-CEO of Preggomall struggled and squirmed Wendy tried to figure out what the best way to make Erin work for her. She knew she couldn't remove any knowledge about the Preggomall or about the amulets, because then she wouldn\u2019t be able to navigate the satalite<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin was best focused when she hated that Brandon fellow that made all those visits to the mall, but then again any memory of him would cause the buxom red head to stop working on the satellite. Realising what she needed to do she put the mask on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Erin\u2026\u201d Wendy said turning around to face her victim. \u201cYou remember this, you used it on Sarah some time ago. Now you are going to forget everything you know about Brandon Page\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, please, not that ANYTHING BUT THAT!\u201d Erin screamed trying to look away. As much as she tried to look away the gaze of the mask was just too much. Her eyes, head and mind felt heavy as she began to forget everything about her love. She forgot the love they made for the first time, arguments they had, the times Brandon helped her out. Everything gone, dispersed from the mind\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kim walked with Wendy as Mara tried to talk to Erin. Forgetting every little detail of Brandon, Erin  had become fixated on learning everything that made the satellite run. \u201cHow did you make all of this happen within a week?\u201d Kim asked, trying to understand the logic behind everything that happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Kim you have still got so much to learn, these amulets have dilated the existence of time around us\u201d looking at Kim she realised she needed an example. \u201cnow let's say Brandon got his amulet on a Wednesday afternoon and now it's Saturday night the next week, well over those 11 days things have happened in a ludicrous pace, building a satellite, research, maintaining a growing business with tons of products and growing a city takes time. Hell pregnancy itself takes nine months to happen.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Wendy continued to talk as she went back to her throne. \u201cOnce the amulets are brought back together, the amulets will expand the past 11 days into let's say nine months, thus reverting time to its normal non chaotic self. But if I keep one of those amulets somewhere far away, then I can speed up the whole process of converting the worlds\u2019 populous to pregnant women.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women sat down at their respective places. \u201cNow, should we see who else is trying to disrupt my future empire?\u201d Wendy asked as she brought up the security app on her tablet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon awoke woozily, woken up by a loud rumbling sound. He took in his surroundings , being tied up in a chair he looked around. He could feel a giant weight was behind him, so there was no chance of trying to destroy the chair. He  tried to shake his hands free from behind his back but stopped when he felt a soft supple backside behind him. \u201cHey, who\u2019s there?\u201d Brandon questioned, failing to look over his shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait I know that voice.\u201d The fellow trapped woman said from behind him. \u201cWere you at Galacti-con yesterday?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess Becka?\u201d Brandon asked, thinking why on earth she would be here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, seeing as how I'm not in costume, just call me Becka.\u201d Becka answered, sighing as she looked down on the bra that barely covered her breasts and the pyjama bottoms that were skin tight. \u201cHow on earth are we going to get out of here?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon had an idea, he knew Becka was pregnant, even if she had been turned back she would have reverted to a pregnant body because of the affect Wendy was using on the land. If she shrunk down a couple of sizes the rope would be free enough for her to escape and free Brandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the amulet Brandon inhaled as he tried to focus his magic on reducing Becka\u2019s size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried again! Nope<br>\r\nFrustrated with the amulet he silently cursed at it. Becka turned around, hearing some kind of commotion. \u201c are you okay?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, just dealing a with a snotty second rate piece of junk!\u201d Brandon said before being zapped by the ancient piece of jewellery. \u201cOw damn it!\u201d .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealising that shrinking wouldn't work, he realised that if Beckas belly expanded, it could break the rope! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocusing his hardest on the amulet again, he heard that oh too familiar sound like a balloon being blown to bursting point. \u201cOooh, owwww Brandon why are you doing this?\u201d Becka moaned in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA low stretching sound could be heard coming from the ropes, it was working! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSNAP! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rope came undone! Bringing her hands over her head Becka chewed the knot, freed herself and started working on Brandon\u2019s situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce free the two geeks ran into the mall, skulking between shadows. They found their way into the basement, an early feeling coming over them as they enter. It felt like hundreds of people had recently left the huge area. Brandon and Becka searched all over, looking around for the Catalina, Grace, Joelle and Gwen. \u201cGuys, can you hear me?\u201d Brandon tried to quietly call out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard a few strange noises coming from beneath them. Grabbing his phone he used the phones light ability to find a way to get He could easily fit in, but there was no chance Becka could make it. \u201cHere, let's exchange numbers, call me and we can communicate whilst this all happens.\u201d Brandon told the cosplayer as he told her his phone number. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Brandon, it's going to suck being here all on my own, but why do I need to call you? Do you know what that'll do to my phones call plan?\u201d Becka asked annoyingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, nows not the the time to argue about petty things like this!\u201d Brandon answered, his frustration growing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you get to go exploring whilst I wait up here, waiting for trouble to come to me? No you call me!!\u201d Becka angrily argued. \u201cIf I call you, the noise could alert guards to your position.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did have a point, there was a series of controls around the hangar that could tamper with things in the lab. If he called her, they could work together in sabotaging the laboratory. Grumbling Brandon took down her number and took off. Crawling rough the ventilation shaft was something that Brandon wanted to do, even Though the space was tight, he could quite manage to make his way through to the other parts of the lab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came to a spot where he could slide down to the next floor. Ungracefully he slid down, yelling as he quickly picked up speed. He hit the bottom hard, breaking part of the shaft in the process. Peering through the damaged hole, he noticed he was in a utility closet. <br>\r\n\u201cHey, did you hear that?\u201d A voice came from the neighbouring room. Brandon moved quickly away from the hole as he heard footsteps pacing quickly to the closet. With a flick of the switch two pregnant women waddled in. After realising there was nothing in the room they walked out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he scuttled back, Brandon decided to check out what was happening in the next room. Moving backwards he could peer into the next room. It was a medical lab, with two giant chambers, with Joelle and Gwen inside. Everyone crowded around as Jill flipped a switch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god, it's happening again!\u201d Gwen screamed as she dropped to the ground, clutching her belly. Joelle moaned as she fell flat on her arse. The two females slowly lost their pregnant bodies, becoming just female versions of themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Sally insert formula M\u201d Jill said as several scientists applauded the successful test. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady scientist grabbed a big bottle and hooked it up to one of the cords. A weird lime green gas shrouded Joelle and Gwen. Slowly they morphed back to their male selves, happy to see their bodies returned to normal. Their happiness vanished when the test chambers were opened. Joel and Grant rapidly switched genders and swelled out again. The whole experience was incredible to the two poor victims. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDear God, I can feel my Insides spinning!\u201d Joelle said, gasping for air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, look on the bright side, everyone knows you're circumcised now!\u201d Gwen chuckled before cowering over as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Jill waddled over and looked over the chambers. \u201cNo damage\u2026 Okay time for round two!\u201d Jill commanded as she prepared the experiment again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon had to keep moving, he squeezed through the vent and freed himself in the next room. Running out of he empty lab he found himself running down a hall. Running along he called up Becka. \u201cBecka, can you find some way to switch off all the power?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh, sure\u2026\u201d She said as she ran over to the controls<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon was too busy trying to communicate that he didn't realise who he was about to run into. Kim waddled around the corner only to have Brandon run into her. Kim moaned as she felt Brandon brush up against her sensitive nipples. It had been some time since a man touched her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, have you seen Erin?\u201d Brandon asked, catching his breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes right this way.\u201d Kim said as she lead Brandon into Wendy's office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy looked down on her belly, smiling as she gave it a motherly rub. Hearing a knock on the door she happily answered \u201ccome in\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim brought Brandon inside, who was surprised to see an absence of his lover. \u201cWho are- you're Wendy aren't you?\u201d Brandon said, realising who was standing before him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's right, and you're Brandon! By the looks of things were both good at guessing games\u201d Wendy answered mockingly. Standing up she and Kim walked over and sat down at the lovely couches provided. Brandon wanted to know why Kim was being all chummy with Wendy but one question plagued him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is Erin?\u201d Brandon sternly asked walking up to the business woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don't you take a seat\u201d Wendy replied, patting the spare spot next to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is she?\u201d Brandon asked again, her patience dwindling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine\u2026 I'll tell you.\u201d Wendy answered, turning over to the man. \u201cI have a satellite that can transform the worlds population into pregnant women. This is a machine that will make me the most powerful woman everywhere! You my sorry young man will be one of the last men on earth and will become my personal pet, now yes you \u2018could\u2019 stop me, I have just told you my master plan, but here's where you're wrong. I just launched the satellite, with your lovebird Erin, into space.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had been a smoker before being transformed into an enormous pregnant woman and still had a lingering urge to step out for a cigarette. Somehow, she didn't think Wendy would allow that. Note to self: see if Wendy will give me the resources to work on a more effective method to quit tobacco, Jill thought as she watched Gwen and Joelle panting in their cells. Both women seemed worn out by the process of quickly shifting between their original male physiology and their current, and seemingly permanent, excessively pregnant female bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had hoped to find a way to turn herself back into Bill but her research appeared fruitless. No matter her attempts to reverse the process, whatever Wendy did wasn't going to turn back unless possibly Wendy herself wanted it to. And that was as unlikely as her allowing her pregnant employees to smoke on the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed a distraction. \"Let's see if we can corner the market on cosmetic surgery,\" Jill said with a growing smile, slinking up to the control panel. With a few taps and changes to some chemical formulas, two new mists filled the cells Gwen and Joelle were held in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great, not again,\" Gwen grumbled. Her hands went down to her hips, prepared for them to shift back into their slimmer, more muscular male form. But instead, she felt nothing. \"Huh. Do you feel any different, Joelle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-a little,\" Joelle moaned, hands on her waist as well. \"My hips feel funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you're finally going to be Joel again,\" Gwen sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, it's not that! They're getting wider!\" Joelle whined, her hands moving to her rear. \"No, not wider! Firmer!\" She waddled around and Gwen could see his best friend's butt start to expand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that same moment, Gwen saw that her field of vision was getting even more compromised than usual. Her breasts were swelling at an alarming rate. Both women squealed with confusion as selective parts of their pregnant bodies grew. In no time, Joelle was struggling to balance with a butt that looked like it was housing quadruplets and Gwen's chest was so large, she couldn't even see her enormous pregnant belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill laughed wildly, hands wrapped around her own maternal stomach. \"Wonderful! Something about these two make them hilarious guinea pigs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, back in her office, Wendy was smiling as she watched Brandon's horrified expression. \"Yes, the former CEO of PreggoMall, and as I understand it, your former lover, now making her way into the upper atmosphere as we speak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you're out of your mind,\" Brandon managed to mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come now. You of all people must be excited by the prospect of a world populated by only pregnant women,\" Wendy chuckled, rubbing one knee against his erection. Brandon blushed and staggered away from her. \"You'll get used to it. And you don't want Erin as a distraction anyway. You will be serving me from now on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what, I'll be your sex slave or something?\" Brandon spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing that crude. I can think of many other ways for your to amuse me,\" Wendy laughed, one hand rubbing her barely visible pregnant belly. Brandon's shock was giving way to anger and her constant berating was helping to push him over the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I find a way to stop you, you had better hope Erin is alright,\" Brandon growled, stepping toward Wendy. \"Because I don't care if you are pregnant, I will use my amulet and every resource Sarah has at PregTech to make you pay.\" He placed one hand against Wendy's small belly and locked eyes with her. \"Maybe I'll see if there's a limit to just how big I can make someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as Brandon tried to finish his threat, Wendy was already midway through a massive slap to the face that knocked Brandon back a few steps. Her cold, menacing demeanor was now disheveled and furious as she held both hands over her stomach. \"How dare you touch my womb!\" Wendy screamed. \"You, a commoner, corrupted by that chaotic magic! I am carrying the child of Antonio Greene and the next ruler of this world after me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim grabbed Brandon's arms and held him in place. \"Easy there, kid,\" she whispered in his ear, giving it a soft kiss. \"Time to pay for your mistakes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy walked up to Brandon, still fuming. \"I was going to keep you up here to watch the whole plan unfold but you don't deserve it.\" She reached around his neck and pulled off the master amulet, holding it aloft. \"And I'll take this. Throw him in a cell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim passed Brandon off to some other mall employees and had him send down to the mall's dungeon. In the past, Brandon thought he could use the charisma the amulet let him exert over pregnant woman to get his way out of things but losing the amulet around his neck seemed to rob him of that power. Once in the dungeon, Jill caught sight of him and hurried over. \"Please, let me run a few experiments on him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Orders from Wendy were just to lock him up,\" one of the models said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, just a little. He'll still be kept in a cell,\" Jill pleaded. The models obliged and handed Brandon over and Jill quickly had him stripped and thrown into one of the same clear rooms she'd used to observe Gwen and Joelle. \"Look at you...the last man in Freyjaton.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon didn't want to let them know Tanner was still out there. \"Yeah, what of it? You want to use me to make a cure for what happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no cure but I can at least see if there's a way to make you like us,\" Jill sneered. \"Seeing you be free from our fate just makes me sick.\" She hit a button and the same pregnancy transformation ray washed over Brandon. He felt a little uneasy but he wasn't changing. \"Increase power...more...more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Brandon fell to his knees, trembling all over. He looked down at himself and saw his body hair fading and his waist expanding. Before his eyes, he grew an enormous pregnant belly, bigger than any he had seen since the amulet fell into his possession. He stood up slowly, looking himself over, and feeling kicks inside his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did it! It works!\" Jill cheered, but then suddenly, Brandon's body reverted back to his male form. \"Damn, it's the same as those other two. He'll just fluctuate back and forth until it gets out of his system...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do with, uh, him? Her?\" another scientist said, looking at Brandon halfway between transformations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Throw him in one of the other cells with one of the others we caught,\" Jill sighed, turning away. \"I'm done for the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon was led away, waddling to keep up as he was in the process of sporting a big belly again, and thrown into a holding cell. Inside, looking at her pregnant cellmate with a weak smile, was Katie. \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-Brandon,\" he groaned as his belly and breasts shrank back down and his genitals returned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brandon?\" Katie yelled with shock when she saw him turn back into himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I thought Catalina was going to free you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tried and failed. Gwen and Joelle got snatched and me and Janice are back in chains,\" Katie said, still wide-eyed. \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They...did something to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They sure did,\" Katie said with a blush, looking him over. \"So it just keeps...going back and forth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but they think it'll stop eventually,\" Brandon groaned as he became fully male again. \"Oh god, I can feel it starting up again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie gulped and scooted across the cell floor, touching one hand to Brandon's growing belly. \"This is very confusing for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" Brandon said, turning to Katie and giving her a pained smile. \"I look pretty good as a pregnant woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie licked her lips, feeling her mouth getting dry, and started to rub her thigh against Brandon. \"I've never had sex with a man before but I think this is as close as I'll ever come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what do you mean?\" Brandon said, his voice changing as his body began to swell again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like pregnant women, you like pregnant women, let's just make this happen,\" Katie said, getting up and trying to position herself for Brandon to penetrate her. \"This whole 'energy conversion' thing leaves us pretty horny but still be easy. I've never done this before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon looked down at his belly as it died down and felt the tip of his erection sprout back out and tickle the bottom of his belly as it retreated. \"You know, I never have either. But Erin...\" He paused. Erin was on her way to space. \"Erin would never believe this.\" He thrust his erection inside Katie, who gasped loudly upon entry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two clumsily pumped against one another, his occasional belly getting in the way at times. Whenever his belly grew to its full size, Katie would lick and suck on it with gusto, making Brandon feel a wave of sensations. If his penis was gone, he would focus on letting Katie bury her face against his belly and breasts, then when it grew back, he went back to thrusting deep inside the small pregnancy lover. Eventually, Brandon came and she slid off of him. \"H-how was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird,\" Katie panted. \"I-I might give you another go some day...if we ever get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I actually wanted Erin to have sex with you and let me watch,\" Brandon chuckled as he slid down, feeling his transformation cycle finally ending as he returned to being fully and permanently male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you can join in, how about that?\" Katie laughed, stroking her belly as she looked back at Brandon. He was scratching his ear and felt something rub against it. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure,\" Brandon said, picking his ear and feeling a small gem fall out. It was one of the gems from the amulets, and based on the color, it was from Kim's. \"But I hope you hold up your end of the bargain because we may have a way out of here after all.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brandon rolled the gem around in his hand, feeling the small familiar tingles of power from when he used his own amulet. \"You're already up?\" Katie murmured, her fingers tracing circles on the top of her belly as she let the ripples of orgasmic pleasure continue to spread throughout her massive pregnant body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm trying to figure something out,\" Brandon said, looking out of the small window in his cell. There weren't many guards or scientists down here so he needed to make his opportunity count when it arrived. He was also nervous because he wasn't sure how this small gem would work compared to the amulet he once wielded with such ease. It was too risky to not at least practice. \"Do you mind if I try something?\" he asked, turning to Katie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depends on what,\" Katie said, groaning and trying to get back up to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon gulped. \"I want to see if I can use this gem to make you more pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie chuckled, patting the sides of her enormous stomach and rubbing the front in slow, sensual strokes. \"Buddy, you can try that out as many times as you'd like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon nodded and focused, trying to remember how he'd felt when he used the amulet before. He weakly gestured the gem toward Katie and stared at her belly, trying to imagine it expanding outward. And while Katie was already colossal, she was not getting any larger. \"It's not working,\" Brandon grimaced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just focus. You kicked everything off with that amulet of yours so you must have some sort of knack at this,\" Katie said. \"You're like me: you love pregnant bellies. Just think about me gently growing outward, caressing my fertile curves with one hand while I feel kicking stirring inside me. Think of all of us growing: Erin, Sarah, Catalina, Janice, Ashley, Kim...oof, I'm starting to turn myself on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie's words got to Brandon and he felt his passion flowing through his fingers and into the gem. Slowly, Katie's belly began to lurch forward and the previously quiet, coy clothing seller gasped as she clutched her swelling middle. \"T-there,\" Brandon sighed, dropping his arm. \"It was only a few babies but...I managed to pull it off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bigger's always better,\" Katie giggled, rubbing her belly. \"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can tell...there isn't much left in this gem. It needs to get back to its amulet,\" Brandon panted, looking out of his cell door as a model-turned-guard waddled up to it. \"But it may be enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOla, the Polish model Erin hired in what seemed like another era, opened the cell. \"Wendy wants you to return to her office,\" she said before looking Brandon and Katie over and smirking. \"Got a bit frisky in there, did you? They told me you don't fuck with men.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made an exception,\" Katie snickered. \"Besides, he did me a favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He helped me escape,\" Katie said as Brandon lifted the gem. It glowed brightly and Ola gasped as her pregnant belly jerked forward. She was much smaller than Katie so any addition was more pronounced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Boze! Tak!\" Ola squealed, her tongue lapping out and her hand stroking her larger stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess she liked it,\" Katie laughed. With her distracted attention, Brandon was able to duck past her and leave the cell. As she tried to catch him and reach for a radio at the same time, Katie's jumbo pregnancy flattened her and she was easily rolled into the cell in their place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon shut the door, locking it, as he looked down the halls. \"Okay, now let's find everyone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shame. She was really hot,\" Katie sighed, looking back at Ola pounding on the cell door. She waddled after Brandon, both still totally naked. \"So how did you get that gem anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly sure,\" Brandon said, remembering Kim's kiss on the cheek and how close she got to his ear before he found the gem in there. \"But something tells me we still have someone on our side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in Wendy's office, Kim was pacing around slowly, looking over the control panel on a far table. \"So this satellite can really convert the entire planet's population to pregnant women?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will take some time but yes,\" Wendy nodded. \"We could take my approach and work city-by-city but that would take even longer. No, this is the best way to kick off my plan for global domination.\" She touched one hand to her stomach and looked down at her personal computer. \"Why, the entire country should be converted by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Genius,\" Kim said, tapping a few keys on the control panel. \"So, any idea what your first act as Empress or Queen will be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy laughed. \"Oh those titles are a bit silly, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose it's the beginning of a new age in humanity. We can have better ranks,\" Kim smiled and nodded. \"But your plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy thought about it. \"The construction of a mighty birthing suite for my own use. It will be where I usher in my daughter, the next ruler of the world, and where she will deliver her daughter and so on throughout generations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting. I didn't know you took such a spiritual view of maternity,\" Kim said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I have always loved pregnancy and knew my womb would be the best one. That's why I never allowed anyone inside me before I decided to carry Antonio's child,\" Wendy said, turning to face Kim. \"And what will you do as the owner of the mall? That seems to be your big goal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure. But I know for sure I'm not going to be forced to watch you push your ugly baby out,\" Kim said. As Wendy's eyes flared, Kim slammed her fist on the controls and a loud alarm rang out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Satellite Re-Entering Atmosphere,\" a mechanical voice blared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Wendy howled, her skin turning red with rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought it over and, you take over, there won't be any more money and then what am I going to do with my life?\" Kim asked, gesturing to her greed amulet. \"So I think you and Sarah need a little more competition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have made a terrible mistake,\" Wendy growled. \"What I am going to do to you...you'll wish you were hooked up to a power converter in the basement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see you stop me when you weigh as much as a bus,\" Kim said, touching her amulet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instead of Wendy swelling, Kim started to rapidly grow larger. She whimpered and fell to her knees under her weight. Wendy walked up, holding Brandon's master amulet. \"You thought I didn't know how to use this? No chaotic magic and no PregTech trickery is going to interfere with my pregnancy,\" she sneered, resting one foot on Kim's belly to show how she had conquered her traitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy reached down and pulled off Kim's amulet, holding it aloft to inspect it. There was a missing gem but Wendy paid it no mind. Antonio had once given a gem to the labs for research and it must have been this one. \"Malati, come in here please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Indian model came into the office and gasped at the enormous tan pregnant beauty on the ground. \"W-what should I do with her?\" Malati asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get her nice and comfortable in the main theater and bring out her girlfriend. I'm going to make her pay,\" Wendy cackled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-which one is her girlfriend. She kind of sleeps around,\" Malati said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashley! Get Ashley and keep her restrained!\" Wendy shouted as Malati hurried and dragged Kim away. Wendy let out a sigh to calm herself as she inspected both amulets. Touching them together, there was a brief flash before only one remained in her hand, their colors twisting together. \"You may have ruined my grand plan but I won't be stopped here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack down in the dungeon, Catalina was fruitlessly searching for Sarah and the others in the basement. She opened one cell door and peeked around inside. \"Do you know where Sarah Page is?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no,\" said Jennifer Armstrong, the imprisoned and now pregnant reporter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...do you know who I am?\" Catalina then asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" the reporter replied. Catalina abruptly shut the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what's the point?\" she groaned, hurrying to the next door. She and Grace had been able to get past security and scientists but were running out of time. All around were loud, heavy footsteps as they were getting closed in. Finally, Catalina and Grace stumbled into a large room, full of scientists looking at them in shock. Brandon and Katie ran in from the other side, all looking surprised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wrong way,\" Brandon gulped, looking off to the side to see Gwen and Joelle with enormous breasts and ass cheeks. \"Oh my god...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop them!\" Rebecca yelled so loudly, everyone had to clutch their ears. In stomped the most fearsome woman in the world: Rebecca Quo with the wrath amulet around her neck. \"Finally...finally...I can put a stop to you once and for all.\" She cracked her knuckles and wrists, clenching her fists so tightly her knuckles turned white. \"I have been waiting for this moment for so long. Now then...who's first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rebecca stepped forward, she stopped suddenly and touched her belly. \"Everything okay?\" Jill asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine!\" Rebecca barked. \"I'm just a little tight and...oof...\" She bent forward some, running both hands on her back and belly. \"Something feels strange.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen everyone slowly realized what was happening. Rebecca had been a life-long loyal PreggoMall employee. She had never messed with any PregTech gear that extended pregnancy and the effects of the energy converter had died off by now, returning her fetuses to their original form. Aside from the amulet's affects, she had no had her pregnancy tampered with so it had progressed naturally. And now that progression was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca Quo was going into labor.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rebecca huffed and puffed as she tried to calm herself from the pain that was child birth. She tried to regain composure but couldn't under the sheer amount of pain her foetuses were putting her through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d One of the lab assistants asked as She waddled up to the assassin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca gave her a demonised look, grabbed her by the coat, pulled her in and sternly threatened \u201cI need a doctor now.\u201d She fiercely pushed the scientist back, causing the poor \u2018woman\u2019 to fall on her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie And Brandon embraced Catalina and Grace as they found each other for the first time in a few hours. \u201cDid you find out the preg convertor?\u201d Brandon asked, absentmindedly rubbing Graces belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, we have no idea how to turn it- uhh Brandon?\u201d Grace asked as she felt Brandon\u2019s hand rub up her underbelly. Brandon stopped and apologised so she could continue, \u201cOff, thank you\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay so why don't we all go over there together and see if multiple amulets can do the trick.\u201d Katie replied, before realising her greed amulet was gone. \u201cRight I don't have my amulet\u2026what if we had Sarah?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon missed Sarah, Erin was the love of his life, but one of the best sexual experiences was with the gorgeous brunette in her office. Brandon looked over and saw that everyone had swarmed around Rebecca. Grabbing a spare lab coat to cover himself he realised he could hear the assassin  huffing and puffing loudly. \u201cHey, do you think if we helped Rebecca out, that she would work for us?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other three looked at The man before bursting out laughing. \u201cYou have to be kidding me!\u201d Katie laughed as she held her sides<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cthat woman looks like she's all loyalty and not in a mood to switch sides.\u201d Grace said as she leaned over, groaning over the weight of her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, now that I think about it, it's a good idea\u201d Catalina answered, thinking logically for a change. Everyone turned around in shock at the fact she didn't think about herself for a change. \u201cThink about it. That is the deadliest woman in Freyjaton, she is also the woman currently feeling more pain than I did after finishing 4 erotic films in a week.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, I forgot you used to do porn!\u201d Brandon laughed before being grabbed by he throat by the proud actress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey are erotic films\u2026 If I ever hear you say that word again you will wish you hadn't!\u201d Catalina angrily said as she let go. \u201cNow Sarah is the only one who knows how the Preg-convertor works, if we find her, we can get Rebecca on our side\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut we need a distraction, something that would distract the other mall workers whilst we helped out that deadly Asian\u201d Brandon said before realising everyone was looking at him. \u201cSeriously? What if they transform me into a woman again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's a risk we\u2019re willing to take!\u201d Grace said as she pushed Brandon over to the scientists. Off to the right of her she saw Joelle, massively pregnant weighed down by her extreme breasts. \u201cDon't worry sweetie we will be together again soon\u2026\u201d Grace silently whispered as she she went back to her fellow pregnant women. \u201cOkay let's get started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon didn't realise that he would be stumbling straight into the mall workers that were surrounding Rebecca. \u201cThe fool has reverted back to a male, get him!\u201d Jill called out as he and several lab assistants chased after Brandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInto the darkness he ran, the Lab assistants following his loud footsteps. There was no escape! No hiding! He found his way back into the utility closet with the ventilation shaft. Climbing on shelves and boxes he inched his way back towards the shaft. Higher and higher he climbed, he could hear the footsteps coming closer. He tried to reach for the broken edges but he couldn't. The scientists footsteps sped up, racing towards the closet. Brandon climbed higher and got a hand on the opening! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door creaked open and Jill saw him, Brandon barely hanging onto the broken piece of metal. \u201cGrab the fool!\u201d Jill ordered as two pregnant women waddled in to grab him. Brandon kicked and screamed but it was no use, the two scientists were far to strong and far too attractive to fight off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Brandon didn't know was that the two scientists would each try to go through the door first. The sudden impact swung Brandon out and I to Jill. The lead scientist readied herself for impact and took Brandon down. Grabbing two syringes she took blood out of Brandon\u2019s arm and injected a more concentrated formula into his veins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime for round two!\u201d Jill mocked as she got off Brandon. The true amulet holder sat and whimpered as he could feel his hair growing out again, his member changing, his breasts growing outward again, any trace of body hair was disappearing and lastly his body features were becoming more feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon looked herself over, she realised she wasn't pregnant. \u201cWell at least I'm not huUUUGE!\u201d He said as he felt  a sickly feeling in his stomach. His thighs thickened and within seconds he looked overdue with twins, then triplets until his belly, breasts and butt expanded until he was supporting 200 foetuses. Her poor body took up every inch of the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon lay there, unable to do anything, when she felt a kick, and then a few more. \u201cOh god, what have I done?\u201d His mind was flooding with memories of every day since he grabbed the amulet. With every kick, he realised every life he had changed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah had become a skilled inventor that was ruined by a rival company<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother a famous model and had to deal with an ungrateful husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina went from a porn star to a famous actress<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice lost her way and forgot what it meant to be one with her body but gained many friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie, well she got everything she wanted<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin\u2026 Erin's life had completely flipped upside down. She went from the attractive rich girl next door, to golfing pro, to a Pregnant CEO, to now having no life as she drifted through space, monitoring a satellite that would most likely be transforming the worlds population into pregnant women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a deep breath in as she accepted the responsibility of her actions. The chaos had caused irreparable damage already, but maybe she could make up for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Grace and Katie introduced themselves they followed Catalina running further into the labyrinth that was the Preggomalls HQ. They managed much easier without having to avoid Wendy\u2019s henchmen, but finding Sarah would be no easy task. They reached a large vault, locked with a digit pad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrap, how are we going to get in there?\u201d Grace asked as she looked around, making sure that no one had followed them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina humphed as she waddled over to the pad and took out a mirror. \u201cRemember how I mentioned my spectacular performance in that spy film I talked about earlier? Well my character used a mirror to find out the combination!\u201d After lightly pressing down on the mirror she looked at the answer. \u201cAnd the numbers arrrreeen\u2019t there\u2026\u201dCatalina frustratingly answered as she stuffed her mirror back in the bra. \u201cOh wait, mirror tape, it was mirror tape!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie pushed Catalina and looked down at the pad. \u201cOkay the first number is one because the paint has been rubbed off, the second is 9 because it's starting to lose paint\u2026\u201d Katie curiously said as she observed the digits. \u201cCatalina, did the previous CEO mention any historical things?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually yes, he mentioned this massive war in a European village that destroyed the landscape of it. He said it happened in 1970 something\u2026\u201d Catalina answered as she tried to remember the last digit. \u201c I remember it was even number\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat, we will all take advice from the actress that can't remember a number!\u201d Grace angrily interrupted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up! Catalina, did you see any photos from his European thing?\u201d Katie asked trying to keep the two people women sane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere was an expedition that he showed me a photo from, there were 6 men, and 3 women standing in front of the site where they were rebuilding the ruins.\u201d Catalina answered, her eyes closed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay do you recognise any outfits?\u201d Katie pressed, trying her best to get an accurate date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, there was a blazer, sweater and pants number\u201d Catalina answered \u201cthe blazer was brown-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c1976!\u201d Katie shouted as she punched the number in and pressed enter. \u201c I studied fashion and international business, so I can easily tell what year a photo is taken by looking at what the people are wearing.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were waited but nothing happened [voice command needed]. Catalina leaned over, cleared her throught and in the best Wendy impersonation said \u201copen vault door\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive vault door creaked open. \u201cAAACCCTTTIIINNNNGGGG!\u201d Catalina announced proudly. As they opened the door, they saw Sarah in the process of dismantling her amulet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow the hell am I going to get out of here!\u201d Sarah cried, wiping away tears. Her belly had significantly grown since coming to he Preggomall, she now rivalled Brandon\u2019s belly. \u201cOh my god, you guys are here!\u201d  She squealed as she rubbed her sides. Wiping away the tears she wanted to give them all a big hug but couldn't reach them from the sheer size of her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSarah, we are going to get you out of here, but we need you to help us out first\u2026\u201d Catalina said as she looked to Katie to continue the conversation. Sadly she was currently sucking on Sarah\u2019s huge belly, nuzzling it lovingly.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cYou need me to help out that Asian psychopath?\u201d Sarah exclaimed, she had seen the work that Rebecca made throughout the town. There was no way she would want to get in the path of hurricane Rebecca. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, all you need to do is tell us where you know you put your portable preg-convertor when you came here\u201d Catalina pleaded, in the most proud way she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy? You basically have the most chaotic woman in Freyjatons history suspended in a moment of labor, I say let her feel he pain she gives on an hourly basis.\u201d Sarah replied, her arms crossed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace tapped Catalina on the shoulder and asked to try knock some sense into the trapped woman. \u201cOkay Sarah, hi I'm Grace.\u201d Grace greeted herself, trying to sound as genuine as possible. \u201cYour friends tell me you are an incredible inventor, mind as sharp as a tack right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah nodded in agreement as she looked down at Grace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then, now I am sure if you saw an opportunity present itself to help you reduce your belly size to something manageable, you would take it right?\u201d Grace asked. Sarah begrudgingly agreed. \u201cOkay cool, now I know about these amulet things, if we had two, we should be able to move some of this energy stuff into other women, right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright fine, I can see your point. The portable convertor is a floor up in the giant hangar.\u201d Sarah surrendered  \u201cjust make sure you guys shrink this belly down to something more manageable!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina and Grace dashed for the elevator, post haste. Sarah collapsed onto her big belly when she noticed Katie spooning her delightful midsection. \u201cShouldn't you go help them?\u201d Sarah asked her sexually distracted friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm? Oh right, I should but you need someone here Incase something happens\u201d Katie mumbled as she went back to hugging Sarahs massive belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, I have been feeling really lonely lately\u2026\u201d Sarah replied as she reached over and lightly played with Katie's hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy sat back in her chair as she got a call from her office telephone. \u201c hello Empress, something is going on with the satellite, why am I reentering the atmosphere?\u201d Erin asked as she sat in her very large spacesuit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh please you don't have to call me Empress.\u201d Wendy said as she twirled her hair. \u201cSadly Kim has betrayed us. I\u2019m locating the trajectory of the Satellite and I can see it will crash in the Golf course behind that country club you like. I'll met you there when you crash\u201d She hung up and walked over to her cabinet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside were the three amulets she had taken from her captives and one that Rebecca swapped out for. First she took Sarah\u2019s Envy amulet, pushing the Sarah\u2019s amulet into the Master One, Wendy could see a bright flash before seeing one amulet remaining. The Master amulet shone nicely, it's power developing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy wasn't done, she was power hungry. She merged the Lust amulet and the Sloth Amulet into the master amulet, making it more and more powerful! Smiling she placed the amulet back in her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFour down, three to go.\u201d She said as Kim and Ashley were brought into the room. The pregnant women carrying her collapsed as they let go off the models. \u201cYou 8 have done very nicely,  reward for your efforts!\u201d Wendy announced as she doubled the bellies of each of the women. Every Preggomall employee now had their bellies filled with energy rather than foetuses, so the extra energy had them jumping for joy and running out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLadies, welcome to the final trimester.\u201d Wendy stated as the automatic doors closed. \u201c Ashley, your lover here has very happily ruined my plan for changing the worlds population into pregnant women.\u201d She walked up and slightly traced her finger around Ashley's midsection. \u201cNow, you know what they say about plans, always make a plan B. Now sadly I didn't have enough resources for another satellite, but this should work just nicely.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat on earth are you doing?\u201d Kim asked as she tried to look over to Wendy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHah! Like I would tell you.\u201d Wendy answered as She walked back to the stage. \u201cJill, come help me with my amulet, we have to go golfing\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon lay there, frustrated being stuck. She was happy to see her large breasts again though. They were impossible to lift, so she just laid there and hugged them. Jill who was standing there with some scientists just ended his call with Wendh. \u201cOkay gals, we have been asked to go take the master amulet to the country club. I want you two to help me, but Jackie and Samantha, go use Brandons blood to find a remedy for our pregnant bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would an amulet need such help?\u201d Brandon asked herself, letting go of her juicy breasts. She loved her new form, Brandon could stop rubbing herself over. Unlike last time she wasn't changing back and forth, the formula injected in him was much more concentrated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll alone she started to get a little horny. \u201cOh man, I can put do it like this!\u201d Brandon yelled as she couldn't reach her nether regions. All her shouting had brought attention to the transformed woman. The footsteps gained pace until she discovered they belonged too\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brandon struggled on the floor with her new, enormously pregnant body as she tried to get up. Rebecca was coming and lately, that meant bad news. Brandon grabbed onto the wall and managed to at least get to her knees, her belly rubbing against the floor as she moved.<br>\r\nRebecca stomped forward, her hands clutching her belly like she was holding onto it for dear life. Brandon could see all of Rebecca's muscles flexing as she grit her jaw so tightly, it looked like her teeth might break.<br>\r\n\"You,\" Rebecca growled, pointing at Brandon. \"Somehow, this is all your fault!\"<br>\r\n\"Me?\" Brandon said, trying out her new, feminine voice, trying to make it even more high-pitched. \"I-I don't know what you're talking about. My name's not Brandon, it's...Brenda!\"<br>\r\n\"Who said I was looking for anyone named Brandon?\" Rebecca scowled.<br>\r\n\"Oops,\" Brandon said to herself, stroking her twitching belly. \"Pregnancy brain, sorry.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm a trained spy. I can trace and track someone across the whole planet,\" Rebecca said, pressing her belly against Brandon's. Brandon could feel how strong the super-soldier's contractions were when they touched, with each clench hitting Brandon like a punch. \"A little thing like a sex change can't fool me.\"<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't call this little,\" Brandon wheezed, balancing against the wall with her enormous ass so both hands could stroke her belly. Her fear of Rebecca was making her heart race and that was exciting the 200 fetuses she was now carrying. \"So...what are you going to do to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I going to do to you?\" Rebecca said, a terrifying smile on her face. \"I've been thinking about that for a long time. I'm going to...going to...\" Rebecca grunted and stumbled, holding onto the wall for support while her other hand held fast against her belly. \"I can't take it anymore! I'm about ready to burst!\"<br>\r\nBrandon knew she was just being euphemistic about childbirth but with Rebecca's belly as big and tight as it was, one never knows. \"What about the PreggoMall scientists that were all over you a little while ago?\" Brandon asked.<br>\r\n\"They're idiots! I thought they might get a little brighter after turning into women but their heads are as empty as their bellies are full,\" Rebecca panted, sweat starting to cover her face. \"Oh god, these contractions keep getting tighter.\"<br>\r\n\"Just...um...breathe,\" Brandon said, waddling a little closer. \"Try not to be so angry.\"<br>\r\n\"I CAN'T FUCKING HELP IT! I'M ABOUT TO GIVE BIRTH TO MORE THAN 100 BABIES!\" Rebecca screamed, her eyes closing as she sucked in a deep breath. \"Here it comes...\"<br>\r\nBrandon took Rebecca's hand and held it against her swollen breasts. \"It's okay, I'm here,\" Brandon said. \"Just squeeze when you have a contraction and-\" She spoke a little too soon. Rebecca squeezed and Brandon let out a silent shout, falling back to her knees. \"g-good...just like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack upstairs, Grace, Catalina, and Katie were supporting Sarah as they tried to make it back upstairs. Grace and Catalina each took an arm while Katie had the heaviest load, holding Sarah's big belly on her back. But Katie hardly looked upset with her station. \"Where to?\" Katie said, hiding her glee some, as they looked around the empty halls of the mall.<br>\r\n\"I think I left my gear in the old clothing store you used to work at,\" Sarah said.<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I wonder if I still technically own it,\" Katie said. \"I've probably missed a lot of shifts...but I can chalk it up to maternity leave.\"<br>\r\nSarah giggled, looking down at Katie, seeing tufts of her short brown hair next to her enormous pregnant middle. Without Sarah's envy amulet, she was seeing things more clearly and didn't realize how much she enjoyed working with Katie...and being around her. The four of them made the turn and headed toward the store. But once inside, they saw another familiar face there: Becka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What. Is. Going. On?\" Becka yelled, her voice wavering. She was clearly shaken up. \"This place is so weird. They said something about a satellite launch, there's orgies in the spa, and women keep getting thrown in a dungeon.\" Becka rested her hands on her huge belly. \"I don't even want to be pregnant! Help!\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay,\" Catalina said, letting Sarah down to rest on the floor as she waddled up to Becka. \"Catalina Corazon is here to help.\"<br>\r\n\"Help? You aren't a real action hero! You just play one in movies!\" Becka shouted. \"And not even that well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah, Grace, and Katie all froze. No one had ever criticized Catalina's acting to her face, at least not since she got her amulet. The pride Catalina carried had already been multiplied dozens of times over and her psyche couldn't shake the insult.<br>\r\n\"Not...I'm not...but everyone loves me,\" Catalina murmured.<br>\r\n\"Because you have big tits, a bigger ass, and a hot face,\" Becka yelled, her face turning pale as her exhaustion overwhelmed her. \"And because being a pregnant hero is weird!\"<br>\r\nCatalina gulped and touched one hand to her dark belly. \"Well then...I thought you were one of my biggest fans...\" She moved one hand to her amulet and tapped it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it turns out you're just the biggest,\" Catalina purred as Becka instantly swelled. Her belly expanded with 100 additional fetuses and she collapsed to the floor, moaning and stroking her pregnant middle.<br>\r\n\"She's almost as big as me,\" Sarah whispered.<br>\r\n\"Yeah but you're hotter,\" Katie whispered back. \"And besides, I like smart girls too.\"<br>\r\nSarah blushed as Grace looked at Catalina with shock. \"I guess...we'd better hope she's as mad at Wendy as she was with Becka.\"<br>\r\nCatalina waddled over and picked up the belt Sarah brought with her. \"This it?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah. They must have taken everything else and not realized this was more PregTech gear,\" Sarah said, wrapping the belt around her belly and beginning to tinker with its components. \"And Becka, just..stay put.\"<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't be too hard for her,\" Katie said to herself, watching Becka's little legs kick as she struggled to get upright. <br>\r\n\"Let's go,\" Grace said. \"Seeing her so big creeps me out.\"<br>\r\n\"What about me?\" Sarah said, patting her pregnant belly.<br>\r\nGrace shrugged. \"You carry it better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...I think you're fully dilated,\" Brandon said, pulling her hand back out of Rebecca's vagina. She had wanted to get to third base with Rebecca but...this was not what she had in mind. \"But my sister should be back soon so if you want to hold off on pushing, we can-\"<br>\r\n\"I want to push!\" Rebecca screamed. She was sitting on the floor, legs spread incredibly far thanks to her flexible body. Brandon was right beneath her enormous, quivering belly. She could see Rebecca's golden belly skin tighten and pulse with veins.<br>\r\n\"Then now's as good a time as ever,\" Brandon sighed. \"Push!\"<br>\r\n\"I...I'm nervous,\" Rebecca said. \"I don't really want to be a mother. I'm too...bad.\"<br>\r\n\"You're fine,\" Brandon said. \"You don't have to let the amulet define you.\"<br>\r\nRebecca grunted and lurched forward. \"I was bad before the amulets! Before the belly!\"<br>\r\n\"Then just change! It's hard but you can do it! Just look around the city! Lots of things have changed!\" Brandon said, having to yell over the sound of Rebecca's groans. \"Now you need to push!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca sucked in a deep breath and howled, pushing both hands into her boulder-like belly as she pushed. Rebecca had never given birth before but her powerful muscles helped ease one of her babies out, and in a few minutes, Brandon was holding a wet, crying infant in her hands. <br>\r\n\"H-how does it look?\" Rebecca panted. \"Did it come out okay?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, he's fine,\" Brandon said, supporting the baby in her arms. \"Guess Wendy's plan to turn all the men into pregnant women doesn't affect those in the womb.\"<br>\r\nRebecca let out a little laugh before groaning and shifting forward. \"T-there's another one coming!\"<br>\r\n\"Fine, just do the same thing. You are doing great,\" Brandon said, placing one hand on Rebecca's upper thigh. \"Push!\"<br>\r\nAs Rebecca screamed and pushed, Sarah and her valets hurried forward. \"There, found her!\" Grace yelled.<br>\r\n\"It was easy. Just follow the sound of the shouting and cursing,\" Katie said, helping set Sarah down. Sarah couldn't quite stand yet but she was able to lie on the floor, propped up by her belly, and calibrate her energy converter. Just as Rebecca pushed out her second baby, Sarah zapped Rebecca's belly. Rebecca let out a cry of sexual bliss and relaxed, stroking her belly as she felt the contractions vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, it's over,\" Rebecca cooed. \"And...the babies?\"<br>\r\n\"One boy and one girl,\" Brandon said, handing them both to their mother. Instantly, they latched onto her nipples and began to feed. Rebecca laughed, tears welling up in her eyes.<br>\r\n\"They're beautiful,\" she whimpered, turning to Sarah and Brandon. \"Thank you...so much.\"<br>\r\n\"We want to help more people but Wendy is proving tricky,\" Sarah said. \"Any help with that?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm quitting the mall,\" Rebecca scowled. \"No paid maternity leave.\" She looked between her ample breasts at her amulet and frowned. \"I can't be a good mother with this thing poisoning my mind. Take it away.\"<br>\r\nGladly, Brandon took it. With a flash and a PING, Brandon became a man again and his fetuses were distributed among the nearest 200 pregnant women. \"Feels good to have an amulet in my hands again,\" Brandon said.<br>\r\n\"It looks good in your hands,\" Rebecca said, looking him up and down. The charismatic effect the master amulet gave him over pregnant women seemed to be rekindled by the new amulet.<br>\r\n\"I just won't wear it or else...who knows what might happen,\" Brandon gulped, thinking about Janice and Rebecca's violent tantrums. \"Now then...what next?\"<br>\r\n\"The scientists will stay on your side,\" Rebecca said. \"Or else.\"<br>\r\n\"I'll stay here to take care of Rebecca's babies,\" Grace said. \"I'm a nurse after all.\"<br>\r\n\"Then let's free everyone else and head upstairs,\" Sarah said. \"I think Wendy and I need to have a chat again.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Rebecca's groans and howls from her expedient childbirth rocked the entire mall and echoed through every store, Wendy was far away, driving toward the site where Erin's satellite was touching down. It was on a far side of town but Wendy had a secret weapon up her sleeve for getting there quickly. Secretly, she had her science team develop a hover car off the books. It ran solely off of the converted pregnant energy of PreggoMall's prisoners and employees and didn't use the copied PregTech computer chips so it was immune to Sarah's virus. Wendy knew when she ruled the world, she'd have to travel quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Comfortable back there?\" Wendy asked with a laugh. Ashley was in the back seat, lying on her back as her truly gigantic pregnant belly stuck straight up. Wendy wanted to find some way to restrain Ashley's arms and legs but with her body so heavy, it was unnecessary. Ashley was in no condition to run away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-why do you need me?\" Ashley whined, rubbing her big belly as it constantly trembled with movement from her hundreds of fetuses. Wisely, Wendy's flying vehicle was large enough to accommodate pregnant women of Ashley's size, though she couldn't fit many more on board. There was room for just one more pregnant woman, particularly one of Erin's size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a whir, Wendy's mechanical chariot landed on the golf course of the country club Erin once dominated. Confused pregnant women huddled around the steaming satellite stuck in the earth like nervous peasants around an idol. Many of them had their clothes torn to shreds, making it clear they were once ordinary men before Wendy's energy washed over them and turned them into curvaceous expectant women with a minimum of 30 kicking babies inside their bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Move aside,\" Wendy said, holding up the amulet. It glowed and flashed and, as if by instinct, the pregnant women waddled back, giving Wendy a clear path to walk to the satellite. With a glad smile, she stroked her small belly and opened the door to the satellite. Erin was standing inside, a blank look on her face. \"Welcome back to Earth, Ms. Parker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Empress,\" Erin said in a monotone, walking out of the satellite to the grassy hills of the golf course. \"I am sorry my mission was unsuccessful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't a total failure. Look at all these new, wonderfully huge pregnant subjects,\" Wendy said, holding her arms outstretched and cackling. \"We can get another shot at transforming and controlling the world if I can just get the other remaining amulets.\" She held the amulet up to her eye level and watched it glisten in the sunlight. \"Just Catalina's and then Rebecca's will be easy. After that...the world is mine.\" She touched one hand back to her belly. \"The world is ours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is my mission?\" Erin asked, her voice unchanged. Wendy's device not only wiped Erin's memory. It made her a blank slate, open to suggestion and easy to turn into a willing pawn of Wendy's, with no recollection of her time with anyone else back in Freyjaton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For now, be alert,\" Wendy said, turning to the rest of the pregnant women on the golf course. She strode up to one woman, her torn polo shirt and shorts making it clear she used to be a man. \"Ma'am, it looks like you have put on some weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you do this to us?\" the woman whimpered, touching her swollen middle. Wendy smiled and wrapped her hands around the woman's pregnant stomach, squeezing her popped out navel. \"O-oh! That feels...funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I did this. All over this country, everyone is turning into pregnant women \u2013 the pinnacle of human evolution,\" Wendy said, lifting her amulet. It glowed brightly and the women all gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all grew in size instantly. The woman Wendy had spoken to fell to her knees, growing to carry 50 babies as her long blond hair fluttered in the sunlight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only one who can lead this new world of pregnant women is me, your empress, Wendy Greene!\" Wendy bellowed. The women all looked at one another before turning back to Wendy and bowing their heads, touching the fronts of their bellies as a sign of supplication. \"Now kneel!\" There was a chorus of groans and huffs as the heavy women tried to bend down, moving slowly and jutting their hips out as their stomachs swung around. \"Okay, forget about kneeling. I have something else you can do for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Wendy could speak, there was a muffled buzzing from the flying vehicle. Ashley started to moan and squeal in rhythm with the sound. Wendy made her way over and realized her tablet computer was right under Ashley, its buzzing stimulating her lap. Wendy pulled it out and answered the incoming video call, stroking Ashley's thigh as she turned it on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wendy! Where are you?\" Sarah yelled, standing in front of Wendy's office computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I? You don't need to be concerned with that now. All you need to...ohmygodhe'snaked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah and the other pregnant women gathered around the computer turned around to see Brandon standing there, nude. \"He...tore through some outfits,\" Sarah said. \"Long story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have changes of clothes in the office closet. Get him to put something on,\" Wendy grumbled, looking away from the screen. After a few minute, she turned back and resumed her talk. \"Alright, now then, let me speak to Mr. Page.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looked confused but waved Brandon over. \"H-hello?\" Brandon asked, trembling a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Mr. Page,\" Wendy cackled. \"I see you've found yourself another amulet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to get them all back,\" Brandon said, trying to be tough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I think not,\" Wendy sighed. \"I have a proposal for you. Since you seem to have some sort of connection with these amulets, you should be the one to hand the last ones over to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I do that?\" Brandon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I have the two women you care the most about with me and I have a way to make them very susceptible,\" Wendy purred. \"In my new pregnant world, they could be made to worship you almost as much as they worship me...and be willing to do anything for you. And to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon gulped. \"T-the amulets have a connection to me, huh? You know why that is? Because I love pregnant women and I don't want to hurt them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love pregnant women too,\" Wendy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You love to control them. It's different,\" Brandon said, feeling confident for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy sighed. \"There's no getting through to you. Well, my offer still stands.\" She pointed the tablet to the mountain of belly and breasts that was Ashley. \"Say hi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-Brandon!\" Ashley cried out before Wendy turned off the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, let's head back,\" Wendy said, hopping in the vehicle and bringing Erin in with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we do?\" the transformed pregnant women called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see that satellite?\" Wendy said, pointing to the structure rooted in the ground. \"There are enough of you here. Pick it up and bring it back to PreggoMall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where?\" they cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know where it is. Maternal instinct,\" Wendy cackled as the vehicle lifted into the air and zipped off back toward the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Empress? Who is Brandon?\" Erin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The last man on Earth. Or he will be soon,\" Wendy said. \"A very bad man. An enemy of the empress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Erin nodded, her brainwashed mind starting to churn. <i>If men are needed to impregnate a woman...and I am pregnant...then this Brandon must be the father of my children.</i> She touched one hand to her quivering belly. <i>I am curious to meet him. Evil or not.</i></span></div></div>",

She didn't realise that the pregnancy wave that hit the town hadn't completely worked on everyone. The young and e elderly had changed sex, but heir bodies weren't viable to be pregnant. Duke the owner of the country club, the same man, now woman that flew several people around the city, had witnessed the past thirty minutes and was furious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Grabbing her brand new sniper rifle Duke climbed to the top of the mansion. She took aim, knowing if she wanted to strike, it would have to be now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know it doesn't matter if they're ducks or strange flying machines, the bigger the target\u201d Duke said as she pulled the trigger, \u201cthe easier the shot.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women screamed as the car was struck from below. \u201cOne of the turbines are out!\u201d Wendy stated trying to manoeuvre the Car in for landing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan we still fly with 3?\u201d Ashley asked, guessing the number of turbines on board. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, but not at this weight!\u201d Wendy shouted as the car slowly dropped altitude. \u201cThe 3 last turbines managed to make landing a little softer than a full on crash landing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy's car flew over the Mansions driveway and onto one of the hills. With extensive damage and a busted engine, the prototype wasn\u2019t gunna fly without some scientists fixing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemarkably no one was hurt inside. Wendy had made it a priority that the insides of the car would be encased with a superior shock absorption technology. \u201cCheck in everyone\u2026\u201d Wendy said as she looked over to her pregnant prisoners. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIm fine, but Erin looks deranged\u201d Ashley said as she looked over to Erin who looked worse for wear, whilst retaining her trance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am good, is there anything I can do to help?\u201d Erin asked as she turned her gaze to Wendy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, firstly stop giving me that creepy look.\u201d Wendy answered disturbed by Erin's look. \u201cSecondly go collect my new pregnant slaves and tell them to bring the satellite to the top of that mansion up there.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin nodded and waddled out of the car. Climbing up such a massive driveway would be hell for anyone as pregnant as Erin, but in her state right now, she felt no pain. Wendy pressed a few buttons and the rooftop parted. As she stood on the seat she noticed something, there were no buildings to block out the sky from this area of town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you going to do with me?\u201d Ashley asked, as she tried to inch away from the soon to be Empress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, there's more than one way to send a signal out to the world, I just need the right platform to send it from!\u201d Wendy yelled back. \u201cYour son has no chance in stopping me now, the amulets are mostly gone, and once my transformation signal goes out, it just needs to hit the international space station, and then the whole world can be mine!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when she realised she needed Ashley to power the satellite. \u201cBut how the hell am I going to get you up this god damn hill?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon raced towards the  elevator, Catalina grabbed his arm before he nearly ran into a wall. \u201cBrandon!\u201d Catalina sternly shouted \u201cthink, you cannot win this with an unsteady mind!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut she's got Erin and Ashley!\u201d Brandon shouted back. A swift strong palm slapped the poor fool on the face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCALM DOWN\u201d Catalina bellowed. The rest of the crew stood there in silence, amazed by the sheer strength her lungs had. Brandon halted, his mind racing. After a couple of slow calm breaths he regained his cool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, maybe we can find someone who has had an inside scoop with the company. Maybe someone that can turn us around.\u201d Catalina wondered as she rubbed her chin. \u201c Rebecca, would you know where the Preggomall employees would be?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell some would be in the labs, others would be at the top of the mall where Wendy hosted the press conference.\u201d Catalina answered. She looked down and saw her two newborns latching onto her breasts. \u201cThis is going to be hard for me, I don't want any harm to come to my little ones\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't worry, I'll be here to support you.\u201d Grace replied, rubbing the assassins back. \u201cIt's what nurses do.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ran into the lab and saw the small army of Lab technicians working on Joelle and Gwen. The prisoners breasts and butts had become astronomical now, their bellies dwarfed by the presence of their much larger assets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, no more\u2026\u201d Joelle cried \u201cI just feel so raw\u2026 I don't know how much more I can take\u2026\u201d Tears were streaming down their eyes as their massive bodies surrounded the casing of their test chambers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't worry, your next test will try to turn back time\u2026\u201d Jill answered as she extracted the appropriate chemicals from Brandon\u2019s blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWait!\u201d Brandon said as he saw the Lab people about to move. \u201cYou people have fought tooth and nail for an evil woman that wouldn't even give you your proper lives back! You can be free once again, broken away from a society that acts like some kind of stupid pyramid scheme! You guys are scientists, King's of Intelligence, but you cow tow to that hag! What do you say? Isn\u2019t it time you think for yourselves?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina and Grace cried as they were moved by Brandon\u2019s motivational speech, Sarah stood in awe and Katie actually took her mind off of Sarah\u2019s belly to pay attention. The scientists on the other hand, weren't phased, except Jill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you change us back into men?\u201d Jill asked as did several of the other scientists that went through a sex change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure why not!\u201d Brandon called out to which most of the characters cheered. The pregnant women who were women from the start had other ideas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow hold on!\u201d One of the women called out. \u201cYou have worked for Wendy for how long now? A lot of you were unemployed before this all started! You owe Wendy your loyalty, your respect, your\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hand came out from no where and grabbed the unfortunate woman's neck. The owner of said hand, Rebecca pulled her in and threatened \u201cYou need to know about our terms... Either you run back home now, side with us, or learn how furious a new mother can be!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe original women did not take too kindly to their ultimatum and ran off. With a small army on their side, it was time to take the fight to Wendy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don't we get Wendy? It's time to start a bitch hunt!\u201d Brandon called out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie quickly pulled Brandon over to ask \u201cdon\u2019t you mean witch hunt?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon looked back, chuckled and answered \u201cno, I'm right this time.\u201d</span></div></div>",

A couple of emergency lights flickered as they made their way towards the afternoon sun, off to the distance some delightful gasps and squeals came from the spa that miraculously worked through all the madness that had happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon stopped, his new amulet felt warmer for some reason. Holding it up he felt a presence coming from upstairs. After a quick glance to everyone in front of him, he found a way to slip away. He ran up the four flights of escalators until he reached the High Class Fashion Level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was  drawn to two heavy doors on the other side of the floor. Closer and closer he walked, not quite sure about what he was expecting. He put the amulet  around his neck, continuing the walk towards whatever was leading him there. He felt a pain inside him, tiny at first but it grew deeper, he couldn't quite place it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened the doors, and saw Kim lying on top of a 8 foot tall belly. Brandon used to just deal with the woman that broke his family apart, but now that pain he felt was coming out in a rage of anger. This woman screwed up the lives of everyone in Brandon\u2019s family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey how did you get up here?\u201d Kim asked as she turned her back so that she could see the man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I have my ways, just like yourself\u201d Brandon retorted. He walked around, sensing a somewhat fragile feeling with the floor beneath them. \u201cTell me Kim, why did you do it?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo what?\u201d Kim asked as she tried to get a better view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, don't play freaking coy.\u201d  Brandon answered \u201c why did you screw my dad, a married man, fuck Ashley and make her join the Preggomall!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook I'm not going answer that, you all know why I did it\u201d Kim said, trying to hide her feelings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I know there is more to it.\u201d Brandon said as he traced his fingers around his new amulet. \u201cI had sex with God knows how many pregnant women, and there was a reason behind all of them, NOW TELL ME!\u201d  In all his hatred he threw his amulet at Kim, The impact caused Kim to grow with another 50 foetuses. As the amulet bounced away the floor boards started to crack slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim looked at Brandon and saw all the chaos she had caused. The damage she had made was irreparable. The only thing she could do, was come clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIT\u2019S BECAUSE I HAVE NOTHING!\u201d Kim cried out. \u201c I had a really good job before I came here, I had prospects but I was emotionally dead. My family wouldn\u2019t talk to me because I'm an atheist and my friends were all fake pompous pricks. I slept with your father because it was the closest thing I had to a relationship with someone.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon stood back, realising how similar their paths were. \u201cI never knew my true parents...\u201d He replied feeling wrath leave him. \u201cI may have my family and friends, but recently I have felt more and more alone.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c I'm sorry I screwed your family up, they are all really nice people\u201d Kim apologised, wiping away tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I snapped\u201d Brandon said \u201ccome here\u201d.  He reached out his hands and walked over to hug Kim's huge belly when he heard the crack happen again. \u201cCrud\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon snuck back, trying not to put too much weight in each foot. Looking around he couldn't find the amulet. \u201cUh Brandon?\u201d Kim asked as she felt the floor start to give way. Brandon had no time as the floor broke up around the woman he just forgave. He ran for the door and looked back as Kim fell to the floor below her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ok?\u201d Brandon asked looking through the settling dust. He didn't want to say goodbye to someone who had gone through so much. Low and behold Kim and her massive belly appeared as the dust settled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim laughed and she brushed off a little bit of debris. \u201cHoly crap, it's like my belly is made of rubber!\u201d She laughed as she wobbled about. Looking around she realised she was in the home appliances section. She tried reaching for something that resembled a torch, but that's when she heard another large crack. \u201cSeriously?\u201d She asked as she went down another story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon made it half way down to the ground floor when he found an exhausted Kim. Completely unharmed she was tired of falling down stories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOh god, how am I going to clean myself up? I look disgusting!\u201d Kim cried, banging her arms and legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sorry Kim\u201d Brandon said as she comforted the immensely pregnant women. \u201cI can't seem to get anything right! Hell I don't even know where Wendy has taken my mum!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim wiped away a tear and saw Brandon resting comfortably on her belly. She remembered where the satellite was going to crash when she sabotaged the machine. \u201cHey Brandon, do you know what's on the North side of town?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah the golf course why?\u201d Brandon asked before realising what she meant. \u201cShe's there? Oh thank you! I have so much to do. Hold on, I have an idea\u2026\u201d Brandon said as he ran across the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Back at the spa the owners were busy commanding their underlings to do their bidding. \u201cYou call that FOREPLAY?\u201d the owner shouted watching the two women trying to make out. \u201cYou gotta caress the partner, make her want it!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, nobody likes forced foreplay\u201d Brandon called out from the front of the Spa. 30 pregnant beauties turned their heads, amazed to see that such a man had come back to them. Lusting for a man\u2019s touch they dived for the clothed make, Brandon narrowly escaping outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women chased him into the furniture store. A dark ominous feel came over the many women as Brandon tried to lead them in the right direction. \u201cOver here\u201d Brandon called out as he tried to grab their attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman noticed a  large light filled area and dashed for that. Her spa friends weren't far behind. Brandon slid under a table and made it to the kitchen wares. The women turned around a corner and made it to the same place where they became reacquainted with Kim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll memory of Brandon seemed to vanish as the ladies  walked ever so sultry to the beauty before them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Kim asked as Brandon started walking off<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI needed to get the women off my back and I thought you might want something whilst I go save the day.\u201d Brandon exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara shook her head awake, she had been stuck inside the hover cars trunk. She checked to see if the coast was clear, then snuck out of the boot. She looked around and saw Wendy try to roll Ashley up the driveway leading to the Mansion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy pushed as hard as she could, but she was tired. Looking around she saw two pregnant golfers close by. \u201cHey you two!\u201d Wendy bellowed. \u201c YOUR EMPRESS NEEDS YOU!\u201d The two women waddled over as fast as hey could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara bolted for the Mansion, she knew someone could help her. Getting to the top of the hill she surveyed the land, walking around the building she saw the Wendy's satellite being towed up the golf course. Just to the corner of her eye Mara saw Erin's lucky flowing red hair. Using her best Black Widow impression she snuck around to get to her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm so glad to see you again!\u201d Mara exclaimed as she embraced the hypnotised ginger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin gave her a vacant yet confused look, but after a minute, she came up with an idea. \u201cAh yes, I remember seeing you before I went into space!\u201d Erin stated with a minor touch of excitement. \u201cTell me, have you heard of a Brandon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201coh please, we both know the answer to that!\u201d Mara laughed as she looked around. \u201cOkay we need to get help, if my memory serves me correctly, you know the man who runs the country club?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, her name is Duke, but there are no more men in Freyjaton\u201d Erin answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah duh! But I'm sure she will be able to give us some help\u201d Mara replied as she stealthily looked around \u201cLet's see if she has a way of getting us out of here\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Women were still reeling from the affects that Sarah\u2019s virus had on the Preggomall\u2019s products, several fires had broken out in the afternoon sun and right on the other side of he parking lot were the two huge Preggomall Vans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a collective waddle they realised that it would be impossible for most of the women to drive. \u201cHold on\u2026\u201d Gwen said as she looked at the vans. \u201cWhy are we out here when we don't even know where this woman is!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey're\u2026 Heading\u2026 to golf thing\u2026\u201d Brandon huffed as he stopped running and collapsed in front of the group. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,  you're driving us\u201d Sarah answered before turning to the group. \u201cGrace, as the smallest belly here, you are driving the other van\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sorry Sarah\u201d Rebecca interjected \u201c I can't let any harm happen to my offspring. Grace find a safe place, see if you can get to the outskirts of town and just lay low.\u201d Rebecca waddled over to her \u2018midwife\u2019 who was holding her newborn children. \u201cI love you two very much, but mum has one more task before she retires.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving caught his breath, Brandon walked over to the new mother and touched her gently. \u201cIt's going to be okay Rebecca, you'll see them again.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey opened the doors to the vans and discovered something.  Pregtechs products lay perfectly in the van, there was enough for everyone! Everyone Equiped the properly built gadgets on and felt wonderful. \u201cYou know how good it is to have the robospine back on?\u201d Sarah sighed . With everyone accounted for, they realised that they needed to get inside the vans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was the first to squeeze into the van, the suspension taking on her load comfortably. Joelle was next, her breasts were the largest out of everyone's. She had a hard time squeezing through the door, but just got through. Jill and Katie squeezed up the very top with just enough room for 4 scientists and another in the front with Brandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side it was a very similar story but filled mainly with scientists, one of which ended up driving the thing. \u201cOh god! It's so hard to breathe!\u201d Joelle said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhose foot is that?\u201d Cried one person<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm in heaven\u2026\u201d moaned another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright guys!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The country club was quickly emptying as pregnant women in torn, fancy clothing rushed toward Wendy's location, captivated by her charisma and clear supernatural connection to what happened with their pregnancies. Bellies bounced with each labored, bounding step as fabric fluttered off of them and strings of pearls smacked against their incredibly endowed breasts, or in the case of club members who were previously men, their ties were stuck in their deep cleavage and their watches and rings now slid off their slender hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara crept forward, looking around suspiciously before making it to the club's main foyer. Erin followed blindly, her face still vacant of any emotion. That made Mara uneasy but she was preoccupied with the situation at hand. She may have the only window of opportunity to stop Wendy from both preg-ifying the planet and then conquering it. Without any sign of the PregTech team, Mara figured she had to take things into her own hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is Duke's office?\" Mara asked, wondering if the club's owner should go by \"Dame\" now instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin looked around before stopping and turning back to Mara. \"I have no recollection of those specifics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara groaned and put her hands on her hips. They were naturally wide but as one of the few people for miles who wasn't pregnant, she was still at normal proportions. Standing next to Erin, she was like a moray on a whale. Erin's belly stuck out nearly a dozen feet, constantly quivering with movement, with a butt that could crush Mara and breasts too heavy for the nerdy girl to carry, even one at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, let's just start looking then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need,\" a woman's voice bellowed. Sliding down the bannister of a long staircase was an elderly woman in a tuxedo and a rifle in her hands. She stopped at the bottom and looked between Mara and Erin. \"I don't know if I can trust her. I may remember her from the golf tournament, though she's gotten a bit...larger since then,\" Duke said, pointing at Erin before turning to Mara. \"But you're not expectant so I think I can talk to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMara saw the gun. \"So you <u>did</u> shoot down Wendy's vehicle.\" She stepped forward and took one of the old woman's hands. \"I know things are crazy right now but I think you may be able to help stop what's going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. I served in the war in my younger days and have always exercised and kept regular training,\" Duke said, saluting. \"Just call me Sarge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha,\" Mara said with a little smile, playfully saluting. \"So it looks like Wendy still transformed all men, but if they're of a...certain age, they won't become pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about this one?\" Sarge said, pointing at Erin. \"She looks a bit...dim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wendy kind of screwed with her head but she's a friend,\" Mara said, turning to Erin. \"At least, I think so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You thought wrong,\" Wendy cooed as she walked into the country club's main floor. Mara's face went pale as she saw the villainous former secretary step forward. \"Ms. Parker has a handy tracker on her person. I thought she may try and look for signs of her former life and that makes it easy to track down...loose ends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had the correct instinct,\" Erin said, pointing at Sarge and stepping back toward her \"empress.\" \"This is the one who shot down your ship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy sighed and crossed her arms. \"Seems women who won't become pregnant will be rebellious. I'll just have to gather up elderly women when I take control. No worry. I find old people disgusting anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarge raised her rifle and pointed it at Wendy. \"I will not kill a woman who's with child but I can hit you in the leg and make you lame,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy rolled her eyes. \"Oh please. Erin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a blur of red and pink, Erin snatched away Sarge's gun and laid it down at Wendy's feet, who took to dismantling and breaking its individual parts. \"H-how in the world?\" Sarge stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erin here is a blank slate and exists to serve me,\" Wendy said, petting Erin's enormous belly. \"Once you get rid of irrelevant things \u2013 birthdays, interests, hobbies \u2013 you can focus on the things that matter. Like disarming an attacker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't let you get away with what you're doing!\" Sarge boomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, do what you want,\" Wendy shrugged, taking out a small pistol and firing it into Sarge's shoulder. The old woman stumbled back a few steps but was otherwise unharmed. \"That's a tracker. When I'm ready to gather up all rebels, we'll meet again.\" Wendy turned to leave but stopped and touched her hand on Erin again. \"Oh, would you bring Mara with us, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? What do you want with me?\" Mara panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a bit of a nuisance but I think you can be put to good use,\" Wendy said with a sweet smile. \"As someone who just refuses to get pregnant, I think you'll make a good nanny for my daughter. I'll be a busy woman, after all.\" Erin grabbed Mara's arms, squeezing tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Empress, are we going back to the vehicle?\" Erin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we'll go back and see how the preggos are doing on repairs,\" Wendy said as they left the country club. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When it is ready, I want to go meet this...Brandon,\" Erin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy snorted. \"Oh, believe me, I think he's coming here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin's face didn't show it but she was processing the new information. Brandon is coming here...and he is the father of my babies...does this mean he...cares about me? Faintly, her cheeks started to turn red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;hr&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the van, Brandon was being pushed every which way by the bellies crammed inside. At times he wasn't even sitting, just crowd-surfing the pregnant stomachs instead. At least if there was an accident, he would still be preserved, as if he was surrounded by bubble-wrap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are. In town and en route,\" Sarah said, seeing the sign for the rich neighborhood pass by. \"Now we just need to figure out where this satellite of Wendy's is and then track that monster down ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I think I may have found her,\" Brandon stammered, turning his head. Everyone in the car turned their head to see a large, light brown orb. From afar, it looked like stone or a downed hot air balloon but as they drove closer, it was clear that it was a pregnant belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god,\" Katie said, trying to picture a pregnancy that size. She was conflicted between being aroused and terrified and she was not alone. Brandon's erection twitched, his heart going out to whoever it was but also desperately wanting to caress that colossal belly himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone, be on your guard,\" Rebecca said, leaning forward and pushing her stomach against Brandon. \"Wendy's clearly not messing around and she can be incredibly dangerous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right,\" Brandon said, feeling Rebecca rub against him. Now that she had given her breasts some work, they were starting to swell even faster with milk for her two newborns, each now the size of Brandon's arm span. He couldn't help but remember how, out of all the amulet-carrying women, she was the only one he hadn't slept with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe van parked near the gigantic pregnant belly and everyone hurried out. Brandon expected to be the fastest, but with the return of the robo-spines, he was outpaced by his swollen sister and her coworkers. \"Mom?\" Sarah said in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hi honey,\" Ashley croaked. She was pinned to the Earth by her belly, stretching nearly three stories into the air. Miraculously, her skin was still smooth and taut, though it was easier to see the impression of veins lining her swollen womb. She turned to Brandon and gave a little grin. Her lust amulet had been taken by Wendy but with so many pregnancy hormones flooding her system, she was still aroused by the sight of the last man she'd slept with. \"Hello Brandon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Ashley. I'll help you out,\" Brandon said, lifting his own amulet he got from Kim. It glowed briefly but he was unable to shrink his adopted mother down. \"What's happening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wendy used her amulet to transfer all the babies from some of her new...followers into me. She said I generate energy better in my belly and it'll help them work faster on her satellite,\" Ashley groaned, feeling the converted energy inside her round middle pulse and shift. \"Ooh, I'm so sore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see what I can do,\" Sarah said, getting out some of her PregTech gear. \"And don't worry. I'll get back at Wendy for you whenever she shows up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to wait that long,\" Catalina said, pointing across the golf course. Over the hill came Wendy, Erin, and Mara in their clutches. A sick smile spread across Wendy's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, finally,\" Wendy cackled. \"We're all together.\"</span></div></div>",

Her various workers, some still with their pregnancies intact and others with smooth, toned middles from Wendy's transfer into Ashley, looked on with fear and caution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give it up, Wendy. You're all alone and totally outnumbered,\" Sarah said, raising one of her PregTech devices and pointing it at the mall's de facto leader. \"Surrender or Antonio will end up with a lot more heirs than he expected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, ah, ah,\" Wendy chided. Sarah hit Wendy with the energy wave, intending to add onto her pregnancy but Wendy's amulet just glowed, pulsing with the six different colors of the various amulets that combined to form it. All that remained were the pride and wrath amulet, held by Catalina and Brandon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-be careful!\" Ashley wheezed, pushing both hands against the mound of belly on top of her. \"She's too dangerous for you all to handle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pff, danger's my middle name,\" Catalina grinned, slipping on a light brown vest. Once on, she darted toward Wendy, snaking around her to grab the slender woman's arms and legs. \"Or rather, it's the middle name of archeologist and treasure hunter, Diana D. Dawson, as seen in Triple D Adventure: Search For The Hidden-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Catalina could finish her sentence, Wendy had already tripped her up and pinned the pregnant actress to the floor. Wendy had one foot on her back, pressing her belly into the golf course. \"You were saying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" Catalina thought out loud as Wendy bent down and snatched the amulet off of her neck. \"That's a lot harder to do when I'm not working with a stunt team. And I don't get 50 takes to get it right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy combined the pride amulet with her own, cackling and marveling at her new glowing gem. \"Only one left,\" she said, turning her mossy eyes to Brandon. \"And no offense but I think you'll be the easiest one to stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon gulped and held his greed amulet up. \"I can't let you do this, Wendy. You're treating all these pregnant women like slaves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please, like that's any better than you treating them as pieces of meat?\" Wendy laughed. \"How many of the women here have you fucked in the past few days?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying to be better. And at least I really do care about these women,\" Brandon said. \"As for your offer of turning Ashley and Erin into sex zombies or whatever, no thanks. I like them the way they are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you'll feel that way,\" Wendy smiled, snapping her fingers. Instantly, Ashley's eyes bugged out and she pushed hard into the ground. With a grunt, she managed to turn her colossal pregnant belly over until it came down, crashing into the earth and trapping all of the PregTech team. Brandon was just barely out of the way and looked in horror as his pregnant friends and comrades were stuck under an even larger belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what happened?\" Ashley moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The mind wipe is tricky to pull off and since I didn't have the time to erase your memory, I thought I'd add something to it,\" Wendy said. \"A little subconscious cue. Now then, for that amulet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Wendy walked toward Brandon, the remaining man too paralyzed with fear to run, there was a flash of golden skin as Rebecca swung her fist. Wendy dodged and looked unfazed as the swollen spy panted, a look of rage in her eyes. \"I'm not under your thumb anymore, you bitch,\" Rebecca growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rebecca, you look terrible,\" Wendy giggled. \"Exhausted too. Did something happen recently?\" As Rebecca howled and darted forward again, Erin darted to intercept and effortlessly deflected the spy's blows. \"I was wondering when you would get here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was doing final checks on the satellite, empress,\" Erin said in her brainwashed monotone. \"It will be ready for launch momentarily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect. Once the amulet is complete, it will be able to convert the entire planet to pregnant woman instantly. Save for Mr. Page here but maybe we can keep him in a zoo or something so people can see the last remaining male,\" Wendy said. \"Oh, and Rebecca's baby boy should be there too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca may have lost her wrath amulet but she was still filled with fury as she battled Erin. But with her own fatigue from just giving birth combined with Erin's focus from her mind wipe, the oversized secret agent was slowing down while Erin stood strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then,\" Wendy said, striding forward. \"The amulet.\" Just as Wendy grabbed it off of Brandon's body, there was a loud horn honking. Wendy turned to see a golf cart racing toward them with Tanner behind the wheel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brandon! Get on!\" Tanner yelled. Wendy narrowly avoided the cart as Brandon got on. In the back, hanging on barely, was Kim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that big blob...Ashley?\" Kim asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but we have more important things to worry about,\" Brandon said. \"Though I'm surprised to see you both together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We both care about your mother, even if it's in different ways now,\" Tanner said. \"And Sarah is still my daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, did Wendy have any technology at the mall you didn't know about?\" Brandon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, why?\" Kim said before turning and looking past her own belly and breasts to see Wendy running and gaining on the golf cart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so close! I'm not letting you get away now!\" Wendy screamed, leaping into a spear tackle. She hit Kim in the belly, making the swollen tan woman squeal and tipping the cart over. Tanner and Brandon rolled out, just in front of the satellite. As Brandon weakly tried to stand up, Erin was already on top of him and held him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally,\" Wendy sighed, daintily holding her combined amulet as Erin removed Brandon's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin looked between Brandon and his adopted father. \"Are these...men?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, soon to be the last ones,\" Wendy said. \"Now then, the amulet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which one is Brandon?\" Erin asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The young one. Now, the amulet!\" Wendy shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin helped Brandon up and looked him over. She touched his hand against her belly. \"You're...the father?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Brandon said with a nervous laugh. \"But I...love you. Do you remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe groaned, holding her head and her belly. \"I feel...alone. Empress said only she cares for me but when I'm with you, my chest feels...warm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon stepped forward, pressing against her belly, feeling his own face blushing too. \"Erin, please, it's me. She can't have made you forget about the two of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin looked into Brandon's eyes and started blushing brighter and brighter. \"Brandon? I feel...weird. My head is all...hazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you remember?\" Brandon cooed, taking her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin bit her lip and gently hugged him. \"I remember liking...this. Being with...you.\" She kissed him softly and the two hugged, gripping his amulet tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy grunted and strode forward, stepping over Tanner in the process. \"If you want something done right,\" she said to herself as she grabbed the amulet out of Brandon's hands. It combined with her own and the two began wrestling over the one, true, combined amulet. It crackled with energy and glowed like a far off star in the sky. \"It's mine! It's all mine! I will control the world and there will be order in my empire!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep inside the amulet, there was still a piece of Yaral's intent. And what Yaral craved was chaos. For a long time, it had gone along with Antonio and Wendy because it saw chaos in their future. But if Wendy was going to conquer the world once and for all...that was it for chaos. So with a bolt of energy, Wendy's hands were thrown off the amulet and Brandon stood tall with the powerful bauble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">I knew it would be you</span> a sinister voice said in Brandon's head. <span class=\"clred\">How are you going to use all this power?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon looked over at his team trapped underneath Ashley. Using the amulet, he returned her fetuses to the women around the golf course who had their transferred into her. Ashley shrank down to her previous size, which was hardly small, but she was a bit more normal now and all the working women from the country club were back to being swollen and fertile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Good, good! Now, let's keep spreading that power around the world! Really mix things up!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon looked down at the amulet and thought about everything that had happened in the past weeks or so since he came across it. He thought about all the women he had sex with and all the things Sarah built. But he also thought about the hearts he'd broken and the war between PregTech and the mall. So, looking into Erin's eyes one more time, he tossed the amulet into the satellite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim, how do I launch this?\" Brandon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Wendy screamed as Kim weakly crawled over and typed in the proper codes. The machine rumbled to life and began to launch into the sky. As it reached the upper atmosphere, it got faster and faster until it was gone, drifting through the vast expanse of space until it broke apart. The amulet floated out into the recesses of space, possibly to one day find another universe or dimension and find new hosts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon sighed and looked down at Erin, who nodded and smiled at him. They kissed and held each other in their arms as Brandon looked up again. \"It's over.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Deep in the upper west coast of America, in a big valley two hours from shore was a delightful cheery place called Smallton. Life for the Smalltonians would be forever changed when a mysterious wave of industry, technology and biological genius came to town. I\u2019m BBN reporter Nicola Farris and this is the documentary of how Smallton, became the fertile luxurious city known as Frejyabourne. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy story begins at the most important piece of Freyjabourne\u2019s history, the Preggomall. Starting off as a simple arcade it was purchased 5 years ago by a man by the name of Antonio Greene. Over the years it grew astronomically and now is one of the high end maternity companies in the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt should be mentioned that when you come to Freyjabourne as a woman I felt so welcome meeting the many pregnant women in this city. When I arrived at the Preggomall I felt like I was taking a step into the future, almost like an exclusively women's Silicon Valley. Stores were selling highly advanced technologies and gadgets that felt years beyond our time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI made my way to see the CEO of this fine establishment, and I have to tell you Kim is one of the most humble leaders I've met. I sat down and had a discussion about the recent events that lead her to becoming the CEO of such an important company. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it was quite an interesting venture\u201d Kim claimed as she drank a cup of tea. \u201cWhen I started working for the Preggomall, Freyjabourne was still called Smallton, in fact it was a few weeks until the name Freyjaton was being used\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was curious, I thought this place was called Freyjabourne, but apparently it had been changed fairly recently, to commemorate the recent events that shaped this town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter a previous CEO\u2019s blunders I decided it was time to fix the notorious natures that the Preggomall was known for.\u201d Kim continued. \u201cOnce that CEO was locked up behind bars, the sweetest man whom helped my partner decided to join in with the rebuilding. Oh hello lackey, so you have those new numbers for me?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man by the name of Tanner begrudgingly entered the office wearing a somewhat tight and odd looking suit. After Kim whispered into the accountant\u2019s ear he went on to introduce himself. In an annoyed and tired manner he said to me \u201cHello there madam, my name is Tanner and I am the lead accountant and I am absolutely delighted to see you make a documentary about our ever so brave and Intelligent leader.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanner left the room and Kim went on to mention how a man by the name of Brandon Page helped for a strategic relationship between the Preggomall and Preg-Tech and how they had just announced PTP Industries. After our initial conversation Kim went on to show me the Mall and how it is run. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking through each of the stores I noticed the PTP logo on most appliances, including a tablet run program that can help each business communicate with each other. \u201c As you can see the food court has some fully fledged restaurants inside, serving some elegant cuisines from across the globe\u201d Kim told me as she waddled around with her large midsection. \u201cThe furniture has all been constructed to work with the pregnant form\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was amazed not just by the work she was able to do but how much she could whilst pregnant. \u201cOh please this is simple, the one that has been doing the hard work is an ex-coworker I know that has been running her own security firm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe had sadly run out of time, Kim had to be at Prenatal Yoga with a woman by the name of Janice. But I had to ask my self, where do I go to next on this journey? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decided to find out who ran this security company. If Kim could vouch for her, then she surely must be good. She didn't want to put her face on camera, but was happy to talk about how this city changed her life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComing into this town I wouldn't realise that I would become a mother\u201d the owner answered through a voice modulator. \u201c my history had been questionable, and When I started going into labour, I thought my life was over. That's when a young man called Brandon came and helped me realise that I could live a new life in this fantastic town!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we continued the lady talked about her children. \u201cWell, they are both 6 months old, they are currently with my boyfriend who is one of  the yoga teachers at the Preggomall. I have truly been blessed\u201d she smiled, finishing the conversation off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the name Brandon again I asked if I could meet with him, but alas she told me she had no clue as to the man's whereabouts. She did however give me directions to my next location. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn what looked like a newly built part of the city, I found myself on set of \u2018the Forbidden Curve\u2019 a dramatic soap opera about lesbians in a lingerie store. After watching a take I went over to the Director to talk about Freyjabourne. To my discovery, it was none other than the very famous Catalina Carazon! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNicola how good to see you again!\u201d Catalina squealed as she embraced me. During her previous film releases she had been interviewed by me for a documentary on her rapidly rising career. She was the reason why I am doing this documentary on Freyjaboune. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a break from her busy schedule to have a talk with me about her career change. \u201c During my time here I realised I was talking all about the experiences that my characters had. I couldn't help telling my eager fans and colleges about the movies I was in.\u201d Looking over to her crew I noticed they had an admiration for the glowing star. \u201cAfter the event at the golf club I decided it was time I became that made the stories that people loved, not just starred in them.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was lucky enough to meet some up coming stars hat would make their debut in this show. Just like most of the women on the streets these women were pregnant too, but it was almost as if I was looking at a whole new league of pregnancy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst up was a woman widely known through the pop culture community as \u2018Princess Becka\u2019. She sported the most children of the cast and had the most to say about it. \u201c I tell you I have tried for-ever to find a way to induce labor but as you can see, nothing worked. I consulted Catalina and she told me to embrace it, then she offered me a role in her new show, to which I happily accepted!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was incredible to see a woman of Beckas age supporting a belly of sheer size. When I asked her about supporting that many children she said \u201cI'm afraid there are women at similar sizes to me.\u201d Pointing across the set I could see the famous actresses Hayley Hewitt and Ashlee Byron with a couple of other actresses. Every actress sat down with me including the two new comers Joelle Banks and Ashley Page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur new careers are fantastic!\u201d Joelle joyfully squealed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter the mess that rocked our lovely little town, it's finally good to have something great come from all this!\u201d Ashley added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter a man by the name of Brandon, (who we know like very well) Hayley and I decided to take up on their offer of dropping by.\u201d  Ashlee said as she held Hayley's hand. \u201cThat's where we met Catalina and after some bridges were mended we started a new life here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust be aware of Ashlee and Ashley.\u201d Hayley interjected \u201c you and I Nicola, we know all too well about strange bed fellows\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the names Brandon and Page again I wondered if Ashley knew anything more about our mysterious do gooder. We sat down and had a good one in one about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI- helped raise Brandon from a very young age. Sadly his parents passed away when he was a baby and I was his next of kin.\u201d Ashley solemnly started. Her frown changed to a grin as she continued. \u201cHe has always thought the best of my family and has always tried to do what's best for us, even if we aren't technically related\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to learn more. This person had some how shaped the town drastically! \u201cWhy has everyone been so secretive of this Brandon fellow?\u201d I asked trying my best to consider the step mothers feelings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell once all the chaos died down Brandon had to deal with someone that caused most of the madness in the town. Brandon spent the next few months rebuilding the town. As an engineer he managed to get the process quickly completed.\u201d Ashley proudly claimed. A slightly sad tone could be heard in her voice though. \u201cBut something was a wry, he knew if this person could not be trusted to stay there.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew Ashley and I would meet again, but she believed the story could only be continued by a lovely lady called\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Booked my appointment and A few days later I was meeting Katie Johnson who was PTP\u2019s CFO. Located in the business section of Freyjabourne their building towered over the neighbouring businesses. I was about to enter when I got received a message from an unknown number. It read<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[I hope you had fun with Kim, a woman like her can\u2019t be trusted]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to call the number but it didn't work. Realising I was running late I ran into the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking it to the 29th floor I was welcomed to a vey lovely office. There was a cubical section for all their young interns and new employees and I walked past their break room with some large and comfy chairs. Heading upstairs I noticed that PTP was very accommodating for their employees, all of which were and still are heavily pregnant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie's assistant showed me into her office before leaving in a hurry. It felt odd being alone in this large office by myself, a feeling that became worse when I saw steam escape from the door on the other side of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the door opened I was amazed by what I had seen. A petite woman had come out in a business suit and a towel wrapped around her head. I was amazed to see that she was supporting one of the heaviest pregnancies in the office. I had no idea how this young woman was supporting such a pregnancy that would break anyone's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere's all the steam coming from?\u201d I asked, concerned that it might damage the office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that's just the sauna next door\u201d answered Katie as she dried out her hair. \u201cI'm sorry about that but my blasted assistant is still understanding things like giving me prior notice to when guests arrive\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I asked her about Freyjabournes evolution, she gave me a delicate smile and spoke from the heart. \u201c these past couple of years have been a blast. We had our troubles here and there but things really came together when the Preggomall and Pregtech came to create PTP. We understood that the Preggomall can really relate to their audience and we make the highest quality products. It's clear to say it was a simple fit.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went on to talk about when they decided to make this step moving forward. She, Kim and their partner Sarah were going to help revolutionise pregnancy in the world today. Just like Elon Musk they had five goals for the next ten years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.\tTo throw away any negativity that comes with pregnancy. <br>\r\n2.\tEnd endometriosis and other diseases that leave people sterile <br>\r\n3.\tDeliver a service across America that helps all pregnant women at every stage. <br>\r\n4.\tProvide an energy supplement that will help lower pollution levels<br>\r\n5.\tTackle Issue one and three on a global scale.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to talk about why each of those goals were important but we had a special guest arrive. Sarah Page, PTP industries founder and CEO came in and discovered us filming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's going on here?\u201d She profusely demanded. After a brief explanation a discussion  and some contemplation by Sarah and her legal team, it was deemed okay. Just like Kim I noticed how Sarah had a confident stride mixed in with her waddle, she gracefully glided through the halls with a belly that was almost rubbing both of the walls. I didn't want to say but her belly did get stuck as she entered her office. After a little push she apologised and told me how they were refitting the door this week. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie, Sarah and I went into Sarah\u2019s corner office and discussed the people who helped out with PTP whilst I tried to uncover more about this Brandon fellow. \u201cKim and I knew there was a lot of discord in Freyjaton, so after the Country Club Offensive  We chose to form a partnership. We sat on the grass of the golf course and discussed what we wanted. In the end we formed PTP, a company that provides  a pregnancy and electronic service across America.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you tell us about the Country Club Offensive?\u201d I asked, curious as to what happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c In order to tell you that I think you should know about the person that tried to take us down\u201d Sarah claimed with a most concerned look. \u201cWendy Greene, wife of Antonio Greene was the previous CEO of the Preggomall. She manipulated many of my fellow colleges and friends and almost cost he reputation of this fine city. Everything came to a head when she caused an event that changed the life of thousands in Freyjaton. We confronted her at the Country Club and we stopped her from changing other people's lives.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I ask where she is now?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe was arrested and is seeing multiple life sentences but a woman as manipulative as her always finds a way out. She escaped and is somewhere out there. Hell she could be in Tijuana for all I know!\u201d Sarah answered as her phone rang. \u201cHello? No you know where Brandon is. Yes I\u2019m with Nicola now, okay fine when I find it, I will give it to her.\u201d Normally we don't include phone calls in documentaries but I had to find out more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, Sarah Page, as in sister of Brandon Page?\u201d I questioned the CEO. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looked at me, said goodbye and hung up the phone. \u201cI forget you camera guys like to catch everything on camera. Yes I am his sister, but Brandon has said that he wants his privacy. Being my step brother we had some strange emotions binding between us. Not bad strange, a lot of it was good. The day after the CCO Brandon started fixing any wrongs he had made. Brandon and his fia- oh I guess it was still girlfriend back then decided that the right thing to do was to stop the violence and start building the foundation that would take Freyjaton into being Freyjabourne I\u2026 I-noti- I I I\u2026.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie could see Sarah was finding it hard to talk so she continued. \u201cWe could see that when he wasn't outside or with Erin- \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKatie!\u201d Sarah yelled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, you can cut that out right?\u201d Katie asked me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah we can stuff like that out\u201d I reassured her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, When he was on his own, or when he thought no one was looking, he would start to look adrift. He would grab something from his pockets and just slowly rub it like he was holding a large penny.\u201d Katie said, looking into her glass of water. \u201cI  haven't seen what he was holding, but on occasion I saw a red glow come from his breast pocket. About six months ago, it seemed like he was never sure of himself, and a certain red headed girlfriend decided that they needed time away from Freyjabourne.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were nearing the end of our discussion when my phone started buzzing. I had received another message from that unknown number. After excusing myself  I tried to ring it, but I was left with a dead dial tone. The message read <br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Don\u2019t trust the PM, how can a mall have that much energy?]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning my phone off I excused myself to see the facilities. Looking the text over again I knew something suspicious was up. There was an incredible amount of pregnant women here, technology had seemed to come leaps and bounds and now I'm receiving texts from someone questioning this cities energy? Coming back I rounded up the interview and decided to head to my next location. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>If PregTech was such a big part of PTP, the economic driving force behind everything in Frejyabourne, then I wanted to see some of their technology for myself. I headed to a large store in downtown Freyjabourne and I was, not surprisingly, surrounding by pregnant women inside. They were of all different ages and sizes, though even the smallest woman would have been the biggest I'd ever seen before coming here on my assignment. Each one was buying products marked with the PTP logo, though one older product still bore the PregTech marker, with the silhouette of a pregnant woman and the company's name inside the belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me,\" I asked one woman who slowly waddled around the store as she picked up a flat, curved piece of metal. \"What is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This? They call them robo-spines,\" the woman said with a little smile, clearly nervous to be on camera. \"They help you walk while you're pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I can see why that would come in handy,\" I chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed back. \"Yes, I already have one but I recently made my belly a lot bigger so I need the upgrade.\" As she indicated, her belly stuck out nearly twice as far as her wingspan and she seemed to have trouble moving around with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter talking with her, I found the two owners of the store: a mother/daughter pair named Clara and Kristina respectively. Clara had the dignified look you'd expect in a high-powered executive while her daughter seemed a little more mischievous. Both carried pregnancies that boggled the mind, though still nothing compared to what I'd seen at the PTP headquarters or on the TV set with Catalina and Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you both worked in this business for very long?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was part of another engineering company about a year ago,\" Clara said. \"My husb...I mean, my wife ran it but I was the de facto CEO so it was easy when I transitioned over.\" She snickered. \"Pregnancy has not been easy on my dear Tyra so she let me take over officially.\" Clara placed one hand on Kristina's belly and began to stroke it. \"And I'm hoping to prepare my daughter to take over one day too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So selling PTP's products must go over well in a town with so many women expecting,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Expecting' implies they're going to give birth soon,\" Kristina laughed, giving her enormous middle a few slaps. \"I'm planning on keeping these brats in here for a good long time. Being pregnant is fun but I don't want to be a mom yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could see both women glaring at each other so I cleared my throat and tried to move on to another question but Clara cut me off. \"PTP sells many products that pregnant women find useful but what companies like us do is offer customization. We can reprogram and upgrade devices where PTP doesn't have the time...at least not yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" I said, making a few notes. \"And Clara, you seem to be married and happy but is dating hard in this town? Is it hard to see someone when you're pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if you're into pregnant women already,\" Kristina snickered again. \"There aren't a lot of options for guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I keep hearing about one man...Brandon Page,\" I said. \"Have you dated him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristina and Clara's faces both flushed. \"Once,\" Kristina growled. \"He ended up being a dweeb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that's enough for this interview,\" Clara said as two wide-bellied security guards came over. With that, I left and was a bit lost for my next location. I looked over the cards I'd been snuck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n[how can a mall have that much energy?]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, I went back to the mall to try and investigate for myself. With so many women with enormous bellies, it was easy to move around unseen. After all, most of them could not even see their own legs and I am not a tall woman. I got past the pregnant hoards and found a basement. It was surprisingly deep and there appeared to be labs where the mall was testing new technology. I didn't dawdle and chose to focus on the task at hand: PreggoMall's energy supply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed what appeared to be power lines to a series of large metal doors and heard cries and whimpers from inside one of them. Terror struck me: they were torturing women or keeping them prison. I knew such a perfect town could not exist. Getting my camera ready, I burst into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Kim and Ashley were writhing on a mattress, with the mall's CEO sucking the large, swollen breasts of the actress while struggling to stroke her naked lap. Ashley was screaming in ecstasy, with one hand rubbing her own belly and one rubbing Kim's. They were sweaty and glistening as Ashley's cries got higher and higher until she could no longer be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that climax hit, Kim grabbed a large cable and affixed it to Ashley's popped-out belly button. There was a crackle of energy and I could hear machinery start to turn. Ashley collapsed onto the mattress and continued to pant and moan as Kim turned to me. \"Ms. Farris...I wish you'd called if you wanted a follow-up interview.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Ashley settled into her orgasm, Kim explained everything to me. She was planning on keeping this a secret until the next technology expo but she figured this was as good a time as any. PTP had been working on an alternative energy source for months and they had now perfected it. The contents of a woman's womb could be turned into pure energy. This eliminated all kinds of risks: women who did not want to give birth would not have to, it made women near-invulnerable and imbued many other health benefits, and it provided a massive amount of clean energy. Kim and Sarah Page were even working on a way to let this power source run their special pregnancy cars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI asked if Ashley would never be able to give birth and Kim said it was a temporary process. Women could administer a dose and turn their wombs into energy for as long as they wanted and it was easily reversible. Kim also found that, when tapping into the energy, women in orgasm produced more and the hornier the better. As such, Ashley herself was enough to power not just the mall, but the entire city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soon, all women will have this option and we can eliminate all other energy sources,\" Kim said with a big smile. \"Now you know why we wanted a better platform to announce it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI promised to hold off on this part of the story until around the time they were going to make the announcement but in return, I wanted information on Brandon Page. Ashley was in no condition to talk just yet so Kim directed me to some friends of Brandon's at the city hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the improvements in technology, the hospital now did little else besides deliver babies for women who were ready to give birth and treat pregnant patients from outside the town. This was the division of Brandon's friends Gwen, Grace, and Mara. Gwen, who had the biggest pair of breasts I've seen in my life, waddled forward as Grace shook my hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, I'm Grace and I run the Outside Natal Health Clinic here,\" she said. \"Mara is our top researcher and Gwen here is my assistant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" Gwen smiled, waving and smacking her chest in the process. \"Ouch...sorry, that happens a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PTP is working on some kind of support for her,\" Grace giggled softly, rubbing her own belly. It was much smaller than others I'd seen. Gwen's looked small too but I think it was just a matter of perspective with her bosom. \"Let's walk and talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown the hall, there were many women \u2013 some pregnant and some not. The pregnant ones mostly looked like normal women with maybe only one or two fetuses inside them. \"First, let's meet Mara,\" Grace said, opening the door to a lab. Mara was, to my surprise, not pregnant but she was at a table with many chemicals and pieces of PTP tech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" Mara said, shaking my hand as she introduced herself. \"Grace and Gwen and I have been good friends for a long time so when Grace announced she was creating this clinic, I knew I wanted to join.\" She put one hand over her stomach. \"I've been infertile for a lot of my life so working on curing infertility and helping other women become pregnant has been close to my heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've still had success with the process and help outside women reach their goals,\" Gwen said. \"And a lot end up with many more babies than they anticipated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we can also cure a lot of pregnancy complications here,\" Grace said. \"It's a mix of our hard work and the great tech over at PTP.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gwen and Mara kissed a bit, I turned to Grace and asked if she knew where Brandon Page might be, explaining my interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Grace said, looking over Gwen and Mara. \"Well...I guess his honeymoon had to end sometime.\" They got out their phones, also PTP-branded, and found an address for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to talk to Brandon, that's where he'll be,\" Gwen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI loaded up my news van and headed out and it turns out their directions were-</span></div></div>",

Actually, signs and maps told me it used to be part of a neighboring, wealthier city with a large country club and convention center but as it had its own sudden outbreak of extreme pregnancies and seemingly no male population, the two merged in the period where Freyjaton became Freyjabourne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this country club where I was told I could find the elusive Brandon Page. With large swimming pools and an athletic center for gentle workouts, it seemed to be the perfect place for expectant women carrying massive loads who would want a load off. But the whole place was empty as I drove up, yet the grounds seemed to be well taken care of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere I met my first person as an older woman came up to me and politely asked me to leave. \"I'm sorry, the club has been rented out for a private event for the next few months,\" she said. She was clearly too old to be pregnant but her eyes settled on my own flat stomach and she grinned. \"You must be from out of town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am. Nicola Farris, journalist,\" I said, shaking the woman's hand. \"I was told I could talk with Brandon Page here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the old woman, who told me she was the owner, was trying to tell me I was still going to need to leave, she got a call. I could hear a young man's voice on the other end but couldn't make out what he was saying. \"Mr. Page said his friends called him to let him know you were coming. He says it's alright.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling and thanking the woman, I walked into the large club house, which was totally empty but I could hear the sound of cooing and panting echoing through the halls. I followed the sound to a large room where an enormous mattress was set up, its sheets lifted into the air by the largest pregnant belly I had seen yet. I'd seen the photos of the women in Freyjabourne before starting my report and knew to expect some strange things but this defied belief. Whoever this belly was attached to, it looked like she was gestating a pair of whales inside there, though I had to admit her skin was still had a smooth sheen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, you must be Nicola,\" a young man said as he got off of the bed. He was blushing and sweating a bit but he had changed into a robe. The pregnant woman, a gorgeous red head, wrapped the sheets close to her swollen breasts, exposing more and more of her belly in the process. \"I'm Brandon and this is my wife Erin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you,\" Erin and I said in unison. \"I have to admit, you're a hard man to track down,\" I added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We really wanted to get away for our honeymoon,\" Erin smiled, stroking Brandon's arm. \"Things got a little crazy a few months ago so we wanted some...quality time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I see,\" I said, blushing as the two made doe eyes at one another. I had clearly interrupted them as they...broke in their honeymoon suite, let's say. \"H-have you been having fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lots,\" Erin purred, leaning her massive body forward to kiss Brandon on the lips. He smiled and touched one hand to her belly, taking in her size and tightness. \"We had to rent this place out so I had room to get as big as possible. Luckily, the owner is a friend and decided she owed us a favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get bigger?\" I asked. \"I'd heard some other women in Freyjabourne talk about making their pregnancies larger but how exactly does that work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freyjabourne. I'll never get used to that name,\" Brandon said, shaking his head as he held up a small device. \"This was one of the first big inventions my sis...I mean, my step-sister came up with. She found a way to tap into the fundamental 'essence' and 'energy' of pregnancy and could tamper with it. With this, you can make your pregnancy bigger, smaller, get rid of it all together, or even make yourself pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you chose to...make yours bigger, I take it,\" I said, gesturing to all of Erin. She laughed and started rubbing her bare stomach where I saw the impressions of some kicks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's fun,\" Erin said. \"Just feeling yourself getting more fertile and motherly. Plus, I think I look good with the belly and I know Brandon agrees.\" She put one hand on his thigh, which made the newly married man jolt up a bit. \"Don't you think I look good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped, seeing Erin's pink lips glisten and part, her eyes flash, her breasts rise and fall with her breath, and her pregnant stomach looking so powerful and lovely. \"Y-you look nice,\" I said, thinking about my own private desires to be a mother one day...or at least be pregnant. But this busy job has its downsides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show her, Brandon. Use it on her,\" Erin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't think that's necessary,\" Brandon said, his cheeks turning even redder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I meant to ask, everyone seems to attribute you with helping the town out,\" I said. \"Ashley, Sarah, Catalina, Kim, Katie, the head of the security firm,\" I said, not wanting to reveal that woman's name, as per her request. \"What exactly did you do all those months ago?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon gulped and looked nervous but Erin patted him on the back and seemed to give him a little burst of confidence. \"While the old owners of the mall were looking into pregnancy technology, I...stumbled across a few ideas of my own. Some got a little out of hand but everyone else picked up on them. Katie, Ashley, especially Sarah, did a lot with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they seem to have a deeply personal connection with you,\" I said, pressing the issue. It'd taken me so long to find this man, I wanted to at least get some answers out of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were...friends. Close friends,\" Brandon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very close friends, in most cases,\" Erin chuckled, giving Brandon a harder pat on the back. \"But I've been there too. I've gotten to be close friends with a lot of them too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought I was picking up on the subtext correctly and raised my eyebrows. \"I-Is that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin smiled and nodded, stroking her belly in bigger and bigger circles. \"One hell of a bachelorette party, let me tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...think you'll keep your pregnancy this size for long?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's great for a special occasion but I couldn't last this big forever,\" Erin laughed, giving a playful grunt as she shifted her maternal weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll probably end our honeymoon soon anyway. It's been a long time and we'd like to get back to work and see everyone else,\" Brandon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if I get rid of my pregnancy entirely, we can look into putting a baby inside me the old fashioned way,\" Erin grinned. Brandon turned to his wife in disbelief, a nervous smile quickly crawling up his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you mean it?\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to wait until we were back home but...surprise!\" Erin squealed. The two jumped together to kiss and embrace again, Erin's gigantic belly knocking over the pregnancy device in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...oops,\" Erin said, looking me over. \"Sorry about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" I said, looking down at my new, swollen belly that burst through my clothes. I don't know how I looked to them but I felt enormous. There must have been at least triplets squirming around inside me and I looked ready to pop at the drop of a hat. \"I think it looks good on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I agree,\" Brandon gulped. Erin snickered and started to lower her bedsheet to reveal more cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same. Hey, why don't we end this honeymoon on a bang?\" Erin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's where I decided it would be a good place to end my report. What started as a simple assignment turned into a new place to live for me. The women and Brandon helped me learn to love pregnancy and everyone here is so nice. If you can make it, move out to Freyjabourne, especially women! From Nicola Farris, newly assigned to Freyjabourne full-time, good night!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe TV shut off in an instant as Wendy threw the remote to the ground. She was alone in her penthouse apartment, rented under an alias. Well, not totally alone. She had her daughter growing inside her, only a few weeks away from being ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You all have your fun,\" Wendy sneered, stroking her swollen middle. \"Enjoy it while it lasts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA big kick from inside her womb made Wendy sit up and soften her expression, stroking her big belly and speaking in a calming voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, don't get upset. You stay inside me as long as you need,\" Wendy cooed, before looking at the tiny gem she got from the PreggoMall lab before her escape. \"Take your time. We'll get our shot, just be patient.\" The gem gleamed back, a flicker of energy left in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">The End</font></div></span></div></div>",

This was third day in a row at least he didn\u2019t have to hang around this time just drop them off at the class and they can make their own way home, he thought to himself. Of course he was fooling himself and he knew deep down that the first thing they would do when they wanted to go home was call him or possibly Tanner but at least he did walk around the mall with them or watch the prenatal yoga class, a prospect he might of enjoyed otherwise if it wasn't for the fact the his mother's and sister's size would over shadow everyone else their, quite literally. Not surprisingly when they arrived at the mall Sarah and Ashley needed help getting out of the car, Brandon tried not to look at them when doing this so he didn't notice the amulet nestled in Sarah's cleavage. With a lot self control Brandon did not look at the gravid female members of his family waddle off and instead looked at the map on his phone, he was going find that garage sale (or at least the house where it was) and get some answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley and Sarah made their way into Mamaste where they were greeted by Janice at the door. \"Here's the fertile family, you are looking gradient especially you Ashley\" she said. Sarah tried to look a diminutive as possible not an easy feat considering she was carrying four times as many babies as most of the women there but she managed it. This was most likely because of Ashley who being pregnant with sextuplets dwarfed even her daughter, she waved to multitude of women around the room smiling. This was met with disgruntled looks and a few glares, the Pages weren't particularly popular. Most of the woman were approaching full term and felt as large and cumbersome as elephants, hippopotamuses or other large grey animals and they found that the multiple bearing Pages made a mockery of this especially Ashley, who despite her age and size seemed to be carrying pregnancy the easiest. Ashley seemed not to notice the reception she received, \"That's the hour,\" said Janice, \"I think we might start now.\" The dozen women arranged themselves in the middle of the room, with Ashley choosing to sit in the front row, an act which did little to help her standing with the women directly behind her. Conversely Sarah slunk to the back of the class which gave her a view of everyone, only when she sat down did she realize that the she forgot to take off the amulet, which she knew would get in the way all class, but it was too much effort to get up and put it over with the rest of her stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie drummed her fingers on the counter, business had been really slow this morning, only two women had came in, one who was only four months pregnant and another who recently given birth and had came in to pick up a nursing bra. Katie was unaware of  the existence of 'Mamaste: Prenatal Exercise for Mother and Child' a fact that might explain why she hadn't volunteered to help there. She had amulet that modify pregnancy whose abilities she had seen with her own eyes and now there were no decent sized pregnant women to use it on. She fiddled with amulet absentmindedly thinking about what she could do with it, she could give all the babies she found into Ashley or inversely give all of Ashley's babies to a woman who wasn't pregnant and watch them burst out of their clothes. She was so lost in her thoughts that she didn't notice a eight month pregnant woman waddle into the shop and nearly dropped the amulet when spoken to.<br>\r\n\"Excuse me do you ha...\"<br>\r\n'PING'<br>\r\nThe woman froze mid sentence as her belly deflated, she looked around the shop for a few seconds clearly confused about why she had came in, she gave a sheepish grin and waved to Katie, who had also stopped moving, before walking out of the shop. It was another few seconds before Katie moved, she slowly moved her hand down feeling the 'lower curve' of her stomach a feature her flat stomach didn't have before. She looked down just as slowly and saw that she had acquired the woman's baby and with it the belly. She hadn't intended this to happen, a common thought to women who find themselves pregnant, but as she absentmindedly now rubbed her belly she had new a feeling a sort of hunger (she also had a regular hunger as well) she wanted more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon looked at the side of the road, he was sure that this was the stop sign that the garage sale sign was on. Not only was the sign gone, which wasn't weird in itself, but there was no right turn only a left turn. On his right was a wooded track that might of been a walking track but there was no sign of the garage sale at all. He pulled his car over off the road and got out, something was not quite right and he was going to find out what was going on. He had to otherwise he was going to get half a dozen new siblings and four nieces or nephews, another thing Brandon didn't know was that it was more than that now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would of been an interesting class to anyone who could see what was going on but no one attending it was aware. Every time Sarah changed position the amulet sparked and babies changed location, women would suddenly find themselves free of child and confused about why they were there before getting up and leaving, many of them receiving a child or two before they got to the door only to lose them again once they sat down. Lycra and sweat pants were let lax or stretched as their owners unwittingly played a game a kin to musical chairs or pass the parcel. By the end of class only three women remained. Sarah would not be pleased to know that she ended with one more baby then she started with and about the same size as  the class instructor Janice, who had gained four of her former instructee's children but both were dwarfed by Ashley whose already immense size seemed to give her a gravity to attract more babies as she gained four new babies and was now carrying double digits.<br>\r\n\"I don't know why you sat so far back Sarah,\" said Ashley, \"we're the only people in the class.\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe because you're so big and you taking up all the space,\" joked Janice struggling to get to her feet.<br>\r\n\"I got ten in here what's your excuse,\" joked back Ashley.<br>\r\n\"Well thank you for coming along,\" said Janice crossing to Sarah and helping her up, \"it's going to be difficult raising these five by myself and if I didn't get paid to do these classes I'm not sure what I'd do, I can't think why there are so few ladies having children.\"<br>\r\n\"Well I'm sure Sarah and I more then make up for that.\"<br>\r\nSarah and Janice helped Ashley to her feet, \"Good god...how much...do you weigh?\" panted Janice.<br>\r\n\"I don't know it's been sometime since I've been able to read a scale.\"<br>\r\n\"There another class next week,\" said Janice as the three women ponderously made their way to the door, \"do you think you'll be able to make it?\"<br>\r\n\"I've got a few more weeks to go,\" said Ashley rubbing her belly completely exposed since she recently acquired a few more children, \"I'm not sure these clothes will last it though.\"<br>\r\n\"I need some new workout clothes too,\" said Janice whose own growing baby bump had done something similar to her workout clothes.<br>\r\n\"Oooh you know where you should go,\" said Ashley to Janice, \"there is a really nice maternity shop in this mall, and there's a really sweet girl who works there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie waddled into the back room of the shop, her bra had snapped, her employee shirt was stretched to tearing point over it, the zipper on her pants had burst open giving the world a clear view of the lower curve of her triplet filled belly clad in a pair of pastel pink underpants that were incredibly tight\u2026she felt great. She crossed the room, empty except some boxes of unpriced stock and her, but given the fact there was now quite a lot of her the room seemed relatively crowded, she sat down on the single chair in the room which groaned under her weight causing Katie grin and feel faint flutter of excitement, she really had to find a set of scales to weigh herself. For as long as she could remember Katie was awed by pregnancy this job was originally amazing as it allowed her to see, talk to and, if she was feeling bold, to touch women who were pregnant and now it was a wardrobe and hunting ground already she had snatched another two pregnancies from women who had left the shop rather confused about why they had entered it in the first place. Though there had been plenty more who had entered the shop but Katie was only interested in \u2018big game\u2019 targets, women who were near full term, no runts for her, beside she didn\u2019t want this affect the shops business too much as they might decide to reduce staff and the pregnant girl would probably be the first to go. Of course this put her at risk giving birth, She only wanted to carry not raise the brats not raise them and so she made sure that she could give the babies back (or at least to someone else), and the greatest thing about this amulet was that no one else seemed to notice anything, they acted as the one who was pregnant had always been pregnant. She looked over at the mirror on the far wall, which up until this morning showed a petite young girl but now showed a young woman who was the very symbol of fertility, she rubbed her belly lovingly whilst crooning \u201cmirror, mirror on the wall whose the most pregnant of them all,\u201d and whilst the mirror continued to show her the thought of the women in the Page family crept into her mind, both the mother and daughter were having more than her. Katie switch her focus to the amulet nestled in her now ample cleavage, \u2018but we now know why, and we know how to take it I should really pay them another visit,\u2019 she thought to herself. At the point her belly gave groan and she felt great pang of hunger, that was one down side of being pregnant, her finances were taking a hit from her having to feed her ever increasing number of occupants.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As decisions went, it wasn't the most obvious. But what the hell. Seeing his father pregnant would be good for a laugh if nothing else. And even if this amulet were to be trusted, he could always take it out later with no one being the wiser! To top it all off, his poor parents were so hard at work to secure a good retirement: it was about time they stopped to claim their reward. And, well, a new baby would be just the ticket! Not to mention his mother had already carried two...why burden her further?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEh, it was all a joke, anyway. Brandon decided to complete the ruse for completion's sake. The gentle hum through his bones stilled at the decision flowing to his index finger. Just one digit under the table pointing at his old man, imagine the deed being done...the amulet glowed under his shirt, he could tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Huh? What happened? Everything seemed fine. His father seemed the same as before, eating spaghetti at the...ah. At the rather tall table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd suddenly, Ashley stood up to get a second bowl of spaghetti, setting it down in front of Tanner. His eyes following the bowl, she set it down next to the first, which was being steadily and vigorously emptied by his old man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and those three are really after my sauce!\", exclaimed Ashley. \"I've never had such a satisfied diner since you got pregnant, hon, this is uncharted territory!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose...three?! Perhaps he was a bit too enthusiastic...but his father finished the bowl with spaghetti sauce clinging to his beard here and there, set it down, and beamed like he had just closed a million dollar deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's world-class pasta, hon!\" He slapped his stomach. \"Of course these boys would want every little strand they could get, haha! It'll make them big and strong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...It'll mostly just make you big, though.\" Brandon found himself commenting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanner chuckled, and Brandon could hear his father's hands rubbing his stomach through his shirt. He motioned for Brandon to lean in. \"Well, don't say this to the girls...\", the pregnant man whispered, \"But I hope so. This has been a revelation for me. Hell, I might even do it again, if I can close that deal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis dad seemed to...<i>like</i> being pregnant? His mood certainly improved from before, even if just a little. Brandon reached under his shirt and palmed the amulet. If he really did seem to enjoy this...then taking it away would just deprive him of joy. And Brandon had to admit that having some little brothers started to appeal to him. Well, then. If Dad wanted to be pregnant, then pregnant he would be! Merry Early Christmas!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stretched his arms above him and pulled back in his chair, pulling up his skin-tight shirt to unveil a massive, round, and slightly hairy tummy. He must have been just a hair away from bumping into the table with that thing! His father was <i>huge</i>! As if reading Brandon's thoughts, Tanner scooted back from the table just a bit before going to devour the second bowl. He did it with just his right hand this time, keeping his left on his very big belly, kinda like how his high school chemistry teacher did sometimes when she was expecting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, could you <i>please</i> wear a bigger shirt?\", complained Sarah. \"It's jarring to see your gut every time you move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir mother tutted at her and replied: \"And wait for that shirt to get ruined as well? He's only six months pregnant; he's only going to get bigger. He might as well burst through his old shirts and clear out some closet space.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanner nodded as he slurped down another massive forkful of noodles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething his dad just said came into focus: <i>if I can close that deal</i>. So it was like he thought: Tanner was still working at the office, six months pregnant with triplets, as a 50 year old man. Damned if he wasn't the hardest working man Brandon ever knew! Still...that couldn't be good for him. Something had to be done.</span></div></div>",

Granted, he had never tried before, but it was always clear to see how serious of a work ethic Tanner had. Hell, his mother and sister weren't even trying to dissuade him, he was that dedicated! If he tried to talk him out of it, Brandon would just make a fool of himself and waste everyone's time. No, his dad was going to work whether he liked it or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut something still had to be done. Anything. This was his fault, so he had to take responsibility <i>somehow</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Come to think of it, what was his old man going to wear tomorrow? Nothing in his closet would fit anymore! Even the roomiest of his suits wouldn't cut it, not with how big he was now! Brandon cringed at the guilt of what he did, realizing that even its weight upon his conscience was dwarfed by the weight of three unborn children squirming inside his father's stomach. Womb. Whatever, it was weird and it was real and he needed to speak up before it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanner swallowed the last of the spaghetti, reached around his belly to get the knapkin, wiped his lips clean of the sauce, and shot up his eyebrows at Brandon to show he was listening. He kept eye contact with Brandon as he went for the bread basket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow to phrase this? Perhaps...he had to put on some pressure without sounding condescending. \"You're going to get a new suit before heading off to work tomorrow, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanner stalled in the middle of chewing a piece of toasted French bread and went bug-eyed. His mom did the same, looking ready to kick herself. But his dad made to finish the bread and swallow, still focused on feeding the babies in his swollen and growing belly. He had to be careful, though, or his pregnancy-fattened backside would fatten even more and keep him from getting out of the average-sized chair!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes, of course. I'll stop by the, ah...\" Tanner looked as if he were trying not to smell something nasty, he was grimacing so intently. \"...to the Big and Tall shop after I'm done here. They should have something ready for me tomorrow morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Really?\", asked Sarah and Ashley in unison. They all knew how he felt about establishments that singled out clothing based on size. Well, when men were singled out: he didn't say anything for plus-sized companies whenever the subject came up. Not that he had an opinion, but that he neglected to form one. Brandon was distracting himself while his dad was finding his words. It seemed like he was rubbing near his bellybutton for inspiration. Like Buddha, but heavily pregnant and without a fraction of the wisdom. Probably older than Buddha, too, but that was neither here nor there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really have a choice, do I? Nope! Not a one!\" He hastily shoved another piece of toast in his mouth and chewed with unnecessary vigor. His mom saw his reaction and went to get him another bowl of spaghetti to calm him down, which he would doubtlessly inhale with the rest. The man was not happy. Well, that was what he got for being stubborn!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon finally went back to his dinner before he started getting looks. It was done! <i>Phew!</i> This wasn't much, but it did open some new possibilities. More time spent pondering if going to work was a good decision, for one. But Brandon's hard-working dad was true to his reputation, struggling to make it work even with this \"new\" time constraint. Perhaps some persuasion was in order...but then again, Tanner wasn't <i>stupid</i> and would see sense after enough thought. But would he even think about staying home instead of squeezing that hill of a baby belly into a suit and lugging it into a room of judgmental stockholders and suppliers? Or whoever it was went to these big, important meetings of his?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do, Brandon, you <i>turkey?</i></span></div></div>",

As happy as he seemed, this pregnancy - Brandon took a moment to let that realization grab him, regretting it soon after - was clearly taking its toll on his health as it was. Working in that office would be horrible stress. He couldn't make that presentation in front of so many important people! Hell, Brandon got sweaty just discussing project ideas with his professors <i>casually!</i> If he dared imagine the stress of making a presentation of <i>consequence</i> in front of people who decided whether or not he would get <i>paid</i>...eugh, and all that for a pregnancy, a male pregnancy at that! Brandon had to...he had to...?! What was he going to do?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, this was <i>fantastic</i>. Here his greying old man was, bursting out of his old college T-shirt with...with what looked like growing breasts, oh my, and a belly full of three <i>babies</i>, and the one responsible couldn't keep him safe. Great! Never better! No, no, he was letting himself get discouraged: no engineer worth their salt gave up at a roadblock. He had to think carefully...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Perhaps his dad could postpone the meeting until later? He <i>was</i> heavily pregnant, after all. He could say he overestimated his stamina and request to do it later, when he...is bigger, and slower, and more easily tired; dammit. And they would not wait until Tanner gave birth, even if...shit, could that even work?! W-Well, if it couldn't, then he would just take them out, clean and simple. No need to dwell on that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Although Brandon did shudder a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you cold, hon?\", asked his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-Just a chill, you know how it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah shook her head with a wry smile. \"You've been hovering over that pasta for a while now and staring into space. You know, I call you a dork to tease you, but if the shoe fits...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon stuck out his tongue at her absent-mindedly and swirled a forkful of spaghetti to chew. Strike postponing out, that couldn't work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Perhaps they could cancel the meeting altogether? No, even on the surface, that was ridiculous. His dad went on about millions of dollars being at stake, and no businessperson was going to give that up. Strike two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...He could just...take the pregnancy out and leave things as they were...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah haha!\" Tanner thumped his turgid belly and grinned. \"Filling as always, but it keeps me wanting more! Eh, Ash? Huh...Baby, you look exhausted! Go take a nap after that bite, don't wear yourself out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley tried to wave it off: \"Oh, it's nothing, you need your strength. You're eating for four! I'm happy to help you for somthing as simple as--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanner literally waved it off: \"Go get some rest, hon. You work as hard as I do. And I've got a son here that's barely touched your prize-winning pasta: his punishment is to get me anything I need!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon made to quickly shove some pasta in his mouth, but the jig was up. Was it his fault he lost his appetite when he was panicking?! Oh good grief...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Alright.\" Sarah took one last bite, dabbed at her face with the knapkin, and stood up from the table. \"Brandon, go get your dad another bowl. Believe me, he wants one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yessum...\" Brandon obeyed and endured his father's smug expression, as he took one of the empty bowls and refilled it with the pasta. On the way to the table, Brandon got a startling profile view of the pregnant man. He didn't measure much in inches anymore, but he knew his father wore size 36 waist pants, and they were down around his knees. His shirt was a few X's large in anticipation of pigging out at dinner, and that was full to bursting. If Brandon had to guess, Tanner's belly was around 65 inches now, and he wasn't even full term!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking it out seemed like a better idea now. That couldn't be comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as he set down the bowl, he saw his dad's face was suddenly serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm busy as hell tonight. Tell Mom thanks for me!\" Sarah put the empty bowl in Brandon's now-empty hand and excused herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch your language, missy. But I'll tell her.\" Tanner motioned for Brandon to sit down and tried to lean in, but he clearly thought better of it as his belly bumped into the table. \"OOF! This gut of mine sometimes, I swear...Anyway. Well, I wanted to say this to her, too, but it can wait. You should know that I'm thrilled to bits to be pregnant, boy. I mean, besides feeling pregnant: that's a queer joy in itself, but there's a more important reason. Your mom...bless her heart, we wanted more kids, but she was so exhausted with you and your sister. It was awful, watching her struggle. We just couldn't have any more with how it drained her back then. Nowadays, I'm not so sure...\" Brandon felt weird at the leading sentence, but he decided to dismiss it. \"But we weren't having kids all the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now?\" He pulled Brandon's hand to his swollen stomach, making him feel the pair of feet pressing against the sphere of flesh and the tight T-shirt. \"Now we're going to have the family we always wanted. It'll be pricey, but this account I'm busting my pregnant hump for will make it just fine!\" Tanner released Brandon's now-trembling hand. \"So, here's the thing: maybe show a little more enthusiasm for it, both you and your sister. Your mom would appreciate it. I would too, but you know her, she doesn't complain...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon had nothing to say. Everything his dad said had to be true, and the conclusion was clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Brandon worked past his panicking nerves and rubbed his father's stomach as a show of good faith. Good Lord, it felt weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now, I shouldn't let this get cold! You shouldn't either, eat up, beanpole!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon rolled his eyes and made to eat his dinner. As he ate, the situation returned to him with a new revelation: those babies inside his father were <i>wanted.</i> He couldn't take them out. But...was it worth the trouble if the stress from working made him miscarry, or something equally terrible?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll doors seemed closed. The amulet changed memories upon changing pregnancies...maybe this could all just be chalked up as an experimental failure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a mess...</span></div></div>",

With some effort he lifted his bulk off the couch and rubbed his under-belly tenderly.

She stroked her belly softly while still leaning against Kyle. The two were kissing and talking about how wonderful it felt to be pregnant at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon had to admit, he thought Mary looked cuter with a large baby belly, but he heard something off to his left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh.\" Alicia was rolling her eyes. \"They're so gross, playing with each other's bellies while we have company over.\" She sighed. \"I'm sorry you have to watch this. Come on! Let's go up to my room!\" Alicia seemed completely unaware that a huge belly was hanging off her own body, where it hadn't before. It was noticeably larger than bother her father's and her mother's bellies. It stuck out from the bottom of her tight t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Head start for the pregnant girl!\" She teased, shoving Brandon and pressing him against the wall. </span></div></div>",

He found it interesting that they barely took notice that they were suddenly pregnant when they hadn't been even ten minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also watched Alicia's retreating backside as she bounded up the stairs.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Emily just got promoted, and she couldn't contain her excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter years of laboring in IntraTech, someone finally noticed that she was more than a pretty girl. She had mind so sharp it would put most medieval weaponry to shame. Someone finally saw that she had the guts and was just as capable as any man to thrive in this kill or be killed world. Someone finally saw past her features on the outside and looked deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's not to say that her outside features were anything to laugh at. Standing at about six foot three, Emily is usually quite an imposing figure to her fellow businessmen in those all important board meetings. And that's when she isn't wearing her heels. Now if only being so tall didn't make so her imposing when she was searching for love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen one got past her height, you could see it was mostly made up of her long, toned, smooth legs that meet up with some very curvy, tantalizing thighs. Beyond those assets was a shapely and cute little ass. Higher up on her body rested two nice double D's that were struggling to break free of the power suit that adorned her body. She wanted to be taken seriously, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Emily wasn't busy fighting off the corporate sharks, she liked to hang out with her friends and exercise. And it showed. Muscles rippled across her arms and legs, but not enough to seem crazy, but she was definitely toned. Her abs were proof enough of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you looked up further, you would notice a face like an angel, but her sapphire blue eyes showed you the devilish fires of determination and resolve within her. Her smile parted two luscious rose petals of lips to show teeth so white they could shine, revealing her cute dimples and slight spattering of freckles. She had a cute little nose and waves of golden blonde hair that reached her shoulders. All of these beautiful features were covered in flawless, albeit extremely pale, skin. When in the eat or be eaten world of industry, one didn't really have much time for the outdoors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was most definitely outdoors now. The second she got the news from her boss, she couldn't stop smiling. She quickly took a lunch break ( a rare occurrence for Emily, who was so focused on the job at hand she rarely had time for a lunch.) hurried out of the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she left, she made sure to hi to her friend Laura. \"Hi Laura!\" She said, bubbling over with excitement and joy. \"Hey!\" Laura replied, \"the boss just informed me about you. congratulations! You've earn..oof!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura abruptly cut off her statement and replaced it with a small grunt of discomfort. Emily giggled. \"Little one giving you trouble again?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only a little\" Laura said as she rubbed her full term pregnant  belly in the spot her unborn was kicking. \"I just wish instead of kicking, you can help me with these calls.\" She cooed to her womb.<br>\r\n\"I still don't understand why you don't just take the maternity leave they have been offering you. That you wouldn't have to work while with child.\"<br>\r\n\"I told you, I can't afford maternity leave.\" Laura said. \"You realize they pay you right?\" Emily said.<br>\r\n\"But they pay me more for when I'm working. Being a secretary for IntraTech<br>\r\nDoesn't exactly bring in the big bucks. And you know what rent is like in this city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not anymore. I just got my bonus check with my promotion!\" Emily said barely containing her excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well isn't today just getting better and better for you!\" Laura said. \"That settles it. Tonight, we are celebrating! We'll get everybody and hit the town!\"<br>\r\n\"Whoa, slow down. Are you sure you wanna go party in your condition?\" Emily asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell yeah!\" Laura. \"I haven't been to a party since this little guy was made\" this last part she pointed to her belly for emphasis. \"Besides, all the movement, may kick start labor and I can finally see my beautiful baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright\" Emily said, still not sold on the idea, but knowing it would be impossible to change her friends mind. \"I gotta go, I'm taking a lunch break and going for a jog. I can barely contain my excitement and still remain professional.\" She said, glaring at some first years who just walked by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard their whispers as they walked swiftly away. \"Dude, you do not want to piss off the Amazon. Just walk and don't look back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazon, that was the nickname she had. And with her height, beautiful features, and viciousness in the boardroom, it was a fitting and well deserved nickname.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye Laura.\" Emily said, trying to remain professional.<br>\r\n\"Rock on Amazon.\" Laura replied, ruining said professionalism.<br>\r\nEmily gave her a look of mock anger and headed out her car, got her jogging outfit she kept there for her rare lunch breaks, changed in the car, and proceeded to jog to..well...Wherever. She didn't care, she just got promoted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was when she was quite a ways from the office and alone that Emily Woodward started acting very unprofessional. Clad in running shoes, yoga pants, a sports bra, a ponytail, and nothing else, Emily couldn't contain her excitement any longer. She started jumping, running, screaming and squealing like a teenage girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I GOT PROMOTED!!\" Emily screamed to the heavens. \"YOU HEAR THAT? EMILY WOODWARD IS NOT JUST A PRETTY FACE! SHE IS AN AMAZON!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer preaching to the heavens was abruptly cut off when she ran into a stop sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling herself up from the ground and glad nobody was around to watch her stupidity, Emily noticed a sign underneath the stop sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGARAGE SALE, THE STRANGE AND MYSTERIOUS! TURN RIGHT.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily usually didn't fall for magic mumbo jumbo, but as explained before, Emily just got promoted.<br>\r\n\"What the hell\" she thought. \"Today is already a great day, why not go laugh at people who believe in the strange and mysterious.\" And with that, she turned down the road and headed for the garage sale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took her a bit, but Emily reached the front of a house that wouldn't have looked out of during the civil war. Cars were parked all along the driveway, and people roamed the isles of wooden tables, scanning for who knows what in all those piles of junk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily started to roam around as well and immediately found what she was looking for, a good laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily giggled uncontrollably every time she saw a \"mystical Spell book\" or a \"magic insert object name here\". \"How do people buy in to this stuff?\" She wondered to herself. She saw several people seeming to take this stuff as the gospel truth, and that cracked Emily up more than the junk she found. She saw one kid, old enough to just be back from college, holding some coin in is hand and staring at as if it was alive.\"Jeez, you'd think the coin was talking to him.\" She muttered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on a table in front of her was a beautiful amulet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was simple, yet elegant at the same time. Six opals surrounded and ruby all layered with gold. The opals seemed to change color depending on where Emily stood, blue one way, pink another way, and Emily swore she could she an X carved into the ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very beautiful, is it not?\" Emily jumped, unaware of the man as tall as hers approach. Emily inspected the man, the man had black everything on, from his trench coat to his fedora atop his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello. I am Yaral and I live here. Would you like to buy amulet?\"<br>\r\nHis accent and grammar was strange, as if this was the first time he spoke English.<br>\r\n\"Uhh, I'm just looking\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't fool yourself.\" Yaral pitched. \"You want this amulet. You want it because it is special. You see, this amulet transfers pregnancies.\"<br>\r\nNow he had completely lost Emily. \"Really?\" She asked incredulously. \"I t transfers a woman's pregnancy?\"<br>\r\n\"Not just a woman, but men as well. Anyone to anyone.\" Yaral said with a smile which made Emily uneasy. \"You know you want it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily didn't believe for a second any of this pregnancy crap. But it was a pretty amulet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she did just get promoted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what? I'll take it. Not because of that pregnancy nonsense, but because it's pretty and it would be a good memory for today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful!\" Yaral exclaimed. \" all you must do to use it is point it at who you want the children to go or from, and the children will go into the stones\" he pointed to the Opals around the ruby. \"Then they can go into whoever the user chooses. Once they within their chosen womb, the children become their own in blood and spirit, and everyone will believe they had been that way the whole time. If you ever want to undo it all, just touch the ruby, and all will return to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it hadn't been for her years in business, Emily would never have kept a straight face, but she did and only said \"sure\" as she paid him the five dollars he asked for payment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her new Amulet around her neck, the Amazon quickly jogged back on to the main street and continued on, completely unaware that the pathway to the house in the woods vanished, as if it had never been there at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily jogged...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Stopping to quickly change back into her suit and untie her ponytail, Emily walked back into the IntraTech headquarters just as professional as before, albeit with her new amulet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly noticed Laura, with her pregnant womb and giggled to herself. \"Watch out Laura, my amulet can steal your babies. OooOOOOoooh!\" She mumbled to herself, making fake ghost noises as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust for laughs she decided to \"try\" the amulet, just to amuse herself. She knew nothing was going to happen. But the thought of her holding the amulet in front of her and waving her arms like a magician tickled the crap out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the amulet, Emily pointed it at her friend, imagining her baby going into her own womb. The light hitting the amulet almost made look like it was glowing when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbsolutely nothing happened, just like Emily knew it would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mean, really. Even if it did work, why would she make her baby go into Laura's womb? It was Emily's baby after all, she would never give it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily giggled to herself again, finding that whole situation just hilarious. She quickly waddled over to her friend, hand rubbing wherever her child kicked. <br>\r\n\"I'm back.\" Emily said. \"And as you can see, the walk did not help kick start labor.\"<br>\r\n\"Good\" Laura replied. \"That means we are still on for tonight. I don't care if that baby is bulging out of your pants, we are celebrating your promotion!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't know if I should go out bar hopping while in this condition.\" Emily said, still not sold on the idea, but knowing it would be impossible to change her friend's mind.<br>\r\n\"You will be fine, you haven't enjoyed yourself since this little guy came.\" Laura said, placing a hand on Emily's stomach. \"Besides, more walking may start labor.\" \"I guess you're right. Tonight, let's hit the tooof!\" Emily said, grunt as here unborn kicked especially hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little one giving you trouble?\" Laura asked.<br>\r\n\"A little\" Emily replied. \"Now if only instead of kicking, you can help with paperwork.\"<br>\r\nEmily was kicked from within as a response. \"Ooh! I guess not.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura giggled. \"Man, you are lucky Emily, I wish I was pregnant.\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe someday\" Emily said. \"I have to go settle in to my new office, see you tonight Laura.\" \"See you tonight, rock on Amazon!\" Laura replied as Emily steppes into the elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily was so excited to finally press the button for the top floor. This is where the hotshots and bigwigs of IntraTech resided. And she was one of them. Emily was with the elites now, and the ride to the top felt like she was ascending to be crowned on her throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily took this time to examine herself. She quickly fluffed up her shoulder length hair and caressed her belly. She chuckled at the fact that she once had abs. Now when she looked down, a great ball of flesh greeted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n And she loved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n While business was her true passion, it was a cutthroat industry. Amelia couldn't play it pretty face and had to be tough and ruthless just like the other men in the office. She couldn't show weakness. But with her pregnancy, Emily was always reminded of how great it was to be a woman. This feeling of being full of life was second to none. While she did want meet her child, she also wanted to stay pregnant as long as she could. It was one of the best feelings of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she had to push all those thoughts aside as she reached her destination. Now was not the time for motherly pride. Now was time to get serious and ruthless. Now was the time to act like an Amazon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the elevator doors opened, Emily waddled into the heart of IntraTech. But she waddled with purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne unlucky man thought be wise to try and lend a helping hand. He walked over to Emily with a smile on his face. \"Hello Emily, would you like me to get you a seat so you can rest?\"<br>\r\nEmily never even broke her stride. \"What I NEED you to do is get me the reports on the shareholder prices, send messages to the board regarding our new public policies, and call up our new client to the meeting room to discuss our new partnership.\" She said without even so much as glancing at him. And just to tease and shame him a little bit more, she added. \"And MS. WOODWARD would like for you to go get some peaches and tacos, I've got a craving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoroughly put in his place, the young man only responded with a quick \"yes Ms. Woodward.\" Before scurrying off to do her bidding. Emily only smirked as she waddled to her new office. \"Like an Amazon.\" She said under breath as she Began to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd boy did she. They say you never work a day in you life if you love your job, but Emily loved to work, so it was pure joy to conduct business. To Emily, it was all a game. And she new how to play. She filed reports, she made calls, she held meetings, after one day of her promotion, she did so much that her boss considered promoting her again. She was a business fiend, and not even a full term pregnant belly could slow her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily sat down in her new chair and looked out into the skyline of the city, admiring the view and her office in general. It was a full room, not just some cubicle. One wall was entirely made of glass, perfect for staring at the city. While the rest was solid walls, giving her privacy. Just her and her desk and computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was eating her peach filled tacos when that same man came into the office. \"The client is in meeting room B, Ms. Woodward.\" He said.<br>\r\n\"Thank you, you may go.\" She said. He was a good kid, she thought. She liked him and was thinking about hiring him as her secretary. Oh, the irony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily walked into the meeting room knowing already this partnership was going to be a success. She was picked personally to handle the terms of this partnership. She knew the material, she knew all about her client, and she knew they were on equal ground and had much in common.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, Margaret Quaine, to IntraTech.\" Emily said to her client.<br>\r\n\"Emily Woodward, I have heard much about the rising star at IntraTech. Or do you prefer to be called, the Amazon?\" \"Whichever one gets us on better terms, Ms.Quaine.\" Emily said. \"Please, call me Margaret, we may be from different companies, but we are most certainly equals.\" Margaret said raising her pregnant frame from the chair to shake Emily's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have heard and read a lot about you too Margaret. Did you know we are the exact same length into our pregnancies?\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't know that.\" Margaret said and smiled. \"Look at us, in the prime of motherhood, the most wonderful time to be a woman, and we are showing those men that we can still be just as cunning and ruthless.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, well, at least you already did this once before. But even pregnant with your second child, you're still doing this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my, you did read up on me. You most certainly earned your nickname.\"<br>\r\n\"Well part of it was earned.\" Emily said, staring down at her E cup breasts, full of milk for her baby. She remembered when they were just Double D's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please, height beauty, strength, and a mind sharper than a tack? You are an Amazon through an through.\" Margaret complimented.<br>\r\n\"Thank you\" Emily said. \"Now let's talk terms about IntraTech and MegaCorp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so they discussed, quite longer than it should have really. They both kept getting side tracked into other subjects or pause whenever their babies kicked. They were a little forgetful. Emily really liked Margaret and saw her as someone she could relate to, even on pregnancy of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey finally closed the discussion on good terms. \"I think IntraTech's need have been sufficiently filled.\" Emily said.<br>\r\n\"And MegaCorp will be satisfied with those terms.\" Margaret replied.\"Congratulations. You just sealed the biggest deal in both of our companies histories.\" Margaret continued. \"That will sure please the boss.\" Emily replied. Margaret laughed. \"I think this is the beginning of a beautiful partnership.\"</span></div></div>",

Heh, there is a funny story involved with it too.\"<br>\r\n\"Do tell.\" Margaret said intriguingly. \"According to the salesman, this is a magic amulet.\" Emily waving the medallion for effect.<br>\r\nMargaret chuckled. \"Anything to make a sale, what is its so called \"magical properties\"\" she said, putting air quotes on the last part. <br>\r\n\"I'll have you know that this medallion can transfer pregnancies!\" Emily said with mock amazement. \"All I have to do is point it at whoever I want to receive or take a pregnancy from\" Emily said, pointing it at Margaret for dramatic affect. \"And then imagine that child being transferred into another womb and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely nothing happens!\" Emily said, resulting in a fit of laughter from both women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\" Margaret said, regaining her composure. \"Since I'm still without child and you still have twins in your womb, I don't quite think it works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily chuckled as she rubbed her twins' rapid kicks. \"What a shame, and the salesman seemed like such a trustworthy guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaret chuckled and then sighed. \"Look at you, in the prime of motherhood, the most wonderful time to be a woman, and you are showing these men that you can still be just as cunning and ruthless.\"<br>\r\nEmily blushed. \"Yes, well, you did this once before, as I recall reading, with your own child.\"<br>\r\n\"My my, you did read up on me. You most certainly earned your nickname.\" Margaret said.<br>\r\n\"Well, part of it was earned.\" Emily said, staring down at her EE cup breasts, full of milk for her two babies. She remembered when they were just double D's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please, height, beauty, strength, and a mind sharper than a tack? You are an Amazon through and through. Even when your pregnant with twins!\" Margaret said.<br>\r\nEmily couldn't help but blush. \"Thank you\" she said. \"That means a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily quickly regained her composure and said in a dignified manner. \"Now let's talk terms about IntraTech and MegaCorp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the the discussions commenced, taking significantly longer than should have. Emily was more than a little forgetful thanks to the hormones raging within her. She would often get sidetracked on to other subjects, or pause whenever her babies kicked, only to have Margaret bring her back on topic. Emily liked Margaret and thought they would make good friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think IntraTech's needs have been sufficiently filled.\" Emily said, closing the discussion on good terms.<br>\r\n\"And I'm sure MegaCorp will be satisfied with this agreement.\" Margaret said. She stood up and so did Emily, (a harder task for her.) So they could shake hands. <br>\r\n\"Congratulations, you just sealed the biggest deal in both our companies histories.\"<br>\r\nMargaret exclaimed. Emily blushed at the accomplishment. \"That will sure please the boss.\" Was all she could think to say, but it made Margaret laugh all the same.<br>\r\n\"I think this is the beginning of a beautiful partnership.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she turned to eave the meeting room, Margaret stopped her.<br>\r\n\"Might I give you some advice? From one working mother to another?\"<br>\r\nEmily only smiled, \"well your certainly have the experience, and I need all the help I can get.\" Margaret chuckled. \"Well, I know you pride yourself on professionalism, and that's why you wear the suit yes?\"<br>\r\nEmily nodded. \"I want be known for my work, not my looks.\" She said.<br>\r\n\"As you should, I know I get judged just like you. You may be the Amazon, but they are known for their brutality just as much as their beauty.\" Margaret said. \"You wear the suit to look like the other men, but when your pregnant with two children, it makes you look rather....let's say \"suggestive\".\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily looked down at herself and noticed that Margaret  was right. The blazer wouldn't even button close and her blouse was struggling to stay buttoned up as well. One could see many little gaps of her pale flesh between the buttons. Her breasts weren't exactly helping either. Her blouse couldn't reach the top buttons over breasts, so Emily was showing a lot of cleavage. More than she would ever show if she wasn't pregnant. She couldn't see it, but she could feel that her business slack were unzipped by the size of her belly. Emily realized what Margaret meant, she looked really \"suggestive\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My advice is this.\" Margaret said. \"I would go out and get some maternity work wear if you are determined to continue your job while expecting. You will look feminine, professional, and if you act right, no one will treat you differently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Margaret said made a lot of sense. She didn't have any maternity work clothes. Come to think of it, she didn't have any maternity clothes at all. In fact, she hadn't bought anything her babies might need! Cribs, high chairs, car seats, baby food, nothing. She was always so focused on working and not letting on not letting her babies slow her down, she forgot to prepare for the babies period! She would have to go shopping soon. With a quick \"Thank you and pleasure doing business with you.\"  Emily turned and headed out the meeting room to go hone for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she was about to leave, her boss called for her. \"WOODWARD!\" He shouted. \"GET IN HERE!\" He pointed to his office and Emily waddled her way over. \"Yes Mr. Wazowski.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down in front of his desk while he sat behind it. Mr. Wazowski was a senior partner on the board of directors, and no nonsense man with a big gut and an even bigger temper. His balding head and bushy eyebrows made him like he had come from a cartoon. But never tell him that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily was worried. People rarely came to Mr. Wazowski's office unless they were in trouble. Emily couldn't imagine what she had done. She worked her hardest to show she could make in the big leagues. She just signed on MegaCorp, for Pete's sake! She was terrified she didn't actually seal the deal and that she was being demoted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know why you are here?\" Mr.Wazowski saidin his gravely voice. \"Not really sir.\" Emily said, her sweet melodic voice paling in comparison his. \"You are here because your performance today.\" Mr. Wazowski said. \"Oh god, what did I do wrong! I swear I can improve! Did MegaCorp not sign on?\" Emily frantically blurted out, rubbing her belly for comfort. \"Slow down there! I don't want your water breaking all over my new carpet!\" He said, showing where his priorities lay. \"You did nothing wrong! In fact, just from today, shares are up three percent, and one of the biggest deals ever made by us was made by you.\" Mr.Wazowski continued. \"You see, we've been watching you Woodward, the board and I. This promotion was a test to see if you were serious about this company, and after one day I can already see that. We would like to offer a position on the board of directors. What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily was taken completely by surprise, and barely managed to mumble out \"yes\" before it fully hit her \"yes Yes OH MY GOD YES! Thank you so much! You won't ever regret this.\"<br>\r\nMr. Wazowski smiled. \"I'm sure I won't. Congrats kid, we'll see you when you came back.\" \"What?\" Emily asked, confused. \"Your maternity leave, we will see you when you get back from maternity leave.\" Mr. Wazowski said. Emily only smiled. \"Sir, I can tell I will be here exactly at ten tomorrow for the daily meeting.\" Mr. Wazowski was taken aback \"Woodward, you could pop any minute we can't be interrupted in our meeting by you having children. Unacceptable!\" Emily remained persistent. \"You asked if a I was serious about IntraTech, and I am. Nothing will stop me. Not even these two.\" She said patting her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Wazowski, seeing the fire in her eyes, relented. \"Alright\" he conceded. \"The meeting for directors is at ten sharp tomorrow. Now go out and celebrate, you crazy kid.\" With a quick \"thank you.\" Emily walked out of the office and headed to her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily was ecstatic, she got promoted today, she got her own office, she couldn't believe how much she had gotten done today, she sealed the biggest deal of her life and now this? This was the best day of her life! She screamed and squealed uncontrollably, and acting all together quite unprofessionally. Just earlier today, she was a mid level manager, now she has a part in deciding how the entire company will go forward. A small part, she was just a junior partner, but a part nonetheless.<br>\r\nShe stood in the parking lot , wondering what had changed to give her this meteoric rise within IntraTech, then realized it was hanging around her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This must be like a good luck charm!\" She said as she broke into another fit of teenage squeals. Some unfortunate woman walking up the street was just wadding her way up the road when this was happening. Emily quickly walked up to said woman and, for no reason, kissed her firmly on her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got a position on the board thanks to my magic amulet!\" Emily screeched. Not sure why in the world she would do such a thing but was way to excited to control herself. The woman, understandably shocked, only stared on awed silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily promptly grabbed the amulet and shoved in the woman's face. \"All I have to is point it at who i want and imagine and concentrate real hard..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand nothing happens! But its lucky!\" Emily breaking into a fit of giggles so excited she was almost hysterical. \"Good for you.\" Was all the woman could say as she broke free of Emily's grip and quickly walked off. She feared for the babies within that girl's belly. \"I'm glad I'm not pregnant.\" She mumbled to herself. Even though she just was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter calming down, Emily glanced at the amulet. \"You can't transfer pregnancies, but you sure are lucky.\" She said to it. \"Or maybe its just you three.\" She cooed to her stomach. And with that, Emily waddled over to her car, struggled to fit her triplet filled belly in said car and drove away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Emily had to pull the seat back as far as it would go to fit in her car, and yet she could feel the steering wheel brush against her stomach. She knew she probably should have stopped driving awhile ago, but she didn't care, she had places to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily arrived at her place and squirmed her way out of the car. It was a nice home, a two story house out in the suburbs of the city. She waddled her way inside, and saw how truly dire her situation was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only did she have nothing for her children, her home was completely unsuited for family life. Exercise equipment littered the home, the only parts of it she uses now are the exercise ball and the treadmill for kick starting labor. Pictures of her and her friends at parties, heavily intoxicated, were all around. She even saw a picture of herself in her bikini before she was pregnant, and she laughed at how different she looked compared to then. Well, there was really one major difference. <br>\r\nMagazines, very unfitting for children to read, littered the furniture as well. What's more, there were no signs that a pregnant woman lived here. There were no pictures of her belly at different stages, no ultrasound results. Emily didn't even remember going to see a doctor before. If you looked at her house, it looked as if she became pregnant this morning!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hit Emily pretty hard how much she ignored her children for the sake of work. This brought a troubling line of thought. \"My god, if I can't even take care of my children before theft are born, what kind of mother will I be?\" That was a bad thought. Being a single mother is tough, but a single mother of three? Terrifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place is going to get remodeled. Big time.\" She exclaimed as she rubbed her belly. \"But first...\" She smirked and headed to her closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon opening said closet, Emily was slightly disappointed. There were a lot more suits and formal wear than regular clothes in her closet. Emily frowned at the suits and dresses she could no longer wear and looked down at the suit she was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer blazer didn't even come close around her, and almost every button had popped off.  A few straggling buttons held on in crucial places on her belly at least, but one could see huge gaps of pale flesh several button lengths apart. A singular button kept the blouse from revealing her bra she now noticed was incredibly tight. That is what happens when you try to fit F cup breasts in a double D bra. She could feel her pants were lower, unable to fit around her girth, and when she felt back there, Emily could feel her panties poking out from the pants. Margaret was putting it nicely, she looked like the office slut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, maternity clothes are a must now.\" She said as she now searched for a rare normal outfit. She finally settled on what fit her best instead of what looked good. She had a pair of sweat pants on that were straining to stay on followed with a black T-shirt that only reached about halfway down her stomach, showing a lot of her triplet filled womb.<br>\r\nAfter long consideration, Emily decided to go without a bra, knowing it would be just to uncomfortable for the night. Letting the girls hang free, Emily waddled back to the car and drove to where Laura said she and her friends would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy in the world Laura decided to have a party for a pregnant woman in a busy bar, Emily will never know. But it was, and that was where Emily found herself now. Emily Immediately saw her friends by the corner booth and waddled her way over.<br>\r\n\"Why did you have to pick a booth?\" Emily asked Laura. \"You realize how hard it is to get into tight spaces while carrying three children in my stomach?\" <br>\r\n\"Oh quit whining. You need the exercise anyway, fatty.\" Laura joked. <br>\r\n\"At least I exercise Laura.\" Emily retorted, finally managing to wriggle in to the booth. \"You guys are never going to guess what happened today!\" <br>\r\n\"Honey, we know what today, that's why we are celebrating!\" Laura said gesturing to all her friends in the booth.<br>\r\n\"No something else happened today.\" Emily said, as she related to her friends the events that had taken place that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat news was met with lots of screams of delight and congratulations. \"I can't believe it\" Laura squealed. \"Two promotions in one day? You are one lucky girl!\" <br>\r\n\"Your right.\" Emily said. \"You know what, the next round of drinks are on me. Let me go tell the bartender.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another battle of wriggling, Emily managed to get out of the booth and head for the bar. Waddling her way to the bar, Emily placed her groups order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need four whiskies and one sooOOH MY GOD! YOU!\" Emily exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding behind the bar, preparing her drinks, was the woman Emily had kissed earlier that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman seemed to recognize her too. \"You!\" She said. \"You were the crazy woman earlier today! You were the one that kissed me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily wanted nothing more than to disappear. \"I'm so sorry about that! I didn't know what I was doing! I don't even know why I kissed you! I'm so sorry!\" She said in rapid succession. Her face would put most lobsters to shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the woman did something completely unexpected, she started to laugh.<br>\r\n\"Haha, slow down! It was worth it to see that reaction right there! Can I at least get a name for my secret admirer?\" The woman joked. \"I'm Emily.\" She said, her face still beet red. <br>\r\n\"Well then, I'm Jane.\" She said. \"Now what do you want to order?\"  \"Four whiskies and a soda.\" Was Emily's reply.<br>\r\n\"Wow, you are a heavy drinker! You may have a problem. You sure wanna subject the little guy to that?\" Jane said, pointing to her belly.<br>\r\nEmily was shocked. \"Oh god no! The soda is for me! I would never drink while pregnant! The...\" Emily stopped when she noticed Jane giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just joking! Man, you fluster easily! Don't worry, four whiskies and a soda coming right up.\" Jane said as she turned to pour the drinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was turned, Emily got to really look at Jane for the first time. She was shorter than Emily, but most people were. She looked about average height. She was a very attractive woman, Emily had to give her that. Skinny jeans hugged her legs and showed off some nice curves, and when she bent over, Emily noticed a lot of the men in the bar turn to stare at her her ass. A small belt wrapped around some very curvy thighs. A blouse and a black vest, like the ones you see on casino dealers, his what were at least Triple D breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jane turned around, Emily saw a playfulness in her eyes and in her smile. She also saw the luscious red lips and dazzling white teeth that she had kissed earlier that day. Followed by green eyes hiding under bangs of fiery red hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here ya go!\" Jane said breaking Emily out of her trance. \"For whiskies and a soda for the mother to be.\" Jane then looked at Emily. \"That's an interesting outfit for a night of partying.\" \"It was the only stuff I had that fit me these days.\" Emily said, rubbing the exposed flesh of her womb. \"If that's what fits you, I'd hate to see what doesn't.\" Jane joked. \"I mean, you don't even have a bra on.\"<br>\r\n\"How did you know I didn't have a bra on?\" Emily asked. \"That's easy, your leaking honey.\"<br>\r\nEmily looked down and saw that was indeed leaking breast milk, and it was soaking through her shirt to the point that she could see through the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily's hands shot up to cover her breasts. \"Oh god! This is so embarrassing!\" Emily said, illiciting a cackle of laughter from Jane. \"Its also incredibly funny!\" She said between chuckles. \"I like you Emily, even if you are a crazy kisser.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily liked Jane as well, when she got past the embarrassment that she kissed this woman for no reason. Emily though she would make a good friend. \"Well, you seem nice too. Thanks for the drinks. Again, I'm sorry about kissing you.\" Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you at least owe me dinner first.\" Jane joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily laughed, and then thought about it. Hey she just got promoted with a bonus check, what the hell?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Emily said, deciding to be adventurous. Jane, for her part was taken off guard. What?\" She asked. \"Dinner, let me buy you a dinner. It the least I could do to make up for what I did earlier today.\"<br>\r\n\"You realize that I was joking, right?\" Jane asked. \"Yes, but I'm not joking. Let me buy you a dinner. Here.\" Emily said as she took a napkin and wrote down her phone number and  placed it in Jane's hand. \"Tomorrow evening sound good?\" She asked.<br>\r\nJane stared for a moment and then smiled warmly. \"Hey, who can turn down free food? Sounds great. See you then.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily took the drinks over to the booth and sat down after much wriggling yet again. When she settled in, she realized her friends were staring. \"What?\" She asked. \"What was that about?\" Laura asked, pointing towards the bar. \"Oh nothing, just celebrating in my own little way. \"Alright, don't tell me. Hey, you know your leaking right?\" Laura said.<br>\r\n\"I know.\" Emily said in an exasperated tone. Emily was about take a sip of her soda when...  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Emily was casually taking a sip of her soda, enjoying the time she had to celebrate with her friends over her double promotions. However, her eyes happened to wander around the room and landed on the clock that was hung in the back of the bar. Her eyes widened and she immediately froze as she saw the time displayed by the hour and minute hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Aw crap! 6:00 Already?!?</i> She thought, shocked at how the time had flown by so fast while she was with her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Em?\" Laura asked, worried at how her friend's mood had taken an abrupt 180.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was supposed to go shopping for maternity wear today Laura!\" Emily said, exasperated at how she could have let herself forget something so crucial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with what you're wearing now? You know, besides the leaky faucets here?\" Laura teased jokingly as she lightly poked one of Emily's swollen, milk-filled breasts in emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura!\" Emily gasped, as she blushed a deep red at both the words, and the sudden touch in her sensitive bosoms. \"These clothes barely fit as it is, and these are my most flexible pieces of clothing!\" She explained, gesturing to the half of her belly that was exposed by the obviously smaller shirt. \"And plus I need to get some clothes for work, ones that preferably fit and don't make me look like a complete-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright alright I get it! Geez and I thought this far in the mood swings were supposed to be over!\" Laura laughed, lightly clapping her pregnant friend on the back in support. \"I guess we'll see you later then Em, have fun shopping!\" Laura then wiggled out of the booth in order to let Emily get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright later girls! It was fun hanging out with you all!\" Emily said, giving each one of her friends a quick hug as she hurriedly waddled towards the door. Once she got back in her car she quickly started it up and drove off as fast as she could. She figured that the nearest place to her would be the maternity shop in the mall, since it was the closest thing and she knew it was still open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe arrived at the mall in a few minutes, hurriedly parking her car as close as she could to the door. She shot out of the car as quick as she could and went inside the mall. Emily gave a sigh of relief as she turned a corner in the mall and noticed that the maternity store was still open. Once inside, she looked around for anybody that was able to help her out, and fortunately saw someone obscured by some racks of nice maternity dresses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me Ms!\" The triplet-carrying business-woman called out, catching the attention of the woman, who began walking over to her. As the rest of the woman became visible, Emily noticed that she seemed to be pregnant almost to term, but not quite near to the degree that she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes how can I help yo- oh my!\" The woman seemed to freeze up at seeing a woman much larger than she was. \"Well and i thought my belly was huge!\" She said, giggling as Emily gave her a sheepish grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup,\" she replied, rubbing the exposed half of her belly, \"I've got three little ones on the way in here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I must say you are certainly holding up well for  a woman going through something such as this!\" The helper complimented, making Emily blush a little at the praise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I've certainly been lucky!\" She told the woman. \"I think I owe it to this amulet here!\" She said, pointing to the trinket in question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?\" The woman asked with a smile, \"wherever did you get something like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I actually found it at a garage sale where some old man was selling it!\" She said, remembering when she bought it. \"Apparently it even has some <i>magical abilities</i>!\" She said, throwing her voice to make it sound spooky and making a silly gesture with her hands. This made both of the women laugh at the ridiculousness of the claim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So was there anything in particular you were looking for today?\" The sales associate asked her, finally getting back on topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was actually looking for some maternity wear for work and some bras as well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no problem! The business wear is over in the back near the fitting rooms, and bras are on the other side near the dresses and summer wear!\" The clerk explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty! Thanks for your help!\" Emily exclaimed as the other woman began to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Honestly! Magical abilities!</i> Emily scoffed inwardly, still baffled by how someone could believe such a claim. <i>I mean seriously! All I have to do is grab the amulet,</i> she thought, placing both hands on it, <i>point at a pregnant woman,</i> she continued, aiming at the employee, who was still waddling away from her, <i>and imagine me having her baby!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph! Ridiculous!\" Emily chuckled lightly, turning to head towards the bras and summer wear section of the store, not finding her newly gained quadruplet belly anything out of the ordinary. However, on her way there she ended up passing a mirror and happened to glance at her self. She frowned and stopped as she looked over herself. \"Geez it's a good thing I came when I did!\" She told herself. \"I'm lucky these clothes haven't just given out yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, Emily found herself quite lucky that her clothes had even fit her anymore. Her black T-shirt, which used to at least cover up half of her belly when she was pregnant with triplets, had given up on hiding her gargantuan globe and simply left her entire baby belly displayed to the world. <i>At least I don't have stretch marks miraculously!</i> She thought to herself. Her breasts, which had already been large enough to strain her shirt a bit, were now so large that her shirt was pulled very tightly over the both of them, and Emily even noticed a rip forming in the collar of the shirt, almost making it a v-neck of sorts. She didn't even want to mention the fact that the fabric was still soaked from her leaking breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sweatpants weren't fairing much better, as they had ridden down enough for the public to get a slight glimpse of her panties and butt. At this point Emily was surprised that she hadn't been stopped for looking like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeesh, mommy shouldn't have put this off for so long!\" She told her belly, the children within kicking slightly as if to voice their agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter surveying herself a bit longer she left to buy the clothes that she needed. She ended up buying a number of G-cup bras, some business attire, and even some casual wear for when she would go out with her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Though at this point I think walking up a flight of stairs is taxing with you guys in me!</i> She thought, giving her huge belly a light pat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ringing up the clothes she had picked out and payed for, she decided to change out of the clothes she had now. She opted to pick a regular Black bra with a light blue T-shirt and some black pants. She looked over herself and was happy with how the clothes fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Very nice!</i> She thought happily, <i>Now with these, you four little ones aren't on display, I don't have to look like I was in a wet T-shirt contest, or like I'm trying to give the world a shot of my panties!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was leaving the store as it closed, when suddenly...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"M-ma'am?\" Emily heard someone say sheepishly behind her. Emily turned around abruptly, her massive belly swinging and hitting the owner of the voice. Emily had about four feet of pregnant belly swelling out from her abdomen and it all made full contact with the slightly-taller-than-five-feet woman who called out to her. Needless to say, the woman was knocked onto her back and Emil looked down at her over her belly and breasts with a curious look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry!\" Emily said, holding her hands over her belly cutely. The tiny woman, who by her outfit was a clerk at the maternity clothing store, looked up at Emily's belly, and only her belly, with a stunned look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-it's okay,\" the woman said. Emily saw that her name tag read \"Katie.\" Emily bent over the best she could to try to help Katie up, but her magically-donated belly made that too much of a struggle, so she only managed to rub her belly against Katie as the tiny clerk quickly got up. She had short brown hair, a little hair clip, and a face that was heavily blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I'd be used to having this massive belly!\" Emily giggled, patting her roundness for emphasis. The amulet may have changed her mind into believing she had always been pregnant, but Emily's body was not particularly used to its new size, so accidents like this were bound to happen. \"You're not hurt, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm fine!\" Katie said awkwardly, clearing her throat and trying to compose herself. \"I j-just wanted to say, you left this in the changing room.\" Katie handed Emily her cellphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Thank you so much!\" Emily said cheerily, taking her phone back and giving Katie the best hug she could manage, not that Katie seemed to mind. As Emily stuffed her phone into her new black pants, getting into the back pockets that gave plenty of room for her round, maternal butt, she noticed something had changed. \"Wait a minute...\" Emily noticed that the amulet was no longer in her hands!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie saw Emily's confusion and noticed a jewel-encased necklace lying next to a metal clothing rack. The impact of the \"belly bump\" must have knocked it out of Emily's hands and into the rack. Katie reached down and handed it to the mother-to-be. \"Here you go,\" Katie said, before the amulet gave her a little jolt. \"Yeouch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, dear?\" Emily said, reaching for the necklace herself, attaching it back around her neck. Spending so much time as a woman in the corporate world, Emily had heard and despised every denigrating pet name lobbed at her - dear, honey, sweetie, babe - but this clumsy, awkward salesgirl was just too adorable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, must have been a static shock from the metal rack,\" Katie said, her eyes nervously fluttering to Emily's milk-preparing chest when she said \"rack,\" causing her whole face to light up again. Emily chuckled to herself. <i>Poor girl, but...getting knocked down by a pregnant woman and getting a static jolt from a clothes rack? This girl is like Bambi trying to stand up</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, thank you again,\" Emily said, heading out the door before she caused Katie to break her leg or some nonsense. Katie shivered as Emily left, never imagining she'd meet a pregnant woman as big and gorgeous as that in her life. Then, another shiver ran down her back and Katie furrowed her brow. She felt strange but...it was a different kind of strange. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I might need to go to sleep early tonight</i>, Katie thought to herself, turning around to help her co-workers clean up. <i>I might be coming down with something</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Emily waddled up to her car, she took a look at the front seat and realized one undeniable truth: she was too big to drive anymore. Somehow, she'd just barely fit on the way here, but <u>something</u> was preventing her belly from getting in now. Weird. It wasn't like she was carrying more babies now than when she arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting on her phone that Katie was nice enough to find for her, Emily phoned Laura. \"Hey, Laura? It's me...no, I did, but, um...I think I'm too big to drive anymore. Would you mind helping me home?...thank you!...haha...yeah, you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waiting on the bench in the front of the mall for about half an hour, and getting plenty of looks and even a few sneaky candid photographs, Laura walked off the bus in the front of the mall and walked over to Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...you weren't kidding, you definitely can't drive now,\" Laura joked weakly, her face a little confused as she gawked at Emily's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, thanks,\" Emily said, rolling her eyes with a smile. One of her babies gave a particularly poor-timed kick and Emily started rubbing her belly with one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must be the new outfit but...you really look a lot bigger, Em,\" Laura said, still starring at her friend's pregnant stomach. \"Do you feel any different?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I feel fine,\" Emily said, starting to feel self-conscious. She loved being pregnant and having such a large belly, but...it felt bad being scrutinized like this. Laura saw the concern in her friend's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but, that's okay! You look like one hot mama,\" Laura said with a grin, walking up and rubbing the front of her friend's belly. Emily laughed, Laura's hand tickling her popped out belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay. Help this hot mama get home, will ya?\" Emily laughed, waddling over to her car with her friend. Moving the passenger seat back a few feet, Emily got comfortable as Laura drove them both to Emily's home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need any more help?\" Laura asked as she got out of the car and offered Emily a hand to pull her heavy, maternal body out of the side seat. \"I know you've been doing just fine by yourself over these nine months but...you know, you're getting closer and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I appreciate it,\" Emily said, giving Laura a devastating hug of mostly belly. \"I'll be sure to let you know if I need anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Laura said quietly as she embraced her pregnant friend back. \"Well...bye then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women women moved away from each other slowly, with Laura stopping as she saw the car. \"So...should I take your car until you have your babies, or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what?\" Emily said with a shy smile. \"Maybe you can just...spend the night here. It's a Friday, after all, and I probably need the help. If I do into labor now, I'll have to either call a taxi or give birth in the bath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura laughed and walked inside with her friend, smiling happily. \"Makes sense. And I wouldn't mind staying with you. Your apartment's probably a lot nicer than mine.\" The two women took the elevator up to Emily's place and, getting out, Laura helped her make a particularly large dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they ate, Emily rolled her shirt up to show off all of her belly. Laura couldn't help but stare, still not remembering when it was that big. Emily didn't mind, giggling as Laura gave it loving rubs. As the meal wore down, Laura rubbed her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you don't mind if I just go to sleep now, do you? I'm feeling...kind of funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem!\" Emily said. \"Make yourself at home. I was probably going to lie down too. These little ones take a lot out of me.\" She patted her belly to make her point, making a loud, drum-like sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Emily took a shower, which was much harder to do than she remembered, Laura turned the living room's sofa into a makeshift bed. She curled up and sighed, thinking about how much nicer it was to stay the night here than at her lousy, ratty apartment that she paid for on her secretary's salary. Not to mention how much nicer it was to live with someone than to live...alone. (Even before the preg-transfer, Laura was pregnant and the father was a no-show) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily ran her towel over her smooth belly slowly, drying off her massive breasts. \"G-cup bras were the right choice,\" she said to herself quietly as she got into bed. Rubbing the side of her belly, Emily sunk into her bed, reaching out her arm to the unoccupied other half of her bed. Like Laura had been, Emily was going to have to raise these babies alone. The raise and promotions were going to go a long way in supporting the coming family she would have on her arms, but Emily was still lonely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Amazon, sleeping alone yet again,\" she scoffed to herself, before clutching her belly tightly. \"At least I still have you,\" she said, closing her eyes as the Preg-Transferer sat on her dresser drawer, still sparking and sputtering in the dark, its power leaking and malfunctioning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Laura woke to the warm light of the morning sun through one of the windows in Emily's home. Lying on her back, she felt an familiar weight pressing down upon her. After sitting up with some difficulty, she stretched rubbing her slightly sore back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ugh, I should know better than to sleep on my back when I am pregnant.\"</i> Looking down, Laura was met with her generous (but modest in comparison to Emily) breasts and pregnant belly that looked close to full term. \"Good morning little guy!\", Laura said cheerfully. As if in response, Laura felt the movement of her unborn child with a fluttering feeling withing her belly. Something felt really good about today, but Laura wasn't sure what made her feel particularly upbeat. Sure it was a Saturday morning, and she just had a fun night celebrating Emily's advancement within the company, but there was just something else. Something different about today that made Laura in a good mood. \"Guess it must be the hormones, so I guess I will have to thank you for that!\", Laura said looking down at her belly and giving it an affectionate rub. \"Well, I suppose I should see how Emily is doing, she always told me she hates sleeping in too long on a day off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura walked down the hall with surprising elegance, her body still used to the weight of carrying a child. \"Hey Emily, wake up, do you plan on sleeping your entir-woah.\" Laura cut herself off upon seeing her quadruplet-laden friend sleeping in the bedroom. Laura gazed at her slumbering friend the sheets distended and lifted high around the three mounds of her enormous middle and breasts. Looking at the subtle points of her nipples through the sheets and the discarded towel next to the bed, Laura concluded that Emily hadn't bothered to wear anything to bed that night. <i>\"She must of been more exhausted than she let on.\"</i>, Laura thought to herself. \"Hey Emily, you will catch a cold if you stay like that. Put something on, will ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily still half-asleep slowly sat up in her bed, not yet registering that she was naked in front of her friend. \"Mnngh...what do you-ah!\", cried a startled Emily, who finally realized she forgot to put anything on. \"Oh, I didn't even think about it, this has never happened before!\", Emily declared, her red face displaying her embarrassment as much as her lack of clothes displayed her sexuality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking of the scantily-clad warrior women of myth, Laura couldn't help but tease Emily. \"You already act like an amazon, you now look the part too!\", joked Laura.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Like you are one to talk, I know I put off buying maternity clothes, but you already had some and didn't even bother to wear them!\", retorted Emily. Laura glanced downward and had to agree, with a pregnant belly partially exposed from wearing a non-maternity top, she was hardly modest herself. She couldn't really think of good explanation of why she chose to wear normal clothes last night.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Well It's still not as outrageous as you! You better get ready, its pretty late in the morning and you made that 'date' with Jane, remember?\" Noticing the necklace that Emily was carrying around all yesterday on the dresser, Laura picked up the surprisingly warm necklace and tossed it to Emily on her bed. \"Oh don't forget your 'mystical' amulet, if anything that at least seems to be lucky,\" said Laura as she left to let Emily get herself ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh yeah, I said I would buy Jane dinner tonight.</i>, Emily thought to herself as she picked up and placed the necklace around her neck, letting the amulet rest in between her abundant cleavage. Surprised by feeling a small tingling between her breasts, she retrieved the amulet and looked at it more closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe amulet was cracked and letting off a soft hum, the lights blinked erratically and contact to Emily's skin caused a tingling sensation. <i>Aww,  I wonder when it got damaged? Well whatever, I'm sure its still lucky, even with whatever cheap electronic lights that are in here broken.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides\", Emily said to no one in particular, placing the amulet back between her breasts. \"This feels kinda nice.\"</span></div></div>",

But it looks like you know EXACTLY what i'm talking about!\" She says looking down at Emily's own belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing her own sphere, \"Yeah, These four can be a real pain sometimes. But its still worth it in the long run.\" The other woman smiled warmly. \"Agreed! Oh by the way, i love that necklace you're wearing!\" Pointing at her amulet. \"Thanks! So do i! Its my good luck charm! And it can even take or give pregnancies!\" She says with a laugh.The woman laughs along with her. \"Oh really? Well then why not try taking my kids? Or better yet, try giving me some of yours? I've always wondered what it be like to have more than three in here at once.\" She said not knowing the consequences of those words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as unaware of it herself. Emily laughed along and said. \"Well, alright!\" She grabbed her amulet. \"Now watch and be amazed! As all of the babies in one of us is magically transferred to the other!\" And just as before<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PING\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the light fades, who has all the babies now?</span></div></div>",

The decidedly non-pregnant woman in front of her was leaning over her belly, waving her hand in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily blushed, \"Oh I'm fine, I'm fine. When you're <b>this</b> pregnant, things like this happen all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...if you're sure.\" The woman gave a half-hearted smile and walked away. Emily grinned and waddled heavily away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I wish I could say that was the first time you guys have gotten that kind of reaction.</i> Emily's once encompassing shirt how barely covered her bosom. Her belly heaved to and fro, easily longer than some women of shorter stature were tall. Her heavy breasts practically bounced in slow motion, her now tiny shirt doing its best to keep her decent. While the black pants she had picked out did a little to disguise the size of her backside, she had now passed Kardashian levels, the tops of her massive cheeks peeking out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery step her muscles groaned. Despite the air conditioned atmosphere, Emily could feel sweat forming on her brow before she even exited the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow\" She panted, \"Tomorrow we'll make sure you guys have a suitable home to go to once you get here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Gonna feel good to get a load off.</i> Emily thought <i>Especially you guys!</i> She jostled her huge baby carriage, children kicking in response. Emily sighed. She couldn't remember having this much unrequited love towards anyone before; let alone seven someones. She furrowed her brow. She couldn't remember this...ever. Not after finding out she was pregnant. Not when she had her first ultrasound. Nothing. Concerned, she packed her tiny car with tiny clothes. Worming her backside into the undersized seat, she twisted only to find feet of belly and boobs that remained outside the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No...This can't be possible. Can it?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTry as she might, Emily couldn't find a way to fit her massive bulk in the driver's seat. After a struggle, she collapsed across the center console, belly rising up like a pale wave about to crash down. Pondering how she even drove there in the first place, she carefully tried to pull her phone out of her back pocket. The small compartment was crushed against her growing ass, the fabric gripping the phone like a vice. After wrestling with her own backside, she pulled the phone from the metaphorical stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Now, who should I call? Or rather, who would believe I got too pregnant to drive myself home?</i> Emily pondered, scrolling through her contacts.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Emily sighed and knew that there was only one person who was a surefire way out of this...awkward situation she had gotten herself in. If there was anyone she knew that she could depend on, it was Laura, Emily knew this as she scrolled through her phone's list of contacts. It didn't take too long for the dial tone to start playing, but as it rang she was inwardly debating whether or not to explain the situation over the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" The familiar voice of her friend came loud and clear through the phone's speaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Laura! It's me!\" The impossibly pregnant woman responded in a much cheerier tone now that she knew she had her friend's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey Em! What's going on? You finished shopping for those maternity clothes yet?\" Her friend asked going for a casual conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I did...\" Emily paused. \"Listen, I'm in a bit of a jam here and I could use your help. Think you could head on over to the mall really quick? I'll explain when you get here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh sure thing?\" Laura complied, though she sounded a bit confused, \"be there in about 15 minutes.\" After that, the two exchanged goodbyes before hanging up. Figuring that a view comprised of only her massive maternal stomach probably wasn't the best way to greet her friend when she arrived, Emily decided that she should pull herself back up into sitting position. She absentmindedly stuffed her phone back in the back pocket of her overwhelmingly tight pants before groaning as she remembered the frustrating battle with her recently inflated rear that she had fought to even pull it out before. <i>Well I guess I won't be taking any calls for a while,</i> she thought with a frustrated sigh before finally deciding that she'd better sit up anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took only a couple of seconds to realize that sitting up with a womb-full of seven growing children, and engorged breasts to boot, was no easy task to accomplish, as Emily propped herself up on her elbows to give herself some leverage. Her muscles ached tiredly in reply at trying to lift such a hefty amount of weight, and Emily felt sweat forming on her brow at the amount of effort she was using to even attempt lift herself up. Finally, the strain was too exhausting for her, and she let herself fall back once again with a tired huff of defeat, the weight of her belly rocking the entire car and the force of her fall making her breasts bounce considerably. <i>This is ridiculous!</i> She thought as she wiped away the fair amount of sweat that had accumulated on her forehead, <i>first I'm too pregnant to fit in my car and drive myself home, and now I'm too heavy to even lift myself up!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily's self-image had been called into question right about now, and could feel tears welling in her eyes as she held back a sob. She had once been the Amazon! Something the men in the business world had both revered and desired! The envy of all the women and men in the workplace, and one of the best, brightest, and most fit employees at her company! Now she was just some fat, pregnant lady who's clothes were hardly modest and couldn't even sit upright! Of course, this was all a simple overreaction that was occurring due to the stress of the situation at hand, and the fact that as a heavily pregnant lady who was pretty far along, her hormones tended to get excited and riled up quite easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, before she could beat herself up anymore about her current situation, she heard a car pull up near hers and a door close. After that, she was relieved to hear the person begin to speak to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee Em, I figured that the situation you mentioned might involve your pregnancy, but...\" Laura trailed off as she tried to stifle a teasing giggle at the sight of her friend lying down, her gigantic belly and legs being the only thing to see from her point of view. Emily blushed bright red from embarrassment as she heard her friend holding back her laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just help me up please...\" She sighed with a roll of her eyes. She heard Laura trying to pass off her laughter as a cough, though it didn't fool her, before finally hearing her walk over and felt a pair of hands wrap around her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus Em!\" Laura grunted as she exerted as much as she could in order to help Emily sit up, \"remind me to ask you to pay me back for this once I get pregnant with seven kids!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...it's...not exactly a common occurrence Laura.\" Emily grunted back as the two worked together to pull her upright. Finally, after a couple minutes of struggling, they both let out a tired side of relief as Emily was finally able prop herself up in her seat, her belly and breasts protruding out of the doorway a few feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you'll probably be wanting a ride home from me eh?\" At this, Emily nodded and took a deep breath before slowly heaving herself up to a standing position. Laura, figuring she might need some help, got behind her friend and wrapped an arm around her shoulder to help her steady herself once she stood up. However, once Emily stood up and stretched out to loosen herself up a bit Laura's eyes widened as she took in her friends figure. \"Uh Emily you <b>did</b> go shopping for those maternity clothes right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey what kind of question is that?!?\" Emily yelled in outrage, but was unable to keep her face from turning a heavy shade of crimson from the inquiry. <i>My clothes don't fit me <b>that badly</b> right?</i> She thought to herself worriedly as she just now noticed the horribly tight feeling that her clothes were giving her, and she thought she heard some of the seams creak and groan as she moved her arms and legs. She shook her head in a small bit of hope that her clothes weren't in as dire a situation as Laura made it seem. Though her best friend was chuckling at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all good Em, I'm just teasing you!\" Laura sheepishly grinned at the glare that her friend gave her in return, \"aw come on don't be like that, besides, we need to get going if we're going to get you back home with all your stuff with enough time to get ready for your 'date.'\" Laura added while making air quotes around the word date. With a sigh of resignation Emily shook her head, but began to slowly waddle to Laura's car while her friend began to transfer the mall purchases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily knew that there was no way she was going to be able to sit in the back seat of Laura's car normally, her belly would stop that no question, and so she began trying many different angles and positions to try and fit herself inside. Luckily, this little shenanigan helped pass the time while Laura was putting all of the maternity clothes in the trunk. Finally, Emily found that she simply had to sit with her belly facing perpendicular to the car doors themselves, and that in doing so she was left with space to at least move around. Laura raised her eyebrow at Emily's victorious look, but then that look of triumph quickly turned into one that told Laura to stop looking and start driving, and so with that ordeal out of the way, and with a successful shopping spree of clothes that at this point at least covered her they drove back to Emily's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter parking in her driveway and taking a bit of time to get inside with a bit of help from Laura, Emily gave groaned tiredly as she fell back on her bed, which creaked loudly in protest at having to bear it's occupant's much heavier weight. She closed her eyes and began to rest for a little bit before she heard Laura call out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Em I'm gonna head out for something to eat! I'll be back later!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later Laura!\" Emily heard the door close shortly after that, and was content to lay there for what seemed like an hour or two, but in reality was only a couple of minutes. After a little while though, she decided to get up. She then thought that since it took her a while to get just about <i>anywhere</i> in her current state, that she'd start to get ready for her \"date\" right now. Deciding that a change of clothes would be best, she waddled back to her living room and picked out black shirt similar to her current one, and a pair of gray sweatpants that would hopefully fit her better than the pants she had on now. Taking her ensemble of clothes in one hand, and using the other to soothe her children, who were kicking up a storm, by rubbing her belly, she headed over to her bathroom to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was there she managed to get her current clothes off easily, and was able to get her new shirt on easily enough. Her sweatpants however gave her more trouble, and she could only manage to pull them up so far before she gave up and just let them be. Turning  towards the mirror to see how she looked her jaw dropped and for the umpteenth time her cheeks flared a tomato red as she realized why Laura and the woman she met in the mall gave her the looks they did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new shirt did absolutely nothing to cover any part of her belly, letting the vast expanse of Emily's pale mountain of flesh hang out, topped with the tiny protrusion that was her outie belly button, but she was expecting this as she knew her belly was quite huge. What she didn't expect was the fact that the shirt had ridden up to cover only her massively swollen mammaries, and was showing an almost unreal amount of cleavage that she was sure wouldn't be legal under normal circumstances. However, the horror wasn't over yet as she yelped in surprise at seeing the state that her sweatpants were in. She knew that in pregnancy that a woman's posterior tended to grow out, but this was crazy! The sweatpants were riding down her back to the point where she figured that at least the top half of her cheeks and even a bit of her crack was showing. She gulped as she realized that even though she was sure she was wearing panties, that her butt had grown so large that the back bottom strap wasn't even visible anymore!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Guess this is as good as I'm gonna get...</i> She thought to herself as she silently hoped that Jade wouldn't be too judgmental about the way she looked...</span></div></div>",

The woman is stunning with G cup breasts and a belly that entered the bar a few steps before her. She was wearing a yellow sundress that covered her bump but did little to hide the swell. Emily looked at the woman and a thought popped in her head \" Oh no I'm going to miss the maternity store if I don't hurry!\" Laura giggles and retorts \"That lady is much larger than you are and her clothes fit great you should see where she got it.\" And with that Emily stood up and approached the massive woman. \"Hello miss I was wondering where you got the dress you're wearing? As you can see I'm in need of a wardrobe change.\" The woman looked over at Emily and smiled \"well I got this at the maternity plus store just outside the mall. When you are 8 months pregnant with quadruplets a normal store won't do.\" Emily laughed and looked surprised at the woman's huge form. \"I didn't realize there was another maternity store near the mall. Why is it called maternity plus?\" \"Because it caters to woman that are expecting multiples only as small as twins and I think the go up to septuplets in store. I do know they have larger sizes online though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Emily started to leave but as she's walking away the woman asks her a question. \"Since we're sharing clothing tips where did you get that lovely necklace you are wearing?\" \"Oh I got this at a garage sale just this afternoon and you wanna know a secret.\" Emily leaned in close to the woman \"It a magical necklace that lets me transfer babies from one person to another.\" The woman looked at Emily with disbelief \"That can't be tru you're pulling my leg.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily waved her hands in front of her face as she said \"oooh beware the powers of my necklace if I point it at you I can transfer babies.\" With that Emily pointed the necklace at the woman and....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha I told you you were pulling my leg I didn't magical become pregnant with you're septuplets.\" The woman stated matter of factly. \" Yea I know it has been a dud on the magic part but it has brought me and the little ones good luck\" Emily said back. The woman laughs and replies \"But I know I shouldn't have pried but I noticed your condition and I remember my sister being pregnant with triplets and going to the maternity plus by the mall, I hope it helps.\" With that Emily smiled and walked to her car to find she didn't fit anymore. She goes inside to ask Lauren for a ride thank god she has a SUV or else it would be a impossible squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for giving me a ride to maternity plus Lauren I don't know how I've been getting any were in my car lately.\" Emily said as she strokes her now exposed belly her shirt is just barely acting as a bra for her breasts that are easily the size of cantaloupes. \"Don't mention it Emily you are seriously out of any close that fit.

Inside are hundreds of rows of clothes of all styles and sizes. Among the rows three, no wait, four heavily pregnant women scoured the aisles. Seven if you counted the three clerks who were lounging on stools behind their desks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I mean the hundreds of thousand of plants that had to die so you could cover your giant belly,\" Lauren replies back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, it was a joke you jackass.\" Emma laughingly says as Lauren dances out of punching distance. \"Well where do you think we should start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably in the dress section, you're shirts holding onto hope and desperation as of right now.\" Lauren was right, Emma's boobs were insanely large. Around HH cup her shirt was barley able to contain the massive fun bags that were Emma's chest let alone her massive stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know!\" Emma yelled as she waddled away as fast as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Several minutes later~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren watched as Emma walked out of the changing room in the back of the store wearing a dress identical to the one the lady who told them about the store wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what do you think?\" Emma asked, twisting her body, making her sundress twirl around her. The yellow dress was a loose fit, surprising for her size. Her chest, belly and booty were all enhanced by the dress and made her look quite entrancing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Emma, first try and it's perfect\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must be my lucky amulet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, yeah, the magical amulet, tell me, how does it work again?\" Lauren asked, barely able to contain herself, she was laughing so hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Lauren, I just pick it up like this. Point it at the women I want to transfer to.\" Emma said, very theatrically, all the while waving her arm around sporadically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"and\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"doesn't\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"work\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure it doesn't work, miss-know-it-all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I am, see?\" Emma retorted, waving her arm even harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, I told you it doesn't work, it's just lucky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Ms. Lucky Amulet, your dress certainly is stunning, too bad there's nothing bigger. Still it IS pretty damn perfect we could find anything to fit you at all. I mean it's pretty hard to find clothes that fit when you're carrying trigintuplets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know right! This sundress is pretty but I'm surprised I could even get it to fit. I mean it's kinda hard to dress for 30 kids.\" Emma's massive breasts were barley contained in her dress at least a UUU cup, practically spilling out of the dress. Her belly was covered, but barely. The previously loose dress was now skin tight and squeaked loudly in protest around her 23 foot diameter belly. Her booty was another story, obscenely large and jiggled like a bowl of Jell-o, it was only half covered by the sundress. The bottom half of her bottom was completely exposed to the elements. Giving anyone who happened by a great view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After we pay for this thing, we should probably buy some custom-fitted stuff, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be a good idea,\" Emma laughed, \"how did we fit me into your car again?\"</span></div></div>",

I just wish it wasn't so hard to move or exist in a body like this. 30 babies is a lot of babies! And I don't remember going to see a doctor once!</i> Emily looked down at herself almost bursting out of her dress and began to cry uncontrollably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura heard her friend's distress and turned to console her, but was met with Emily's swollen body crashing into her. \"Laura I'm massive!\" cried Emily in despair, \"I haven't been to the doctor, or bought any baby things. I don't even have a place to put them all!\" This continued for several minutes in the parking lot of the mall and Laura did her best to console her super-sized friend. Eventually Emily cried herself out and she and Laura began discussing ways to 'catch Emily up' to where she should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily looked down at herself again and while she liked what she saw she also knew she was in way over her head. She lifted her lucky amulet out from her massive cleavage and held it close, \"Looks like you were a little too lucky this time huh?\" But as she was looking at it she saw that the gem in the middle was a little scratched. \"Oh now how did that happen! This is my lucky amulet!\" She pushed on the gem trying to rub it and see how deep the scratch was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPONG<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily finished inspecting the amulet and let it fall. Her body, Laura's baby, and all the other women's children had returned to normal. \"Oh well I did get it super cheap at a yard sale. Anyway Laura after all of that partying we had better get you home.\" Emily looked down at herself in a dress that was now many sizes too small for her, \"And me into some clothes that fit!\" They both laughed together and climbed into Laura's van. Laura dropped Emily off at her car and they said their goodbyes. Emily got into her own vehicle and went home.</span></div></div>",

Ever since I noticed the little scuff on my amulet, everything's felt off. I'm wearing a tent, my seat's not positioned right, and my bra feels loose.\" Emily looked at herself in the rear view mirror, rubbing her hands across her face. \"Nothing seems odd, but I just can't shake this feeling...\" It was not unlike a gloom of sorts, like she was missing something important. \"Well, I'm sure I'll remember it soon enough, maybe after some sleep\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily tried to focus on her driving, to get her mind out of this nameless funk. But it just stuck with her, like a nagging presence in the back of her mind. It was starting to irritate her, she was so certain she could almost remember what it was. But as she pulled in to park near her apartment, she still struggled to figure it out. Frustrated, Emily pulled her new bought clothes out of the car, still not sure what inspired her to buy different sized maternity clothes. Maybe she was planning some presents for Laura? But the clothes were much too big for her friend. \"I'll just have to return them tomorrow I guess, and get a better size\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust after getting the bags out of the car, Emily could hear footsteps coming closer. Turning to her side, she saw a woman out late, or early depending on who you asked. She was wearing some tight shorts and a sports top, and seemed to be jogging around the block. Emphasis on 'seems' as she was also sporting a round baby bump. She looked a little smaller then Emily's friend Laura, but that could just be because the woman clearly was keen to keep in shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily wasn't sure why she ended up staring, her hand hovering over her flat toned abdomen, at least not at first. But all of a sudden it hit her like a truck. She was envious, she was surrounded by women in the prime of their femininity and all carrying children. It happened so often today, from work, to the party, even now when she was home again. She felt her body twist as she realized she felt <i>empty</i>. \"Damn biological clock... but, maybe I have been focusing on work to much. I mean I'm still single! Being a business women didn't stop Marget, why should it stop me? That's it, starting tomorrow, the amazon is going to find a partner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily declared, smiling as she announced this in the dead of night, blushing a little bit at her outburst. Still, she felt good about herself again. Reaching between her chest, she pulled out the amulet and smiled. \"Well, hopefully you're still lucky after that scuff earlier, but just in case. I'll try and use your 'magic'\" Emily chuckled, not beveling it, but it had ended up being lucky for her, so she didn't mind playing along. She saw the pregnant jogger start to make a turn and focused on her. Imaging her own belly swelling up to that firm round size and pressed on her amulet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily shook her head with a sigh. Just because the amulet was lucky didn't mean she wanted to be rid of her baby girl. Sure not being pregnant might make her goal of finding a partner easier, but she loved her soon to be bundle of joy too much! And that was the point wasn't it? To start a family? Happily rubbing her belly, Emily carried her slightly too big maternity clothes into her apartment with her, and got ready for bed.</span></div></div>",

She let out a unhappy groan as she blindly reached out and hit the snooze button, contemplating resting a little while longer. It was her day off, and she did just have a rather late party last night. Still the choice was taken from her as her baby chose that moment to start kicking, fully waking her mother up. \"Alright, alright. message received. Guess you're not one for sleeping in either huh?\" Emily said affectionately, patting her belly as she struggled to sit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a bit of wiggling, but eventually the mother to be was upright in her bra and underwear, and stretching her arms out as she took a look around her room. It was rather bare bones, with some dirty clothes hanging off furniture. \"Mmm, seems like it's laundry day today. Though maybe I should finally go though my clothes and pack away what doesn't fit me anymore? I also got to order a crib for you. I know I still got a month left before you show up, but putting the crib together would be easier sooner rather then later.\" Emily let out a wince as her daughter kicked her roughly again. \"You're really active today baby. Did I sleep on my back again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily found herself gently rubbing her slightly sore back, seems like she didn't sleep to well, though that might be because her mattress wasn't as soft as she'd like. \"I guess I'll put a new mattress on the shopping list to. I can afford it now that we earned those promotions!\" The mother to be grinned as she ran her hands over her taunt skin where she felt her daughter kick, enjoying playing with her uborn child for a little while, at least till her snooze alarm started making noise again. \"Ahh, jeez, ok Em, no more getting distracted. You got a lot of work to do today! And a date of all things later\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily found herself a little excited, even though it was more like a friendly thing. But it would be good practice for her long term goal of finding a partner. And she had a good feeling about befriending Jane. Still, that was later in the day, for now...\"Ok, I know you're hungry baby girl. Don't worry. mommy's gonna take care of it~\" Emily hummed as she waddled into the kitchen, making a hearty breakfast and enjoying a few plates of eggs and toast. She ended it feeling a bit bloated, and lethargic. But pushed though the tiredness as she pulled out her laptop and ordered some baby supplies online. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily winced as she saw the price tag at the end, but she was fairly sure she needed it. A crib, diapers, changing station, formula? Emily thought about that one, and then looked down at her well endowed chest, that had only stood out more as her pregnancy made her body all but ready to produce milk. \"Maybe I'll pass on the formula. Somehow I don't think you'll go hungry\" She chuckled as she rubbed her bare belly, feeling a small series of light kicks that she could only interpret as agreement. \"Well, that's that for buying stuff for now. I can stop by the mattress shop later.... I guess now I just gotta figure out where I'm going to put you once you deiced my belly's not comfortable anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around her small apartment, Emily decided..</span></div></div>",

She'd have to ask for some help moving the furniture around, but she could fit a crib next to her bed, that way her little girl could be close to her, just like she was now. Emily found herself tearing up suddenly, overcome with a wave of emotion. \"Ahh, damned hormones...\" She sniffed a bit, feeling herself on the verge of crying. She didn't like the thought of letting her baby out of her warm home just yet. Even though it would be out of her control. She felt a desire, no, a need to keep her baby as safe as long as she could. Emily sat herself down and just cradled her belly as her child moved inside of her, taking a moment to just remind herself that she still had awhile still like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh... look at me. I can chew my way though the business world like no one else, I can out perform any man or woman with my body and mind... but motherhood? It seems I've met my match, and yet. I'm still happy.\" Emily wiped her tears away with a smile, before being interrupted by her phone vibrating on her nightstand. Curious she picked the phone up and opened the app that was making it's alarm go off. Emily felt her face freeze as she saw a reminder from herself, to attend the meeting of the board of directors today, at 10am sharp. \"How could I forget this?! I just got promoted yesterday... did I skip a day somehow?!\" Emily let out a groan of frustration, ready to blame her pregnancy brain when she got a look at the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's 9 already?! But I don't have any more time to waste!\" The Amazon ran around her room in a panic, though ran might be a bit much. She did move fast, but given her pregnancy, she was naturally cautious about outright running. She also had to stop herself from reaching for her old suit, reminding herself that she barely fit into it during the deal she made with Megacorp yesterday. It would not be good for her to wear such a showy outfit to her first big meeting. That only left one other option, one of her hastily bought maternity dresses. Emily pored though her bags quickly, settling on a slightly loose black dress, that did well to cover her belly, but also highlight her height and fit body. She felt a bit embarrassed to not be in a suit, but as she looked at herself in the mirror, she had to admit that the femininity wasn't a bad look. She just had to embrace it as her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoot, it's almost 9:30. Ok enough gawking Em, lets move it!\" The amazon grabbed her briefcase, and strutted out the door at a brisk pace, getting into the car, and having to readjust the seat once more. But she paid it no mind as she high tailed it to work, and arrived a solid five minutes early. Eager to make her mark on the board, and show them just why she was brought up to this position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking in with a firm confidence to her waddle, that she wasn't quite feeling inwardly, Emily kept worrying that her dress might be too short, and showed off more of her legs then she intended, or maybe the change of outfit was too jarring to her image. She had her professional smile on, which is to say her standard almost predatory like grin, but she couldn't help but notice how everyone starred, and gossiped as she waddled past them into the meeting room. Thankfully, once she was in there, Emily got to let out a internal sight of relief, as the others on the board seemed to merely note her entrance with a polite nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe there were a few long gazes, but they were not as obvious as Emily eased herself into the open seat. But all that was forgotten as Mr.Wazowski came into the room and closed the door, shutting them away from the noise in the larger part of the office space. \"Ladies and Gentlemen of the board. Thank you for coming in for today's meeting. I'm happy to announce that shares are up another two percent since the deal made last afternoon with our newest partners at Megacorp.\" Emily smiled as eyes were drawn to her, and Mr.Wazowski took this as a cue to continue. \"As you all know, this was in no small part thanks to Ms.Woodward here. Who's hustle and dedication earned her a position on the board. Where I have no doubt she'll continue to help grow IntraTech. Right Ms.Woodward?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily nodded as she stood up, having the back up from the table a bit to avoid her belly bumping into it as she did so. She looked around at the faces before her, and started speaking. \"Yes, I'm not stopping any time soon. I'm going to keep bringing great deals to the table, and snuff out anyone looking to exploit the company as I have been before now. I know that we still need to move forward to keep the deal between us and Megacorp profitable, and I'm going to make sure it stays that way, even if I have to do so mid-labor\" Emily finally could let her hands touch her belly, feeling a little relieved to finally address it with some of the others laughing at her partial joke. Mr.Wazowski gave her a hard look though, knowing that she was all too serious about the claim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sat down, one of the other, older board members stood up. A woman with greying hair, but a very sharp gaze as she stared down Emily. \"I'm glad you feel that way Ms.Woodward, as the board had come to an agreement yesterday. You will be appointed head of operations for our dealings with Megacorp. Given that you already have a good rapport with them, and are eager, we believe it will be a good use of your talent until something more urgent comes up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, the board has my thanks.\" Emily nodded, though internally she was a bit disappointed. She had expected something... well, bigger to handle. Though she supposed overseeing the biggest joint project in their company's history wasn't small... but she still felt like she was a step below the others on the board. Well, that only meant she had to show them just what kind of woman the Amazon was! \"Now that we're all caught up, I would like to bring this first topic up to the board...\" Mr.Wazowski said, as the meeting continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Emily sighed in relief as she nearly leaped, or tried to in her current state, into the driver's seat of her car. She may have been energized and raring to go from her new promotion at the beginning of the day, but then she was barraged by endless introductions to the seemingly countless list of people under her new jurisdiction. Then after that came the many lectures and policies she was expected to both enforce and maintain herself, the usual corporate drivel. No social media posts that might reflect badly on the company, you represent us, etcetera etcetera. The same talk was given every time she managed to climb up in rank, and at this point she'd gone through it so many times she practically knew the speech by heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that I'd care to be the one giving that speech anytime soon...\" Emily shuddered, not relishing the thought of subjecting some other poor soul to that waste of a day. As if agreeing with her, Emily's daughter started to kick, almost as if wanting to vocalize her disdain for the proceedings, which made Emily smile. \"Guess you didn't care for all that company jargon either eh little girl?\" She giggled, patting her belly lovingly, \"I think you and I are gonna get along just fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*<i>Brriiiing</i>*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily jumped as her phone loudly blasted the alarm she'd set in place earlier that day. Checking her phone's reminder, she suddenly remembered that as much as she'd like to nap for the rest of the day, she still had business to attend to. \"Better get home in a hurry, I've got a dinner to attend!\" With that, she dismissed the alarm with a swipe of her finger and promptly started her car. Pulling out of her parking space, she figured she'd be better off taking the toll roads to get home quicker since she was running a bit short on time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for her, the toll roads were much less crowded than the main roads and let her arrive home in record time, leaving her just under an hour to prepare for her get together with Jane she'd promised. After arriving home and waddling her way into her home, she started off her long list of preparations, by hopping in the shower. Normally, she'd take her time and let the warm water's sweet touch melt the stress of the day away, but as she knew she was on a time limit, she had to cut her relaxation to a minimum to save time. She scrubbed and scrubbed away the residue of sweat and office dust bunnies off her belly and the rest of her body, humming a fast paced pop song that reflected her excitement for the evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she'd finished rinsing away the grime of a hard day's work, she stepped out of the shower and dried herself off. Luckily, she'd already had an idea of what she'd wanted to wear to the date, a white and black striped zebra patterned maternity blouse that both hugged her belly and showed off a hint of cleavage, and a gray skirt she'd picked up from the store earlier since she knew casual clothes were a section of her wardrobe she'd definitely need to expand in the near future. Next, she focused on straightening out her golden locks, straightening them out to perfection as she looked back at her reflection with a please nod. All she needed now was a dash of makeup, a light coating of lipstick, and she'd be good to go!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoosing to go with a more natural shade of lip gloss, she meticulously applied each and every finishing touch to her look, finally stepping back after all was said and done with a nod and a smile. \"Perfect!\" Emily chirped, placing a hand on her hip as she admired her reflection in the mirror. If she turned heads at work, her amped up appearance now was sure to bring the house down! Now to text Jane with the address where they were meeting. Shooting a quick message to her newfound acquaintance for the nearby pasta diner. It was a family owned restaurant that very well kept, but wasn't so high brow as to be stifling. \"Plus they have the best bread...mmm...\" Emily paused as a dreamy smile came over her face at the thought of sinking her teeth into those buttery rolls that were baked to a golden brown state of nirvana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay I can drool over them at the restaurant!\" Emily chastised herself, shaking her head to get her mind back on track. \"Now, operation Get Back in the Game begins!\" She giggled, heading out to her car and driving off to her destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad she arrived at the diner at 6:00, Emily might have had a problem finding a seat in the diner, as the weird hours of the establishment shifted the usual dinner rush to a bit earlier in the day. This meant that at 7:30, after a good portion of the people had filed out and headed home for the night, Emily and Jane had their pick of most of the restaurant. The perfect amount of people to provide a relaxing atmosphere, while still having enough around so they weren't awkwardly sitting alone in the place as the only patrons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daaaaaang girl, you're really going all out for this!\" Jane whistled as she took in Emily's appearance, \"I thought I looked good, but here you are putting me to shame!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dress to impress!\" The taller blonde giggled as she struck a pose, \"it helps that I actually bought clothes so I could actually dress for the occasion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, were your other options a suit or a dirty t-shirt?\" Jane snorted, jokingly elbowing Emily who blushed and turned away in embarrassment. \"Oh my god, those were <i>actually</i> what you had?\" Jane's eyes widened in disbelief, before she broke down in another fit of giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh...was pretty focused on my job. What can I say?\" Emily explained sheepishly, before joining in the laughter at her own forgetfulness. \"At least I eventually solved that though.\" She pointed out, gesturing to her outfit proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you aren't leaking through your shirt like the other day.\" Jane winked playfully, whilst giving her date a teasing round of golf claps, \"so I'd say you've improved pretty well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my goooood, you aren't gonna let me live that down are you?\" Emily groaned as she facepalmed, her face doing its best impression of a tomato as she recalled the mortification she'd felt during that experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehhhhh, I think I can be inclined to forget it after a good meal.\" Jane chuckled, patting Emily on the shoulder in sympathy before she lightly tugged her arm, eager to head on inside, \"now come on! I'm starving, and so are you two most likely, so let's keep the chit chat for once we sit down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got that right!\" Emily chirped, pulling her face out of her hands and forgetting about her embarrassment as her stomach let out a loud rumble to signal her growing appetite. \"I feel like I could eat everything on the menu at this point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that might be jr. talking hun.\" Jane smirked as the two beauties sat down and looked over the menu. After a light discussion on what Emily recommended, Jane decided to go with the pasta Alfredo dish and a side salad, while Emily stuck to her usual, pasta salad with a side of fruit, but with the extra addition of her all time favorite, half a dozen of those heavenly rolls she'd been desiring ever since she'd arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they'd placed their order, and the server dutifully went to go put their desired dishes in, Emily figured now was a good time to get back into conversation. However, she wasn't sure where to begin the topic. She had a couple of ideas on what to discuss, but she was having a hard time deciding. In the end, she decided to... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Emily wanted to know more about Jane. She seemed a interesting woman, and very easily and naturally pushed the business woman outside of her comfort zone. Which, though reluctant to admit, is a benefit for Emily. She did need to get out of her profession routine more often. To that end Emily spoke up first. \"So you know a little bit about me and how I tunnel vision a little too much...\" Emily admitted with a flustered blush. \"But I don't know nearly as much about you! Outside the fact that you don't react to badly to random kisses and dinner dates!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily smiled as she tried to playfully embarrass  Jane back for earlier tonight, but the bartender just smirked back. \"Well yeah, it was surprising, but I don't think I'll ever be upset getting a kiss from a cutie\" Ending the statement with a wink, it seemed Emily's plan backfired on her as she could hardly look Jane in the face now. \"Though, I do love free food. I used to get asked out multiple times a night at work. They set me up as a bartender to attract more people into buying drinks, but apparently I'm too good at that part of my job for my own good. At least until jr. here started showing.\" Jane gave a few light pats to her own round bump \"He's been great at chasing away all the pervs, and I'm gonna miss it when he finally decides to come out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, guys started thinking you were spoken for?\" Emily asked, not wanting to make the same assumption, even though this was a friend date, and that Jane was almost as pregnant as her. \"Ehh, maybe? I more think they're just put off by the bump. Either because they don't want to be dads, or because they don't find it as sexy as when I was thinner. Their loss though, I'm sure I don't have to tell you, but everything's felt much better since I got knocked up\" Jane gave Emily a big smirk as the later broke out into a deep blush as her mind went wild with implications. \"Oh you're too much fun! I mean massages, showers, anything where I can feel something on my bump Em. And I guess when I can feel the kid move around. It just feels right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily took a deep breath to calm herself, fanning her face a bit. Her heart was racing, and although she was having fun, she quickly realized she was at a big disadvantage socially compared to Jane. Who was now running the conversation even though Emily initially directed it. At the least she was learning things, and 'getting back into the game' as she put it. Still, as Emily took a sip of water to calm herself down, Jane went in for the kill \"That's not to say I'm sure sex would feel great. But I'm thinking we're both in the same position there. Single, and not a interested soul in sight\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pregnant amazon had to keep her mouth closed tight, her body wanting to do a variety of things all at the same time. All of them ending with her spitting out the water she was desperately trying to swallow. But she endured, fighting against her body and getting the liquid down. She ended up having a small coughing fit as she got air back into her lungs, and gave a light glare at her date. \"You're a piece of work, you know that?\" To which Jane could only laugh, Emily joining her a few seconds afterward.</span></div></div>",

He's actually a big worry wort, and keeps trying to get me to go on leave. Which is all well and good, but I love my job, and I'm pregnant, not inept! \" Jane explained with a small bite in her tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you mean, The first thing they assumed after I got my promotion was that I should take leave till my daughter was born. And I had to tell them, and show them no. Just because I'm close to term doesn't mean I can't put out just as much, if not more work then them! Honestly? I think they're just intimated by us. We're doing something not many can do in our wombs. Making life, and I don't know about you, but that's exciting and empowering, it makes me feel like I can do anything\" The blond amazon let out a  happy sigh as she felt her child kick. \"And I think you agree too huh? Though it might be a bit <i>too</i> early for you to be thinking about having kids\" Emily had a easy smile as she playful corrected her unborn girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation was dying down, and the pair were getting a little impatient for their food, just as the waiter came back around with a pair of plate. \"Ma'am's? Please enjoy\" Setting down the alfredo  for Jane, and the pasta salad for Emily, the girls offered him a quick thanks before digging into their dinner. Emily, despite being very hungry tried to pace herself, up until she saw Jane eating quite fast, shoveling mouthfuls of pasta and large bites of salad and chewing and swallowing at a fever pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily realized she had forgotten, Jane was expecting too. So certain things she was used to having to hide, or hold back on. She could just be more natural on around her, because Jane would understand. It's not like Emily herself thought less of Jane for the way she was eating, she just thought that the baby must be making her hungry. So, letting go of her reservations, Emily took large bites out of the wonderfully buttery bread sticks, while chasing each bite down with some of the sweet tangyness of the pasta salad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most wonderful thing about it all Emily found. Is she was actually relaxing and being herself. Not just the Amazon of the business world, not just a mother to be. But she got to be Emily, a combination of them both here. It was refreshing, and if all dates could go like this, she'd be very happy to keep going on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls started to slow down their dinner as they reached the last quarter of their respective plates. Now that they were somewhat full, there wasn't a pressing need to eat, and they were both taking light bites and enjoying the flavors. Though, Emily couldn't help but giggle a little, it seems Jane was a little more hungry then she let on, she had some alfrado sauce stuck on her face, around her lips. </span></div></div>",

Pretty good or nah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh uh...\" Emily shook her head lightly as her date's voice snapped her back out of her thoughts, \"yeah it was great as always. I kinda wish my little cinnamon bun in here would let me <i>enjoy</i> my food though instead of scarfing it down.\" she playfully glared down at her belly, giving it a light flick as if to chastise her unborn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on,\" Jane snorted, hiding her smirk behind a hand, \"you seemed to enjoy those half a dozen rolls.\" She pointed to basket, which had once been filled with a pile of steaming dinner rolls that had looked absolutely tantalizing to her taste buds. Unfortunately, Emily had instantly dragged the container to her and massacred the entire batch before she'd even finished her meal. Emily, at Jane's teasing, burned a bright red as she realized she'd hoarded the bread for the table all to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh I'm sorry!\" Emily looked around in a frenzy, trying to spot a waiter somewhere, anywhere to come over and help, \"I can get you more bread I was just so hungry I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chill girl! Relax!\" Jane laughed at how flustered the other woman was getting, almost like she'd gone and broken the window or table rather than deny the opportunity for her to get a dinner roll. \"It's no biggie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just...ooohhh those rolls are too good...\" Emily planted her face on the table, cheek resting on the cool fabric of the tablecloth in a desperate attempt to hide her crimson cheeks flaring up in embarrassment. Maybe if she burrowed hard enough she could recover from the social faux pa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, it's all good.\" Jane insisted, rolling her eyes in amusement at Emily's discomfort at her own appetite and sat back in her chair, \"we're kinda eating for two on both our parts, and everyone has a certain food that's a weakness, so don't sweat it. I'll come back here sometime, after all, I gotta try the rest of the menu!\" Jane then smirked, patting Emily's head before rubbing her chin in thought, \"though I suppose in return for pilfering those pastries, you can tell me a little more about who got you into such a well-rounded person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Emily looked up at this, confused on what Jane meant. \"I mean I kind of practiced at work-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no! Not that,\" Jane giggled, holding up a hand to cut Emily off, before pointing to the abdomen where the blonde's daughter to be rested in, \"I meant <i>well-rounded</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Ohhhhh!\" Emily blushed as she finally caught the wordplay being used on her. \"Well I uh...I-I'm...huh...\" Emily stammered, at first mortified on giving the details of the conception of her bundle of joy, before halting in surprise as she realized she really couldn't recall the events that had led to her current condition. \"I...I can't honestly remember...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing at all?\" Jane scratched her head in bewilderment, \"hair color, skin tone, favorite band? Anything?\" Jane only got more and more shocked as she listed off common items on someone's physical characteristics, only for Emily to deflect each one with a shake of her head. \"Did he even get <i>your</i> name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably not...\" Emily sighed, a guilty look washing over her face, \"I mean if I didn't even remember a single thing about him...\" Emily paused, a feeling of sadness washing over her as she looked down at her stomach, all filled and gravid with child from a man she by all accounts hadn't technically met on any personal level. <i>To not even get a name from him?</i> She thought, <i>did it really mean so little to the both of us? Did I leave him or did he leave me?</i> The more she thought, the more uncomfortable she became.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Emily started to entrench herself in her thoughts, plagued with both worry and fear, Jane realized that the conversation had taken a very awkward turn, and sought to remedy the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey uh, Em?\" She called, though the woman didn't respond to her voice, still staring distantly at her belly, \"Em? Hey Em!\" Another try, this time as she leaned over to snap her fingers to try and wake Emily out of her stupor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-huh? Oh Sorry Jane! Must've spaced out there...haha...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah...\" Jane frowned at the woman's nervous titter, still obviously jarred by the thoughts posed Jane's previous question had created. Rather than apologize for bringing up something so heavy however, Jane figured right now it was best to move on and continue on another topic. Smiling, she nodded as she realized she had the perfect one. \"So uh Emily? I noticed something on our little outing so far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got no flirting game!\" Jane exclaimed, pointing an accusatory finger lazily at her target, \"if you're gonna get back out there and nab yourself someone to help take care of your little lady you've gotta open up more and lay on the charm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I didn't think I did <i>that</i> bad!\" Emily gasped, placing a hand on her chest and flashing a hurt look at Jane, before bursting into a light giggle fit, \"I mean come on I'm out with you right now aren't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but most people aren't as unfazed by a stranger jumping them in public and attacking their mouth out of nowhere.\" Jane pointed out, smirking as her observation produced the desired effect and made Emily avert her eyes, the seemingly ever-present blush making it's not so awaited return to her cheeks. \"Mostly that might get you a shove or a restraining order.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay okay I get it!\" Emily sighed, before looking back to Jane, twirling a strand of hair in her index finger, \"Soooo, in that case, what's the master got in terms of Flirting 101?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, I guess in your case treat it like one of your big business deals.\" Jane shrugged, \"I've seen too many men and women in my job trying to seem all puffed up and self important. Never really attracts the right attention they want usually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what, just try and talk to them and learn what you can?\" Emily blinked, staring at the ceiling in thought, \"that's a surprisingly simple way to put it, but it makes sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, a date is kinda like a business deal anyways.\" Jane noted, before grinning cheekily, \"just replace stuffy suits and paperwork with well placed complements and a good time at a place both people enjoy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So would you say I've been doing good so far?\" Emily questioned, looking at the other woman, who was currently eyeing her with an intense look of concentration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...well I honestly can't say for sure, this was more of a friendly thing so we'll have to find some other way to test your skills. Maybe-\" Jane was cut off as a bell rang, signaling the entrance of another customer. The two girls turned to see if they could catch a glimpse of the patrons who had shared their idea of coming to this place, and Jane smiled as she couldn't believe her luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man and a woman had walked into the establishment, laughing to themselves after one of them had told a joke both had obviously found funny, and seemed quite comfortable with each other. The man was quite attractive, Jane noted, standing at a height of around 6 foot 2 or so, with a medium length mane of auburn hair and a fair skin tone. His emerald eyes were what stuck out the most however, besides the well toned musculature that his arms and legs betrayed from the t-shirt and khaki shorts he was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman, not to be outdone in the looks department, was gorgeous, at a much smaller 5 foot 4 her jet black her pulled back in a ponytail flowed behind her, with pale skin that shone so brightly in the glare of the lights in the restaurant. Wearing a lovely blue blouse and a white knee length skirt, she carried herself with a confident walk, or waddle in this case as Jane's eyes made their way down to the woman's middle. Apparently this place attracted mother's to be like the plague, as the woman had a pregnant belly to match the size of both Jane and Emily both, which put her almost to full term like they were. However, Jane, having had many years of practice with people reading in her profession, realized that the two were not together. They had no rings, didn't hold hands, or acted in the way so many couples did. They simply seemed like two friends on a night out. <i>Perfect...</i> Jane grinned, the smile only widening as she looked back to Emily and noticed that she was staring at the pair of newcomers with heavy shade of red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright here's the plan,\" Jane whispered, leaning over to Emily who looked back at her, \"you pick who you want and we get you some hands on flirting practice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What!\" Emily hissed harshly, though she couldn't bring herself to refuse Jane's offer, \"but we don't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh we'll know em soon enough!\" Jane giggled, pulling Emily out of her seat, \"you go first and introduce yourself to the one you want, I'll keep the other one occupied!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait you swing both ways?\" Emily questioned, a surprised look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I'm into guys,\" Jane chuckled, \"but if you want the guy I can keep the lady busy with some light girl talk while you strut your stuff. Now come on, clock's ticking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But I...Jane!\" Emily yelped, feeling herself forcefully dragged over to the man and woman against her will. Gulping, she realized she couldn't deny that the two were both <i>very</i> attractive. In the end though, as Jane shoved her toward the two, Emily found herself especially interested in...</span></div></div>",

So on a split second choice Emily waddled herself towards the lady. It was initially so that Jane could enjoy herself flirting with someone she would be into, but Emily was also curious about herself. Obvious she was more then willing to be intimate with a guy, but she couldn't even remember anything about the night! So maybe she might enjoy women more? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was something she never bothered to really figure out about herself. At the least it might be easier to bond with the women given that she was also pregnant. Emily felt her amulet jingle between her breasts, a fallback plan if things went south. But she wanted to try and see if she still had game without her good luck charm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Just relax, think of it like a business deal Emily'  The blond reminded herself, before taking a confident step forward and introducing herself to the bemused looking woman. \"Hey there, I'm Emily. And I just needed to say you really make that outfit work. It looks like it was tailored for you. Really accents your figure and makes it pop\" Emily's smile seemed to strain a little bit as she realized what she said about popping, the woman looked so close to term, was that a bad thing to say?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily kept her cool on the outside, as she heard Jane and the man start to chat beside her. She was too focused on the woman in front of her to hear what her new friend was saying. Still there was a little bit of relief as the woman returned Emily's smile as she rubbed one hand over her prominent swell. \"I am Stephanie, and It sure looks like I'm about to pop doesn't it? But if you're worried, I still have a couple months to go with these two. I'm glad you think the clothes fit me, I thought I made them a size too big. You wouldn't think it matters much at our size, but it's the difference between just feeling comfortable, and feeling attractive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily blinked for a second, digesting what the woman said. \"You made the clothes? Wow, that's cool. Sounds like you'll never run out of cute things to wear then. I can only imagine how good you must be with your hands.\" Emily found herself blushing at the implication of her words. They just came out naturally! Still, it was rather good if she was intent on flirting with the woman, if a bit bold. But what was the Amazon if not bold? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie seemed to respond with a subtle smile, drumming her fingers along her belly as she seemed to look Emily up and down. \"Yes, my profession tends to require a certain amount of dexterity. If you'd like, I could show you some time. After all I rather dislike seeing my old projects being worn, when I have made such large improvements since then.\" The smaller woman motions towards Emily's dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you made this too? Oh, uhh wow. Talk about a coincidence. I just got it yesterday, is it really that old?\" the amazon asked, while trying to inspect the outfit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes and no. First off, it was made with a bigger woman in mind then you, width wise at least. But it works for you since you're much taller then my intended audience. Still I can't help but think there's some parts that feel baggy yes?\" Emily found herself nodding, there was a slight discomfort of her dress rubbing against her skin whenever she stood up or sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I want to do better for your figure Emily. To design something not just for the small, thin pregnant women, but the taller, more amazon like moms to be like yourself. Maybe you can find the time to visit my studio? And I can get you out of that ill fitting outfit, and into something you'll like much better\" Stephanie writes her number and address down on a nearby napkin and hands it to Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily for her part, was trying not to get too flustered with all the implications and innuendos that she passed back and forth with Stephanie, or maybe she wouldn't mind being called Steph? Either way, she counted it a minor success as she felt a light tug on her shoulder. \"Hey Em, I think I gotta bail soon, you wanna walk and talk for a bit?\" Emily nodded, before turning back to Stephanie \"It was lovely meeting you, and I'm a little excited to see what you have in mind for me!\" Before waddling off with Jane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily, as promised paid for her and Emily's dinner, and soon the pair were out walking in the direction of her car. \"Soooo, how'd it go? Did you wow your way into her pants, or strike out Em?\" The ever curious, and quite blunt Jane asked with a smile. Once again making her new friend blush very easily. \"I-I think I did well? I got her number at least, and she wants to see me so that she can make me a maternity outfit.\" Emily opens the napkin, gasping as.</span></div></div>",

If it wasn't on a napkin in her hands, she would have thought herself looking at a business card. \"There's nothing but the number, though she seems to have rather good penmanship.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, well. She might just be the type to hold her cards close to her face. Or she might be like me and not into other girls. At least you didn't have to bribe her with food though. So small improvement Em\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily pouted and rolled her eyes at Jane, but she did have a point. She at least felt like she made a good impression. \"I'll call her tomorrow, and take it from there. Though.. I'm feeling a little intimated, she's some kind of fashion designer, and I barely have enough maternity outfits for work. Maybe this is a mistake, I'm not used to dressing up so often. I normally just wear suits and recently some maternity outfits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I show up in the wrong kinda clothes? What if she gets fed up with me trying to flirt poorly? I am very likely to put my foot in my mo-\" Emily was interrupted as she felt a oddly familiar pair of lips press against hers, muffling any protest until Jane pulled back, with a worried glance. Emily let out a confused, but not displeased gasp as she took in air, wondering why Jane would do such a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, please don't make me do that again Em. You're really bad with going down a spiral of what if's. You just need to relax, take it one step at a time. Feel things out with this fashion girl, and if it dosen't work? Then we'll find you another hookup Sunday. This is supposed to be fun, not stressful\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane rubbed the back of her head as the pair got to the parking lot, where Emily's car was currently sitting. \"Hey, Em. If nothing else you had fun tonight right? I mean I did, you're really easy to tease, and the look on your face every time I bring up the mil-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jane! please! Ugh... yeah I had fun. I haven't been out as much as I used to, and it shows. But I had fun, and learned a few things.\" Emily had a momentary thought about bringing up the fact that Jane seemed rather good at kissing women for being strait. But it felt a bit mean spirited. \"We should do this again sometime soon, I mean, us single moms have to stick together right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, after all, who else will watch our feet when we can't see our own?\" Jane laughed as she lightly bumped her belly into Emily's \"Don't be a strange either, just because I work at a bar, dosen't mean you can't come bother me at work. It just means I can't serve you any drinks\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily found herself giggling from the sensation of the smaller girl pressing her belly against Emily's own. It wasn't something she allowed herself to do often, as she felt it didn't suit her work personality, but around Jane she felt more at ease. \"Maybe I will, the girls do like dancing at that club. I'll see you around\" Emily gave a quick wave, before settling back into her car and driving back to her place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a little pumped. Sure it didn't go exactly the way she had thought it would, but she considered her first date since finding out she got pregnant a success. She even got a number of someone who <i>might</i> be attracted to her? Or at the very least was somewhat interested. At the very least Jane seemed more then happy to play wing man for her now. \"Maybe I'll have to return the favor? Not that Jane needs the help I think. But she's single too.\" Emily mussed on her trip up the stairs back to her place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pregnant businesswoman let out a unhappy groan as she stepped into her apartment \"Ok, one more for the 'I should move' list. Stairs. Stairs are not my friend anymore.\" Emily let out a tired sigh as she started to slowly undress, waddling into the bathroom with both hands rubbing her near term bump. She could feel her daughter moving around, and getting rather dangerously close to kicking her bladder \"Hey, calm down in there. I'm sure you agree with me, but that's no reason to abuse my body. Just wait a little bit, you love baths right? Mommy's going to take a nice long warm one soon.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily started running the water, filling up the tub. In the meantime she felt some kind of pull as she walked towards the mirror, getting a view of herself in the nude. She was taken aback, she looked huge, like she had a small basketball under her skin. She turned from side to side, still amazed by how far forward her bump reached. \"I guess you're going to be a big girl like your mother huh? And a hungry one too if my body's getting ready for you.. \" Emily lightly  cupped her engorged breasts,  she was always rather stacked compared to most, but so late in her pregnancy, they had grown to a rather absurd proportion in preparation to feed her child. \"It's a bit silly to think I could try and hide the changes as long as I did with normal clothes... \"  Emily let out a wishful sigh, wondering how else she could embrace her feminine, motherly parts without compromising her strong, cutthroat business self. At the very least she had the weekend to think it over, but for now, she earned her warm bath as she slowly slide down into the prefect temperature water.</span></div></div>",

Around 6:30), and Emily was NOT pleased. All she wanted to do was sleep in. But her extra occupant starting kicking up a storm, putting an end to that idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know.\" Emily said. Slowly, she threw off the covers and slowly slid herself out of bed. She'd felt rather lethargic after her bath, so she had gone to bed only in her underwear. Cradeling her swollen womb, she slowly stood up. Taking one hand off her belly and putting it on the small of her back, Emily stretched. Now she was ready to start the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, you.\" Emily said to her unborn occupant. \"Thank goodness it's Saturday.\" One of the perks of her new promotion: Saturday's off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Emily waddled over to her closet, and opened it. Looking inside, she frowned. What on Earth had possessed her to keep her pre-pregnancy clothes? At the moment, there was very little that would fit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn.\" Emily muttered. She looked over at the maternity clothes she had bought a little while ago. They would cover her, but were all far too big (why had she gotten that size again?). Looking around her room, she saw the napkin with Stephenies number on it laying on the nightstand. Waddling over to it, she picked it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's hop she's not too upset at being woken up.\" Emily said, before picking up her cell phone off the nightstand and dialing the number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 2 rings, someone answered the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Emily heard the other person say. It definitely was Stephenie. They did sound a bit tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, it's Emily from last night.\" Emily replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello Emily.\" Stephenie said. \"Sorry, I wasn't expecting a call so early in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I wasn't expecting to wake up so early, but a certain someone didn't want to stay in bed.\" Emily said, patting her large tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that feeling.\" Stephenie replied. \"So, to what do I owe the honor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I just had a look in my closet, and I don't think I'm going to fit in much of my wardrobe.\" Emily said. \"I was wondering if I could schedule a fitting later today? I'm off work today, so I've got plenty of time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, my schedule's open today.\" Stephenie said. \"If you give me your address, I can stop by around 4. That sound good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does.\" Emily replied. She then gave Stephenie her address, and thanked her for agreeing to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a problem.\" Stephanie said. \"See you around 4.\" With that, Stephanie hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily set her phone on the nightstand and sighed, patting her tummy. She looked at her closet and the maternity clothes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope Stephenie doesn't mind me being in my underwear.\" Emily said. \"Anyway, time for breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she turned to waddle out of her room, she remembered her amulet. Quickly going over to her dresser, she picked the amulet up from it and put it around her neck. Now satisfied, she waddled out of the room.<br>\r\n------<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Emily was sitting in her kitchen, happily eating a small stack of fluffy pancakes drenched in syrup. Her unborn daughter was kicking in her womb, evidently happy with the meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never expected to start my day eating pancakes in my underwear, but what can you do?\" Emily said to herself. She cut another piece of pancake and was stuffing it in her mouth when the doorbell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping her mouth with a napkin, Emily slowly got up from her seat and waddled to her apartment door.

Resting some kind of platter on her prominent baby bump and looking in Emily's professional opinion the shining example of motherhood. As a mother to two, and with her third on the way the stay at home mom really wore the pregnancy well. Betting then Emily did that was for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe semi nude business woman opened the door, comfortable enough with her neighbor to not be too embarrassed about being in nothing but her underwear. \"Mrs.Jamison, good morning. I guess you had just as much trouble sleeping as I did?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe homely neighbor smiled and laughed. \"The little one kicked you awake again dear? No, I was just up early to send Lilly and Michal off to school. And I thought you and your baby would appreciate some home made breakfast since I seemed to have made more then I needed~\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs.Jamison handed over the still warm plate as Emily couldn't help but take it. Her cooking was always too good, and was part of the reason Emily had trouble getting her old pants past her thighs. At least Emily liked to think. The stay at home mom was always feeding her, often times encouraging Emily to eat past her full 'for the baby's sake'. Emily didn't think much of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Mrs.Jamison, though if you keep this up I might have to send my baby over to your place. Nothing I make could compare if they got used to your cooking!\" The two shared a laugh as the full time mother noticed Emily's jewelry. \"That's new dear, did you find it at an antique store? It really brings out your eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily looked down and lifted up her necklace, shaking her head. \"No I got it from a old guy on the street. Said it was a good luck charm for the baby. I don't know if it works out not, but it's not hurting anyone. I could try it on you too!\" Emily didn't wait at all, using the necklace instantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the necklace must be doing something dear. Your twins look healthy and big, Just like they should be\" The now flat Mrs.Jamison said with a cheery smile as Emily rubbed her large belly happily, the plate in her other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's only because you feed me so well. Thanks again for that, and actually if you don't mind. I was thinking of naming one of the girls Jamie.\" Emily's neighbor gasped and went to hug the business woman. \"I'd be honored sweetie. Do take care though, my kids are eager to get to play with yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two woman waved their goodbyes as Emily sat down with a wince, rubbing her belly as the twins kicked. \"Easy guys, I know I know. I'll eat your favorite food in a second.\" She wasn't a fan of how much weight she was gaining from the twins. But she knew it was the price of being a good mom. And Emily was never one to do thing by halves. If the girls were hungry enough for her to finish two breakfasts then she'd just work harder to lose the weight after they were born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, she still had a little bit of time to kill before Stephenie showed up, maybe she could get a head start on working out?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eliza had just finished her college degree and found a job. Out of all places, a fast food joint. It had been a month since she had worked there and already tired of it. There were no available slots for her in the places she wanted to work and ended up there. If she didn't find a job, whether it was suited for her or not. She wouldn't hear the endless nagging of her mom. So she took this one despite minimal pay. She lived with her parents and had a kid brother. She had to get to work that day. Her younger brother was still in high school but he too was tired of their mom's constant nagging even though their father had a good job. She and her brother got along pretty well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another day... Hope I don't get annoyed again.\" Eliza sighed as she thought to herself. She wore baggy brown cargo pants with black sneakers. Her top was a yellow collored golf shirt with white sleeves that extended down past her belt. It had a burger icon on it. She placed her cap in her bag and ran downstairs to get her lunch. Though a nagger of sorts thier mom always prepared for her evem though she's big enough to do it herself. Her brother already in school, she made her way to the bus stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe worked at a kiosk of sorts that was in the food distirct of the local mall nearby. Taking the bus was easier. Looking at her watch, she knew she would get thier on time. On her usual route, something new appeared near the bus stop. It was a small stand set up by an old man with a hat. White beard, bald, your usual old man. He had a small table with a red cloth where he displayed his mechendise. Curiousity got the best of her so she checked it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Care to have a look miss? You might have something you like.\" Said the old man with a smile. She smiled back as she looked at his stuff. Bracelets with gems, watches, trinklets, charms, things you would put on your bag or cellphone. But what caught her eye was an amulet of sorts that seemed to stand out of the rest. It had a large X mark in the middle that was as big as her thumb. It was black with the x mark being white. The center was surrounded by gemstones that were clear on top of its gold sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Good eye miss. Its the magic amulet.\" He said looking at it as Eliza held it up and inspected it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic huh? What does it do? Grant wishes?\" Eliza said as she giggled. The old man smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I know is that it can transfer something. Dunno what though. So you gonna buy it?\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems like an ordinary amulet to me. I'll give you ten for it!\" Eliza said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear. I'm selling that for 20.\" He said just as her bus arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give you 15! Take it ir leave because my bus is here!\" As she pulled out a five and a ten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sold! Thank you miss!\" He said taking the money as Eliza ran for the bus. \"Have fun with it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza sat in the middle of the bus as she looked back to see the man had disappeared. Scratching her head, she looked at the amulet she had just bought. It glimmered in the sunlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magical huh? Just what do you transfer?\" Eliza wondered as her bus pulled to its stop at the mall. She wore the necklace as she exited and entered the mall to her stand. Putting her white cap on with a burger she began her buisness. Her boss would take her place later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a long day with her customers being her usual annoyance. Guys who would buy a bottle water or burger and try to hit on her. She played along to their dismay, couldn't get her number. She had some kids buy but nonetheless it was a slow day as usual. It was past 2 p.m. as she yawned and stretched her arms as she sat on her stool, waiting for a customer. Picking up the amulet, she looked at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe in magic but just what do you transfer?\" Eliza thought as she glared at it.</span></div></div>",

Paniked a bit but regain her composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh sorry mam! So what will you order?\" Said Eliza as she smiled. The woman wore a black tank top that revealed her cleavage and a long white skirt with slip on shoes. She had a lot of bags so Eliza thought she must have gown shopping. Her belly was quite large but seemed perfectly shape for the woman as she was a bit taller than Eliza. She had short auburn hair and red glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry if I startled you. I'll have the double cheeseburger and bottle water.\" Said the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll be 9.95 mam!\" Eliza said as the woman gave her a 10. Eliza began taking the burger out of the fridge and handed the woman her change and bottle of water. It didn't take long to cook. Eliza noticed the woman kept rubbing her belly. Curious, she started a converation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just how far are you mam?\" Eliza asked as she placed the patty on the bun. Then the secret sauce, chesse and the other bun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm quite overdue. Heavy one she is. I'd have to be about 10 months.\" She said as she giggled and began eating her sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! You should be in a hospital by now! Why are you shopping?\" Eliza said as she leaned in her elbows on the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry. I have friends who will meet me here.\" Said the woman as she was half way done with her sandwich. Then she noticed Eliza's amulet dangling from her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! That is such a nice necklace! Who gave it to you? Your boyfriend?\" The woman said as she held the amulet with her left hand. Putting her face closer to inspect it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have a boyfriend mam. Just bought it recently from some old guy who was sidewalk vending. Sorry but it was quite weird as he as he disappeared after I got on the bus and on my way here.\" Eliza said. She got a good glimpse of the woman'a cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thats to bad I wanted to get one.\" The woman said as she frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I know but interesting he said that its magical.\" Eliza said. \"Transfers something even he doesn't know what.\" As she shrugges her shoulders. The woman giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what. Hey looks like you can press the amulet. Wanna see what happens?\" The woman said looking at Eliza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead. I wanna see what this magic is!\" Eliza said as the woman pressed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCLICK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe X mark seemed to light up as the gems at its side flared up as well but within moments it died down with one if the 8 gemstones glowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that must be the magic. I wonder if it runs out if magic?\" She giggled as her cellphone rung. Taking it from her purse, she checked her text message and placed her cellphone back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta go. My friends are waiting for me at the parking lot. Nice meeting you!\" Said the woman as she gathered her things and waves good bye to Eliza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks! Hope to see you again!\" Eliza said as she waved back. She slowly sat on her stool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice woman. Guess its just you and me now!\" Said Eliza as she stroked her belly. It covered a fourth of her legs as she adjust her bra since it was biting into her shoulders. Her pants still a bit loose. Eliza leaned on her hand like that pose of the thinking man as she watched people pass her by. Her other hand on top of her belly as her baby kicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She heard laughter as she turned to see who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scared ya! Didn't I?\" said a woman with square shaped glasses. She had brown hair that was tied in a chinese style bun. She wore a yellow sleeved blouse with the burger logo on and a brown skirt that extended past her kness with brown shirt heeled shoes. She rubbed her eyes after calming down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, boss. Don't scare me like that! You're not the only one pregnant you know.\" Eliza said as she packed her things and gave her boss the store's earnings. Her boss checked and smiled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. You're just so fun to tease. Your just about due like I am right?\" Said her boss as she patted her 9 month belly. Her breasts were D cups and atuck out well like her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good work by the way!\" She said as Eliza walked out to meet her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem boss. At least I have company!\" Eliza said as she cradled her belly. Her uniform hid her belly quite well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Eliza! Call me Rhea.\" said her boss waving at her while shaking her head. \"Its not like I have other workers. Oh here's your pay.\" As Rhea handed some money to Eliza who smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Rhea. Tomorrow again?\" Asked Eliza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The next day. You have the day off and I have my check up.\" Said Rhea as she noticed Eliza's new nexklace with the X amulet. She gestured Eliza to come near here as she picked up her necklace and looked at the amulet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice amulet.\" Rhea said as she looked at Eliza then at the amulet which she held with her right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bought earlier from some old street vendor. He disappeared afterwards when I got on the bus and made my way here. Says its magical but all it does is light up.\" Eliza shrugged as she cradled her belly with both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh I see. So what is the gender of your baby? Mine's a girl.\" Rhea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here though its a big girl compared to yours!\" Said Eliza as she giggled. Rubbing the spot where her baby kicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thats good to hear as long as their both healthy thats the best though I wonder why you went ten months.\" Rhea said as she looked at Eliza with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry! The doctor said its fine. The baby's fine too!\" said Eliza patting her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't mind if I press it to see what it does? Rhea said as she held the amulet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead! Wouldn't hurt anyone if you want to see what it does.\" said Eliza as she pressed the amulet. It lit up like before and a second gem was glowing next to the first. It was going clockwise from the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very nice.\" Rhea said as she adjusted her skirt a bit. Seeing it was quite loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm. Excuse me? I would like to order please!\" said a middle age man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! So sorry! Take care on the way home now!\" Rhea said as she waved to Eliza who slowly walked away from the stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worker of yours?\" Asked the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Very hard working! She'll be a good mother despite having twins.\" Rhea smiled as she cooked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza slowly walked around the mall. Her belly sticking out a bit underneath as she adjusted her bra once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder why I bought small bras. It fit this morning.\" She thought as she passed by the maternity store. She looked and decided to go in. A woman helped her out as she picked a light blue sweater, some stretchable pants, a large white t-shirt and blouse and some DD maternity bras. She put one on as she was satisfied. Her knees quite sore she decided to take a seat on the bench insidw the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lugging you two around is heavy. Adding my large breasts doesn't make it easier.\" She thought as she placed her left hand behind her back and cradled her belly with her right. Her belly now looking like she was about to give birth to twins.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She has good E cup breasts and a nice round ass, but the biggest curve of all is her 9 month triplet filled belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman approaches Eliza to offer some simpathy. \"Hard carrying such a large load isn't it?\" Eliza who has been off in her own dream world while sitting on the bench looks up and is stunned to see such a beautiful and enormous woman waddling towards her. \"Oh yes it has been especially hard this last month.\" The woman approaches Eliza with a quizzical look on her face. \"How far along are you sweetly, you're having triplets too right?\" Eliza smiles sheepishly at the woman \"no I'm only carrying twins, big ones at that, but I am in the tenth month of my pregnancy.\" Shocked the other woman looked the young lady up and down to take in what she has just told her. She sees the necklace hanging from her neck and is emediatly drawn to it. \"What a gorgeous necklace you have Hun.\" Eliza smiles a little remembering her necklace \"yea I got th is from some old man selling trinkets at the bus stop. He actually said that it was a magical necklace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really it's so pretty what is the necklace supposed to do?\" The woman asks. He wasn't to sure it's supposed to transfer things what you push the X in the middle but it hasn't done anything other than light up for me. \" \"that's so interesting do you mind if I see it light up?\" She asks. Eliza gives a smile and a nod to the triplet laden woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCLICK<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights start to circle again as the woman watched intently. As they finish Eliza's now EE cup breast were straining he now too small bra and her maternity shirt had rides up to the top of the massive quintuplet laden belly. \"that was so pretty\" the woman whose now way to large shirt acted as more of a dress that a shirt giggled with Eliza. See like I told you nothing seemed to happen. \" well thank you for letting me try it anyway.\" And with that the beautiful red head leaves to maternity store wondering why she was there in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza caressed her now massive dome of a stomach to try and soothe the five children in her womb. \" You five are making mommy tired\" she says as she try's to stand up.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Emiko slowly walked between the stacks of dusty tomes, supposedly arcane items, and other assorted creepy and decorative items. Her knee length coat softly swished as she walked and her luminous green eyes flicked this way and that as she perused the items scattered throughout the store, looking for something that might help spark her creativity. Her career as a freelance comic book artist usually went swimmingly, and then she would occasionally run into the mother of all creative blocks, much like she did today. After trying and failing half a dozen times to finish even a single page frame without throwing it out, she got up and left her home, coming here in the hopes that she could find something to prove an inspiration. So far, that idea had worked about as well as her day\u2019s work. Monkey\u2019s paw, been done; an old and dusty book with the word Liponomicon barely visible on the spine, something felt familiar about that to Emiko, but she shook her head and moved along; a crystal ball with what appeared to be a puff of black smoke forever shifting and flowing through the interior, that held a possibility but Emiko eventually passed, keeping it in mind though; an odd looking coin with rough etchings of what appeared to be a man and woman facing each other and holding round swollen stomachs, Emiko almost thought that it looked like they were both pregnant, the thought of a male pregnancy helped dissuade her, and a quiet whispering that distracted her as she looked around for the source finished it when she set the coin down and continued walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmiko was just about to give up and head out to see if anywhere else might stir her imagination when her eyes alighted on a golden amulet resting on one of the shelves. Six bluish/pinkish jewels were arrayed around what appeared to be a ruby carved into the shape of a small x in the center, and the attached chain was thin but strong gold as well. Holding it up to the light, Emiko didn\u2019t feel much inspiration from the amulet, but something about it was seemingly calling to her, she had to have it. Setting a quicker pace towards the back of the store, she inwardly groaned as she saw the person sitting behind the counter; Alexandra had always been a bit of a lazy and unambitious person, and she had only gotten worse since she had gotten pregnant months before. Every time that Emiko had seen her, she had always felt her pulse quicken, seeing that pale orb of her stomach stretching out of clothes definitely not meant for a pregnant woman. After taking a moment to cool off, Emiko moved closer. Alexandra barely looked up from the magazine she had spread across the counter, and only dimly acknowledged Emiko. On her face was a glum expression that was there so often, that it could have been painted on in the thick layers of makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Alexandra, how much for this thing?\u201d Emiko asked, putting on as cheerful a face as she could to hide her frustration. \u201cThere\u2019s no tag on it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven her speaking had gotten slower, and that was saying quite a bit, as Alexandra slowly and lowly murmured, \u201cThat thing, I think the boss meant to mark it as twenty dollars.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmiko hemmed and hawed a bit, thinking that it was a bit more than she wanted to spend on a trinket. Alexandra seemed to perk up a tiny fraction though, sensing that there was the possibility of a sale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSome woman brought it in a little while back, wanting to sell it. She said that it was magic and would allow the wearer to transfer pregnancies, <i>right</i>.\u201d Emiko felt her breath quicken a bit again as she heard that, even as Alexandra let out a mirthless laugh. \u201c\u2018All you have to do is hold It up and think about the baby or babies moving to or fro and the amulet will transfer the children into your target, into you, or even into the amulet,\u2019 she said. She even told me to try it out, and I did, but it didn\u2019t get rid of this little girl at all,\u201d she said, reaching down to touch the smooth orb of her womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Alexandra\u2019s denial of anything happening, Emiko still felt drawn to the amulet for some reason. Even if the pregnancy transference part didn\u2019t work out, the amulet still looked pretty nice, and it might be something that Tara would like. Making her mind up, Emiko paid the twenty dollars, before spinning on her heel and walking towards the front of the store. Along the way, she slipped the chain over her head, and felt the amulet settle against her tanned skin. It felt oddly warm, and holding it up to the light made it almost seem as there was a glow within the various jewels dotted across the front. She stopped just inside the door, lacy curtains were across drawn to darken the inside of the store, but still allow some visibility outside. Emiko now felt her pulse quicken as she saw a woman walking along the sidewalk on the opposite side of the street, slowly making her way despite the bulge of what appeared to be a triplet-laden belly beneath the tent-like sundress. Looking back, Emiko could also see Alexandra still seated at the counter, back to reading the magazine before her. Now looking down at the amulet, the Asian-American woman was overcome with the desire to go ahead and try out this supposedly magical trinket and see if she could fulfill her deepest fantasy of being pregnant. Holding the amulet up, she pointed it and imagined the pregnancy of her target being moved into her; and she continued to concentrate on\u2026</span></div></div>",

Emiko just stared for a moment, baffled. She looked at the amulet, then at the woman, who was adjusting her loose sundress in confusion. Why on Earth was she trying to transfer her triplets to someone else? It was her belly to enjoy. Shrugging, she placed a hand on her huge belly, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive, tanned orb of her belly was completely exposed, her shirt not even trying to cover it. They were too busy trying to contain her huge, milk-filled boobs. Even her butt, which was already fairly big, was straining her pants. Emiko never liked maternity clothes. She wanted to show off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmiko stared at the amulet for a minute. If it didn't transfer her pregnancy to that woman (and why did she want it to), maybe it prevented birth. Emiko never liked that idea. She had always wanted to stay pregnant forever. If the amulet did that, it would be amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled over to Alexandra, who was still reading her magazine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think it worked.\" Emiko said. \"Guess I'm keeping these triplets in me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good for you.\" Alexandra said, not looking up from her magazine. \"But I knew it wouldn't work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmiko looked at her for a second, then back at the amulet. Smirking, she held it up to Alexandra, and concentrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, nothing. Alexandra finally looked up at her and saw her pointing the amulet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, if that worked, keep it away from me. I'd rather not have to deal with kids.\" She said, scracting her flat stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, don't know what got into me.\" Emiko said. Turning, she hefted her quadruplet filled belly out the door.<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Emiko was waddling down the street, craddling her massive belly. She smiled every time she felt a kick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You four are active.\" She said. \"Don't worry. You get to stay in my belly, hopefully forever if this amulet is magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped in her tracks though. Ahead of her was a really pretty woman, with long brown hair and blue eyes. Even though she wore baggy clothes, Emiko could still see a 9 month belly under them. Even though she already had a huge belly to enjoy, seeing other pregnant women still excited her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the amulet. She really wanted to see if she could take the woman's pregnancy, but she also had to get home to Tara. Should she give the amulet a try again?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She concentrated on the pregnant woman, and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, nothing. The woman was still without child. Not that Emiko minded. She didn't want to transfer any of her quints. Shrugging, she continued on her way, belly bouncing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she continued to walk home, constantly rubbing her enormous belly, she thought to Tara. Tara had said she planned a surprise tonight. Emiko couldn't wait to see what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was pulled from her thoughts when she glanced to her right. Across the street was a redheaded woman who was clearly full term with twins. Her maternity dress couldn't hid that big buldge. Blushing, Emiko couldn't help herself. She concentrated on the woman, and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing changed. The woman continued walking, wondering why she was wearing a maternity dress when she wasn't pregnant. Emiko just shrugged and walked off, her septuplet filled belly bouncing all the way.<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\nEventually, Emiko made it home. She and Tara lived on the first floor of an upscale apartment building. The apartment itself was fairly large, with a bath, a bedroom, a large living area, and a kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmiko squeezed her way into the apartment. She really needed to talk to the landlord about widening the doors. Her belly was a little too big. Once she got in, Tara immediatly came to see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara was a year older then Emiko, and slightly taller then Emiko, at 5'10. She had naturally white hair (she claimed it was genetics), and beautiful green eyes. She had a slim waist and toned butt, but was naturally stacked, sporting a pair of F cups. She currently wore a red tee shirt and black jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara was a cheerful woman. Not matter how bad things were, she always tried to look at the positive. She was friendly with everyone, even the usually rude customers at the department store she worked at. She also shared Emiko's pregnancy fetish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara walked around to Emiko's side and kissed her on the cheek. \"And how did your search go, dear?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that good. No real ideas.\" Emiko said. Then she pointed at the amulet. \"I did find this, though. Supposed to have the power to transfer pregnancies. Not that I'd want to give up this beauty.\" She patted her belly to emphasize it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't want that either.\" Tara said, before planting a kiss on Emiko's huge tan belly. \"It's gorgeous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The amulet, or my gut?\" Emiko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both.\" Tara answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if it is magic, maybe it can keep me pregnant forever.\" Emiko said. Then she sighed. \"That would be a dream come true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of dreams, it's time for your surprise.\" Tara said. \"Remember that new place that opened up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Silver Dollar? Yeah.\" Emiko replied. \"Wait, you don't mean-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. I got my paycheck, and we finally have enough for a date there.\" Tara replied. \"So get that black dress I love so much. We're finally going! I've got to prepare myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them, excited, walked (well, Emiko waddled) to the bedroom to change for the date.<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\nA little while later, they were ready. Tara had on a white dress with a short skirt, while Emiko had a black dress cut up the side to show leg. The dress was tight around her massive belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready?\" Tara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Emiko replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them left the apartment and headed for The Silver Dollar, which was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a chore to get Emiko into the car, but working together, she and Tara managed it\u2014with more than a little extra touching and caressing involved, much to the delight of both women. The drive didn\u2019t take very long, and soon enough Emiko had to be freed from the confines of the vehicle and together they walked out along the boardwalk with the moon hanging low over the water casting its pale glow across the beachfront. Despite both Emiko and Tara\u2019s desire to get to the Silver Dollar, they adopted a sedate pace, enjoying the cool breeze wafting from the ocean that sent any loose material fluttering. A smile curled the edges of Emiko\u2019s lips as she felt Tara reaching out and touching her massively swollen stomach again; reaching down, Emiko interlaced her fingers with Tara\u2019s, feeling her belly just as much, and drawing a light laugh from her girlfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe line leading inside was somewhat long, but the time passed quickly. Emiko\u2019s smile grew as she saw how many second, third, and even fourth glances she attracted; most of the faces just seemed extremely surprised by seeing a woman walking around with such a massive belly, though she noted that there were more than a few envious and even lustful expressions being thrown her way too. The music within was loud, but not so much to make it so that people would have to shout in ears to be heard, and the light was low enough to cast almost everything in shadows without rendering everyone completely blind. The inside of the club was full of people but Emiko had no problem getting through, her enormous belly parting the crowd like the Red Sea, with Tara following in her wake. Emiko felt a tickle on her neck as Tara leaned in close and asked if she felt up to a bit of dancing. Emiko nodded vigorously, reaching back and taking ahold of Tara\u2019s hand and tugging her along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dance floor was full of people but again, Emiko\u2019s body quickly cleared a space for her and Tara. The extremely pregnant woman started simply and slowly, getting a feel for how her center of gravity shifted due to her own rapidly shifting mass. Tara snuggled up close, helping to support Emiko, keeping her dancing simpler as well. As the next song started, Emiko kicked it up a notch, adding more gyrating and wiggling that sent her body shifting in every direction; Tara drifting a bit further away to expand on her dancing as well, but still keeping close enough to be there if it looked like Emiko was having trouble. Emiko still had to be careful though, as it was harder to stop her body than it was to start any movements. By the end of the third song, a slight sheen of sweat started to appear across Emiko\u2019s body, noticeable even in the dim lighting, but she was enjoying herself too much to think about stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the end of the fourth song though, Emiko could feel her energy fading quickly, especially in her legs as they valiantly held her mass up through ever more complex movements. Tara was on her like a flash, helping her off of the dance floor and towards the seating around the edge. It took a while to find a spot that could take her huge size, but once they did, Emiko collapsed into the seat, swearing that she could hear it creaking under the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry we had to stop,\u201d Emiko said, looking up at her girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara waved it off, \u201cIt\u2019s no problem, dear, just rest up and we can see if you feel better in a while. It\u2019s just nice to get out and about when we can.\u201d Before she sat down, Tara looked across the room before turning back to Emiko and asking, \u201cDo you want something to drink?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmiko nodded and the white haired woman dutifully darted off through the crowd towards the bar. Emiko waited, fanning herself with a hand, while the other rubbed what little bit it could of her belly, feeling the frenzied motions within. Her eyes roamed the crowd, catching more than a few people looking her way with what looked like complimenting glances, some even applauded her incredible display. As she continued to rest her weary body, her eyes came to rest on something that really held her attention.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Emiko couldn't believe her eyes. A hugely gigantic pregnant woman; even bigger than herself, waddling towards her. Slack-jawed, she rubbed her eyes. Sighing, she leaned back realizing that her eyes were playing tricks on her. A rather large, but normal pregnant woman approached her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You put on quite the show.\" The stranger said, brushing a stray hair behind her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, it's been a while since I've been <i>out</i> out. Emiko's handed nervously worked her stomach. The stranger's gaze didn't miss a movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could've fooled me.\" She took a step closer, her womb pressing up against Emiko's. As she felt the blood rising in her cheeks, she fidgeted with her necklace. \"It's not fair that you're that much bigger than me and a better dancer. Summer.\" Giggling, she offered her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emiko.\" Despite her nervousness, she couldn't help but stare back. Growing pregnant with Tara was the best experience of her life. She treated every new inch of her body like an adventure that needed to be explored. But Emiko wanted to explore too. Summer made sure she had a clear line of sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer stepped forward, her nipples pressing into her shoulder. In a deep voice, she whispered, \"Why don't you let me take you somewhere where can have a little...privacy.\" She leaned forward and gently bit down on the soft flesh of her ear. Nibbling ever so slightly, Emiko clamped down on her own lip, just barely containing her cry. One hand dug into the armrest while the other clenched down on her amulet until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I have a girlfriend!\" Emiko burst out over the noise of the crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\" While Summer straightened out, literally, Emiko admired that her impressive curves filled her dress, despite the inexplicable bagginess around her abdomen. The unmistakable sound of tearing fabric brought both their attention downward. Emiko was beginning to outgrow even her new reality as her slinky black dress split around her belly revealing acres of tanned flesh. Lower, her already wide hips pushed outwards, pinning her against the sides of her seat. Even her bust was trapped in the tiny garment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Summer looked on with lust in her eyes, Emiko did her best not to ruin her dark makeup. She wasn't shy. She and Tara had a long-standing competition of who could flash the longest in public without getting caught. But that was a far cry from bursting out of your dress in a crowded club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBracing herself, she pushed upwards, only to find herself trapped in the oppressive chair. Just as she felt the floodgates open, a shock of white passed through her vision. Looking up, she found the outstretched arm of Tara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grab her arm.\" She commanded. Snapping Summer from her reverie, she placed her foot on the armrest and pulled. Eventually they dragged Emiko's massive behind from the tiny furniture. Her face as red as the Cosmo in Tara's hand, Emiko desperately pulled at the hem of her ruined garment. Despite tearing across the front, her dress rose high enough to give onlookers a clear view of her lower curves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so embarrassing, I'm so sor-\" Emiko's eyes shot open as a pair of lips rammed into hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I love you. Let's get out of here.\" As the couple turned to leave, they heard a voice ring out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emi, aren't you forgetting something? Or someone?\" Despite her embarrassment, just hearing her voice made Emiko weak in the knees. She turned to Tara, eyes pleading, who immediately replied with...</span></div></div>",

I would\u2019ve been fine.\u201d Emiko pouted, breaking the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure, sweetie. I know how much you love walking around butt-ass naked.\u201d Tara snaked her hand down around her waist before grabbing a handful of her exposed booty. Squealing, Emiko slapped her hand away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could've managed. It would've been okay.\" The pair walked in silence again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Emiko murmured.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cOh wow, look at the moon.\u201d The pale sphere loomed in the sky, lighting up an otherwise dimly lit shore. Glancing towards the gentle surf, Emiko grinned. She loved the night. The darkness, the inherent mystery, everything about it called to her. But now was not the time to be brooding. Now was the time for action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon, I\u2019ll race ya!\u201d Ignoring Tara\u2019s protests, Emiko took off in a hurried waddle towards the surf. Her breasts bounced close to her chin as her dress continued to wrestle with them. She could feel the cool spray of the ocean on her exposed stomach. She shivered, but not with cold. Waddling forward, she felt her legs quiver, not used to the exercise she had put them through. As she her legs suddenly gave out she pivoted, falling on her enormous backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEmi! Are you okay?\u201d Tara came rushing up, hands flailing. Emiko took stock and realized that she wasn\u2019t even sore. What started as a giggle quickly turned into a full-fledged laugh as she realized how ridiculous they must\u2019ve looked. A vampire and an massively pregnant Asian goth playing in the sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara was not amused, \u201cYou have to be more careful! You could\u2019ve gotten hurt, or even the babies! Here\u201d She offered her hand. Emiko grabbed it, but instead pulled her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEmi-\u201c Tara started to complain but locked onto her lover\u2019s eyes. Ever so gently she leaned on the swell of her pregnancy. She leaned in where their black and ruby lips met. Letting herself down, she wound herself around Emiko\u2019s pregnant form. She gently stroked her side marveling at the heat coming from her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two lay on the damp sand, only the crash of the surf and occasional caw of a gull breaking the reverie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe-she nibbled on my ear.\u201d Emiko blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara raised an eyebrow, \u201cYou\u2019re joking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no.\u201d Emiko blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you mean like this?\u201d Tara latched onto her ear, smile stretching across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNooooo, you kn-know that\u2019s my spoiiiiiiiiiiii\u201d Emiko cried. She was powerless to resist as her hands digging into the soft earth, thighs squeezing against each other. After a moment or two Tara let her go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been wanting to do this all night\" Tara grabbed the front of the defeated dress before ripping it down the seam exposing her marvel of a bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Emiko cried out, \"What am I gonna wear home?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's leave that for future us to worry about.\" Tara said, pulling the straps off her own shoulders. A small smile crossed her face as she unclasped her bra. Her pale skin almost shimmered in the moonlight, weighty breasts thrusting out proudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fingers danced up Emiko's tanned sides, almost tickling her sensitive skin. She pecked the side of her stomach higher and higher until she reached her chest. With great deliberation she began undoing that myriad of straps that attempted to hold her breasts in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmiko, beached as she were, could only wait. Gone was the embarrassment of the club, the thoughts of being discovered. She gasped at the rush of cool air against her naked chest, her saucer-sized areola and nipples shrinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara immediately moved to her breasts, gently grabbing the tender flesh while playing with her nipple like a lollipop. Emiko was helpless. She offered no resistance as Tara pulled the amulet away from her neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven over the crash of the tide screams from the two girls could be heard. </span></div></div>",

After some minutes spent in denial, she sighed, realizing she wasn\u2019t going back to sleep. Emiko shook her body back and forth to gain some momentum before trying to roll to a sitting position. Doing so however, sparked fire in her muscles that reminded her of the previous night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d She blurted out, collapsing back on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEmi, are you okay?\u201d Tara called outside the bedroom. Ever since she had gotten too big to reach the stove Tara had dutifully woken up early to cook her a full-course breakfast, lunch, and dinner. And snacks. And desserts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I\u2019d be lucky if I get back to less than double my pre-pregnancy weight.</i> Emiko rubbed her wide hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine\u2026just a little sore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a little, huh? I\u2019m surprised you can mo-\u201d Emiko could hear footsteps approaching before stopping in the doorway.

Let\u2019s get you up.\u201d All Tara could see was a spindly pair of arms hidden behind a couple of throw pillow-sized breasts and a belly that swallowed her knees whole. The two struggled to connect around her wide torso before finally heaving her up on her quaking feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you gonna be okay? I don\u2019t want to burn breakfast. Although I\u2019d let burn down the house if I could hold onto your hips.\u201d Her hands once again snaked down below her waist. Despite her heavy upper body, somehow the dour Asian still managed to have an overall pear shape. Hips that were over twice as wide as her shoulders curved into an ass that couldn\u2019t fit on any single seat. Both of Tara\u2019s hands looked like two drops of cream in a cup of coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! I\u2019m not a plaything!\u201d Tara raised an eyebrow. \u201cWell at least not all the time.\u201d Tara was more than happy to dote on her massive little goth girlfriend. She knew with so many kids on the way that she was going to need help. She was happy to provide, even if the reasoning was the slightest bit selfish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmiko sniffed the air. \u201cIs something burning?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, damn!\u201d Tara raced out of the room, Emiko noticing the necklace banging off her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer amulet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed at her neck despite knowing that it wasn\u2019t there.

Is that my necklace?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, I thought it went well with my outfit.\u201d Emiko squeezed through her door into the kitchen to find Tara popping her naked hip, spatula in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, right. Totally makes your boobs pop.\u201d Emiko rolled her eyes as she collapsed onto the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought so. Anyway, you can have it back if you really want it.\u201d Tara set a plate down rivaling her ass in diameter. Drool practically fell out of her mouth while her stomach made a noise that could practically be measured on the Richter scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t \u2018orry abou it.\u201d Emiko managed to get out in between bites, her hungry temporarily distracting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Hogzilla. Remember to chew.\u201d Although Tara wasn\u2019t sure if she would be able to give up the amulet even if Emiko had said yes. She swore she could feel it pulse on her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So anyway, today we have...\"</span></div></div>",

As much as I love seeing you and this belly bare, other people would want you to be decent.\" Tara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmiko nodded. \"Anything else?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, out little romp on the beach gave me an idea. After we go shopping, we come back here, and you can model some bikini's. Our own private fashion show. And they have to be bikini's. I want to see that belly in all it's glory.\" Tara answered. \"Then after, we go to a restaraunt for dinner, and come back to have a little... fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds sexy.\" Emiko said. \"But first things first. Can I have the necklace back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara looked down at the amulet. She really wanted to wear it for a little while longer. She didn't know why, but it felt... great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't I wear it for just a little longer? Just until we're done shopping.\" Tara asked, pulling out one of Emiko's weaknesses: the Puppy Dog Eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmiko couldn't resist the eyes. \"OK.\" She said. \"But I want it back when we get home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara grinned. \"Got it! Now, finish your breakfast and get dressed. We're going to head to the mall in a few minutes.\" She said, before heading back into the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmiko smiled. \"Bikini's, and a night of fooling around? Sounds like we have a busy day ahead of us.\" She said to her belly.<br>\r\n----------------<br>\r\nA few hours later, Emiko and Tara were at the mall. Emiko had dressed in a hoodie that barely covered her breasts and didn't even try to cover her belly, black jeans that Tara had to help put on, and white sneakers.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The odd couple attracted numerous stares from other mall-goers. Tara had happily cut her stride in half to keep pace with her tortoise-like speed, but wasn't exactly crawling. Emiko\u2019s chest may have bounced with every step, but Tara bounced higher.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you please stop?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm? Stop what?\u201d Tara giggled as she slowly skipped, arm locked around Emiko\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSkipping. Everyone is looking at us!\" Emiko pleaded as loud as she could while whispering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo sweetie, they\u2019re looking at you. I\u2019m just the side-show.\u201d It was literally unbelievable that Emiko had a pair of jeans that fit her figure. Somewhere a clown was looking for his show pants with how much slack there was around her hips. Even now her jeans wrestled to keep her buns contained. A black whale tail resembling the size of the actual animal was cresting over the hem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmph.\u201d Emiko flipped her hood over her brow, black lips curving into a scowl. She would\u2019ve crossed her arms but she could barely reach around her breasts now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, c\u2019mon Emi, don\u2019t pout. I thought you\u2019d be used to the attention by now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I thought so too. But it just feels so\u2026new. I think I\u2019ll feel better if I get something to at least cover this up.\u201d She gestured at the vast expanse of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll have something. If not, we can always go by the camping equipment store and get a nice tarp. I\u2019m sure they have something in black so it can match with alllll your outfits.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmiko\u2019s head turned on a swivel, all of her darkened features glowering. She was met with a smile that was almost somehow whiter than its wearer. Both held for a moment before going cross-eyed and sticking out their tongues. Laughing, Tara planted a sloppy kiss, leaving a clear smudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are just so cu-Hey look yoga!\u201d Emiko stumbled as Tara veered off their linear path. Like most storefronts, huge glass panes allowed any passersby to see in. Besides from some decorations on the wall the studio itself was rather empty aside from women in various poses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>They're all preg-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Pregnant </b>yoga! C'mon Emi, we <i>have</i> to get you in there!\" Tara began dragging her pregnant girlfriend with surprising ease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No. No no no. No. No. I don't do spandex. I don't do bright colors. I do not. do. yoga.\" Tara abruptly spun around and glommed onto her shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just think if how much fun we could have if you got a little more flexible, mm?\" Tara laughed as Emiko face turned red as her lipstick print and pulled her through the double doors. Unfortunately for Tara the class was wrapping up just as the pair set foot in the studio. About a half dozen pregnant women of all shapes and most (normal) sizes stopped to stare at the intruders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my. Are you look to sign up for the class?\" The instructor cautiously waddled over, hand nervously working over her bump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No-\" A hand over her mouth cut her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Yes she is! When is you next class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, to be honest, I don't know if we would be able to accommodate someone with such... limitations and still cater to everyone already in the class.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmiko stuck out her tongue, \"See? I'm too huge. Let's go.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, come on Emi, just try it. We can do it together. Watch.\" The class had stopped to watch the pale woman do her best imitation of a pose. She wobbled on one foot as she tried to grab the other behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tara, c'mon, you know how clumsy you are! Let's go!\" Emiko had begun slowly moving backwards towards the door hoping to encourage Tara to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Al...most got it-whoa!\" Just as Tara could feel the tickle her toes she lost her balance and toppled over. Her arms spun in the air like egg beaters as she plummeted to the ground. Just before touchdown she managed to turn so she would land on her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight onto the amulet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash the pre-natal yoga class was decidedly non-natal. One or two were curious about the bagginess in their yoga pants or the relative ease of the class, but all eyes were on the enormous pregnant woman who had just toppled over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara nearly doubled her weight in one fell swoop. Her stomach crested over her knees, resembling a pale beach ball in size. It was completely bare, almost shining in the bright lights. Besides a few veins, her skin was immaculate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tank top had been re-purposed to cover her now enormous chest. Each breast was on par, if not larger, than her own head. Her straps of her tank top were so taut the women were surprised that they couldn't hear them reverberate. Her pink areola were peeking over the red horizon of her top, eager nipples poking through the thin fabric. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer once-tight jeans turned into a second skin. The button had burst off, zipper forced down never to be pulled up again. Once briefs, her underwear was pulled further and further in also never to return. While nowhere near the level of Emiko, Tara easily sized out of shopping at department stores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tara!\" Emiko hurriedly waddled over. She instinctively tried to kneel down but was rebuffed by her stomach. She could hear stitches popping like a cap gun but ignored it. Some of the women who had collected themselves ran over and guided Tara to a sitting position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops!\" Tara had a wide grin in addition to a bright red face. The yogis worked together to pull the white-haired woman to her feet. After offering their sincerest apologies and thank yous, the pair waddled out together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof!\" They grunted simultaneously as their bellies crashed together. Tara scurried out while Emiko was left to roll her eyes and follow after. The unknowing victims were left to ponder what exactly had just happened as they watched the humongous women waddle out of view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't it be fun to try doing yoga when you're that big?\" The women all agreed that it would be a ball to try when you're shaped like one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Emiko and Tara...</span></div></div>",

When she waddled one way it bounced the other. Even moving at a moderate pace created conflicting earthquakes. By the time she caught up to Tara she was tired, sweaty, and sore. With a sliver of hesitation she unzipped her hoodie. Once the zip went down an inch her breasts exploded outwards, jiggling violently despite the best efforts of her black sports bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t know what possessed me to do that.\u201d Tara refused to meet her gaze while chewing on her thumbnail, face still bright as her undersized tank-top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously, what was that? You haven\u2019t done yoga in\u2026.ever!\u201d Emiko struggled as her memory seemed to falter but shook it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I was so confident and then\u2026\u201d She trailed off, her hand stroking her pale side. As if sensing their hesitation, the amulet nestled in her cleavage shone brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, these aren\u2019t getting any smaller!\u201d Emiko grabbed a couple heavy handfuls of pale breasts before doing her best to dart away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOwwww, doooon\u2019t, you know how sensitive they are!\u201d She whined, mashing her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPayback from all the times you\u2019ve goosed me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara peeked around her girlfriend\u2019s frayed seam, \u201cEmi, there's no goosing that causes that.\u201d Emiko turned and followed her gaze. Tara\u2019s little acrobatic display had more lasting effects than giving Emiko a fright. The burst of activity had resulted in another burst from her jeans. Everything from butt cheek to kneecap had exploded into the open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh mother duck. These were my favorite pair of jeans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your only pair of jeans, sweetie. Although we did spend more on them than water that month.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We so did not!\" Emiko stopped for a moment, \"well, it was close!\" Shimmying out of her hoodie, she instinctively tried tying it around her waist. Only after attempting to tie her sleeves around her phantom waist did she realize the futility. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon slim, let's go get some tarps.\" The nearly nude pair shuffled to their destination. A welcome wall of cold air hit the girls like a wall as they stepped inside. Both of their naked stomachs had a visible sheen of sweat. They resisted the urge to take the first seat they found and pushed forward, past the first trimester section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara grabbed a purple top, spinning and modeling it against her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s just your color! But what about your other boob?\u201d Tara giggled and stuck out her tongue. The two pushed through the clothes racks like battering rams, displays thrown by the wayside. The paths of destruction led them to the back of the store where the girls find\u2026</span></div></div>",

They waddled over to see what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat they saw made them upset. Standing near the dressing rooms were 4 women. Three of them, who looked like soccer moms each looking pregnant with twins, were yelling at the fourth woman. Well, two were. One was pinching her nose in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was around Emiko's age. She had a punk-rock look to her, with bright purple hair, pink eyes, and a lip ring. Her ripped skull-and-bones tee-shirt barely covered her head sized breasts, and didn't even try to cover her pale beach ball belly. He had on a pleated skirt, and punkish boots. She had on a name-tag, but Emiko and Tara couldn't make out the name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't even know why you're working here!\" One of the soccer moms yelled at her. \"You belong at the Spencer's Gifts at the end of the mall, not in a store with respectible customers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you can't even do your job!\" Another soccer mom said. \"I asked for an aubergien top, and you gave me lavender! Are you colorblind?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well we didn't have aubergien.\" The punk girl said, a slight British accent in her voice. \"I though lavender would be the next best choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you though wrong!\" The second soccer mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two are acting like idiots.\" The third soccer mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay out of this, Marie.\" The first soccer mom said. Then she turned back to the punk girl, who was now crying. \"You should be ashamed! Looking like that when your about to be a mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the breaking point for Emiko and Tara, who marched over to the women. Both of them were livid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what gives you two the right to mock her?\" Emiko said. \"If she wants to dress like that, it's her choice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And yelling at her for the wrong color?\" Tara asked. \"Who cares? It's still purple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two whales wouldn't understand color!\" The second soccer mom said. \"And you should be ashamed, prancing around half-naked like that! There are respectible people here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmiko, needing to grip something in order to not deck the woman in her face, suddenly grabbed the pendant off Tara's neck, and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just go wait outside you two.\" The third soccer mom, Marie, said to her friends. \"I don't even why I brought you in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two soccer moms, now fiddling with their loose clothing, left. Marie turned to the punk girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry about that.\" Marie said. \"They can be morons at times. They'd probably be worse pregnant.\" She then placed a hand on the punk girls belly. \"I think you'll make a great mother.\" On that, Marie left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe punk girl smiled, then turned to Emiko and Tara. \"I'm sorry you had to see that.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine.\" Emiko said, placing her hands under her even more swollen belly. \"What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Corrine.\" The punk girl said. \"But I prefer Cori.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you Cory.\" Tara said. \"I'm Tara, and this is Emiko.\" She then looked at Cori's belly, noticing an amythest belly ring. \"You have such a beautiful belly. How many are you having?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe it or not, six.\" Cori said. \"I'm acting as a surrogate for a friend. Turns out I'm really fertile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Emiko said, only now realizing she had the pendant in her hand. She put the pendant on her neck. \"Nice. I'm having fourteen, and my girlfriend here is having a dozen. We... kind of went overboard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's worth it.\" Tara said. \"Hey, do you want to hang out with us? You deserve something nice after what happened with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCori smiled. \"OK. My shift is ending soon. You can look around, and afterwords, I'll come with you.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmiko and Tara smiled. \"That'd be great.\" Tara said.<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\nA half-hour later, Emiko and Tara had bought and changed into new clothes, and were leaving the shop with Cori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we're heading over to the swimwear shop next. Me and Emiko are going to model some bikini's. I want to see Emiko's beautifuly gigantic belly in all it's glory.\" Tara said. Then she realized what she said. \"Oh, sorry. Me and Emiko share a pregnancy fetish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's fine.\" Cori said. \"Tell the truth, I have that too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Emiko said. \"That's... nice.\" In her head, though, wheels were turning. She and Tara meet a punk girl who's hugely pregnant, and she just happens to have a pregnancy fetish too? That seemed... convenient. But Emiko pushed the thought aside for now, as the three walked to the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like your hair and eyes.\" Emiko said. \"They're very colorful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Cori said. \"Hair dye and contact lenses do wonders. I'm actually a blonde with brown eyes, but that's boring.\" Just then, Cori's belly growled. Cori blushed. \"Oh great. Cravings are kicking in. Can we stop by the food court first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmiko and Tara nodded, and the three of them chaned direction. On the way to the food court, convenience decides to jump in again, as the three of them run into...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When they reached the beach, the quads decided to run into the ocean and play a little. The rest of the sisters just laid down on the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddie said to his sisters, \"I gonna go for a walk. I'll be back soon.\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah said \"Okay have some fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile walking a while along the beach line, Eddie hit his foot up against something. He did jump when he hit the object. He bent down and pick up the object. He saw in was a weird necklace.  \"Uh. What a strange object.\" He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided he got to show this to his sister. He believes they might a good laugh out of this.<br>\r\n For some odd reason, He decided to put the necklace on. <br>\r\nHe starts to walks..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... waddle his now septuplet pregnant belly back.</span></div></div>",

Emilia smiled. Another successful concert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, San Antonia! You've been rockin'\" Emilia said into the mic. \"Don't forget to pick up my CD's when you leave!\" Then she ended with her trademark: a flex of her muscular arms and a bounce of her E cup boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sound of more cheers, Emilia walked off the stage and headed for her dressing room, security having to hold back the screaming, adoring fans.<br>\r\nOnce in her dressing room, Emilia saw her manager, Tanya, sitting on the couch. Tanya was gorgeous, 35 year old woman with long red hair, blue eyes, tan skin, and huge M cup breasts straining her business suit. Tanya looked overjoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, another sold out venue, another huge payout.\" Tanya said. \"This is becoming one great tour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Tanya.\" Emilia said, plopping down on the couch next to her. \"How many more stops?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"7.\" Tanya answered. \"Phoenix, Arizona is next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always liked Arizona.\" Emilia said. Then she looked at her make-up table. On it were dozens of presents. \"More fan gifts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. We'll have to sort them out later.\" Tanya said. Then she stood up. \"Well, gotta run. I've got a date tonight. A date with some very lucrative record label heads. We might get a new album out soon.\" On that, Tanya left the dressing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmilia got up and looked at the gifts. She always enjoyed getting them. It was nice to see just how much fans cared. She sometimes wished she could give them gifts as thanks. She decided to open one at random. Picking up a small one, she opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside was a note and a necklace. It was golden, with a black X in the middle and six gemstones around it: a garnet, an amethyst, a diamond, a sapphire, an opal, and an emerald. Intrigued, Emilia read the note. It read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Emilia, I'm such a huge fan of yours. I know, you must get that a lot, but I really am. I decided to send you this amulet. It's beautiful, and supposedly magic. It's supposed to transfer pregnancies into yourself and other people. All you need to do is look at a pregnant woman and concentrate. It can even make the pregnancy permanent if you wish. Of course, it might not be real, but who knows, right? Anyway, enjoy it. Sincerely, Erin Parker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmilia smiled, set the note down, and picked up the necklace. It was gorgeous. Emilia put the necklace on and looked in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe necklack complimented her purple dyed hair, numerous piercings (in particular her garnet belly button piercing and diamond studded lip ring), torn skull tee-shirt, and torn jeans with black, high-heeled boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Emilia went back to the couch, fell belly first on it, and nodded off. Today had been long, and she needed her rest.<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\nThe next morning, a knock woke Emilia up.

But even that sundress couldn't hide her pregnant gut. She was clearly having 1 kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should be ashamed of yourself!\" The woman yelled. \"How dare you sing such vulgar lyrics. You're-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Corrupting the youth, singing vile songs, shamelessly showing off, blah blah blah.\" Emilia interrupted. \"Look lady, I've heard all this before.

Dressing like that in your condition. You're going to be a mother, show some respect!\" The woman yelled back, fiddling with her loose sundress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anymore yelling could be done, security walked in and escorted the woman out, who kept ranting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmilia sighed and shut the dressing room door. Leaning against it, she rubbed her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate it when they do that.\" Emilia said to herself. \"So what if I'm pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then looked at the mirror on the other side of the room, and grinned. She made pregnancy look good on her. Her tan belly wasn't even covered by her torn shirt, which was barely holding her milk-filled G cup breasts already. Her garnet belly button piercing was even more obvious on her popped belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, screw them.\" She said. \"I'm gonna make sure you grow up listening to real music.\" She felt a small kick on her left side. \"Ha! Glad you agree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving her belly a loving pat, Emilia decided it was shower time. Removing the amulet, she dropped it on her dresser and headed for the bathroom.<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n25 minutes later, Emilia stepped out of the shower, wrapped in a towel that barely covered her breasts and belly. She had another towel wrapped around her hair, since the dye had washed out. She hated seeing her natural color. As she stepped out, she saw Tanya sitting on her couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Tanya.\" She said. \"When'd you get here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"20 minutes ago.\" Tanya replied. \"I saw security escorting a woman out. Another angry person?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmilia nodded. \"Same old, same old.\" She said. \"They just don't get that I like rocking, even with a second passenger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya got up and, walking over to Emilia, placed her hands on Emilia's belly. \"How is the little rocker doing?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Been quiet most of the day.\" Emilia answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya smiled. \"Well, I think you need to get dressed. You've got a busy day ahead.\" She said, before walking over to the door. \"I'll be at the end of the hall. And be careful. I don't want you stuck on the floor like last time.\" On that, she left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmilia snickered at that memory, and waddled over to her closet to get dressed.<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\nAfter 10 minutes of stuggle, Emilia finally finished getting dressed. She went with a purple tanktop with a skull and crossbones symbol that didn't even try to cover her belly, black leather maternity jeans, and black biker boots. She had also redyed her hair. She was just about to leave when she noticed the amulet. She grabbed it and put it on, then waddled out of the dressing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the hall, Tanya was waiting. She smilied as Emilia waddled up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Took ya long enough.\" Tanya joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it isn't really easy putting on jeans and boots with this.\" Emilia replied, patting her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm kidding.\" Tanya said. \"Well, first up, we have...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She then turned and walked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmilia smiled and gave her belly a pat. \"We're really going places, buddy.\" She said. \"Been a hell of a ride. Can't wait to actually see you. Then I can teach you REAL music.\" Then her smile faded as she rubbed her belly. \"Though, to be honest, I kind of wish I was pregnant forever. Wouldn't that make for a gimmick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmilia chuckled to herself as she waddled down the corridor, unaware of the amulet glowing softly, granting her wish.<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n20 minutes later, Emilia was sitting a table in front of a giant poster of herself. She was sitting in a way that put her belly in full view. On the table were hundreds of smaller posters, all signed. In the middle of the table was a microphone. In front of her, a huge line of screaming, adoring fans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, everyone!\" Emilia yelled into the microphone. \"You all ready for me? I've got free signed posters for ya. 5 bucks nets ya a picture of me. Got 10 bucks? I'll sign somethin' else. And 20 means you get to rub the belly!\" To illustrate that point, she gave her belly a few pats. \"So, let's get this started!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd for the next half hour, Emilia interacted with her fans. She gave out nearly 5 dozen posters, got a few pics taken, signed at least two CD's (and one set of boobs), and got a couple nice belly rubs. This was the part she loved about her concerts: the fans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had just taken another picture when the next fan walked up. She was about a year younger then Emilia, and about 5 feet 11 inches with wild electric blue hair, piercing blue eyes, pale skin and a massive grin on her face. She was wearing what looked like a carbon copy of Emilia's usual getup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat stood out most though was that like Emilia, this woman was pregnant. Her belly was twice the size of Emilia's, and her boobs were bigger then Emilia's, but smaller then Tanya's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey there!\" Emilia said to the fan. \"Another mom-to-be, huh? How many?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Triplets!\" The fan practically screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nice.\" Emilia said, idly rubbing the amulet. The fan then placed 5 one hundred dollar bills on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" Emilia said. \"You must really want me to sign something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I was hoping for something else.\" The fan said. She nervously rubbed her huge belly. \"Could I... spend a few days with you? I mean, you're my idol! I've been to as many concerts as I can, own every CD, gotten as much merchandise as I can-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, woah, take a breath!\" Emilia said. \"Well, I can see your devoted. Anyone that devoted deserves something. Meet me backstage, we'll work something out, miss...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raven!\" The fan said. \"Raven Matthews! And thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmilia smiled, and turned to Tanya. \"Take her to my dressing room. I'll catch up when I'm done here.\" Tanya nodded, and motioned for Raven to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmilia turned back to the line. \"Alright, who's next?\"<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\nAn hour later, Emilia was finally able to waddle back to her dressing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheesh!\" Emilia said. \"Meet and greets can take a lot out of a girl, can't they? Well, time to see how that Raven is doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering her dressing room, Emilia saw Raven sitting on the couch, rubbing her massive belly. She was babbling on and on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and of course, I'll name one of you Emilia!\" Raven said, before looking up. \"Emilia! How much did you hear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just the tail end. Naming a kid after me? Nice.\" Emilia said, before sitting down next to Raven. She leaned back as she idly played with her amulet. \"So, how long you been a fan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Years!\" Raven replied. \"I saw your first concert when I was 20, and was hooked ever since.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long time fan, I see.\" Emilia said. She gripped the amulet and looked at Raven's belly. \"What about them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, the twins?\" Raven asked, placing a hand on her now slightly smaller belly. \"I took a surrogate job. Actually got pregnant around the time you announced yours. B-but don't take it the wrong way. It wasn't to emulate you.\" She then looked at Emilia's twin filled tummy. \"Though, to be honest, seeing you grow bigger and bigger gave me a pregnancy fetish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Emilia said. She then moved herself so her belly was touching Raven's. \"Well, you're a lucky fan tonight. Why don't we...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Stroking her soft skin, she drew her face closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you like that, Raven?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up at the enormous woman. Brilliant sapphire eyes almost lost in her wide-eyed stare. Her mouth moved, but no words passed over the lump in her throat. Eventually, she nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmilia\u2019s grin almost split her face. She took Raven\u2019s hand in hers, food forgotten. The pair stumbled and hurriedly waddled back to the dressing room. Emilia smashed her lips into Raven\u2019s, mashing her into the door. A moan escaped from her lips as a hand fumbled for the doorknob. She fell backwards into the well-carpeted room, wincing slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer idol loomed over her. A leg whipped out, boot sailing across the room into a cluster of bottles, Emilia almost toppling over herself. A smile finally cut through the blush, Raven eagerly pulled her flimsy shirt over her head. Her breasts fell lazily from the torn garment, pale, pert and palm-filling. Emilia grabbed at her top, attempting to follow suit, but instead her impatient fingers found the necklace around her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally pulling the purple tank over her bloated torso, her roving eyes found an almost petite Raven waiting for her. Emilia made to dive in but her body would not cooperate. Her legs quivered and almost buckled, unaccustomed to the weight that had been placed on them. Raven noticed the superstar struggling and guided her to the futon in the corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmilia laid back, her large breasts quacking from the movement. Her hands roved the surface of her tanned stomach. Wide as her shoulders it pushed out far enough to prevent her from locking her hands around it. Raven drew her lips to the side of Emilia\u2019s engorged belly, kissing the tender skin. She kissed higher and higher finally ending on her nipple. Emilia had to bite her knuckle to keep from crying out as the agile tongue teased her sensitive breast. Raven finally came up for air, her eyes roving over her gravid idol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe this is happening.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna love what happens next.\u201d Emilia flipped the smaller girl onto the cushion with a squeal. Emilia\u2019s phone flashed and vibrated but fell on deaf ears. A few minutes later Tanya poked her head in the still-open door. Letting out a short sigh, she closed the door.</span></div></div>",

Entering the restroom she could hear someone crying in one of the stalls. She knocked on it. \"Hi, is everything ok in there?\", Victoria asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just leave.\", the girl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever the problem is, maybe I can help you.\", Victoria said. The girl did not respond. \"If you don't want to tell me, we can just talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stall door then opened, it was a freshman girl, 14 year old Annie. Victoria didn't know her well, but she saw her a few times around school. She usually dressed very nicely, but now she was wearing sweat pants and a baggie sweater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie exited the stall, wiping her face of tears. \"Your Victoria right.\", Annie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, so do you want to tell me what happened or do you just want to talk?\", Victoria asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing.\", Annie said, before breaking down. \"Just ruined my life!\", she said as tears rolled down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can't be that bad.\", Victoria said handing her some paper towels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My boyfriend just dumped me.\", Annie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone gets dumped, its not the end of the world.\", Victoria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone doesn't get left like this\", Annie said, crossing her arms over her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean like this?\", Victoria asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie slowly lifted her sweater, revealing a decently sized pregnant belly. \"It's too late to abort it, and my parent's will probably kick me out when I tell them. How is a freshmen suppose to raise a kid and finish school, let alone get into college.\", Annie asked, hopelessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria held onto the amulet that her grandmother had given her. She hadn't been told much about it, only that, her grandmother knew, she would be willing to help anyone, and that this could help her do that. If what her grandmother said was true, she might be able to take this burden from Annie. She was already accepted to college so it  could work. It might take longer, but if it helped Annie, it might be worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Annie, I think I can help you. All I need you to do is hold onto this with me.\", Victoria said holding out the amulet. \"Then just focus on everything you hope to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie looked at Victoria strangely, but if this could help her, she was willing to try anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two held onto the amulet, Victoria then felt some kind of energy pass into her.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\"><b>Wow, over 1,000 Views!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a amulet that exists purely for the purpose of easing the burden of child-bearing for a woman. Nobody knows where it came from, or how it exactly works. Only that it takes a woman's pregnancy and puts it into someone else, ANYONE else in fact, even men, should the need ever arise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow this amulet has found it's way into the modern day world, and who knows what might happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to \"a\" for getting started on the \"Mom\" storyline! Keep up the good work! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGet any stories or chapters and earn GP! I have a lot of GP to give away! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Rules (Follow Them. Respect Them. Don't Break Em)<br>\r\n1. No characters under 18. Seriously bro, don't do it. <br>\r\n2. Pregnancy/Male Pregnancy. <br>\r\n3. Good Grammar/Spelling. It doesn't have to be flawless, but make an effort. <br>\r\n4. No one sentence, one paragraph chapters. Come on son. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow The Amulet Works:<br>\r\nSo maybe it's magic, or maybe it's an advanced piece of alien technology. Who knows? But here how it works: <br>\r\n1.The device can transfer a pregnancy from one person to another (male or female). Once a pregnancy has been transferred, the now-pregnant person believes themselves to have been pregnant the whole time, HOWEVER, Reality DOES NOT CHANGE, to reflect this. <br>\r\n(Clothes will not change, cribs will not magically appear, so on). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Once a pregnancy is transfered from one person to the next, the traits of the child (should they be born from this now-pregnant person) will genetically match the person it was transferred into. (TL,DR The kid biologically changes to be like the now-pregnant person)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.The amulet can safely store 6 pregnancies at anytime to be transferred into anyone. Once the person holding the amulet wishes to set everything back the way it was, they just press the big \"X\" in the center of the amulet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. The amulet affects the minds of everyone. So a person who was pregnant but was transfer will remember the person not being pregnant, and vice-versa for someone the pregnancy is being transfer into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. I'm sure nothing could possibly go wrong and the device go haywire and start rewriting reality. You know if it was dropped or got damaged in some way, I'm sure nothing bad might happen. </td>",
