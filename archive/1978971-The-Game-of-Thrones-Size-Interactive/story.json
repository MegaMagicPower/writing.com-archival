Joffrey, Tommen, Myrcella and his own daughter Sansa were talking in the dining hall, as the Hound watched over, leaving him little option to meet with his daughter. He decided he needed a place to rest. So, he saw a cushioned seat in the hallway, and cut a hole in it to fit his body in, only allowing his head to poke out, so as to remain vigilnt. He had started to think about his daughters, his sons, his wife, and started to doze off, when the sounds of earthquakes nearing startled him up, as he saw a figure above him come down onto him, leaving him no time to react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho sat on Ned Stark?</span></div></div>",

It isn't safe.\"  Shea retorts, \"Just lay in bed with me for a bit, I have wine.\"  \"You know I can't resist a good cup of wine, \" Tyrion says as he jump on the bed next to Shea.  Shea then pours Tyrion a big glass of wine, and hands it to Tyrion.  Tyrion as always chugs the wine down like no ones business, however after he drank the wine he felt a bit dizzy.  \"It seems a bit too early for me to already be drunk *burp*,\" he says as he falls to the floor.

Tyrion attempts to exert a great amount of force on the bouncy side, however he seems to have his force applied back to him.  It feels almost human like and is emitting this great warmth causing Tyrion to work up a sweat.  Tyrion then realizes he is naked as well.  \"This is some practical joke...\" he mutters.  As soon as he says this he hears Shea's voice, however it's louder than normal.  He can't quite make out the words, and when he hears Shea's voice the wall to the right of him vibrates.  He starts to thrash around, \"LET ME OUT OF HERE,  IF WHOEVER CAPTURED ME WILL I GUARANTEE I WILL PAY TWICE WHAT HIS ENTIRE LIFE IS WORTH.\"  He feels the walls around him vibrate in an odd manner, and then he sees a glimmer of light and what appears to be a GIANT hand.  \"Holy seven hells!\" he yells.  The hand picks him up and places him right in front of what seems to be a giant Shae.  Shae says, \"I am yours and you are mine.\" Tyrion just had the realization, he was next to Shea's breasts.</span></div></div>",

This is a good thing.\"  \"HOW IN GODS NAME IS THIS A GOOD THING, HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO RUN A KING...\" Tyrion stops as Shea blows a gust of cold air towards Tyrion's penis.  \"Dear gods...\" Tyrion says as Shae starts to slowly take off her clothes.  First the dress, then the bra revealing Shae's enormous tits.  Shea moves her right breast towards Tyrion's face.  \"Lick it,\" she said.  Tyrion did as she asked (he wasn't complaining).  Tyrion licked Shea's nipple creating small bumps throughout it until the nipple finally became erect.  At this time Tyrion's penis was rock hard, and Shae noticed this.  Shae moves her face close to Tyrion's penis and wraps her lips around it.  She sucked her lips tightly then let off.  She backed up her face, and then licked Tyrion's penis as well as his entire body.  Tyrion releases a suspended cry of pleasure. She begins to suck his cock more and more faster and faster until Tyrion almost is about to climax and then she stops.   </span></div></div>",

Shae fully engulfs Tyrion in her mouth  and starts to use her tongue to play with Tyrion.  She playfully hits Tyrion with her tongue more and more, until she is basically swishing Tyrion around her mouth left to right over and over.  At this point Tyrion is screaming and begging to let him out of her mouth and to stop this.  Shae only hears muffled noises inside of her mouth.  Shae swallows, and Tyrion  is powerless to fight it.  Tyrion descends down her neck as Shae enjoys the wonderful feeling of having Tyrion slide down her throat.  Tyrion eventually gets dissolved through stomach acids and his bones are attached to Shae's next trip to the bathroom.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His mind drifted of into a day-dream as he worked his way through the soft flesh, folding and rolling it over the flour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, life at the kneeling king was truely wonderful. With food, a warm place to sleep, and bread to roll all day Hot Pie was at his happiest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the war still raged on, the inn still saw quite a few customers coming along, but the where mainly just the Brothers without banners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did come to Hot Pie as a shock when he found out that he was basickly part of a rebelion force, but as long as they didn't causs him any trouble he was happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy,\" a harse women's shout came from outside the kitchen. \"Are you done with those bread rolls? A swear I'll beat you if it's not.\" Hot Pie groaned before replieing,\"I'm almost done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was one of the few things Hot Pie dispised anbout the inn. That bloody women would annoy him so often and even clot him with a wooden spoon. It made him so angry some times that he wished he fled with Arya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut thinking about it was just plain folly. Why would he give up his life here at inn to go with Arya galloping in the woods? No, he licked it here. Though he disliked the women, the innkeeper was a different story.He was much more friendlier, talketive, and felt somewhat like a father to Hot Pie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBending down to place the rolls in the oven, Hot Pie felt how his breeches strained. For the last month, Hot Pie had experienced strange growth spurts. \"Your growing like a weed,\" the Women ones told him. \"Either that, or your getting fat.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat could be the reason, but if it was so, then why was the innkeep experiencing the same problem. \"You blasted women. You shrunk my clothing in the wash again,\" he bellowed one morning, coming shirtless down stairs. The Women only snorted. \"I guess your also getting as fat as that boy in the kitchen,\" she said, pionting towards his round beer-gut. He cursed her and went upstairs again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut these days it seemed that all his clothes where too tight in him, but Hot Pie couldn't worry about that today. He had to go with the innkeep hunting somewhere close to midday.</span></div></div>",

He could still remember the days fleeing Herrenhal, when the sores between his legs felt like fire-ants bitting him. \"Ag, why do we have to go hunting? Can't Lem and the others do it?\" Hot Pie complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe innkeep gave him a sharp glance, saying,\"Lem and the others are escorting Arya. It's up to us to fetch some ge.\" Hot Pie mumbled under his breath, tugging on his tight breeches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo ignore his discomfort, he stared out on the road ahead. It was then, for some reason, that Hot Pie noticed that his garron seemed smaller. 'I'm just imagening things,' he told himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes drifted towards the innkeep.

Hot Pie followed him, ajusting his breeches it will sit more comfortably. He walked behind the innkeep, his walking pace faster then usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spotted a rabbit in the field.

Once she was outside the tiny walls of the city Daenerys bent down for a better look, but this inspection yielded shocking results, she could just about make out little people, running around and screaming, terrified of the giant invader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grin spread across Daenerys' face.. this wasn't a model city.. she was just huge.

Scanning the ground below her she spotted a huge crowd of people who had gathered in a town square to watch her, in a way she was flattered but that wasn't enough to stop her rampage. She raised her boot over the crowd, engulfing them in the shadow, and held it there. The little people below were scurrying like ants as rocks and debris fell from the boot above like meteors, they screamed and ran but the shadow was way too big to escape. Daenerys let out a little giggle as she realised bits of dust and pebbles were falling on them, causing them to frantically scurry around like little bugs, she observed for a few more seconds before gently lowering the boot onto them, hoping she could feel something, unfortunately for her they were far too small to be felt through the leather but that didn't stop the pleasure she received from crushing hundreds like bugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys spent a couple of minutes wandering around the city, ignoring the little squeaks and squeals of the citizens below as she trampled on them and their homes, she noticed a group of roughly 10 people doing their best to run from her, but from her view in the sky she noticed they were running into a dead end alley, this gave her an idea. Daenerys knelt down at the entrance to the alley and treasured the look of fear she could just about make out from her soon to be victims when they realised they were trapped. She lowered her head down to the ground and extended her tongue, it was almost the width of the entire alley, she carefully moved her head forward, running the tongue along the ground, seconds later the pink beast collided with the little peasants and she retracted her tongue. The taste of dirt in her mouth was off-putting but it was easily worth the pleasure she was getting from feeling the little bugs squirm and writhe around in her mouth, she was sat there for at least 10 minutes sloshing her tongue around and toying with them before she began flicking them to the back of her throat and sending them down her gullet one by one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Daenerys had finished with her snacks she realised just how aroused this whole ordeal was making her, did she...</span></div></div>",

Wanting to get a little more comfortable she reached for her feet and slowly pulled off her dirty boots, revealing her bare feet to the thousands of remaining citizens. Carelessly Daenerys tossed them to the side, immediately after she heard a dozen tiny screams before they were abruptly silenced. She looked to her left and began to laugh, without even realising she'd killed hundreds of people discarding her boots, \"I hope you guys are enjoying your new Queen\" she said as she observed the panic below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told Daenerys was unsure with what to do, she was the most powerful woman in westeros but all of her subjects were like ants to her. She flipped herself over and lay down on her stomach, entirely aware that she'd just flattened over a thousand people under her body trying to get comfortable. She lowered her face to the streets, everywhere she looked people were running for cover, trying to escape her gaze and praying they weren't about to die, eventually though Daenerys began dropping her finger from the heavens, smashing up houses and families just for the pleasure. She continued doing this for a few minutes before she felt a prodding at her chest, glancing down she noticed a crowd had formed before her cleavage, at the front of the crowd were a handful of men with spears and swords and behind them a couple of hundred citizens cheering them on as they poked at her exposed skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could barely feel their steel and they had no hope of drawing blood, but still she watched, waiting for one of them to look up. About a minute later they began to look to the sky, every single member of the crowd froze as her enormous eyes stared down at them, her giant lips turned to a grin as her left hand came crashing through the city behind them, sweeping them straight into her cleavage along with some debris. Daenerys stood up to her full height, towering over the tallest buildings in the city, she could feel a surprising amount of squirming from between her breasts considering their minuscule size, however it only gave her a few minutes of pleasure before she grew bored once again, meaning the citizens trapped in the bosom of the dragon queen met their end as she smashed them together with hands. Still recovering from the rush of pleasure Daenerys was distracted by a faint horn in the distance, she turned around to see _________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In total there were only a measly 7 ships, it was probably a scarier sight when they weren't the size of bath toys she thought. Part of her was tempted to just sit down and wait, after all, what could they really do to her? But Daenerys was was horny, and she didn't have the patience to wait for some kind of pathetic attack. Daenerys lifted her blue dress up over her head, and draped it over the Great Sept, seeing such a monumental building used as a clothing rack brought a little smile to her face. She continued undressing with her dirty pants, quickly followed by her matching tanned bra &amp; panties, all deposited on top of the keep. She stood still for a few seconds to take it all in, this wasn't the first time she'd been fully exposed with an audience, but it was the first time the audience were nothing more than worthless mites at her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround a minute later Daenerys began taking steps toward the bay, not even glancing down at the thousands of lives she was ending beneath her bare feet as they smashed through the streets, pulverizing entire families and their houses like they were dirt. Upon reaching the water Daenerys slowly slid her filthy feet inside and her body followed too, hoping to wash herself a little she became mildly annoyed when she realised the water only came up to the bottom of her cunt, even the ocean wasn't big enough for her. After checking out her own curves for a few seconds Daenerys looked up when she remembered the reason she came here in the first place, she giggled a little as the waves from her body entering the water pushed the boats further and further from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you supposed to be attacking me?\" She mocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding there in the water she began to think of the fun she could have with these boats, what ideas did she come up with?</span></div></div>",

She took a slow step toward the nearest boat, trying to cause as little waves as possible. Looking on the deck she counted 8 or so people, fearfully staring at her body. Daenerys lowered her hand down to the water and extended her finger out toward the boat, carefully she pushed the boat toward her cavern, laughing as the sailors started to scramble around on the deck. No amount of experience sailing could help them with this, the giantess continued pushing their boat until they were tightly jammed inside of her. Daenerys moaned as the boat rubbed against the walls of her sex, she couldn't see them anymore but in her head she was picturing the terrified sailors, helpless as she used them for her pleasure. She kept the boat inside of her for a few more minutes before she began clenching as hard as she could, within seconds the boat was obliterated into pieces of driftwood and sailor's bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys was eager to continue, she quickly stepped forward and snatched up a boat into her palm, being significantly rougher now she was aroused. She effortlessly shoved the boat inside of her as far as it would go before grabbing a second one nearby and repeating the process. With two boats tightly packed inside of her she started furiously rubbing at her clitoris, feeling her walls get tighter and tighter around the poor ships. Moments passed and Daenerys moaned loud enough for the entire seven kingdoms to hear as the boats inside of her were crushed by the pressure. Her juices flowed out of her lips like an oil slick on the water, along with bodies and wood and other debris from the boats. Still coming down from her orgasm Daenerys looked around and realised the 4 remaining boats had started sailing away from her as fast as they could. <i>smart</i> She thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Daenerys pursue the boats?</span></div></div>",

She wasn't looking to buy much, if anything at all, she just wanted to get some time for herself and see the local culture. She was wandering by herself, despite Jorah's wishes for her to stay in her quarters. But she insisted to him that she needed some time alone to think and that she wouldn't be long and he reluctantly agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before Daenerys found herself being heckled by a desperate merchant who begged her to buy some of his wares. Being polite she decided to humor the old man instead of just ignoring him. He told her that he had recently received some magic potions that she would be very interested in. Believing him to be a fraud Daenerys told him that she wasn't interested and she began walking away. That's when the old man grabbed her hand and handed her a tiny little bottle. He explained to her that what was in this three inch bottle was a very dangerous potion and that if she were ever in trouble she only need to pour its contents on any would-be assailants. Daenerys tried to refuse taking the bottle but the old man told her it was his gift to her and that if she liked the results to return for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that she continued to wander the city until felt she had seen enough. Daenerys then retired to her room in Xaro's mansion for the night. Late that same night she lay awake in her bed thinking of all that had happened to her and things she had done. And how it all lead her to where she is now. She then thought about the events of earlier that day and she remembered the mysterious bottle she was given. Sitting up, she reached for the mysterious bottle that was just behind her on the bedframe. Unfortunately after she thought she got hold of it, the bottle slipped out of her hands and flew into the air causing most of the liquid to spill out onto Daenerys. Suddenly she felt very weak and she fell off her bed and onto the floor where she passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she woke up Daenerys found herself in an unfamiliar place. Her head was aching somewhat but she tried to ignore it. She then felt a cool breeze come across her body and that was when she noticed that she was completely nude. Which caused her to quickly snap out of her tired state and collect herself. She tried to get a bearing on where she was and find some clothes as well. The room was very large and just in front of herself she could see an incredibly large door, she briefly wondered how anyone could ever open such a monolithic structure. But it was when she saw what was behind her that shook her to her core. Her now empty robes and the mysterious bottle, both gigantic in size. Upon seeing this Daenerys realized what was going on, she was still in her room, only she had been reduced to an incredibly tiny size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the initial shock of being shrunken had settled, Daenerys realized that whatever was in that mysterious bottle must have done this to her. She knew she would need to get back to the old man if she ever wanted to be restored to normal height again. But for now she thought that determining her current height would help her. Standing next to the bottle, which she knew to be only 3 inches high, she compared herself to it and found that she must be only about...</span></div></div>",

Daenerys looked up in fear to see a giant Jorah that was completely unware of her. Jorah walked to her bedside and spotted a broken glass \"what the....\" he mumbled to himself.

She was staring fearfully at the giant pair of lips in front of her when Doreah's massive pink tongue slithered out of her mouth and wet her lips, terrifying Daenerys. Doreah smiled as the little creature between her fingers started flailing and screaming again, she couldn't help but stare at the butt of her little toy, but staring was no longer enough. Doreah ran her tongue against the back of Daenery's body, savoring the slightly salty taste of her skin. She flipped Daenerys in her fingers and started to lick her front too, Daenerys put her arms out to try and stop the massive tongue but she was powerless. Doreah continued licking away at the tiny queen, making sure to taste every area of her petite body. Daenerys even calmed down a little too, that is until Doreah opened her lips wide and tossed the queen into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenery's let out a chilling scream as she sprinted along the massive pink tongue toward the light, just as she was about to jump to freedom the giant teeth slammed shut and a chilling laugh echoed through Doreah's mouth.

As much as Doreah was enjoying this she had started to get an overwhelming urge to swallow her little queen, an urge she didn't want to ignore. Closing her eyes she lifted her tongue and Daenerys began sliding down her tongue toward her throat, Doreah placed her hand on her neck and swallowed, moaning a little as she felt the little bulge slide down her throat, kicking and screaming. </span></div></div>",

Then he noticed the two enormous, cream boots that lay either side of his now shrunken body. He gradually raised his gaze passed the tight trousers and blue dress until his eyes met with the gargantuan form of Daenerys Targaryen, with a sadistic smile spread across her face. He began to shout very obscene and rude thing up to his shrinker. Dany then shook her head and raised her right cream boot above her victim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stopped shouting when the giantess before him raised her huge boot above him. The entire sole had a thin layer of sand upon it. From the two inch heel to the worn-out sole. However, before he could attempt to reason with his captor, she lowered her boot and pinned him beneath it, then proceeding to add pressure. He struggled as his ankles were almost crushed by her heel, and his face was being flattened under her sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDany was thoroughly enjoying herself as she smushed the tiny man beneath her boot. She could feel his vibrations traveling through the sole, and onto her sore foot that lay within. This gave her an idea, so she moved her foot of her victim and placed it on her lap, with her right ankle resting on her left knee. \"I have decided you fate, you treacherous, backstabbing tyrant!\" She boomed down at the cowering form lying in her boot print. \"You spent you worthless life turning people into slaves, so it is only fitting for you to become my slave!\"<br>\r\nThe man began to whimper and cry, before getting on his knees and begging his giant goddess. Dany just looked down at the small man before her, and smirked without an inch of remorse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man then got to his feel and looked in horror, as Daenerys grasped the heel of her raised boot, and began to pull. Eventually, Dany yanked her boot off, and an incredibly pungent aroma filled the room. The shrunken man was brought to his knees by the scent, and Daenerys began to laugh. \"I have been wearing those boots for three days straight,\" Dany said, as she flexed her foot, and her sweaty sole glistened in the light. \"And my feet are so sore from walking. Believe me, it doesn't help when my insoles have disintegrated and I don't wear socks.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the small man had even a chance to run, he was snatched up by Daenerys, and held above the opening to her right boot. She then began to recoil a bit. \"Wow, my feet really stink,\" Dany said. \"I can't imagine what the smell is like for you. Anyway, If I don't feel feel you rubbing my feet, then this boot will be your coffin.\"<br>\r\nWith that, he was dropped down the rancid canyon of Daenerys Targaryen's boot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he hit the soft ground, they smell almost knocked him unconscious, but he managed to gain a footing on the sweat soaked ground. He could not understand how such young and beautiful girl had feet that were so bad, they could bring and army to its knees. He looked up and saw her face looking down at him, smiling. Then he looked at the ground he was stood on, and frowned. The sole was so sweaty, the it was turning yellow, and at the centre was a fade number. He tried to see what it was, but the smell and humidity had warped his mind, but it looked like a number 8. Just as he looked up again, the entire boot tilted and he was sent sliding down the raised arch. The smell became more potent as he traveled further into the boot, and the heat became more and more unbearable. He then stopped in a large depression that must have been created by the giantess' sole. He could barely think now, due to the powerful oder that now encapsulated him, before the boot moved again and all light was extinguished. His heart sunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys felt she had given her slave enough time, so began to put on her boot. She felt the heat and humidity increase as her foot moved further into her slave's prison. Once Dany had completely replaced the boot on her smelly foot, she became a bit horny as she felt his body pinned under her enormous sole and his face trapped between her long, moist toes. \"Now rub my feet!\" She said through the fabric of her boot. \"Also, while your down there, you can lick the filth and sweat from between my smelly toes!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys then got to her feet, with her new insole clean her rancid feet, and headed back outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does she go?</span></div></div>",

It was sure to be a brutal battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n            Meanwhile in one of the many courtyards of the palace, Cersei stood staring at the peculiar vial in her hand. A mysterious visitor gave it to her stating, \" He only wished to help balance the tide of the battle. And the vial would do just that.\" She uncorked the bottle and smelled it, which smelled bitter, meaning it was less likely to be poison. She quickly poured it in her mouth gagging while chocking it down. It tasted bitter, but the discomfort was soon overshadowed by the ground looking further away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n          As the ground forces engaged the invaders loud booming, repeating sounds closing in. \" What in the gods is that?\" Tyrion asked.

Sure enough the men sall a gargantuan  Cersei stepping over the castles. She stood at the awe inspireing  height of three hundred feet tall. Her foot landed of a group of five of Stannis's men crushing them under her shoe, nearly stepping on the Hound who was in the thick of the battle. \" Hold your fire!

After a moment Cersei stopped to see that she had literally snuffed out the opposition under her shoes. She the. Begat splashing her hands in the water causing waves to sink ships. Cesrsei grabbed one brining it to her face before crushing it with a loud clap before they could retaliate. At this point Stannis had retreated, humiliated from the two disastrous ambushes left him wanting revenge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n          The beach itself looked like a graveyard. Men lying dead or dieing in the sand, many crushed in large foot prints. Cersei  carefully stepped out of the bay.

Tyrion wasn't fond of his sisters new height, but he also knew better than to make her angry when she gets in one of her \"moods\".  Cersei reached out and gently as she could picked up her ranting son. \" Wh.. What?! I am the king I demand you to put me down!\" She just playfully bowled him over with her fingers smiling widely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n           Joffrey got back up, furious. \" How dare you, men attack her!\" Not one of his men moved, firstly due to the fact that they hated him, and obviously they didn't want to suicidally attack the giant queen. The playful look faded to a frown. \" I think I will have to keep a close eye on you. I'll have to send you to the dungeon.\" She smirked and pulled her gown outward slightly and dropped him in where he was held firmly in place by her breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n             After this she dismissed the forces for the night and found a rather comfortable  patch of grass and reclined. On her side placing Joffrey on the ground to stare at her. \" Now my sweet boy, have you learned your lesson?\" She asked not loosing her maternal attitude. \" Lesson?! The only lesson I am aware of is the one I will have to teach you in obeying your king!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            Cersei smiled as she slipped off her large, elegant shoes. She placed one of them in-front of her before placing her son in her right shoe. Luckily due to her life-stile her feet don't feet sweat much. For Jeffery it wasn't that bizarre really, more like a simple room with a very soft carpet. He attempted to climb out only to realize it was to slopped to climb unassisted. Cersei quickly fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          In the morning the main street of Kings Landing was \" graced\" with a visit from their mile-high queen. She wore the same clothing, and once again had Joffery in her gown. The people cheered, hooped, and hollered as she walked down the street. She then sat down, careful not to sit on anyone and cause another riot. After awhile she grew bored, and her more deviant side called to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n           Cersei had the desire to be pampered, and take advantage of her size to relax even more. She watched as the City Guard brought out prisoners to be executed, by herself. She snatched up the first few before tossing him into her gapping maw before being eaten alive. The four were brought to her feet. Cersei slowly placed her foot on the first as he popped like a grape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCersei lovers the feeling and began to get curious. She slipped her rather pale feet out of her shoes, and wiggled her toes in delight at the sight of her dainty bare feet now each the size of buildings. ( Hell her shoes already double as one.) She raised her right foot over the first and slowly brought her foot down so he would be next to the ball of her foot. She reveled in the feeling of him struggling as best as he could while being bound. She did this until she was ready to move on, and with a sickening crack then a simple twist of her foot obliterated the prisoner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          Next Cersei raised her left foot so her wiggling  toes were above the condemned man like a guillotine. Her toes struggled to crush him, but never the less they got the job done. Next she stamped her foot in a a way that the last prisoner fit just under her arch before she twisted him into the ground as well. Cersei closed her eyes lost in thought, remembering how when she felt powerless when she was younger she would sometimes squish bugs. Even more she would imagine the bugs as the people she hated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she came back to reality she was met with uproarious applause. The feeling of arousal grew and told her to get more satisfaction from the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes she give into her urges, or is she able to fight and keep her regal, demeanor? </span></div></div>",

The crowd began grouping up tighter together as their outrage grew. Meanwhile, high above them, the queen regent had lost her smile. She rolled over onto her side from her stomach and put her hand on her hip. She arched an eyebrow at the group  as it began hurling incomprehensible insults and threats at her. The group tried to surround her. She could hear them behind her back and near her ass. She was tempted to roll back and crush them under her ass, just to show them their place. A large group was gathering near her chest and face. She noted with some amusement that she could crush most of the crown under one breast. As their rage and violence grew, so did that temptation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a deep breath and sighed, the air swelling out her massive chest, causing it to loom over the people even more, casting a slight shadow on those closest to her. Well, if that's the way they want to do it, she thought to herself, I suppose I will just have to teach them their place. She rolled over onto her ass, crushing the crowd behind her with a satisfying series of screams and crunches. She smiled maliciously as she drew pleasure from the tiny bodies splattering beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the crowd, it was not an amusing experience. The ground rumbled as her royal ass fell towards them. The crowd ran from the looming, silk covered mounds that came crashing down towards them. The first few fell under the edge of her ass closest to the ground. They screamed and pounded at the fleshy wall that seemed to crush its way up their body in a seemingly agonizing speed. Their bones cracked and splintered as she rolled over them until they were crushed completely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the crowd looked up as the other cheek of her ass came crashing towards them like a building flung from a massive catapult. They were pinned by the soft flesh, and momentarily thought they were going to be spared until she settled her weight to the ground. Ending their lives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCersei smiled down at the remaining crowd around her in that special, smile she had that showed loathing and disgust towards those beneath her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't pleasure your queen?\" she began in a spiteful tone filled with confidence and loathing. \"I save your city from being sacked, your women and children from being raped, and in return I ask you to perform a service that should be an honor to you lesser beings, and you refuse. What's more, you react with outrage and hostility.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rose to her full height, crushing a few people beneath her feet. She beamed down onto the insects beneath her, looking forward to putting them in their place. The crowd had fallen still upon the sight of their queen looming over them at a height of over three hundred feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are insects, and your place is beneath me,\" she said, her voice cold and cruel, \"You will pleasure me, in whatever way I wish.

Pleasure me.\" She stated, leaning in so her face loomed over the crowed causing to pack away from her slightly fearing her large mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                        Not wanting to wait any more Cersei grabbed a group of five. She placed the two lucky people on either of her four feet tall erect nipples. She held her hand above her mouth leaving the people to fall in to share their fate with grapes. The rest of the crowd realizing having no other choice approached her vagina. They climbed in and began jumping about, greatly pleasuring the sensitive queen. One if the men bit her nipple, she simply plucked the struggling man up and squished him like a bug in her fingers. Adding more to her pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes she could no longer contain herself and climaxed, much to the dismay of the people. The people where forced out of her vagina, many began vomiting. \" You monster... You cunt! No wai--\" Cersei swatted the man on her breast killing him. She laird panting for a moment thinking of what she could do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat dose she do next?</span></div></div>",

She raised her hand and gave a  dainty little wave. <br>\r\n\u201cGood bye, little bugs.\u201d<br>\r\nThey were mere insects in her presence. She had always thought that of the common folk, but now it was more evident than ever. With a smile that could have made even Joffrey\u2019s blood run cold, she began to grow. It was slow at first, barely perceptible to the people below as a mere rumble, almost as if she were repositioning herself. Then she let loose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling was intoxicating, better than any sexual experience she could have even dreamed of. She closed her eyes and let her head hang back, allowing a soft moan of pleasure to escape her ever expanding lips. She ran her hands along her smooth body, not caring what the insects beneath her saw. She felt tiny, ever dwindling bodies brush against her feet as they expanded in size. She wiggled her toes, feeling tiny people  getting caught between and under them, most popping like grapes from the pressure. The little people were pushed along by her feet as she felt her feet reach the crowds. As she grew, she could feel a few people being knocked through the air to the top of her feet by the seismic disturbance and chaos she was causing. Most of the now ant sized people were simply overtaken by her feet, crushed beneath them. Her feet had completely filled the square and were pressing against the buildings that surrounded it. She felt brief resistance and discomfort before increasing the speed at which she grew, causing her feet to plow through the stone buildings. Her feet expanded so that entire neighborhoods and business districts surrounding the square were mowed down beneath her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people in the square looked up in terror as the queen loomed over them,  her massive form blotting out the sun. She raised her hand, and waived her fingers at them. <br>\r\n\u201cGOOD BYE.\u201d Her voice echoed through the square. She then took a deep breath, causing her impressive chest to swell out even further, before closing her eyes and leaning her head back towards the sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople in the crowd murmured amongst themselves, concerned about what was going to happen. Was she going to leave them alone? Was that why she said good bye?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey felt a low rumbling in the street beneath them, unsure what it was. The ones nearest her saw it first. The remaining bricks in the street where she stood began to crumble as her feet slowly began to expand. A thunderous moan filled the air above them as her growth exploded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer feet seemed to spread out in every direction, casting up rubble and dust as the crowd tried to flee but was quickly overtaken. The first few on the edge of the crowd were hit from behind by the wall of flesh. They were pushed along a little ways until the feet were so tall that they actually began slipping under the curvature of the edge of her feet. They were soon   crushed by the massive shifting weight of their queen\u2019s dainty little feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer toes had reached the crowd by this point. The people ran as fast as they could in vain. Some looked back to see the massive toes towering above them. The tiny ridges in her toes that would have been imperceptible at normal size now looked large enough to climb like rungs on a ladder. Her toes broke through the crowd, mowing down people in their path. The toes began to rise into the air before crashing down at random times. Dozens were crushed or swept between her toes. None realized that this horrible act was done without malice and was in fact merely Cersei wiggling her toes at the sensation of feeling the people brush up against them. The toes crashing down sealed the fate for more than just those beneath them. The force and constant drumming of them was enough to cause many in the fleeing crowd to trip and fall, only to be crushed by the ever expanding feet. Her feet struck the buildings surrounding the square, which offered little resistance before being crushed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCersei felt her growth slow to a stop. She let out the breath that she did not realize she had been holding and opened her eyes. At her feet lay a dust cloud of ruble and destruction, all that remained of the section of the city she destroyed. She looked ahead and saw that the Red Keep, the seat of power for all of Westeros, barely came to her genitalia in height. She was truly massive. The mere sight of the capitol beneath her made her nethers to moisten with anticipation, causing massive drops of cum to crash down below her causing more damage and destruction than a boulder hurled from a catapult. She looked down at the tiny city beneath her feet and felt an all too familiar grin creep across her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The first catapult were given the signal to through a piece of stone the size of a toy ball to Cersei which struck her in the stomach. The behemoth of a queen doubled over in pain desperate to catch her breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n         The large Lannister fought the tears deciding to make one of the catapults crew pay for her pain ten fold! The men watched as her chest came slaming down on the wooden warmachine, ensuring an unlucky occupant was put out of commission permanently. Before the men could retaliate she had already scooped them into her mouth to meet an agonizingly slow death as a minuscule meal for their queen. She then continued her warpath towards her father who so far had made a fool out of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       She took a moment to take out her frustration out on a large group of people near her foot. Her foot easily crushed a group of about two hundred people along with quite a few houses. Eventully she came to the second wall which came up to her crotch. She shoulder barged into the wall quickly cracking through. What she hadn't thought of was Bronn and the Hound jumping onto her. Their stabbing blades felt like bug bites. She tried to crush them but missed each time from being distracted by the swords occasionally meeting nerves and pressure points. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   They used the silk of her dresd to move to scale her body. \" You know back when I worked for this bitch she was small frail thing that talked alot. I think I prefer this!\" The Hound called out to Bron. \" Aye, beats a battle any day!\" Was the sellswords retort. Just as soon as the assault began their distraction ended as they both quickly scaled down her dress and dodged her constantly moving feet as she still believed they were still on her body, swatting at phantom pains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n         After a embarrassingly long time she realized she had been fooled. She looked down too see three horseman riding in three different directions to confuse the overly confident giantess as she stomped after the rider on her right. She plucked the rider gently off his horse before bringing him to eye level carefully removing his helmet. Even at her size she could tell this man was a decoy. \" Brave, stupid little man!\" She scratched him with her fingernail easily piercing his breastplate and cheast basically bisecting him. She turned to see her father on the final wall. \" Cersei, I haven't even given the order for my ment to begin their assault! No one can stand in the way of the Lannisters might, stop making a fool of yourself and surrender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCersei felt a wave of embarrassment food through her.

Today though their was a much darker reason behind her walk. She had sent Cersei a bottle of wine that had a very much desired effect in \" reducing\" the queens sway in court.

Then, her smirk slowly resurfaced as she prepared to speak. \"Oh Cersei, that's where you're wrong.\" She snatched Cersei up and dropped her in the back of her panties. Cersei was swallowed almost immediately by Margery's giant asscheeks, which were tightly squeezed by her panties. Cerise felt heat coming from everywhere, and a pulsating from directly in front of her face: Margery's butthole.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh god!\" Margery moans. \"I really had no idea this would feel so wonderful!\" Margery begins shaking her hips and rubbing her giant bubble butt, making Cersei's life hell. Margery stumbles to the wall, and begins gyrating her ass all over it, sending Cersei closer and closer to her anus.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Margery, please! I'll do anything! Stop!\" The queen's begging is only turning Margery on more, who begins flexing her ass. Cersei can feel the muscles contracting and relaxing, creating a sucking sensation from directly in front of her. Margery's butthole catches on to Cersei's dress, and pulls more and more in with each contraction. Her ass is literally eating her.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Margery moans in ecstasy as she feels the queen begin to enter her rosebud, and flexes and last time before relaxing. This final, complete relaxation pulls Cersei up to her chest- only her head and shoulders are sticking out.</span></div></div>",

She groaned, it was pitch black, and smelled rather shitty. Her life wouldn\u2019t be long if she didn\u2019t get out of here. She pushed at the pucker from the inside, trying to get out, but the bitch was clenching it, and the muscle wasn\u2019t budging a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaery sighed happily. She could feel Cersei struggling inside her butt, and it only turned her on. Her plan had worked out amazingly, with the horrible woman now imprisioned inside her without any chance of escape unless it involved a chamber pot. The tables had finally turned, and Margaery was now the one true Queen with no one to oppose her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere still was fun to be had. Just leaving Cersei there to die was boring; she should have the fun with the tiny bitch while she could. She squeezed her asshole tight as she thought. Sansa would quite enjoy what she had done, having reasons to hate Cersei that topped Margaery\u2019s. Perhaps they could play together, and let her torment the little queen. Joffrey also crossed her mind. What better way to punish her, than to be crushed by her son\u2019s cock. The young king had been trying to fuck her before the wedding, but it wouldn\u2019t hurt to let him have her ass. Oh the possibilities~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her anus was clenched shut and climbing further up was an even shittier idea. She would suffocate soon enough, as the lack of breathable air was quite clear. The bitch would never let her out other than to finally dispose of her; Cersei only wished she had the idea first. The thought of sticking that smirking whore up her ass to die gave her a fleeting moment of joy as she was jostled around by Margaery's movements. She tried to hold on to the slimy walls but it was no use, she couldn't get a grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings seemed to stabilize for a bit, then something pushed through the exit to join her, pinning her to the side of the cavern. It didn't take long for the Queen to realize what it was as it slid over her. That slut was getting assfucked. She wailed in pain as the cock pinned her down. Nothing seemed to be broken, but what little air she had was knocked out of her. It only lasted a few minutes, but there was no relief, it just got worse as she was nearly drowned by cum, the hot thick goo getting into her eyes and mouth and nose, cutting off what little air she had left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaery moaned as Joffrey pounded her from behind. It had been quite easy to manipulate into this, with teenage lust as it is, any hole was preferable to a hand. Of course the boy didn't last long. Margaery put on her best fake orgasm as he spilled his seed inside her ass, and onto his mother. That thought was what turned her on the most, the end of Cersei covered in her son\u2019s semen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoffrey grunted as he pulled out and collapsed on his back, panting heavily, leaving Margaery's ass suddenly empty, except for the jizz dripping from her gaping hole.  She turned, and took his cock in her hand. The slick member was still mostly hard, and she noticed a former queen lodged in his foreskin. \u201cOh Your Grace,\u201d she moaned deeply, letting the bitch know exactly who\u2019s cum she was covered in, and quickly slurped her up along with the cock before he noticed. She cleaned the shaft, sliding Cersei and her tongue around it, and dragging the tiny bitch along with it. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As she walked through the halls, she thought deeply about what she had done. Swallowing Cersei satisfied a hunger she never thought she had. Despite being such a small size, the little queen felt like a banquet in her belly. And the thought of actually eating a person, just made it more satisifying.

She wasn\u2019t hungry at all thanks to the royal meal earlier; and she did want to protect the girl. Thankfully there were plenty of expendable people in a castle as large as this. Any random servant girl would do, and just as luck would have it there were several nearby.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping outside her chamber, she walked to the nearby room where her handmaidens were waiting. She had asked them to leave the two of them be unless she called for them. Sansa\u2019s girl Shae was also with them. Margaery had never trusted that one, even if Sansa did. She always acted strange around Tyrion, as if she was hiding something and her mistress was too na\u00efve to pick up on it. \u201cShae, Sansa needs your assistance.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSansa looked confused when Shae returned with her, but kept quiet as Margaery worked on her plan. \u201cWe require your company,\u201d she said, unfastening Shae\u2019s dress easily and exposing her breasts. She gave the maid a nip on the ear and walked over to the wine cabinet to get her magical wine. There was plenty left after Cersei was disposed of, and it really shouldn\u2019t go to waste as much as it cost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShae was as shocked as Sansa, but obeyed and undressed completely, her eyes darting from Sansa and Margaery. \u201cThe poor dear is rather lonely, with her husband being celibate for the first time in his life. I thought a third would spice things up.\u201d  Sansa\u2019s face was nearly as red as her hair at this, but she kept silent as she watched Shae undress, and did likewise.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaery returned to Shae, handing her the goblet. She seemed more comfortable now, even being naked in front of two powerful women, even taking the initiative, slipping a hand inside Marge\u2019s gown to cup a breast, and then kissing the future queen deeply.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as she wouldn\u2019t mind having fun with the girl that didn\u2019t involve her being three inches tall, Margaery was in a hurry to get to the point before Sansa started to protest. She returned the kiss for a moment and broke away. \u201cMmm, have a drink while we get ready.\u201d Shae smirked and gulped down the wine. Margaery wasn\u2019t wearing much herself, a thin dressing gown that she easily dropped to the floor She sat next to Sansa and beckoned her pet over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShae had primarily been with men most of her life, such is the life of whore, but she was no stranger to women. She had always tried to protect Sansa, and never thought about her in that way, but the lustful Margaery had definitely put her in the mood tonight, especially since Tyrion didn\u2019t seem to be fucking anyone, including her. And the wine; maybe she had gulped it down too fast but it hit her far stronger than it usually did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking her lips she got down on all fours and crawled on the floor towards the pair, focusing on Margaery first. \u201cI\u2019m here to serve, Your Grace,\u201d she said, hoping to flatter the future queen. If she made Sansa happy, that was good, she needed some happiness in her life.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaery took her chin in her hand and smirked down at her. \u201cMmm, I like the sound of that. Good thing Cersei isn\u2019t around to hear it.\u201d Shae agreed wholeheartedly, lifting her head to kiss her again, but her lips seemed to just get farther and farther away, and then, she fell, onto\u2026 something. Shae panicked and looked around to get her bearings. She was lying on what looked and felt like flesh, and when Margaery\u2019s face loomed massively over her, that\u2019s when she realized she was either crazy or had shrunk to a few inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s how you did it!\u201d exclaimed Sansa. \u201cSo what did you do with Cersei after you shrunk her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaery cackled and gave Sansa a deep kiss before responding. \u201cI shoved her up my ass, and later on I swallowed her,\u201d she said, patting her tummy. \u201cShe\u2019ll be nothing but shit in the chamber pot in the morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, how dirty! But I wish I could\u2019ve been the one to do it,\u201d Sansa said, \u201cHer and every Lannister that was ever born.\u201d At this point Shae knew she was in deep shit and tried to run away, hopping off onto Margaery\u2019s thigh, but her hand came down over her, imprisoning her like some bug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you can! I have enough wine left over. Get rid of Tyrion and you can marry Loras, and then Tywin goes next, and Joffrey will be mine to control. Might take years, but once I have a son\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nShae didn\u2019t give a damn about any Lannister but Tyrion, and she lost all sense when he was threatened. She pounded on the leg and even bit in rage. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare hurt him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a wonderful plan. Bodies disposed of in a way no one could ever expect. Maybe even frame Tyrion for Tywin\u2019s death so all the other disappearances would start to make sense. Grandmother would be so proud of her. Her scheming was interrupted as a bug bit her on the thigh. She winced and scooped up the tiny woman, having nearly forgotten her. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare you hurt him\u201d she said, struggling in her grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Shae. Can you change her back? You could\u2019ve just told me instead putting on this show,\u201d Sansa said innocently. Margaery eyed the tiny woman and shook her head. If there was a cure, she didn\u2019t know it. This was old magic, from the height of the Valyrian empire, it would not be reversed easily, if at all. Not that she had ever intended to spare this one, but Sansa was a kind girl. It would be good to teach her some bloodlust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy does Tyrion mean so much to you? His family killed hers, and now she\u2019s in a pointless marriage to him. It would be better to set your mistress free.\u201d  Margaery would get to the bottom of this, and get rid of a Lannister spy in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShae bit her again, on the thumb this time. It felt like a light bug bite and didn\u2019t break the skin so it was easy to ignore. \u201cHe\u2019s mine! First I lose him to a younger woman, now you\u2019re planning on killing him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaery smirked as everything fell into place, and Sansa gasped, having gotten the hint as well. \u201cYours? Sounds like this is serious. Not only did he send you to spy on Sansa, he\u2019s also been fucking you the whole time. Really now, you may not like him, but rarely a woman gets a chance to get even on the other woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSansa didn\u2019t need any more convincing, she took Shae from Margaery and squeezed. The tiny woman screamed and sobbed and fruitlessly tried to pry her fingers open. \u201cWhat did you tell them?\u201d she demanded.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, Marge nuzzled Sansa\u2019s neck, kissing it softly. She didn\u2019t know what secrets she had told Shae, if any, but she finally had an opportunity for a small bit of revenge. \u201cGo on, you can have her. Torment her all you\u2019d like, use her as an insole, a sex toy or whatever first, but eating her at the end is the best. I had Cersei for a late breakfast and I\u2019m still not the least bit hungry.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She watched with a mix of amusement and disdain as the visiting dignitaries gorged themselves on the food that her house provided. They were a group of menial representatives from various trade groups and low houses. No one that would be missed. Unfortunately, Joffrey could not be trusted to sit through such events due to his temper and proclivity towards violence. Therefore, it fell to her, the acting Queen Regent to suffer through it. However, tonight, she actually looked forward to the banquet, for it was sure to be a feast to remember. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the feast, she had the wine steward mix in the shrinking potion with the wine that was being served to the guests. Now, the wine that they were to toast with contained far more shrinking formula than what she gave to her brother\u2019s whore. She motioned for the server to pour everyone the special wine for the toast before motioning the young girl towards her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave yourself a glass too, deary. In fact, pour one for all of the servants and guards in the room. This is an evening of celebration.\u201d Cersei said, dismissing her with a wave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she saw that all the glasses were filled, Cersei stood and tapped her glass slightly. Once the drunken conversations died down, all of the gazes in the room fell unto her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy friends,\u201d she began, laughing slightly at the thought of these inferior fools being friends to her, \u201cWe are gathered here tonight to recognize you, the little people. This dinner is to remind you that we in King\u2019s Landing recognize all of our citizens, no matter how big or small. A toast, to the little people!\u201d<br>\r\nShe finished her toast, raising her glasses. The room murmured a reply, many unsure if they had been insulted. As they greedily gulped down her wine, none noticed that the Queen Regent herself did not drink. She merely sat at her chair, idly twirling a lock of her golden hair around one finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effects were almost instantaneous. Glasses and cutlery fell as the guests panicked. They all felt so strange. Was it poison? The Queen was known to do such. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCersei began to laugh loudly, a sick, maniacal laugh, as she watched the guests and servants and guards all dwindle down into their clothing. The wine glass crashed to the ground as the serving girl next to her disappeared into her clothes After waiting for a moment, she stood and walked over the the unfortunate server\u2019s clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd now, for the main course.\u201d The Queen said softly as she reached down to see how small the girl, and the other guests, had become.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She opened her hand and looked upon the shrunken girl, who was no more than 3 or 4 inches in height and stark naked. The tiny girl cowered and screamed in the palm of the Queen Regent, a reaction that made Cersei shiver with excitement and began a stirring in her loins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well LITTLE girl\", Cersei purred, \"I bet this isn't what you expected when you were asked to serve at my little banquet here. Rest assured, regardless of this tiny setback, the party WILL go on.\" She laughed to the empty room and walked the short distance back to her seat at the head of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe carried the girl and dropped her into an empty wine goblet on the table, the walls too tall and steep for her to ever climb out of.

She ignored the heaps of cloth situated on the chairs, there was no way the tiny guests could have climbed down from that height. She also ignored the suits of armor positioned around the doors of the hall, strong and able as the guards were, it would take probably 50 of them to move a single steel breastplate or helmet at their size. She had different plans for them. No, Cersei was only concerned with those on the floor, they're the ones who could possibly escape, and that she couldn't allow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached the first heap of garbs on the floor and looked down at them. She couldn't remember who they belonged to, and she honestly didn't care, to Cersei they were so <i>beneath</i> her, literally and figuratively. She grinned evilly and licked her lips as she quickly snatched up the coat, revealing a small man who was tangled underneath. He was fat, ugly, old and from the expression on his face very confused and scared. Perfect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a second thought Cersei lifted up her right foot, positioned it over the man and swiftly brought it down. Her boot encounter a brief moment of resistance after the impact and then with quickly added pressure she felt the little man give way under her foot. There was a short series of muffled cracks and pops and then with a wet and loud <i>SQUISH</i> the remains of the little Lord spurted out from under her red heeled shoe like an overripe fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she pressed down on him, squeezing him into the floor like a berry she let out a small moan. She looked down at her foot and the mess that was once a person and purred loudly. \"Mmmmm it feels even better than last time with that little whore.\" Twisting her foot on the remains she continued on to the next pile of clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one Cersei went from pile to pile around the room, stepping on each Lord and Lady she found. Some she squished slowly under the toe of her boot, their limbs flailing wildly and their screams turning into gurgles as their organs were violently ejected from their mouths. Others she quickly mashed under the clunky heel of her shoe, once or twice almost slipping in the gore left behind. The evil Queen pranced around the hall, her shoes becoming damp from being soaked in the blood of her shrunken victims. She laughed and giggled as she mercilessly exterminated her guests, the sounds of their demise beneath her feet were music to her ears. \"Ahhh, a queen could get used to this!\" She said between exhilarated breathes. \"You all should be very honored to be my entertainment this evening. I do hope you all are enjoying this dinner as much as I'm enjoying crushing each and every one of you beneath my wonderful feet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After her stomping rampage, and confident she had killed every guest on the floor Cersei turned her attention to the remaining guests stranded on their chairs, and the guards trapped beneath their armor. First, she walked over to the table and picked up a large bowl, emptying out the bread that was in it. Wiping out the bowl she gleefully hummed to herself as she walked back around the hall and went to collect all the guards who had been shrunk, the sounds of her humming occassionaly interrupted by a juicy squish as she trod on the remains of a tiny guest. As she had predicted, all the guards were trapped beneath the bulk of their armor, whether it be their helm, a steel breastplate or a shirt of mail. The queen collected all of them (9 in total) and placed them in the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill humming playfully Cersei walked back to her seat at the table and placed the bowl full of naked men on it. She looked down at the bowl of squirming men smiling viciously. Even though they had been shrunk the Queen's eyes still spied their muscled bodies, sweaty no doubt from fear and from their attempts to escape their piles of armor. It made her wet beyond belief. She waggled her finger at the men in the bowl and said in a teasing voice, \"Now you boys stay put. I have to get some of our other dinner guests ready and I don't want anyone thinking they can shirk their duty. Anyone I find trying to escape I will break both of their legs with my bare hands.\" She giggled, \"and then I'll step on them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the guards sorted out she grabbed a large silver tray and once again made her rounds around the table, this time collecting the remaining lords and ladies from the chairs. She snatched them up one by one and plopped them onto the tray, ignoring their screams and sounds of confusion. Once she had retrieved all of them she was ready to begin. Cersei walked back to her seat at the head of the table, pleased to see that none of the guards in the bowl had dared to escape. She placed the tray on the table in front of her seat and began to sit down, however something she saw caught her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young servant woman, the first victim of her torment was still trapped within the wine goblet at her place. She tipped the glass, causing the small woman to tumble out into her hand. Looking down onto her tiny shivering form filled Cersei with lust and power like she had never felt before this day. \"Did you think I had forgotten about you my dear?\" She asked the whimpering woman. \"I believe this party is coming to an end, but there is one more thing I need you to do my servant. I need a cushion for my chair.\" The girl looked confused and began to plead with Cersei but it was all in vain. The giantess Queen threw the tiny girl onto the center of her chair and before the shrunken handmaiden could move she was utterly eclipsed in a shadow. She looked up to see the Queen Regent hiking up the back of her dress, exposing her silken undergarments that so wonderfully and tightly hugged the curves of her royal rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Cersei lowered herself onto the seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the servant girl at just 3 inches tall it was like the sky itself was falling on top of her. Crying and afraid she muttered, \"please, by the gods..\" as her world was flattened under Cersei's silken backside. Without the interference of her gown the Queen was able to really feel the squirms of the girl under her. She wondered if the servant could tell how aroused she had become, with how damp her panties had felt. With a cruel smirk on her face Cersei wiggled her butt from side to side, brutally rolling the girl under her, painfully contorting her and breaking several of her limbs no doubt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a slow gasp, Cersei repositioned herself so that the girl was pinned directly under her womanhood. The Queen tried to imagine how it must be for the girl, so utterly overpowered by her superior femininity. Cersei felt like a true Goddess. She was going to kill this woman she thought, destroy her, and all with just her royal cunt. With a loud moan she began to press into the chair and rock back and forth, grinding the poor soul into her cunt, humping her into oblivion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCersei humped her shrunken toy for several minutes, increasing in passion, one hand playing with herself through her soaked panties, the other gripping the table with white knuckles. For a while she could hear the girl screaming, when her head was exposed from under her. Not long after the sounds of screaming were replaced with a wet slapping sound, and the haughty moans and grunts of the Queen. It didn't take much longer till she came, letting out a loud, long moan that left her slumped and shuddering in her seat. She looked down between her legs, panting heavily, the girl was long gone, reduced to nothing more than a chunky smear on the seat and a red stain on her Dornish Silk panties, the blood from her poor fuck toy mixing with the juices from her womanhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.....my....gods.....that was amazing.\" She said outloud between breathes. She wiped some sweat from her brow and looked around the room, almost as if she had forgotten where she was. She looked down at her remaining victims, the guests on the tray and the guards in the bowl both staring at her with absolute fear and horror. \"My goodness, in all my fun I nearly forgot about all of you! What a poor host I am. Ha ha ha ha! Well, I don't know about all of you, but all this excitement has worked up quite an appetite. I think it's time for me to wrap up this party and relax...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had already thought of what she was going to do. Sighing contently she picked up the bowl of guards and placed it on the ground at her feet. As for the tray of her guests, she slide the plate closer to her and relished in her power and dominance over them. They were so pathetic, pathetic and now they really knew it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned over to look under the table and addressed the bowl full of guards. \"Well, I am completely exhausted from all of this evening's fun and since it seems that I have squished all of my servants, I will require YOU strapping young men to help me, your Goddess, relax a bit.\" The Queen then pulled up the hem of her skirt and began to slip off her bloodied, heeled boots revealing a very luscious pair of legs and feet, wrapped in fine white stockings. She wiggled her toes teasingly within their silken confines over the heads of the guards. She laughed as she looked down upon them and said, \"well you all are some good looking muscled young men, surely you won't mind giving your Goddess Queen a well deserved foot rub?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen much to the horror of the guards, Cersei began to lower her stocking feet into the bowl, and on top of the guards. The shrunken men were pushed down into the bowl in a jumble of arms and legs as Cersei rested her warm and slightly moist stocking clad feet upon them. She let out a disappointed huff and lightly pressed her feet into the bowl of men, \"come on now, I don't feel anyone rubbing down there.\"  She then began to lightly knead the men beneath her feet as if they were dough. She alternated lifting the heel up of one foot, then the other, deliberating smushing the guards, while slowly curling her silken toes. Cersei smiled deviously and gave a small giggle. \"Mmmmm this feels MUCH better without those boots on. My my yes this is definitely where you little men belong, squirming so nice and warm under the soles of your Queen. I may have to make this a regular event! I can just feel all the stress from my poor feet washing away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, with the guards so decidedly put in their place, Cersei's expression became much more sinister as she turned her eyes to the shrunken people on the plate before her. She licked her lips and said, \"now then, I am quite famished, and you little worms are looking more like morsels by the minute.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cersei continued to rub her stocking feet into the bowl of shrunken men under the table, their squirming bodies becoming her foot massager. She turned her attention back to the victims on the table in front of her, leaving the guards below at the mercy of her tired soles. She let out a content sigh and briefly stretched, barely regarding the group of victims before her on the plate, most of them sobbing and huddled together, scared and confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that I am comfortable, I'm going to enjoy my meal. May I just say again my guests, how honored I am that you could join me for this wonderful event!\" She said with fake sincerity in her voice. She then heard frantic squeaking from among the group on the plate and leaned in to hear, \"w-what are you going to do with us, your Grace?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat back up and clapped her hands together and smiled. \"I'm so glad you asked that.\" Her expression quickly changed to a sinister grin, and her toes clenched with anticipation as she said, \"I'm going to eat you all. I'm going to devour each of you and then you will be put in a place where such pathetic things belong: in my chamber pot.\" Cersei revelled in the sounds of fear and panic that erupted from the plate on the table, and she forcefully rubbed her feet into the bowl of guards, this time eliciting some cracks and cries of pain from below which sent tingles up her spine and again quickly made her wet with arousal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately upon her announcement some of the shrunken victims bolted from the platter; and were quickly destroyed by the royal goddess as she brought her clenched fists down upon them not unlike how one would smash a bug. Their bodies instantly crumpled under her fists, reduced to a outward spray of blood and bits of flesh. They were there, alive one second, then completely erased the next. Then with the brave(or stupid, depending on your outlook) ones dealt with, the evil queen picked up her fork and knife, and promptly skewered the nearest morsel and brought it to her mouth. \"Hmmm, i always wondered what pathetic tasted like...\" she taunted. The small man had been impaled straight through the waist and was still very much alive although in incredible pain, screaming and writhing on the end of the utensil. Cersei paid him no mind. She licked her lips and slurped the man off the fork, quickly followed by her biting down on him. To the queen, he was delicious, succulent. She moaned at the flavor while chewing loudly, with each smack of her lips she sent bits of blood and gore raining down on those left on the platter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the course of the rest of the dinner Cersei divied her attention between the bowl of guards at her feet, and the little lords and ladies on her plate. Some she plucked out of the air with her bare hands and devoured piece by piece, others she torn apart with knife and fork, savoring their flesh like a fine roast. One of the ladies she dropped into her goblet of wine and watched throughout the meal as she slowly drowned in the cup of the Queen only to be finally swallowed whole to help wash down the remains of another shrunken victim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Sorry if these posts are really long but I kind of hate breaking this stuff up in to a bunch of small abrupt chapters.)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With her meal finished, Cersei leaned back and let out a loud un-lady like beltch and patted her full belly. It was time to end this party and move onto bigger and better plans. But first she had to do something with the squirming bowl of men under her feet, and after a moment's thought an idea came to her. Dabbing her bloodied mouth with a cloth she scooted her chair back from the table and regarded the shrunken guards at her feet. \"Well boys I think it's time that I get going, and I would love to crush you all out like the bugs you are, but you feel sooo good under my soles, I want to keep you! What's a girl to do? I think I've found a solution.\" Cersei grabbed her bloody boots and snatched up half the guards from the bowl. She dangled them over the opening of one of her boots and with a giggle dropped them in. She then did the same with the other half of guards for the other boot. Then with both her shoes filled with the shrunken men she gleefully said, \"I've decided to keep you all as my insoles! That way I can still feel your little bodies under my feet, AND eventually, squish you all into paste. Isn't that a great idea?\" Cersei then let out a cruel laugh and began to slid her beautiful white stocking clad feet into her shoes. Most of the smart guards immediately ran to the toe of her boots as her feet entered, but one or two of the slower ones found themselves squarely under her heel or the pad of her foot, once they had settled. As she stood up from her seat those unfortunate men directly under her feet were splattered, their blood and organs spilling out into the rest of her boots, much to the horror of the remaining guards. Cersei however was loving it, letting out a loud moan and wiggling her toes in her shoes as she felt a warm liquid sensation soak her feet. \"Mmmmm I think shrunken men insoles is gonna become a staple of my wardrobe, you little boys just feel too good under me. Well, let's head up to my bedroom shall we? The rest of you, try not to get squished right away okay?\" She then let out another cruel laugh and walked out of the dining hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her way back to her quarters Cersei met with her secret advisor and personal maester, Qyburn, who was responsible for creating her shrinking potions. She arranged with him to have the dining hall cleaned and the whole ordeal covered up, including the missing house guards. She also ordered him to synthesize more of the potion for future uses. She had big and upcoming plans for her kingdom and it's pathetic people. She then continued her walk to her quarters, deciding to take the long scenic route, relishing in every step, feeling the guards pressed under her soles. By the time she reached her bedroom and slipped off her heels, the only thing remaining were bits of bone and viscera that were stuck to the bottoms of her stockings. She masturbated vigorously that night, almost screaming out in ecstasy as she touched herself to the sight of her soiled stockings and shoes. She later dreamed towering over Kings Landing, ruling all of Westeros as an unstoppable giant goddess. Cersei slept very well that night indeed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(The next chapter I'm going to skip ahead to after Joffery has died and Cersei has seized power as official Queen Regent.)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Jon Snow called after her Ygritte couldn\u2019t help but smirk. People always underestimated her, thought that she wasn\u2019t smart or capable. Because she was young. Because she was a woman. Because she was pretty. But she paid attention, she planned ahead and, most important of all, she remembered. She\u2019d seen the way the other women in the camp had been eyeing up the lost crow, measuring him up and finding him far from wanting. In fact if there was any wanting it was on their part\u2026 as in wanting his nice South-of-the-wall-cock to fill their snatches. Jon didn\u2019t see this though, as he didn\u2019t yet understand the way of the Free Folk. They took what they wanted so if a stronger, more capable woman was able to take Jon from her there would be nothing she could do about it other than fight back. That was how things worked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you wanted to keep someone for your own you had to find a way to make him or her linked to you forever. For most that meant a baby. Get a belly big and taunt and you were together forever\u2026 or at least until something better came along. By Ygritte wasn\u2019t ready for a child, not yet. She still wanted to have fun with her lost little crow and a big belly would only get between the two of them\u2026 both figurative and literally. So she\u2019d thought of new plans, different ways to ensure that Jon Snow not only remained her\u2019s but would never think about leaving her, either for another woman or his precious Night\u2019s Watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been two days earlier, as they had passed a field of large boulders with one that was shaped like a foot that Ygritte suddenly had her answer. She\u2019d remembered a story from her childhood that Tigna, the old soothsayer in her tribe, had told her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople thought that giants were another race of people, as different from a man as a dog was from a deer. But Old Tigna claimed that giants had started off as normal people, the same as everyone else. She said that there existed a hidden pool, buried underground, where the warm enchanted waters would transform anyone who swam in them into a giant. Ygritte had been fascinated by giants when she\u2019d been little and begged Old Tigna to learn more until she\u2019d finally told her the sights she\u2019d have to look for if she wished to find the cave. She\u2019d also given her a warning:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrowth of the body doesn\u2019t mean growth of the mind. If one does not know what the pool does they will grow but forget their lives, believing themselves to have always been giants. Only by knowing the truth can one keep their memories.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ygritte had seen the boulder shaped like a foot she\u2019d realized she\u2019d seen the second marker on the path to the caves. For the next few days she\u2019d kept her eye out, at times fearful that Mance had turned them the wrong way and that they were leaving the path only for her to spot the next marker and relief to fill her. And now, finally, she\u2019d come to the cave itself, the mouth hidden by snow and rocks. She\u2019d only seen it because she was looking for it and as she rushed deeper underground, Jon Snow calling out for her to come back, she felt her heart thudding in her chest. She went down a long shallow ramp and then came to a stop, staring at awe at the large glowing blue pool that sat before her. A waterfall fell down from an opening in the stony wall and steam rose in the cool air. Ygritte looked to her right and saw a bundle of old rotting clothing and then to her left where, just beside the pool, she saw in the wet dirt a foot print that was nearly three times the size of her own. Giants had been here, many years ago\u2026 and they hadn\u2019t started off that big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legend was real. And she was here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYgritte!\u201d Jon called, finally catching up to her. He looked at the pool, amazed, and Ygritte grinned as she turned around and stared at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking, Jon Snow. You have so many vows. To your crows. To Mance. To your family. You can have all of them\u2026\u201d she began to yank her clothing off, tossing them away without a care; she wasn\u2019t going to need them anymore. Giants could easily survive the cold of the North and only wore clothing because humans got so flustered around their naked bodies otherwise. She removed the last of her garments and stood before Jon, the cool air and the warm steam making her feel flush\u2026 and the thought of what was about to happen making her heart race and her body tense and ready. \u201c\u2026or you can have me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could see it in his eyes: he wanted her. The Crows could make as many vows and oaths as they wanted but a man was a man and there was nothing one could do to stop a man from being just that. And Jon Snow was a man\u2026 her man\u2026 soon to be forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly began to step back, a coy smile on her face, and she mentally cheered as he began to remove his own clothing, setting them aside in a hurry but with a bit more care than Ygritte. She wanted to tell him he wouldn\u2019t be leaving with those garments but that thought made her stop and wonder\u2026 should she tell him? On one hand she wanted him to come to her of his own will, to accept all that was about to happen. On the other hand\u2026 if he didn\u2019t know he would forever forget his vows, of his life in the South. She would be able to make him however she wished, without fear that one day he\u2019d feel regret. They\u2019d be giants and Jon would believe they\u2019d always been giants. No risk of his morals of values getting in the way. She\u2019d make him as she wanted him to be and reap the wonderous rewards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJon\u2026\u201d she said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was so burdened with his memories and she just knew that if he forgot about his vows and his oaths and his duties he would be the perfect man for her. Handsome. Caring. Fun. She would make him perfect for her and their new life together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure it won\u2019t be too cold?\u201d Jon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know nothing,\u201d Ygritte teased, holding out her hand to him. He slowly approached, his bare feet slapping against the stone, and finally he took her hand in his. \u201cThese are warm springs\u2026 better than anything else in the world.\u201d She stood on her tiptoes and kissed him, their lips first meeting a bit awkwardly before they found their rhymth and soon were kissing passionately. After a long minute they broke, panting. \u201cThis is the only place you\u2019ll never get cold.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I suppose I am in the mood for a swim,\u201d he said with a leer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYgritte grinned, though Jon didn\u2019t know the reason why, and hand and hand they walked into the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water was perfectly warm, easing her tense and aching muscles and warming her flesh. Ygritte closed her eyes as they reached the point where the water was just at their shoulders and slowly began to swim about. Even if the stories weren\u2019t true and this turned out to just be a normal hot spring it would be well worth it. She could feel Jon\u2019s hot gaze as he watched her nude form slip through the water and Ygritte grinned, padding back to him before wrapping her arms around him and giving him another kiss. She could feel his cock hardening, pressing against her stomach, and though she longed to feel that hard thick meet enter her tight hungry snatch there was something else she wanted to feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, as the kiss began to tapper off\u2026 she felt something buzz within her. It wasn\u2019t painful or unpleasant\u2026 it was just an odd rippling feeling. She slowly break from Jon\u2019s lips and looked down at the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt now barely covered the top of her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to laugh in delight. As she focused on her body she could feel herself growing bigger. The bottom of the pool rubbed against her enlarging feet and the water splashed against her body as she began to rise up. She looked and Jon and he seemed to be in a haze as he grow along side her, his swelling body being revealed inch by inch as he grow taller and wider. She pressed her body tight to his, moaning at the sensation of her breasts growing larger against his widening chest, her nipples stiff and aching as their bodies swell. She began to place little kisses on his shoulders and neck and Jon moaned, shifting and slightly thrusting his large, rock hard cock against her curvy form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a short five minutes Ygritte reasoned they\u2019d grown to nearly 9 feet tall. They were taller than Torrmund and Mance and only Wun Wun the giant would dwarf them. Ygritte felt stronger, her limbs filled with power, and as she ran her fingers along Jon\u2019s body she knew he was far stronger as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Jon seemed to come out of his haze and he looked at her, a touch of confusion crossing his features. He knew her, she could tell that much, but he wasn\u2019t sure of much else at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello,\u201d he said huskily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Jon Snow,\u201d Ygritte said. She liked his name and wanted him to keep it even in this new life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled at her, the name now planted in his mind. He began to slowly kiss her, kneeling down in the water as he trailed his lips along her breasts and stomach. \u201cEverything is fuzzy,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI\u2026 know I should know you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, running her fingers through his hair. \u201cI\u2019m Ygritte, my dear giant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGiant?\u201d Jon asked, pausing at her belly button and making her giggle as he began to lick it with his tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. That\u2019s what we are. You and I are giants. Always have been.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm\u2026 of course,\u201d Jon said as he began to move ever slowly down her stomach towards her eager and willing pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYgritte moaned both in pleasure and victory. She\u2019d done it! His memories of his past life were gone! Jon would only remember being a giant and nothing else. No more crows, no more southern lords. Just him and her and tall, huge, powerful giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shuddered as he neared her wet sex. Part of her wanted him to continue\u2026 but the other part wanted to continue molding him. She wanted to shape his memories fully, to ensure that he was hers forever and no one else would try and claim him. Ideas for a new life, one she would create for the two of them, an entire history, tickled at her brain\u2026 but so too did Jon Snow\u2019s tongue on her slit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDecisions decisions.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Margaery had been walking behind Melisandre for a while in order to give the priestess a sense of achievement as she slowly reached the door, before deciding to thwart her efforts. The giantess raised her barefoot and brought it down, with relative force upon her disobedient slave. She then raised her foot, and noticed that Melisandre was not crushed into the floor, as she had intended, before an idea came into her head. Margaery turned, began to walk back to her discarded shoe and sat back down in the ornate chair. She placed her right foot on her left knee, then turned her sole upward before smiling benevolently. Her sole was slightly dirty, having walked across the stone floor, and still glistened in the light, from the accumulated sweat. However, plastered perfectly in the centre of her bare sole was the struggling form of Melisandre. Margaery assumed that the sweat and heat of her feet must have acted as a glue, fixing her slave to her sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my poor slave,\" Margaery said savagely. \"You should never have run from me, because now I know that you are untrustworthy.\" Melisandre tried desperately to shake her head, but this just rubbed her face deeper into Margaery's sweaty instep. \"I must discipline you!\" Margaery said. With that, she peeled the tiny woman off her foot and held her up, at eye level. \"As you can tell, my feet are beautiful, and I work hard to keep them this way,\" Margaery said, matter-of-factly. Melisandre looked down, and could not deny that the girl holding her had perfect feet, although they were the most sick-inducing thing she had ever encountered. Margaery continued, \"So you are going to help me, by acting as my foot cleaner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Margaery said this, all the colour drained from Melisandre's face and she almost fainted. She could think of nothing worse, in life or death, than to be the personal foot slave to this ruthless princess. Margaery was pleased with her foot girl's reaction, then lowered the almost lifeless body towards her rancid barefoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelisandre was less than human, less than any life form. She was nothing more than a foot sponge for Margaery Tyrell. Margaery began by rubbing her sore foot with her new foot 'cloth'. Melisandre's body was dragged along and through every groove in the girl's foot. The sweat and grime began to coat the tiny woman and pollute her senses. This continued for the best part of five minutes, before Margaery was satisfied, and moved her 'cloth' down to her heel. At this point, Melisandre was becoming light-headed due to the stench of Margaery's foot, and her eyes seemed to begin to fail as dirt and grime was removed from her giantess' sole, and deposited in her eyes. Margaery's warm hand covered Melisandre's body leaving only her face exposed for further torment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlood-curdling screams filled the immediate vicinity as Margaery began to grind her victim's face into her smelly heel, in order to remove the dead skin that had formed upon it. Melisandre's face was rubbed raw by the force applied from Margaery and the rough, unforgiving surface that her face was ground into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this torturous ordeal, Melisandre was barely conscious, but had one last job to do. She was raised up to the delighted smile displayed on Margaery's face. Margaery then licked and smelly the limp form infront of her, before saying, \"Wow, you really taste and smell like my feet!\" Melisandre could not even muster a retort to this jibe. \"This must be and honour for you, to be as worthy as my sweaty feet, but you have one final job, slave.\" Melisandre gave a barely audible groan, having lost the will to live. \"You will clean my toes, whilst I contemplate your reward.\" Margaery said before lowering her slave to her beautiful, yet potent feet. She then spread her clammy toes wide and jammed Melisandre's face deep into the toxic crevice that lay between her big and second toes. \"I expect you to remove all jam and sweat from between my toes,\" she added, without remorse. Within a minute, Melisandre fell unconscious. The smell of Margaery's feet had tripled down there, due to the lack of air and noxious fumes that emanated from between the toes. Also, she was unable to block her nose, because her arms were trapped outside of her fatal prison. Before she passed out she took one lick of the grime that lay before her, causing her to convulse and fall unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaery noticed the lack of service that her toes were receiving, so lift the body from between her vice-like toes, and smiled. She had completely broken Melisandre. \"I've never knocked someone unconscious with my feet,\" she exclaimed. \"She'll make a good...</span></div></div>",

Unfortunatly for this soldier, Melisandre was waiting for him in the Dragonstone harbor, infront of the boat that had to take him to the capital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, hello there.\" Said Melisandre with a very calm voice. The soldier knew she was up to something. His hand was ready on his sword. \"Don't be so rude. You know I wouldn't do any arm to you... If I had to reason. Tell me, young boy, what is in your bag ? What is that letter you have to take to King's Landing and what is so precious that you have to avoid me ?\".

Right behind him, his bag, containing the letter. Melisandre looked at him, amused, and just walked to the bag. The soldier was begging her not to read the letter, but the red giantess didn't care, she opened the letter and began the read. \"Please accept my appologies for turning my back to the true Seven Gods... The Red God is fake... Lady Melisandre corrupted my heart...\" she read. \"Very well, Stannis, let's teach you a lesson\" as she was bruning the letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked to the castle when she susddenly remembered: the soldier !

It must have been some sort of Lannister trick. He cleared his eyes to see his squire passed out on the floor of his tent. The squire was a fat boy and James rushed to his side to right him on his feet. <br>\r\n\u201cLord Kalstark, what happened?\u201d The squire asked nervously. <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure, it must have been a ploy by the Lannister\u2019s,\u201d James replied, stroking his bearded chin. \u201cAlert the rest of the troops. An attack may be eminent. We must prepare to march on the Lannisters!\u201d<br>\r\nThe squire nodded and rushed out of the tent. \u201cSir! You should have a look at this!\u201d <br>\r\nJames rushed out of the tent to see that the entire landscape had changed. What was once a thick forest blanketed by night, was now replaced with a warmly, if dimly, lit strange alien landscape. The ground was a light tan, solid terrain instead of the dense underbrush they had struggled to clear when they made camp. The tall pine trees of the forest were replaced with some sort of strange thick, red trees that seemed to snake up into the sky. They were massive and the forest went on as far as the eye could see. The air was humid and had a thick, somewhat familiar, musky scent. Perhaps they were near a bog, James mused. <br>\r\nThe Stark men were all staring at their surroundings in shock and awe. James knelt down and touched the ground. It was almost pliable, and warm to the touch. The ground suddenly rumbled violently beneath them, causing men to scream in fear as they lost their footing and their gear and supplies to collapse to the ground. When the shaking stopped, James pulled himself to his feet. Where were they?<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the Lannister\u2019s did, but this must be some sort of trick,\u201d he said, helping his squire to his feet. \u201c Rouse the officers. We march on the Lannister\u2019s.\u201d<br>\r\nWhile the Starks and Lannister\u2019s marched on each other, neither army realized they were being observed by a higher power. <br>\r\n***<br>\r\nMelisandre looked down the expanse of her luscious body to her bush. She had not trimmed it in some  time and it was thick and lush. She felt a strange tickling in her nether regions as over 2000 little mites were magically transported to there. Thanks to the Lord of Light\u2019s blessing, she could see and feel them if she focused hard enough. Each was smaller than a single strand of pubic hair was thick. She giggled to herself, this would be great fun to watch. She strained her eyes and saw the small encampments inside of her red forest. The Stark army was closer to her stomach, but still well within the bush. The location of the little Lannisters amused her greatly. They were actually quite close to where the slope of her vagina began. Just the thought of them down there got her wet. She wondered how the air was for them. <br>\r\nShe wanted to get a more comfortable view of them, so she leaned herself up and propped a pillow behind her back so she was sitting up to watch the upcoming battle in the forest. She giggled again when she saw the tiny soldiers shuffle and fall. She bit her lower lip in anticipation. The blood ritual called for their deaths, but should she allow them to slaughter one another while she pleasures herself, or sacrifice their lives to her pleasure?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She opened her mouth slightly to gasp--when all of a sudden Margaery flicked her finger, sending the speck into the gap between Sansa's lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want me to get him out?\" Margaery asked, leaning closer to Sansa. Sansa, her mouth still open, slightly nodded. Margaery leaned in further, smiling, and suddenly kissed Sansa, reaching her tongue into Sansa's mouth. A few moments later, she retreated and stuck out her tongue at Sansa. On the tip of it, trapped in saliva, was a miniscule speck struggling frantically. Sansa, meanwhile, had forgotten the unfortunate man, and leaned towards Margaery. Margaery slid her tongue--man and all--into the darkness of her mouth and the two kissed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor farmer was caught between their tongues as they kissed, and all but crushed to death as their tongues pressed against each other. As the tongues slid around, he was thrown aside and landed in a dark, wet puddle deep in one of their cavernous mouths. Moments later, the tongue above came down to rest, crushing him flat between walls of flesh. As the two giantesses finished their kiss, Margaery noticed the faint taste of blood and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they separated, Sansa's boot flattened a farm house as she carelessly moved her foot, bringing about the first of many deaths they would never even realize they caused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaery sat up. \"So, do you want to have some fun?\"</span></div></div>",

The water hardly reached her ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come, Sansa!\" she said. As Sansa stood, Margaery picked up a handful of water and splashed Sansa with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the Blackwater Bay it was chaos. Margaery's boot crashed down, with dozens of small boats trapped between it and the sea floor. Some were lucky enough to get pushed away by the water pressure--others were not. Survivors clung to the sides of her enormous boot, knowing they were only prolonging their deaths. All of a sudden, her hand reached down, trapping several more boats in her palm as she raised it. In a moment, the crews were flying across the sky. Some crashed into the wall that was Sansa's dress. Others scattered on the ground at her feet and were crushed underfoot as she took a step. A few soared across the Westerosi sky, crashing many miles away from King's Landing. One ship crashed into Sansa's cheek, scattering the poor crew across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSansa inhaled suddenly, sucking a few of the hapless crewmen into the depths of her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther men were scattered across Sansa's lips. Those of them who could still move frantically tried to get to somewhere safer, but the feeling of salt water and splintered wood on her lips bothered Sansa, and she extended her tongue slightly to lick them.<br>\r\nFor the tiny men, it was like a mountain emerging. For dreadful moments, the tip of the tongue loomed above them, and then it collided with the lower lip, instantly flattening most of the helpless specks. A few unlucky ones, however, were trapped in saliva as she pulled her tongue back into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSansa stepped towards Margaery.</span></div></div>",

To those on the ground, however, this simple motion was cataclysmic. There were hardly any survivors left in the Blackwater after Margaery's earlier game, but the added mass of the sizable Stark sent most of the contents of the bay flooding into King's Landing, wiping away huge portions of the slums of Flea Bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this was as insignificant as an actual flea's bottom to Sansa, She exalted in the sense of freedom her new stature granted her, but freedom wasn't all she felt.

She knew she was sinning by kissing a woman. The taboo of it all, combined with her knowledge that none of those laws meant a single thing to them any longer, only made the act more seductive.

She pulled back from their kiss and gave Sansa a playful, confident grin as she raise a brow. Sansa looked back, her cheeks flushed as she tensed slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre-are you sure that we should?\u201d Sansa asked, her voice trembling. \u201cWe\u2019re so big, everyone will see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaery smiled softly at her titanic friend. She reached out and grabbed one of Sansa\u2019s hands and turned it palm up. She then stooped down to water, her shifting rocking the few boats that remained afloat at their feet. She reached down and scooped some water into her hand, capturing two of the largest ships in the bay. Each a warship, tasked with protecting the city from attack. A job they could no longer do. Margaery gently poured the water, and the ships, into Sansa\u2019s waiting palm. She then guided the palm up to their faces, until Sansa\u2019s and her faces barely hovered over the ships. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you see, my friend? It is because we are so big that we no longer have to worry what the people of the world think of us.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSansa watched in awe as the water settled in her hand. It was such a small amount, it would barely even be a sip. She could see two tiny objects, bobbing up and down in the water. They were the size of the smallest of small pills. Were it not for the sails, she would thought them to be slivers of wood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese are two of the mightiest warships in Westeros, and they are nothing to us.\u201d Margaery said, lowering her mouth to Sansa\u2019s palm. Margaery lowered her lips to Sansa\u2019s palm, and opened her lips slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the fleet in their hands, the experience was traumatic. They had barely managed to stay afloat from the giantesses initial movements, only to be sucked into one of their palms. The massive ships, each holding one hundred sailors, groaned in protest from the pressure as they were raised into the air by Margaery\u2019s hand. The crew was tossed about in terror as they flew through the air and finally settled into the massive redhead\u2019s cupped palm. As the water settled, they could feel subtle tremors in the water. Her pulse. It was quickening. The voices boomed above them and were suddenly silenced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe terrified sailors looked up to see the giant cliff faces of Margaery\u2019s lips part to reveal an endless dark chasm. The lips crashed into the water, rocking the ships. Before sailors could respond, they felt a massive force sucking at them. The first ship nearest the lips flowed into the awaiting maw as she sucked the water from Sansa\u2019s palm. They bobbed lightly in the mixture of water and spit in the massive humid cavern. The crew could not even see the far end of her throat. They looked back towards the opening and saw the massive teeth lining the front of the mouth, each seeming to be the size of a small castle, and just as impregnable. Before they could adjust to their surroundings, the lips closed, sealing them in the darkness. The water beneath them and tossed as they were lifted into the air by the massive leviathan beneath them. Her tongue. It slid them back towards her throat, sending them over the edge and into the darkness below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSansa looked on as Margaery effortlessly sucked the water and one of the ships from her hand. Margaery closed her mouth, smiled at her friend and swallowed. She looked back at Sansa\u2019s palm, seeing one of the ships resting on her skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwe, it looks as though I missed one,\u201d Margaery said, looking at Sansa with a pout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips crept into a smile as she moved her face towards the ship. She hovered her nose over the tiny ship and raised a finger to one nostril, pinching it shut. She then snorted sharply, feeling the tiny ship hitting the wall deep inside of her nose, shattering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crew of the ship looked up in terror as a massive rush of air sucked them high into the air. The soared past the nostril, deep past pools and webs of snot that were caked onto large trunks nose hairs, each thicker than any ship mast. The ship crashed against the base of one of the hairs, splitting in half. The ships splintered and the crew were flung deeper into the cavern, some being sucked further into the darkness, meeting their fate in the darkened chamber of Margaery\u2019s lungs. The others slammed into the walls of her nose, sinking into the snot and slowly drowning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaery looked at Sansa, confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, dear, dear, Sansa. Are you ready to move past the limitations that we\u2019ve both outgrown?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSansa looked at her friend, contemplative for a moment, before replying\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Either one of them could destroy the Red Keep, and the city itself if they desired. Or even by accident. Part of the city was already flooding with just a splash in the ocean from on of them, and the castle was the size of the the snow castles she used to build at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, my love, I am,\u201d Sansa said, embracing Margaery and kissing her once more. The older girl smiled and parted her lips, her hands returning to undo Sansa\u2019s dress. The people that weren\u2019t fleeing for their lives were treated to an extra special sight, the two most beautiful ladies in Westeros undressing before their eyes, but the show only lasted so long, as the two piled the clothes up on top of the city as a cushion. Not to spare any lives of course, but to provide a slightly more comfortable spot to lie on. The delicate fabrics still toppled buildings and crushed thousands of people all across the city as they weighed tons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSansa caressed Margaery\u2019s breasts, running her fingers over her soft flesh, and her hard nipples. Margaery smirked and pulled her close. \u201cIf you want me, then take me,\u201d she said. \u201cWe shall both be the queens of this world, so let\u2019s show them how two queens make love.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSansa pushed her lover lightly, and fell down on top of her onto the bed of clothes. The two women left a crater were they fell, crushing a large portion of the city flat. Neither thought much about the destruction they caused. Sansa was quite aroused by everything, not only the power of being so big, but also being with the woman she had secretly lusted after for so long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting into the spirit of being a giantess, Sansa snapped off a tower of the Red Keep, and shook out the contents onto her lover\u2019s breast, the small specks of debris and people barely visible to her eyes. Grinning, she leaned down and licked them up, flicking her tongue over the nipple. There was a faint taste of blood, the people likely dying from the fall before she got to them. Margaery looked pleased. \u201cMmm, fun isn\u2019t it? The world is ours for the taking,\u201d she said, pulling Sansa down to her for another kiss, their tongues entwining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both moaned for while hands explored each other\u2019s bodies. Reluctantly Sansa broke the kiss, but only because she wanted to taste something else. She kissed a trail down her lover\u2019s body, nipping and licking at her skin, and even giving a nipple a playful bite. Margaery groaned softly, caressing Sansa\u2019s back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEager to get started, Sansa grabbed another tower, and shook the contents into her the wet slit. The ants should be proud to die in the cunt of a queen. They didn\u2019t feel that way though as several servants and guards slid down into that wonderful abyss, a few drowning in her arousal, the rest not even sure what was going on other than knowing they would die soon. She crushed the tower between her fingers, killing a few more instantly, and then licked the debris from her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaery smiled, looking down at her lover and running a hand through her hair. \u201cGood, you\u2019ve accepted your new position. We\u2019re too far above everyone else, so don\u2019t worry about using them for your amusement.\u201d Sansa felt nothing but pleasure at toying with these lesser beings. She rubbed her face against Margaery\u2019s snatch, burying her nose in her patch of hair and inhaling her scent. She slurped on her clit, her tongue flicking over the nub as she pushed two fingers inside. Her lover cried out and squeezed her face between her thighs. Sansa was messily eating her lover in a very unlady like fashion, groaning all the while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long, the euphoria of her new power had already turned Margaery on greatly and soon she screamed and held on tightly to her lover, her pussy squeezing the invading fingers. Sansa fucked her hard with her fingers, not letting up until her orgasm faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaery panted hard for breath, pulling her lover up for another kiss. \u201cMmm my dear, I have an <br>\r\nidea,\u201d she said, eyeing the Red Keep. \u201cIt\u2019s time for it to go. Why don\u2019t you do the honors? Joffrey killed your father so take your revenge.\u201d Sansa smiled, and stood, stomping furiously into the center of the castle, collapsing much of it on one blow. As horny as she was, this only aroused her even further. With a few more kicks the once majestic keep was a mere pile of red bricks. Joffrey had fled to the dungeons under the castle, hoping whatever the fuck was going on would blow over, or be a dream. The secret passages to outside the city had collapsed so there was no way out. He was crying in the dark in a corner as the castle shook violently, and suddenly collapsed, not even giving him time to scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuite pleased with herself, Sansa sat down on the rubble and hill, using it as her throne. It wasn\u2019t the most comfortable seat, but it the symbolism of it all that mattered. Margaery smirked her sexy smirk and crawled over to her. \u201cYour Grace, let me clean that for you,\u201d she said, taking Sansa\u2019s foot and licking the debris from it. It tickled a bit and Sansa wiggled her toes as her lover cleaned between them, and suckled on them until they were clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere, now let me get down to business my love,\u201d she said, moving in between Sansa\u2019s legs and burying her face in her red bush, her tongue slipping inside. Sansa groaned, and leaned back, holding on to her partner. She felt a finger slip inside her pussy, and another teased her ass. She relaxed her pucker and let the digit in, the older woman being a bit more kinky, but that was all right. Margaery lightly scraped her teeth over the nub, causing Sansa to yelp, and then sucked furiously on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the pent up sexual energy, Sansa wasn\u2019t going to last long ether, she screamed grinded her snatch against her lover, both her holes squeezing the fingers inside them. She drenched Margaery\u2019s face with her cum. She had masturbated before, but never had an orgasm quite like that. Her whole body shook as she came. Not once, but twice, as soon as it seemed over it hit again, even stronger than before. Sansa collapsed, nearly falling off the hill when it was all over, only Margaery holding on to her kept her up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaery withdrew her fingers and and helped Sansa to her feet. Her face and chest were slick with Sansa\u2019s cum. \u201cImpressive, you must\u2019ve been backed up for years.\u201d She kissed her lover, letting her taste herself. Sansa was still panting, her heart pounding in her chest. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long day, and it\u2019s getting dark so let\u2019s get some rest my love.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSansa nodded, and the two left the city, but only for a short distance. The snuggled up on the grass, and crushing several of the farms and small villages surrounding the city proper. Sansa nuzzled her lover\u2019s neck and sighed contently. It was a long day and night was falling, as the two loving giantesses dozed off.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Daenerys Targaryen was on her way home at last, not aware that her rightful castle and capitol had been destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silver haired queen clutched a stone, one that was fortold to have great power. Indeed she could feel the magic thrumming in it, and all the research she could find in the libraries of Mereen told her of its power. It would make her a giant. Exactly how big was unknown. \u201cInspire your men and crush your enemies\u201d could be anything. A titan, that crush cities or merely a giant like was beyond the wall? Either way, with it and her army of Unsullied and sellswords she could retake her throne. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy Queen, it should only be a few more hours,\u201d Jorah said, stepping up beside her. The plan was to land south of the city several miles and she would go ashore alone to judge the power of the stone. Crushing her own army wasn\u2019t her goal. If it was as powerful as she had hoped, she could smash the walls and let her army do the rest, not wanting to destroy the city entirely.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen was still worried. A few hours ago she had felt a surge of magic momentarily, the same sort of power that she felt in her own stone. It could\u2019ve just been her imagination, but something felt off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce at their destination, Jorah rowed her ashore on a small boat. She was concerned for his safety, but he insisted on coming along, not wanting to leave her alone in Westeros even with the power of the stone. She left him at the shore though as she went to activate the stone.<br>\r\nShe walked off in the distance a ways and looked toward the city, the clouds blocking the moon were finally parting and the landscape was illuminated in the moonlight. Something looked very wrong. There was no majestic Red Keep, only a pile of red rubble. The rest of the city looked to be in a similar condition. She growled and looked around, seeing some shapes on the ground not too far away from the city, that looked similar to people sleeping on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJorah shouted a warning, noticing the same thing, but she ignored it and raised the stone up, willing it to activate.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One moment she was holding the stone up, willing it to unleash its power\u2026 and the next there was a blinding flash of light, so strong and so intense she could do little more than slam her eyes shut. She felt a brief sensation like the rocking of a boat, as if the ground she were standing on suddenly moved, but then it was gone and with it was the bright light. Dany blinked, trying to get the spots out of her eyes, and took a step forward in her daze only for the toe of her one boot to strike stone. She looked down, tilting her head, before she realized that she was looking at a rocks that looked just like the ruins of King\u2019s Landing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuins that she couldn\u2019t find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the rumble again and shook her head\u2026 no, it simply wasn\u2019t possible. But then she turned back towards Blackwater Bay and saw her ships bobbing in the water, looking like tiny carven toys that a child might play with. She whipped her head about, taking in the sights around her before the truth came crashing down upon her: the stone had made her grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys towered over everything. She was gigantic to a scale that was mind boggling. She knew that somewhere down below Jorah Mormont stood but as she scanned the ground she realized he was now simply too little for her to see. \u2018No\u2026 I\u2019m simply too big!\u2019 Dany thought and she shuffled away from the shore, hoping he had wisely decided to head back towards the boats and not where she was now stomping now. He could have been screaming and waving his arms but she would  never had been able to tell\u2026 not at her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA roar filled the air and Dany turned in time to see her dragons fly to her\u2026 and then land, looking at her in confusion. She felt herself chuckle at the sight\u2026 they were as small to her as they had been when they were born. The dragons too must have sensed this as they stared at her, their mother, whom they had grown used to towering over, and didn\u2019t quite know what to make of the woman that cared for them once more towering over them. Dany held out her hand and Drogon, always the bravest, moved towards her before finally clamoring up her arm and settling himself on her shoulder while his brothers quickly did the same. It made Dany smile; she\u2019d missed them being this small and being able to hold them so easily. Back then she\u2019d needed to protect them and now, with the stone having made her so huge, she would protect them again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat thought made her pause and truly think about her situation. She\u2019d wanted to take over Westeros but now she had no need for an army or even dragons. She\u2019d be able to do it by herself! What good were siege towers and cavalry when she could crush them all with her own foot? She had such power\u2026 such amazing power\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes swept across the land and finally fell on what, when she\u2019d landed, had appeared to be great pale cliffs of stone. She now saw them for what they were but that did not ease her confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, lying in the fields outside of the ruins of King\u2019s Landing\u2026 were two naked women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one with brown hair was nearly her age while the second was a few years younger but a woman fully grown into her body and with brilliant red hair. They were lying together and Dany blushed a little when she realized that their thighs and faces were coated in the dried remains of their lovemaking. These two women were her size\u2026 and had clearly destroyed King\u2019s Landing while fucking each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made Dany shift, rubbing her thighs together, and she didn\u2019t know why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnoyed by the strange feelings and thoughts that raced in her head (like wanting to strip\u2026 it suddenly felt wrong to be clothed when these two giantesses were naked) Dany marched towards them and cleared her throat, waiting for the two to awaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey did so almost lazily, yawning and rubbing her bodies against each others before finally realizing there was someone else standing before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid we\u2026 did we shrink back down?\u201d the red head asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d her lover stated, looking past Dany at the ruins of King\u2019s Landing. \u201cShe\u2019s just big like us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am not \u2018like you\u2019,\u201d Dany said with a huff. \u201cI am Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, First of Her Name, the Unburnt, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026hi,\u201d the brunette said with a slight chuckle. \u201cI am Margaery Tyrell and this is Sansa Stark.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDany nodded at that, finding it rather odd to be introducing herself to a pair of naked lesbians while towering over King\u2019s Landing but she decided to move past that. \u201cI have returned to the Seven Kingdoms to reclaim my throne. None shall stand in my way-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm, makes sense,\u201d Margaery stated, slowly standing up and stretching, giving Dany an eyeful of her lush and curvy body. \u201cSansa and I already declared ourselves queens of these lands yesterday but there is nothing to say you couldn\u2019t join us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJ-join you?\u201d Dany said, startled by these turn of events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think, Sansa?\u201d Margaery asked, helping her young lover up. The red head looked Dany over and licked her lips; her recent show of power with Margaery had unlocked something primal and her and she felt braver than she ever had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes\u2026 I\u2019ve always wanted to ride a dragon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-see here\u2026\u201d Dany stammered as the nude couple walked up to her, lightly brushing Dany\u2019s dragon\u2019s away before they began to run their hands along her body, tugging at her clothing. \u201cIf this is\u2026 some kind of trick\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo trick,\u201d Margaery whispered, nibbling on Dany\u2019s ear. \u201cLook at us. We are the largest, most powering beings in the world. Why shouldn\u2019t we do what we please? You want to rule\u2026 you will rule. Join us and we can rule together as goddesses of the Seven Kingdoms.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSansa nodded, boldly reaching around Dany and kneeding her breasts through her top, causing her to moan. \u201cYou just need to let go of your silly little insecurities. Starting with hiding your body.\u201d She tugged and Dany\u2019s top, trying to free her breasts. \u201cStrip down\u2026 remove your clothes. You\u2019ll never need them again. Join us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDestroy your clothing and join us as the third goddess of Westeros,\u201d Margaery said, rubbing her crotch against Dany\u2019s leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Fun. Sansa hadn't had anything resembling fun in the past two years, since the Lannisters took her prisoner. But now, she was gigantic. Holding out her hand, she realized that her fingertips spanned longer than the wings of the legendary Targareyn dragons of old. She was a mountain of power. The thought made her blood run hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand closed into a fist. Since her imprisonment, she could count on that same hand the number of people who had shown her kindness. The Hound. Littlefinger. The Queen of Thorns. Her forced husband, Tyrion the Imp. And her equally-titanic friend Margaery.  But the Hound had fled. Littlefinger had gone to claim Harren Hall. With Margaery a giant beside her, that left exactly two people in King's Landing whose lives she cared to spare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the rest? Even apart from the Lannisters and their forces, the common people of this city had earned her hatred. They cheered her father's execution. Arya had never been found, and had no doubt been murdered or worse by some random thug in the streets. Sansa herself would have been raped and mutilated by these savages if the Hound hadn't intervened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no mercy in Sansa's heart for anyone in this city. She was of the North. The North remembered. The North was cold. Vengeance was cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time in two years, her lips broke into a true smile. \"Margaery, my dearest friend,\" she whispered, sliding her hand in the small of the other giantess's back. \"This wretched place won't be able to survive the fun we're going to have.\"</span></div></div>",

But that was not the only strange thing about them. They were tall, thick and had no branches. Just stretched up high then bent over like they were combed down or something. Even the ground wasnt right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaery placed her hand down on it, noticing it was warm, smooth and the about the same color as her skin. Margaery is suddebly spooked by a loud voice coming out of nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Sansa darling. Where do you think you're going?</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat voice... Cersei? And Sansa?

Only walked off with her eyes looking down at the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sansa wait! How are you so big?! And where is Cers... oh gods.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaery slowly looked down the steep drop and noticed what looked like eyebrows, nose and an arm holding a glass of wine.

Anyone with a bit of common sense will have doubted the Starks's saying \"winter is coming\". Anyway, that meant her feet were going to sweat a lot if she stayed outside. \"A shame, little queen, because I'm going to be here for a lot of time\" She walked around the gardens till her feet felt wet and sore, then she sat on a near bench. She streched her legs to feel Cersei moving, but the queen didn't respond, a sudden fear appeared in her head, yes, she wanted to kill her, but she also wanted to enjoy her a bit more, maybe even take her as a pet, or slave. \"But maybe she isn't dead, she just escaped somehow\" Margaery thought, in an act of despair, and without thinking if someone might be looking, she got her shoe off to find...</span></div></div>",

However, she would have to get used to it with the majority of their surviving family being at one place, however she was finally happy that after so long she could call this place home again.  As she returned to her room, she noticed a strange vial on her table, catious due to her training and hard life, she sniffed if for any signs of poison.  Finding none, she drank the contents, which had a rather fruity taste to them, which was uncommon for drinks unless it was the wine of lords and ladies.  After a bit and fiddling with Needle, she felt off, as if Needle felt somehow bigger in her grasp, with the rest of her clothes feeling not as tight as before.  Sudenly, she felt like she was falling from a great height as Needle left her grasp.  As she hit the ground, she felt something descend upon her, thinking it was just the covers from her bed, she pushed through them only to realize otherwise.  When she popped out, she saw Needle on the ground before her, however the most daunting aspect was that it was huge, or she was just small.  As the though crossed her mind, she realized she was not wearing any clothing and that it was all around her in a pile.

Upon hearing nothing,  Sansa tried the handle and opened the door, peaking inside before opening it fully and stepping into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arya? Are you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSansa could have sworn she say Arya walk walk down the hall and enter her room a minute ago. But for all Sansa knew she could be using her strange new skills to pull a prank and scare her. Sansa hadnt gotten to know this new \"hardened assassin\" version of her little sister, but she never knew Arya as one to pass up an oppurtunity  to embarrass her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, Sansa would play along. She hadn't seen Arya for far to long since their days with their father in the south and she wanted nothing more than to value their time together. That is atleast... until she spotted Aryas discarded clothing on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps their together time could be saved for when one of them isnt buck ass nude. Sansa walked over to the clothes and picked them and her sisters sword up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All these years and your still a slob.\", Sansa chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Sansa know, that hidden in the pile of clothing she held in her hands was her little sister, trying to fight her way out from under her shirt so she could scream to her giant sister without it being muffled by the heavy fabric. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSansa began to walk towards the bed to lay the clothes out which caused a sleeve to slip out and finally give Arya space to move ontop of the pile and hopefully get Sansa to look down at her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArya looked up at her sister, her face staring straight ahead at her bed, completely oblivious to her plight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sansa!\", she screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSansa stopped in place and quickly scanned the room. That voice sounded like Arya but, like she was far away. No doubt trying to scare her like she had thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arya? If you approach me without clothes on I'll...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sansa shut up!

It all came back to her, her maid had mentioned a vial but did not know where it had come from.  When asked about it, Sansa thought it was from the Maester because she had asked him previously for milk of the poppy to help her with the stress of being the Lady of Winterfell.  She had mixed it with the water she was drinking at the time before coming to check on Arya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the face of realization on her gigantic sisters face,\" You did drink from a vial in your room didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before she could respond, her whole body started to feel odd and tingly.  The world started to grow around lady Stark as she started to get smaller.  Her formally well fitting and elegant traditional Stark clothing appearing more like thick blankets on her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArya, watching all this unfold yells to her sister, \"Quickly get on the bed!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSansa, actually listening to her for once climbs on just as her shoes slip off her feet.  Her height rapidly falling below two feet, her fear and slight arousement growing with her clothing, all the while Arya watching with fascination as her \"big\" sister slowly joined her.  In a matter of moments, Sansa's head fell into her dress and cloak, disappearing from Arya's view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sansa, are you there\", with an air of suspense added to the question by the following silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWishing to ensure that she was alright, Arya clambered out of her pile of clothing and made her way towards her sisters.  After some heaving and pushing of the heavy winter cloak, she finally found the once tall and mighty Lady of Winterfell curled up in a ball in the center of her clothing crying.  Seeing her sister in such a weakened state brought out sympathy Arya thought had vanished with all her training as a faceless Assassin.  She climbed over the dress and started to hug her now similar sized naked sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey you clumsy fool stop your river from flowing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSansa looking up,\"That's suppose to make me feel better?\" with doubt in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was worth a try\" with a smile spread across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSansa, remembering their name calling days of old can't help but to smile at the remembrance of the moment.  Getting the tears out of her eyes, she decides to stand with her sister, to see when they are next to one another that Sansa is still slightly taller than Arya, if only by less than an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding hands\" What do we do now?\" gets asked Sansa to her wolfblood sister.</span></div></div>",

He  had heard the Rains of Castemere, before everything went to this blur. He looked around and saw a good chunk of his family. His son Robb was directly in front of him, his wife Catelyn to his side, his daughters Sansa and Arya to his left. He looked behind to see his son, Rickon, in a similar daze to the rest of the family. As he watched Rickon, a darkness surrounded the confused boy, and a black thing came down on him, crushing him. In horror, Eddard looked up to find the boot of a giant man coming down on his sun. It was a large old man, whom he had seen some times around town, except he was carrying his son, Brandon, on his back, and running away. In the shock and terror, he lead his family with his hands, under a wooden porch. Eventually, Eddard heard more and more of his family in general panic, as Catelyn screamed for Rickon, Robb tried to calm his sisters, and Arya and Sansa seemed to be concerned of their height, or lack there of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNed heard a continuous thundering, as he looked to a pair of legs nearing the porch. \"Get down!\" He ordered his family, and they all laid down in the gigantic mud, as Ned, Robb and Arya raised their swords to whatever was nearing them.

Ned turned back to find the back of a now angry Cersei's hand, as it crashed into him, shooting him into a porch's post, breaking his back. Cersei got down on her knees to look straight in, where in the heat of the moment, she applied her fist onto Ned, crushing him slowly and painfully, until Arya could take no more, and ran toward Cersei, Needle in hand. Robb, protective of his family, ran after his sister, demanding she halt. Arya rushed into Cersei's exposed breasts and cut them, to the shock of the Lannister. She took her hand off of Ned, leaving a bloody stain, and grabbed Arya with that hand, before soon grabbing Robb with the other. <br>\r\nShe stood up and dumped Arya onto Robb, and using her spare hand, disarmed them of their swords. It was then she spoke. \"Well, haven't you two done quite the damage,\" she said, now wiping her bloody hand onto Arya and Robb, prompting struggle from the Stark siblings. <br>\r\n\"You may come with me.\" She dumped the duo into her cleavage and walked away, back to House Lannister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArya and Robb awoke on a table, both dazed and confused. They looked into the distance to see a nude Cersei forming in their vision. In her giant form, she wandered over and looked to Arya. She smiled before turning and grabbing the girl's small form and rubbing her inside of her exposed buttcrack. Robb screamed in terror. She then ejected Arya from her behind, and placed her on the table. \"That was for my hand.\"<br>\r\nShe grabbed a stool and sat in front of the frenzied Robb, and the dirty grimy and mortified Arya. <br>\r\n\"Who wants to get tortured first?\"</span></div></div>",

He turned around and stared up at the giant Lannister with his little sister in her grasp. He wanted to continue defying Cersei, but seeing his baby sister so defensless filled him with fear. Robb knew he couldnt beat Cersei while she could see him, so he needed to fight her another way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please... please dont hurt her.\" Robb fell to his knees and began begging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCerseis grin spread even wider upon seeing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Stark begging? Its a shame your father isnt here to see this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCersei lowered her hand and tossed Arya back onto the table. Arya bounced off her arm and slid aways before stopping. Aside from a dark bruise, she was alright. Robb was only able to hold her for a second before his leg was pinned under Cerseis knuckle, and dragged across the table towards her. Arya started running to Robb but he motioned for her to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCersei flipped Robb on his back, then tore his pants off him. She then hovered her finger nail over one of his little legs, before viciously digging it in and scraping the skin off. Robb screamed in intense agony as Cersei dragged her nail down his leg, removing flesh like one would remove a scab. Arya could nothing but call out Robbs name and ball her eyes out, because Cersei had grabbed her with her other hand and forced her to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Cersei was done, the skin on the front of Robbs leg was almost completely gone. Replaced with deep red muscle and blood leaking everywhere. Cersei set Arya on top of a large book while Cersei got up to fetch a cloth and alcohol. She arrived then began treating Robbs leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldnt want it over that quickly now would we?\", Cersei said to Arya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dabbed a cloth into the alcohol, then applied it to Robbs leg. Robb sprung up and howled in pain. Cersei then rubbed the leg clean of all the blood then ripped off a tiny piece from the cloth and tied it tight over Robbs leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. That should do. I have to go now little wolves. I trust you wont try to run while im away?.....Hm. Lets not take chances.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCersei scoops Robb into her hand and grabs Arya in her fist. She then walks over to her night stand and sets the Stark siblings on it. She opens a drawer, pulls out a piece of string and ties the two of them together.

They reached Cerseis throat and stopped, thankful for the little light from the moon in the night that entered her mouth above them. Arya and Robb looked up behind them to catch a final glimpse of the world outside Cerseis body by looking through the open space between her parted lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they held eachothers hand tighter and exchanged a loving look to eachother. Then they timed their leap together and leaped off the tongue and began their descent down Cersei's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued to slide along the wet passage which was the esophagus. Robb thought they would never stop sliding until they suddenly dropped through open space and landed with a splash in some foul swampy substance. They had arrived in Cersie's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoone could barely see a thing and there was a lot of noise coming from the liquids the siblings now found themselves hip deep in. Well... hip deep to Robb, Arya was engulfed in the sloppy liquid up to her chest. It smelt pretty bad down here, but Arya knew she was here for a reason. She plunged her hand down into the sludge reaching for her belt and felt around for her sword, needle.</span></div></div>",

She could jolt awake any time now. You need to hide Arya. Quick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArya looks at her brother with tears in her eyes. She didn't want to leave when she was so close to saving him, but Cersei could wake at any moment, and the first thing she will do is check on her tiny captive on her necklace,then they would both be caught. Arya knew she had to go, so she quickly slips her knife into Robbs sleeve and turns to find a place to hide. Arya leaps off of the lion pendant onto Cersei's chest, landing on the upper portion of Cersei's left breast. Arya sinks into the flesh of the queen's tit before it forces her back, launching her a few steps up towards Cersei's head. Arya lands on her feet then takes off running towards Cersei's neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the gods I should have brought my knife.\" Arya thought to herself. She pictured herself opening Cersei's throat before, but now she pictured herself forcing her way inside the cut until she arrived into her esophagus, where she would hack and slash it to shreds, and be able to hear very clearly as Cersei choked on her own blood... and the tiny wolf girl in her neck. But she would have to find another opportunity some other time. Right now, Arya was on her way to the side of Cersei's neck, where she planned to grab onto the curb of her necklace and hang on while Cersei moved about. She could then shuffle to the back of Cersei's neck where she wouldn't be spotted by anyone else or by Cersei looking in a mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArya continues to run up the chest of the giant queen until she reaches her destination. Arya sat on her butt and slide down the incline of the top of the shoulder towards the curb that rested on the side of Cersei's neck. Arya grabs onto it then lays her body ontop to avoid touching Cersei's skin. She made it just in time as she heard Cersei moan then begin to rise up in her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArya held on tight as the necklace began to slide down along Cersei's skin. The Queen stretched her neck to the right, then to the left, leaving Arya to watch as a wall of tanned flesh loomed abover her and getting closer and closer, threatening to squish her against the shoulder. Arya was engulfed in between Cersei's neck and shoulder for a brief moment, completely shrouded in darkness and the warmth of Cersei's skin. Arya feared for her life but dared not move and let Cersei know where she was, so she toughened up and kept still until finally Cersei straightened her neck, unknowingly allowing Arya to breath and see again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... Good morning little pup. Have you reevaluated your behavior towards me like I asked?\", Cersei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cupped the lion pendant in her hand and raised it up and out in front of her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will kill you myself you cunt! I`ll throw myself into that gaping mouth of yours and choke you to death if thats what it takes!\", Robb yelled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently not. Perhaps some time apart will do you good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCersei plucks Robb from the pendant with his hands still bound, and raises him up to the canopy above her bed. She threads the string through the fabric of the canopy and ties it off, leaving Robb to hang there by his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then gets out of bed and dresses herself in an elegant blue dress with gold adornments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CDALgAtXIAED6a0.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CDALgAtXIAED...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCersei then leaves the room, still unaware of the tiny stowaway who was stealing a ride on her necklace.

The giant woman lowered herself to get a better look at the Starks, she counted five in total, an older man and woman, a fairly aged boy and two little girls, she reached down with her hand and heard a slight shriek before it was muffled by her grasp, she quickly stuffed the family in to her pouch and sealed it up, heading for dorne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe starks had gone over 24 hours without seeing even a glimpse of light, then all of a sudden their vision was restored when they were sent tumbling out of their fur prison and on to a soft, fluffy terrain.

She stared at the little lord pondering what to do with him before reaching a conclusion, \"I think I'll start simple..\" she smirked, her fingers wrapped around him and encapsulated him entirely, and she began to apply pressure, delighting in the resulting squirms inside her fist. Nymeria let out a little chuckle as the protests down from her bed grew louder as the Starks realised her plan for Ned, with one final squeeze Ned's body was obliterated into nothing but a bloody stain on her skin, she was now laughing ecstatically as his wife and children began to cry.

Oh, no matter.\" She said as she put some vigor into her smothering, and began bouncing a bit. You were very much enjoying your current position, and were a bit disappointed when it ended when Sansa leaned forward and pulled you out from under her and brought you up close to her beautiful, smiling face. \"It's so nice to have a friend to play with, it does get awfully dull being cooped up in the castle most of the time. But since I won the best two out of three, I have to wonder what I should get...\" Sansa said, pondering the Idea, as you stared into her massive deep blue eyes. <br>\r\n     \"I could get to use you as a cushion for a while...\" Sansa pondered. \"I'm sure that you wouldn't mind that...\" She teased. \"Or I could put you back between my breasts... both are awfully tempting... I think I'll let you choose which prize that I should get. So what'll it be my little friend?\"</span></div></div>",

It's okay, I'll be gentle.\" Sansa said in a sweet voice trying to guilt you into agreeing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that I'll be your cushion... But it seems more likely to me that this is a reward for you.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSansa smiled and said \"I guess that I'll let you pick your reward next time... but you already seemed to have agreed to this. And I don't suppose that it'll be that bad for you. I think you might quite enjoy yourself.\" Sansa sat up, reached forward and grabbed you. \"I have to write a letter, so I don't think that there is a better time to... sit down and write it.\" Sansa said, giggling at the last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSansa stood up off of her bed and walked over to her desk. She pulled back her chair and gently set you down in the center. \"Now just relax and enjoy yourself, my little friend.\" Sansa said, as she moved and stood over the chair. An idea popped into her head, she giggled, and then hiked up her skirt above her waist exposing her panties, and began to lower her panty-clad ass on top of you. You were surprised by this, and laid down flat on the chair face up rather than be pushed down and be stuck in a potentially uncomfortable position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSansa sat down square on top of you, pulled the chair into the desk, and adjusted her butt on top of you to get comfortable. You found yourself yet again pinned beneath Sansa's enormous sexy ass. Sansa grabbed her quill and began scribbling out her letter. She occasionally wiggled her hips around, adjusted all of her weight to the center of her backside, or even used her armrest for support and gently bounced her ass on top of you for a bit. Sansa had never taken so long to write one letter, but it didn't particularly bother her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Sansa was finished she pushed her chair back and stood up. She looked back to the seat of the chair and was shocked that you weren't there. She quickly realized what had happened and her face flushed with color. Sansa squeezed her massive butt cheeks together and felt you firmly wedged between them. \"Can't let this opportunity go unused\" Sansa said to herself. She walked over to her bed, and adjusted her skirt to sit on the bed like how she sat on her desk chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe that you were stuck between Sansa's ass cheeks, not that you could complain though, considering how comfortable that it was. you felt the pressure around you recede as she went to sit back down on her bed. When her ass was a few inched above the bed her cheeks were spread and you fell to the bed only to be enveloped be her ass again a moment later. Once she had sat down Sansa began to wiggled her butt left and right smothering you with her pale, soft ass flesh. She then began to move her hips around in random directions all over you. Sansa's soft ass was rubbing all over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know how long this was going on, but it didn't matter because you were in heaven the whole time. You never wanted it to end, but it inevitably had. Sansa stood up off of the edge of her bed and pulled her dress back down to cover her... assets. You sat up, a bit dazed from all of the smothering. Sansa knelt down next to her bed and giggled when she saw your current state. \"I thought that you said I would enjoy this more than you would, not that I didn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess I was wrong.\" You said, admiring Sansa's beautiful blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSansa smiled and replied...</span></div></div>",

But for now I need my beauty rest!\" Sansa yawned loudly and headed over to the small bed mended for her and before you could objective any further or hope to move,she lied down,gave you a sort of kissy face and was soon snoring away logs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

Another beautiful day for a siege it seems.\", says Dario. \"I see we finally have our secret weapon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice the man is looking at you when he said that. You? A weapon?

Plus, it\u2019s either that or stand out in the open and just let her find you. And you did sort of want to win this. So you went to the sandals and climb on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sandals themselves where damp and well worn to the point that her foot had left an indent in them. Thankfully, the smell was faint, so you don\u2019t have to worry about the it forcing you away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere are you hiding, my little friend? She said giggling. She looks at her bed and smile. Are you under\u2026.Here? She said, looking under the bed. She feels around under for you but doesn\u2019t feel you. Hmm. Maybe\u2026. He\u2019s on the bed. She said. She reaches for the pillow and pulls it back, but you weren\u2019t there. She then pulls back the covers and you weren\u2019t there either. Looks like he\u2019s not here. She said. She was having fun though. She didn\u2019t want it to be over too quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome out, come out wherever you are. If you do, I\u2019ll give you a nice, long embrace between my breast. She said. Hoping those words would lure you out. You look at her chest and they were impressive and the thought of being smothered by them does sound enticing, but you were out to win this as much as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waits a for a minute but you don\u2019t come out. Thought I had him. Where could he be? She said. It\u2019s not like you had that many places to be. She had already checked the bed, so that only left the nightstand. She walks over to the nightstand and looks inside just in case you manage to get inside. Not finding you inside, she got on her knees and looked under it. Seeing her butt high up in the air was a sight. Wow\u2026.. Was all you could say as you watched it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo\u2026. He\u2019s not here either. She said. She stands back up with a puzzling look. Where are you, little one? She said. Not under the bed or the nightstand. She thought you might have literally up and disappeared. Could he be hiding on me? No. I would have felt him if he was. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys\u2019 eyes land on her sandals. No\u2026. There\u2019s no way he would hide there. She said. Why would he?

She just had to show enough skin for him to come running into her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAww. My dress is all dirty from being on the floor. I should take it off before it gets any dirtier. She said. Daenerys starts to take off her dress slowly just in case you were watching her until she was in her undergarments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had gotten quiet all of a sudden. You didn't hear Daenerys walking or searching. Did she give up? She would have told you to come on out if she did. Did she already know where you were and was just waiting for you to step out and grab you? It put you on edge a little. So you peek out and your eyes go wide. Daenerys, in all her beauty, was standing there in her undergarments with a smile. Oh my..... Was all you could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes were glued to her as she re looked under the bed; giving you a better view of her butt than last time. She then laid down on her stomach and mashed her breast together. Come on out, little one. I saw you looking at them earlier. Don't you want to be right here with them? She said. She sticks her finger between them to show how deep her cleavage is. The only bad thing was that you weren't hiding there to see all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you didn't come out, she got up and walked over to the nightstand. Watching her chest bounce as she strides along gave you a bulge. She did the same thing at the nightstand, but you still didn't come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOhhh..... Where did my little friend go? I hope he didn't run off. Who am i going to hug lovingly? She said, holding her arms against her chest. Or kiss passionately? She said, puckering her lips. She knows you're watching her and is now just waiting for you to come running right to her. She could already see it happening right now. The image of you running to her made her smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a struggle for you. The more you looked, the more wanted to just run out and throw yourself at her. It wasn't easy to look away either. The second you did, you turned your head right back to her. Half of you is telling to go out and just give yourself up. While the other half is telling you not to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

Where are you, little one? Don't you want to be in my embrace, and smothered by my lips? She said. You were shouting yes on the inside, and the mental image of it played through your head multiple times. And it was all the convincing you needed to come out of hiding and running for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys waited and still didn't see you. Where are you, little one? You don't want to leave me all alone, do you? She said. She knows that you had to be watching her and since you hadn't come out yet, she had decided either you were strong willed or struggling. So she was going to take it one more step further. She wasn't going to fully undress herself. No, she wanted to save that for when the time was right. She had to show just enough to get your attention, but leave you wanting more. It would be a whole lot easier for her if she knew what you liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Daenerys put her hands on her corset to undo it, she saw something moving near her foot. She looks down to see it's you. There you are! She said. She bends over and picks you. Finally got you to come out. Where were you hiding this entire time? She said. You point over to her sandals. My sandals? She said. Yes.... The bed was obvious and the nightstand was a deathtrap waiting to happen. So that only left one option. You said. I'm a little surprised you managed to stay close to them. Didn't they smell? Or is that what you fancy? She said with a sly smile. N...no. You said. No to they don't smell? Or no to that's what you like? She said. The first one... You said. Ohhh. So you like my feet, huh? She said. N...no. You said. So they're ugly and they do smell? She said. I-i never said that. I mean, they don't smell and they are far from ugly, but i don't like them as you're implying. You said. Really? Then why did it take so long for you to come out of hiding? Could it be that you were having some fun with my sandals? She said. N-No! I.... just didn't want to sound rude and..... I'm lost on words. What is it you want me to say so i don't make you mad? You said. Seeing you all nervous and flustered made her laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalm down, little one. I'm just teasing you. She said. You are? You said. Of course. Just having a little fun with you. She said. You sigh in relief. Besides, we can discuss that at a later time. Right now.... She said. Daenerys brought you closer to her and placed you against her chest in a gentle embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did say i was going to do this. She said. A part of you didn't believe her when she did say that, but she proved you wrong, and happy about it. She kept you there for 2 minutes before letting go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid you like that? Being nuzzled against my chest? She said. You nod. Well, if you liked that, then you'll love this. She said. She brings you up to her face and moves you to her lips and assaults you with multiple kisses. *Smooch* *Smooch* Hehehe! She said. One kiss after another from her soft lips.... If she told you this before the game started, you'd give up right as it started. She finishes the barrage with a long, passionate kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo.... Was it everything you thought it was? She said. You were trying to find your voice after all those kisses. I'll take your silence as a yes. She said. She sits down on the bed with you in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo little one. You have a name? Or will little friend and little one work for you? She said. M...my name is.... Uh..... You said, finding your voice. *Laugh* Did you forget it after all this time? She said. N.....no. It's (Your name). You said. Well, (Your name) I wanted you opinion on what we should do next? She said. You do? You said. Why not? You opinion is just as valid. She said, rubbing your head. What did you have in mind? You said. Well, we could play more games. Or we could take a stroll through the port. She said. Like....a date? You said. Indeed. It may not be an ideal place, but it would give us the time to talk and get to know each other better. So, which one do you want to do? She said.</span></div></div>",

She said, smiling. Huh? I wasn't staring. You said quickly. No need to be like that, little one. I don't mind if your eyes look. Just don't stare too long. I don't want them to fall out from looking so hard. She said. Daenerys puts you on her shoulder. There. Now hold on. She said. You manage to keep yourself balanced as she takes a few steps an out the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking through the port, Daenerys kept a close eye on you; As she wanted to be ready on the chance you slid and fell down. So (Your name) Where are you from? Are the people their just as small as you? She said. You're not going to enslave everyone there, are you? You joke. Maybe..... I'd be a benevolent ruler. And you'd get to rule with me. She said. Yeah. And i'll be lynched the second you make that statement. You said. So you are from a village of tiny people? She said with a little enthusiasm. No. Sorry to burst your kingdom of tiny people's idea. You said. Aww.... Then where are you from? She said. Ah, ladies first. You said smiling. Ohh. At least you have some manners. She said with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI already told you my name, but let's start there. I'm Daenerys Stormborn Targaryen. Mother of Dragons. She said. Mother of dragons!? You said shocked. Indeed. I have many other titles, but it would take too long to say them all. And i wouldn't want to waste your time either. She said. Mother of dragons? I have so many question already. And that's just the first title you told me. You said. Then ask away. I'll set your mind at ease. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you said Mother of dragoons, you have a chamber filled with them? You said. No. But i can see why you'd think that. I have three of them, and they are very well trained. I'll have to show you to them. She said. Uhh..... You said as your face pales a little. Don't worry,(Your name). They only attack on my command or if i'm threatened. And they won't eat you. I'll make sure of it. She said, giving you a smile. You calm down a little, but it's still a lot to take in, and it's only the first thing she's told you about her. What else would you like to know? She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you of a noble bloodline? You look like royalty. You said. I am. Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen. She said. Oh. Now i'm going to have to say Lady or Madam before your name. Do you prefer a bow or knee from this peasant? You said, getting a laugh out of her. I prefer neither for you. And as for my name..... Just Daenerys or Dany. She said. Informal with noble. I must be doing something right. You said. Keep doing what you're doing and i'd be hard press to turn down any favors. She said. I'll keep that in mind. You said. A noble with pet dragons. And not even the surface has been fully scratched yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou asked Daenerys a few more questions and she tells you about her. How she hates slavers, has an army, immune to fire, which really caught your attention, how she had to endure hardship to get to where she is right now, and other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome on, this isn't a fair choice. She said. It is. You have to give one up. Your army or dragons. You said. I love my dragons.... Raised them since they were small. But my army is full experienced people and people i know well. She said. So? You said. ......My army. I'm just too attached to my dragons to part with them. She said. Well, seeing three flying fire breathers coming your way is terrifying and harder to deal with. You said. My turn. If we meet on the battlefield and i offered you a chance to surrender, would you take it? She said. Hmm. What happens if i surrender? You said. You have to become my servant and wait on me hand and foot. She said. And i guess if i don't, i'll be executed? You said. Well.... Since you're cute and all, I'll take you prisoner and make you bend that knee of yours. She said. So surrender and become a servant? Or be tortured into becoming it? Hard choice. You said. You'd get the same treatment you got last time. She said. I surrender to you, Mother of dragons. You said. As it should be. She said with a laugh. She then comes to a stop at a bench, sits down and puts you in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it's your turn.I want to know everything about you. She said. I doubt it would be interesting as you. Can't top have three dragons as pets. You said. Which makes it interesting. What's it like where you're from? She said. Would you believe me if i told you about where i'm from and about myself? You said. Yes. You're living proof on it. She said with excitement. Alright..... What would you like to know first? You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne after another, you answer her questions and by the end of it, she left astounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow..... Your world sounds amazing! She said. Well, it doesn't have the flying dragons aspect, but it's pretty good. You said. Would you take me there if there's a way back? She said. If there is a way, I'll take you with me. Just....leave your dragons here. It would be mass panic. You said. Thank you! She said, hugging you. She holds you there for a minute and lets go. Until that time, I'll take you back to my house. She said. Is that an invitation? But i'm not wearing my Sunday best. You said. I insist. You wouldn't turn me down, would you? She said. It would be rude of me to. I accept. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gets up and gets on a horse. It shouldn't be that far of a ride. You won't mind riding on my shoulder again, would you. She said. No. I'll be fine. You said. She puts you there and this time, you grab onto her dress to secure yourself. Daenerys gives the horse a gentle nudge it to start moving. The horse neighs and starts to trout along with you both.</span></div></div>",

As she got closer, you hear a loud roaring. Wha- What was that?! You said shocked. You see Daenerys smile as she looks up in the sky. You look up and see three flying animals in the air. They come down towards the ground and land right in front of the horse. Scaring it and chucking you back. Whoa!! You said as you free fall to the ground and land on something soft. Gotcha!

She said. Dany shows you to Viserion and he smells you and blows steam on you; making Dany chuckle a little. She walks up to one with emerald scales. This is Rhaegal. She said. When she shows you to him, he growls lowly at you. G\u2026.good dragon\u2026. You said reaching out to touch his nose. The skin was rough and it seems to put him at ease. Aw.

She said. She shows you to him and like Rhaegal, he growls at you and shows a little disdain. Unlike with Rhaegal, you don\u2019t dare try to touch him. See? I told you they were well trained. She said. I\u2026.don\u2019t think they like me. I\u2019m surprised they can even see me. You said. They have good eyesight. Don\u2019t fret. They won\u2019t do anything unless I\u2019m threatened. And i certainly won't let them harm you. She said. She speaks to her dragons in some weird language and they fly off. Except Drogon, who watched as Dany went into the building before flying away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is where your home away from home!? You said. I take it you\u2019re impressed? She said. Yeah. You put the one percent to shame. You said. Just from walking in, you marvel at the artistic marble and concrete. Well, there\u2019s a lot more to see. She said. Dany took you to what you assume was a throne room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is where you sit and rule from? You said. In a way of speaking, yes. It\u2019s not the seat that I desire, but it\u2019ll do until then. She said. She heads to a dining room. I guess this is where you have your servants make your meals at. You said. It\u2019s comes with the territory. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll make sure your taste are met. She said. Dany then arrived at a big room. Here we are. She said. Whoa\u2026.. This is your room? You said. You look around. A comfy looking bed, a writing table, everything she needs. You didn\u2019t notice her smiling until she took you off her shoulder. We\u2019re going to spend a lot of time here. Just you\u2026.and me. She said as she envelops you in another hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, things aren\u2019t going as bad as you though they would. You wonder if you lucked out with Daenerys as she genially cares and affectionate to you. You don\u2019t know if that\u2019s how she normally is or a custom of hers, but you don\u2019t care. You don\u2019t think anyone else would be as nice as her to you. Besides the three dragons bit, you see nothing wrong with being with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys finally let go of you and stated to rub your back gently. Now, is there anything you want to do? She said. You\u2019re\u2026..asking me? You said. Hehe. Why wouldn\u2019t I? You have a voice, don\u2019t you? I don\u2019t only want to do what I want. She said, smiling. So when you say anything, you mean anything? You said. That\u2019s the meaning of anything, isn\u2019t it? She said with a giggle. Yep. Dany was the best person to find you. It can be anything that you can think of. She said. Anything? You said. Anything that you can think of. Another game, me and you just talking, Anything you want. She said. \u2026..What if I wanted to play with your body? You said. That\u2019s when her smile got big. Then we can do that too. She said. Hands down, the best girl to find you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo? What do you want to do? She said. Secretly, Daenerys' was hoping you chose to play with her body. Not only would it be enjoyment for her, it'd be for the both of you. In the end, you chose.....</span></div></div>",

She sets you down on the bed. Let me just get comfortable first. She said. She starts taking off her dress. Once she was down into her undergarments, she climbed over you. You stare in amazement as her massive body moved over you. Her breast, slim stomach, her butt, was all there for you to see even if still covered. She turns over and grabs you and brings you to her. Since you saw everything just now, where would you like to go first? She said. You didn\u2019t even think about it as you pointed to her breast. Here? I thought for sure you\u2019d want some time with my feet; Since I caught you their last time. She said smiling. Th-that was only for game purpose. Not because I like your feet. You said. So you think my feet are hideous? She said. I never said that. They are cute, but\u2026. You said. But\u2026..? Do you like them or repulsed by them? She said bringing you closer. You don't know what to say as your face turns red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing you flustered made her laugh a bit. She then drops you down in her between her breast. As you look up at her, she pushes her breast together lightly. Is this to your liking? Daenerys said. Y\u2026.yeah. You said. If it\u2019s not, just say so. I\u2019m sure my feet would love the company. She said, giggling. The redness comes back as you wanted to do nothing but sink lower down and disappear. You shouldn\u2019t have hidden near her sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Daenerys, she was enjoying this as much as you are. Especially when it comes to her teasing you. The reaction she gets from you is priceless. And as much as you try to make sense or explain it to her, Dany wouldn\u2019t have a problem with you liking her feet like that. It\u2019s not the strangest thing she\u2019s seen a man interested in. Plus Dany wants you to be interested in her. You\u2019re cute and easy to be around. She doesn\u2019t want to outright ask you to be hers. It might scare you off. She wants to take it slow and have you be more comfortable with her. And this was the perfect first step towards that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the mashing stopped and she pulled you out. Hope you had fun, little guy. Now it\u2019s my turn. She said. Now, you were expecting her to drop you at her feet and continue to tease you about it, but she didn\u2019t. Instead, she brought you to her lips and started kissing you. You were stunned by this, but couldn\u2019t say anything as she kept assaulting you with kisses. As she kept this up, the kisses started to become less playful and more of ones you\u2019d get a loved one. For one of them, she held you against her lips for 30 seconds and used her tongue. When she was done, she pulls you away and gives you a big smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, by the look on your face, I\u2019d say you enjoyed that as much as I did. She said. You nod your head as your voice seems to be lost. Well, it's your turn again.  Where do you want to go next? She said.</span></div></div>",

She turns on her stomach and rubs your head. Try not to have too much fun back there. I wouldn\u2019t want you to fall in. She said. With that said, she reaches back and puts you right next to her cheeks. You stare at the subtle flesh mounds that you were ogling a few minutes ago. Are you just going to stare all day? Dany said. You quickly snap out of it and start climbing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys couldn\u2019t help but laugh as she felt you climbing up her butt. She decided to make it a bit harder by moving her hips around. Seeing you lose your grip and slide down to her leg made her laugh a bit louder. You look at her a bit annoyed as you start you climb again. Dany does the same thing again, but this time, you grip onto her. When she\u2019s done, you continue your ascent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short climb, you reach the top of her left cheek. Her panties were snugged good into her cheeks. Let\u2019s see how she likes being surprised. You said. You give it a quick kiss; which got a shocked gasp from her. Heh\u2026.. You said lowly. You do it this a few more times before you jump in between her cheeks. Daenerys held back a laugh as he felt you wiggling back there. I should have known you'd do this. She said, smiling wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, it was giggling at the sight of her little friend kissing and moving in her butt, but it was doing something inside her. The mere sight of you kissing her butt and feeling you there lit a fire in her loins. She bit her lip and closed her eyes as she suppressed her moaning. Her body was telling her to forget her plan and just have her way with you right now. And she so wanted to, but she didn\u2019t want it to do it. Not just yet. She wanted it to be on her terms. So she fishes you out and brings you to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re full of surprises, aren\u2019t you? She said. I could say the same to you. Making me slide down to your leg. You said. Didn\u2019t want it to be too easy for you. And since you gave me a nice surprise in return, I have to give you one. She said. And what kind of surprise would that be? You said. It wouldn\u2019t be one if I told you. She said, pressing you against her cheek. You do your best to return the hug with your arms stretched out as far as they would go. Now what should I for my turn? She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the was a knock on her door. Lady Daenerys? Are you in there? A voice said. Acting quickly, she stuffs you down into her cleavage. Stay down. She whispers to you. She heads to the door and opens it; seeing it\u2019s one of her young servants. What is it, Anna? She said. Your advisers are here to speak with you. Anna said. Now? Dany said a little annoyed. Yes, my lady. They said it\u2019s imperative they speak with you. She said. Very well. I\u2019ll be there shorty. Daenerys said, closing the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulls you out. Sorry about that. I\u2019m sure you overheard. She said. A meeting with your advisers? You said. Yes. And now of all times. She said. Putting you down, she dresses in her blue dress and puts on her brown boots. I doubt you\u2019d want to go with me and be bored out of your mind as I discuss with them. She said. Maybe. I\u2019d get to see my lady beauty and brains in action. You said. I told you that\u2019s not necessary of you to call me. She said, lightly blushing. She kisses you on the head. I\u2019ll be back as quick as I can. She said before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Dany gone, all you could do was wait for her to come back. She\u2019s been nothing but nice and treating you well. The only thing you see wrong was the 3 dragons; which still shocks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a long wait. Longer than you expected. The sun was starting to go down and it would be night soon. You were actually starting to worry about her. You snapped to when you saw the door open and in came\u2026..</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Coming through the door, you saw Dany carrying a tray. She comes to the bed and puts it down next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd here I was staring to think you forgot about me. You said. I could never forget you. It\u2019s why I brought us food. She said. You saw it was meat and some fruit that has been cut up. So would you like to eat normally? Or be fed? She said. Be fed? You\u2019re going to feed me? You said. You\u2019re my special guest. It\u2019d be rude of me not to. She said. You do this for any other guest? You said. None of them are cute like you. She said. Daenerys sit on the bed and holds her hand open for you. You hop on and she moves you to her lap where she proceeds to feed you the chopped meat and fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNighttime came along. You were asleep in Dany\u2019s hand and she was gentle rubbing your sleeping body. Normally, this would have brought a smile to her, but instead, she had a look of worry. It all came when she went to her advisers. They told her that her army was on the move to King\u2019s landing. Her bid to reclaim her throne was in motion. When she heard that, she should have been elated. Except she purposely left out that her army was in motion when she told you about herself. She didn\u2019t want to come off as a warmonger and scare you off. So she hid it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow with her army about to make landfall, she\u2019d have to be there to stand against her enemies and retake her throne. She just hopes you will let her explain herself first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned as you woke up. You look around and see you\u2019re not on Dany\u2019s lap or pillow. You\u2019re on a bed and tucked under a cover, but it\u2019s not in Dany\u2019s room. Instead, it\u2019s in what look like a big tent. You rub your eyes to make sure you weren\u2019t dreaming. You weren\u2019t. Did someone steal you away in the middle of night? Impossible. No one except Daenerys knew about you. You got up, climbed down and head for the exit when the owner walked in. You had little time to jump out the way of the incoming boot. When you looked up at the person, you could tell it was Dany from the dress wear. Dany! You called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDany came back into her tent and looked at the cover, but you weren\u2019t there. (Your name)? Where is he!? She said. Dany then stood up and made no sudden moves as to not accidentally step on you. Before she could call you out, she heard her name being called. She quickly turned around and saw you. She scoops you up and hugs you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon\u2019t scare me like that! I was starting to think something happened. She said. Dany\u2026.. Too\u2026\u2026tight\u2026.. You said. Oh! She said. She loosens her hold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take it you had something to do with this? A surprise trip to\u2026.wherever here is. You said. We\u2019re on a beach. She said. A trip to the beach? You got a surprise for me or something? You said. That\u2019s when Dany\u2019s smile disappeared. Well\u2026.. It is a surprise. Just\u2026..not for you. She said. What do you mean? You said. That\u2019s when she looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026..I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to keep this from you for long. She said. Keep what? You said. She takes a breath and turns back to you. Hear me out first. Please. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemember when I told you I had an army? She said. Yeah? You said. I\u2026.didn\u2019t tell you that they were mobilized. She said. What? Are you under attack? You said. No. I\u2019m\u2026.invading. She said. Invading?! You said. Wait! Let me explain myself. Long before I met you, my throne was unjustly taken from me. I\u2019ve been biding my time for when I return ever since then. She said. W\u2026.why didn\u2019t you tell me that in the first place? You said. I didn\u2019t want to scare you into thinking you were in the hands of a warmonger. If I told you my army was conquering in my name, would you have stayed? She said. Well\u2026. I mean\u2026. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re a tyrant or anything. You haven\u2019t done or said anything bad to me. You said. That\u2019s because you haven\u2019t seen me when it comes to the throne. If you saw me when I was with my advisers or to my enemies, you\u2019d think I was a different person. And you\u2019re the last person I want to be fearful of me. She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026\u2026Did you ever plan on telling me? You said. I did. It just happened sooner than I expected. She said. You\u2019re a bit upset. While she didn\u2019t lie to you, she didn\u2019t fully tell you she was planning on invading a city. Help me understand this throne. Is it as important as you make it to be? You said. You said. Very. Whoever sits in it, basically rules over all the lands. I\u2019m hoping this will go the way I plan for it. A small show of my army would get notice. She said. The way she talks about this throne, she\u2019s been after it a long time and she really wants it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you mad at me? She said. Looking at her worried face, you sigh. No. I\u2019m just\u2026..wrapping my head around this. It seems dangerous to me. Like you\u2019re asking to go to war. You said. I know. I\u2019m willing to accept the consequences of this. She said. You were about to speak when she quickly cut you off. I know you might see it as dangerous, but I\u2019ve longed for the day when I returned to reclaim what's mine. And I want you with me when I do. She said. You don't know if she's determined or obsessed about this throne. She then brought her finger down and rubbed your back. What can I do to ease your mind about this? She said. I want to say forget about it and let\u2019s go home, but I already know the answer to that. You said, sighing afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have one condition. You said. What is it? She said. No future plans of conquests. Just reclaim the throne and that\u2019s it. You said. Even though you didn't say it, she could tell that you were worried about her. And she didn't want to have to choose between you or her throne. She wanted both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf that's what it takes, I can agree to that. She said. Then I'm with you. You said. Dany's smile returned as she had nothing to worry. So what's the plan? You said. I\u2019ve sent scouts on ahead to see what we\u2019re up against while my army prepares themselves. She said. So\u2026.a dawn raid? You said. Precisely. We attack at first light. She said. That\u2019s still a few hours away. You said. Which gives us plenty of time for ourselves. How about we pick up where we left off? She said. I can\u2019t argue with a soon to be queen. You said. Dany puts you on the bed an starts to take off her clothes. </span></div></div>",

She was also removing her corset as well and let it fall to the ground; letting you finally see her ample breast. You're left speechless as you look at her, which made her laugh. Then she kicked off her boots and, in a slow and enticing manner, she took off her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there she was. In all her naked glory, smiling at you. D...d....Dany? You said, finding your voice. Oh. And here i thought something took your voice away. She said. You watch in awe as Dany climbs onto the bed and place her arms on the side. With a giggle, she lowers her head down to you and mashes you into the bed as she makes out with you. Her tongue went all around you as you were squirming against it. She then stops and moves back a few inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI bet you're wondering about this sudden change. She said. You nod your head. Well, i won't be able to spend as much time with you. I originally planned to do this after i had my throne. That way, I'm officially your queen. She said. B...but aren't you already a queen? You said. Yes, but that way, everyone would know. And you *kiss* will be my little king. She said. K-k-k-king?! Me!? You said, stunned. Of course. You think i'd forget about you once my throne is back in my hand? She said before kissing you. A king and queen celebrating their victory. She said.  B...but i don't know any- Daenerys quickly silence you with her finger.  Shhh We can talk about your kingship later. But for now..... She said, moving onto her knees. Let's indulge in each others desires. She said with lust in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe this. Not only are you about to have sex, Dany was going to make you a king. You don't know if that's a good or bad thing with your size problem. But you quickly push that aside as she grabbed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's very rude to keep a lady waiting. So hurry up and take off those clothes, or i'll just rip them off. She said. No need to be told twice. You quickly take your clothes off. Daenerys looks you up and down. Mmmh. Fairly built. She said. Her eyes was on a particular part of you and you laugh a bit nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, ready to pleasure your queen? She said. You nod and she lowers you down to her pussy and thrust you inside with a yelp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a second to get your bearings before starting your crawling around. Dany moans as she felt you moving and lays down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys could feel everything you did. From crawling to rubbing her vaginal walls; causing her to breathing to become quicker. Yes.... That's it! Satisfy your queen! She said. Hearing that, you keep crawling, taking a few stops to rub and lick the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDany panting became quicker and more rasp as she grab and fondled one of her breast. She was reaching her climax. It wasn't until you found and hit her sweet spot that sent her over the edge. Yes...! YES!! She said loudly as she climaxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDany pants as she catches her breathe. She's never felt a more euphoric feeling. You were pushed out along with her juices. You were afraid you'd drown as you were pushed out, but you held your breathe long enough. You collect yourself as you're picked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat.....*Pant*....was amazing. I didn't think it would have been that good. She said. I aim to please. Can't slouch when it come to a queen. You said. Well then, let's see how you do. She said. She gives you a quick full body lick and blows right on your crotch. The warmth of her breathe quickly got you a hard on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys smiles like a predator as she brings you close to her mouth. She parts her lips a bit and clamps down on your dick. She licks it with the tip of her tongue and starts to suck. You didn't think it would be that exciting since her whole lips engulfed your member. So there wouldn't be much to do. But Dany wasn't going to let that stop her. She moved her head back and forth and making gagging noise as if she was deep throating. Even if it was nothing but an ego boost, it was a nice one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were close to your end and Dany could feel it. So she got a little more violent in her licking and sucking. You on the other hand, didn't want this to end just yet. It was too soon to end it. So you hold it back, which wasn't easy. She was doing everything with her tongue to make you shot. Even using her breathe to stimulate you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Dany was wondering why haven't you sent a warm treat onto her tongue. All this and nothing. You were either holding it in or you were not feeling it. So she stops and holds you in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you not enjoying this? She said with a bit of curiosity. I am. It's just.....takes a lot more than that. She said. Really? Are you saying i don't satisfy you? She said. You do. You really do. But a simple blowjob isn't going to cut it. You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hope she didn't take that the wrong way. But she didn't. She saw it as a challenge. Ok.... I see what you're saying. She said, smiling. I'll try a different method to please you. She said.</span></div></div>",

She had one idea, but shot it down out of fear you'd be crushed under her weight. So she had another idea. One that was perfect. She lowered you onto the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then shifts herself to where her feet where right in front of you. You look at the giant feet as they push you on your back and rub you lightly. D-Daenerys? You said. Yes? She said with a coy smile. She keeps gently rubbing your body with her big toe, making you shutter a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat? You said my mouth wasn't enough for you. So i'm just giving you what you really want. I just know my feet excite you. She said. But i don't like- Shhh. She interrupts. Just lay back and enjoy yourself. She said. With that said, Dany grips your cock with her big and second toe and started stroking your cock up and down. You gasp as the soft, smooth toe flesh on your cock. Dany smile got wider as she sees you not putting up a struggle since you always say you don't like feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor someone who said they don't like feet, you aren't trying to stop it. She said with a giggle. You'd say something, but you're too wrapped up in her blissful footjob. Every now and then, she switch toes and use her sole itself. She was clearly enjoying this as she was looking at your reaction and fingering herself. She was waiting for you to get close to climax, which didn't have to wait long for. It was all too much for you and you were about to shot when Dany suddenly stops an hovers her foot above you. You look up at her bewildered as she smiles and wiggled her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMmm. Not yet. Say it. Say you like feet. She said. All your reasoning was gone as you wanted nothing more than to finish on her feet. I like feet! I admit it! You said. Yes... I knew it. Now.... Say you love my feet. You want no other woman's feet but mine. She said. I love your feet! I want no other woman feet but yours! You said. Saying that, Dany grips your cock with her toes again and strokes you quickly back to climax. But she wanted to hear one more thing.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSay my name! Say my name or I'll stop! She said. Daenerys Stormborn Targaryen! You said, shooting your load on her toes. At the same time, Dany had laid down and arched her back as she reached her second climax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both remain there exhausted and out of breathe. Both of you were out of energy, so you stayed there. Within time, you had unknowingly feel asleep. When Dany had her energy back, she was ready to tease you about liking feet, but she saw you passed out, so she'd have to save it for the morning. She gently picks you up and lays you by her head. Sweet dreams, my soon to be king. She said, before placing a gentle kiss on your head.</span></div></div>",

Suddenly Viserion appers between two big clouds , roared vigorously and landed after few minutes at base of the pyramid , just under the balcony. Daenerys loved her dragons and started admiring that powerful figure until she noticed something wrong on his back : it was you , wearing Lannisters paraments, that were unsuccesfully managing to ride Viserion. She had no idea about how youwere there on her \"child\" and angrily jumped on her dragon from the balcony.  \"You are Daenerys , the daughter of the mad king! I'm here to steal your dragon for Cercei! You wont never reign upon Westeros! Never!\" you shouted with a mix of rage and fear.

Trystane was killed by his horse who saw a snake and went crazy\u201c<br>\r\n\u201eTwo deaths and the best thing that could\u2019ve happened in the same day\u201c<br>\r\n\u201eAre you Ok?You know, I\u2019m here for you\u201c<br>\r\n\u201eThank you\u201c She began to cry.

It was a few minutes before Daenerys arrived in the throne room, then facing her throne, she discretely pulled you out of her bra, and set you down on her throne. Before you could get up and reorient yourself everything got dark, and you looked as Dany's ass descended onto you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDany sat down onto you, and crossed her legs. You were flat on your back, engulfed by the Mother of Dragon's sexy ass. Daenerys moved her butt around to get comfortable on top of you. You were wedged between her cheeks as a result. After an unusual amount of adjusting Dany turned her attention from smothering you to the first merchant who came to her with a plea to be compensated for his home being damaged by freed slaves during the sacking of Meereen. She couldn't help him due to the fact that the slaves rose up and attacker their master and dismissed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Daenerys was waiting for the next person she moved her hips from side to side, smothering you beneath her ass. She then sit up slightly and moved to her left and sat back down, pressing her right ass cheek on top of you. The new position pressed a lot more pressure on top of you. After the next person left Dany slid back to her right and you were pinned between her cheeks. Over the rest of about two hours Daenerys positioned herself on top you you in several different manners. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the last petitioner left Dany leaned to one side and pulled you out from under her butt finally, and stood up and dropped you between her breasts in one quick motion to not draw any attention. You felt relieved to have a gasp of fresh air finally, and to be in a much softer position. Not that Dany's ass wasn't soft.<br>\r\nDany headed back to her room, her boobs jiggling all around you the whole way.</span></div></div>",

She sat for a minute, clearly deep in her own thoughts, without saying a word to you. Eventually you were forced to cough, making sure she hadn't entirely forgotten about you. Her eyes slowly regained focus, before lazily drifting over to your tiny form. \"Anything?\" You demanded, inappropriately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDany frowned for a moment, clearly she wasn't too pleased with your rude behaviour, however, she could overlook this for the time being. \"Considering you vetoed my initial choice, I feel it's only fair to limit you to that one rejection, before you try and deny me of any fun.\" Dany said, a look of both seriousness and satisfaction crossing her face. \"Therefore, I can choose anything I want, no matter how unpleasant it might be for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeavy concern spread across your face; you didn't like where this was going. The giantess began to giggle upon seeing the look on your face. Apparently it was a source of great amusement to the Mother of Dragons. Dany uncrossed her legs and firmly planted her sandy boots either side of you. \"I was thinking, considering your current size, you'd probably make an excellent insole for one of my boots,\" Daenerys stated, nonchalantly. \"So, for the rest of the day, I think you'll be getting some quality time with the baking hot feet of your Queen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were stunned. Part of you wanted to yell abuse at the gigantic figure, before sprinting away, but the more sensible part of you knew that it would just make matters worse. \"On second thoughts, being your seat cushion doesn't sound half-bad, might be better to-\" She cut you off mid-sentence.<br>\r\n\"No, it's too late for a change of heart, little one,\" she said, in a disconnectedly caring tone, considering she was about to make you her human insole. \"Plus, my mind is pretty set on feeling you squirm under my sweaty soles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart sunk, and before you could attempt to even make a rebuttal, she swiftly snatched you up in her left hand. Rising up, past her boots and leggings, her dress and cloak, you stopped right in front of her enormous eyes.\"Don't look so grumpy,\" she said, in a mocking voice. \"I said I'd think of something fun, and this is. Although, I'll probably be having a bit more fun than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDany giggled once more. She placed you down on her knee, reminding you to take in plenty of fresh air, because you were unlikely to get much whilst you were down there. Then, with a sickening pop, she tugged off her boot and flexed her freed toes in the cool air. Moaning with pleasure, she continued to move her long toes, which only caused her to inadvertently waft the stench towards your tiny figure. You began to cough uncontrollably, barely able to maintain your footing on her knee. \"God, I never knew they stunk that bad!\" Dany exclaimed. \"But then again, I won't be the one forced to smell them for the next few hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, she giggled, greatly amused by her own sadistic sense of humour. \"Oh, lighten up,\" she said, dramatically. \"I could be way meaner. I could've forced you to clean all the sweat off my feet, but instead, all you have to do is endure being my boot insole till I get bored of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young Targaryen said this as if it was a simple task. Again, you went to object, but she wasn't having it. She pressed you into the sole of her steaming foot, before plunging it deep into the discarded boot. Her surprisingly large foot immediately consumed your senses, as your helpless face was smothered between her moist toes. Dany made sure her boot was nice and tight, before smirking as she felt your small body writhe beneath her hellish foot. \"If you think my feet smell bad now, you should see them at the end of the day,\" Dany teased. \"They can clear a whole room as soon as I take my boots off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Daenerys got to her feet and wandered off, with you firmly squished under her drenched sole, whilst inhaling her suffocating foot odor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow long does Dany keep you inside her boot?</span></div></div>",

You couldn\u2019t see anything as the world rocked around you and the fleshy wall around you clenched and tightened putting a lot of pressure on your small form and making things very uncomfortable. But then rather suddenly the pressure around you alleviated and you felt yourself falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou landed on a hard wooden surface belly first. Looking around you, you noticed that you seemed to be lower to the ground than the desk you had been on previously, then it finally dawned on you that you were on a chair. You rolled over and saw the dragon queen looking down upon you, a faint smile breaking her otherwise serious expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince you have decided not to talk, I will have to make you talk.\u201d She said as she bent over to bring her head closer to you, and grasped the two corners of the chair with her hands. \u201cOr else\u2026\u201d She said, sly smile further spreading across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of her fingers quickly darted out and pressed your tiny chest down into the hardwood of the chair under you. \u201cI\u2019m not playing games with you anymore. Talk.!\u201d This was a side of her that you had never seen up to this point. And you were shocked and understandably terrified. You were silent, thinking that maybe it would be in your best interests to talk, but your fear betrayed you and you couldn\u2019t say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds her finger moved away and you could breathe easier again. You closed your eyes for a few seconds as you regained your breath\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard movement above you and you opened your eyes, only to see Daenerys's massive backside looming over you. \u201cWell, if you don\u2019t want to talk now, maybe you will in an hour\u2026 or two\u2026\u201d She said, before slowly lowering her butt onto the chair. You tried to scramble backward to get out from under her before she sat on you, but it was already too late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer butt plopped down into the chair and slid to the back, sliding you backwards in the process. The dragon queen moved her butt around, from side to side, back and forth, even sitting, giving you hope that she might have changed her mind, only to plop back down on top of you a second later. She took a long time making sure that she was comfortable, and finally pulled her chair up and under her desk\u2026 then tried to get comfortable again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed and squeezed her butt cheeks together, feeling you squirming under her gave her immense pleasure. She sat up lightly and plopped her butt back down again one last time before getting back to some paperwork.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The new Queen would be standing on the podium in the middle of the city in a few hours and you wanted to see her desperatel. But there was one problem...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour master had an inkling of fascination for scientific experiments (or so he called them). You knew it was a lie. He just liked to have his servants perform experiments on slaves and watch them die in new and exciting ways. One of these experiments, caused you to shrink down to 2 inches in height and the power to shrink further down to the size of a flea if you wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, this little problem was going to make it hard for you to see Mhysa. The crowd had already gathered at the podium. Thousands of ex slaves and even some of the kind and gentle masters had arrived to show their love and gratitude to her. You begin to run over the crowd, hopping climbing and sliding over bare and sandaled feet until you reached the front of the podium where a squad of Unsullied stood guard. The podium was to steep so you climb up on of the guards spears until you reach the top and jump off it onto the floor of the podium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou land on your feet and your eyes are graced by the beauty of Daenerys Targaryen, towering above you in the distance. She was the most gorgeous woman you have ever laid seen. Beside her was Missandei, Dario and Jorah, protecting her as the queen gave her uplifting and inspiring speech to her subjects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to meet her. You decide to climb onto one of the giants with hopes of going back to Daenerys palace.</span></div></div>",

You could only imagine you and her becoming friends, and you sitting on her shoulder as she went from city to city freeing more and more slaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys finishes her speech perfectly, and continues standing still as the crowd cheers for her.

No, that is a lie. In reality this mighty lance was little more than a twig being held between the thumb and forefinger of a bored young girl. My current traveling companion, Arya Stark. Was she a giant? No. I was once a knight, traveling my way across the land, trying to avoid this miserable war. Now, I had been reduced to the size of two inches and now relied on her for protection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJAB. Ouch! She stuck me once more, throwing off my train of thought. She looked at me with a bored expression as she leaned over the tree stump that I was standing on. To her, it was the size of a small stool, to me it could have been the stage in an arena. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop that.\u201d I ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said, poking me once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop it!\u201d I shouted, my irritation mounting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake me.\u201d She replied, amusement creeping into her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know damned well I can\u2019t do that! I\u2019m only two bloody inches tall!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shifted her weight and sat down, leaning forward and propping her elbows on either side of me on the stump. She hung her head between her hands. Good lord, even sitting she towered over me. I looked up at her, her mouth nearly directly over me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s my fault. I didn\u2019t do this to you, you\u2019re lucky I found you instead of a wild animal, or some farmer\u2019s bored teenaged daughter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached the hand holding the stick down and poked me in the side once more. We were in a clearing about a mile from the main road. We\u2019d been traveling since dawn and were both rather hungry, so now we sat trying to decide how we would find something to eat. Or rather I tried to figure it out. The overgrown brat seemed content to try and dent my armor with that infernal log!<br>\r\nI crossed my arms in contempt and looked up at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are far too big to act this childish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m not big. You\u2019re just rather small.\u201d Arya said with a smirk. \u201cYou\u2019re quite the opposite of my last companion. He towered over me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter now, we need to find some food and shelter before nightfall. It\u2019s getting colder.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArya stood up and walked over to our pack that lay on the ground a few feet away. She reached into it and pulled out a large coat she had bartered off of a trader. She put it on and it reached down to nearly her knees. We\u2019d decided that this would aid in disguising the fact that she was a girl. The coat also had a collar that could pull up to help shield her from the wind. Once she had the coat on, she turned to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe could stay outside tonight, between this and my blankets, I\u2019ll be warm. And you can sleep in the pack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe, but then what would we do about food?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sly grin slowly crept across Arya\u2019s face. She crept towards me looking ever more mischievous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I am of The North. My mother told me stories of the last winter.\u201d Arya hovered over me, lowering her face towards me as she spoke. \u201cWhen the food was gone and the cold nights stretched on. She said that eventually they had to turn to eating livestock, and eventually\u2026\u201d Her mouth was only inches away from me at this point. \u201cThey had to eat each other. Starting with the smallest.\u201d As she said that, her tongue flicked from her mouth and slammed into my chest in a short but strong lick, knocking me to my feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wiped her drool from my armor, thankful that my face was spared. I stood and looked up to her. Her face was still hovering in front of me, now wearing a self-satisfied grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI vote that we avoid cannibalism. I say we go on down the road a bit further to see if we could come across a tavern or a farm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArya stood with a sigh, walked over to the pack, hoisted it to her shoulder and walked back. She lowered her hand palm up towards me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd by we walk, you mean me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I replied, climbing to her palm. \u201cWould you have it any other way?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat me on her shoulder as she started walking towards the road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly, I\u2019d rather trade you to a horny farm girl for a horse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe walked along the road until nightfall. Did we find anywhere to stay or were we forced to sleep outdoors?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Arya began to smile as she imagined all of the countless possibilities and fun she was now able to have, reaching for the bottle she pulled the cork from the top and sniffed it, the smell was rather unpleasant but she hadn't expected much, Arya assumed that the more of this she drank the larger she'd grow, so she tilted her head back and chugged away as quickly as she could. Mere seconds later her body began to tingle with a strange sensation all over, she looked around and realised it'd be a bad idea to grow inside so she burst open her bedroom door and began sprinting as fast as she could, she almost tripped over a few times as her head became fuzzier and fuzzier but eventually she made it to the gates of Winterfell. Demanding the guards let her through she continued sprinting until Winterfell was a safe distance away from her before collapsing to the ground and blacking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon waking up Arya got to her feet and looked around, she didn't recognise where she was at all, there were lots of strange black shapes and a toy castle in the distance, as well as a huge patch of dark green moss on the ground. Arya took two steps toward the castle and the black shapes when she began to see movement, there were strange black dots running around between the shapes. She crouched down to the ground to get a better look and gasped as she remembered what she did, consuming all of the growth potion had made her unbelievably large, the Unsullied before her were just slightly smaller than ants to a human and the toy castle close by was none other than Winterfell itself. Arya returned back to her unbelievably huge stature, coating the Unsullied camp in her shadow and began to think, while she wanted to get rid of Daenerys was this really the best way to do it? She'd have to take on the Night King herself afterwards but she doubted that'd be an issue with her new found height, after much contemplation Arya ____________________ </span></div></div>",

She carefully brought the heel of her brown boot to the edge of the Unsullied camp and raised the sole over them, even with her extreme height she could just about make out little black specks scurrying around in a panic as they were enveloped by her foots shadow. Arya spent another few seconds deciding if she really wanted to go through with this before she began slowly lowering her sole onto the soldiers, the tents around them collapsed as the boot of the young assassin fell from the sky, flattening a chunk of Daenerys' precious army, at her size Arya didn't feel the slightest thing but the thought of hundreds of big strong men being obliterated by her boot gave her more than enough pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcited from her initial step Arya began to walk through the camp with a little speed, she was treating it like a game, trying to step on as many black dots as she could in a single step, yet far below her on the ground thousands of lives were being ended for her amusement as her devastating boots fell like meteors on the soldiers. Arya continued her little game until there were only a thousand or so Unsullied left alive, she began to walk toward the remaining tents when she felt a warm sensation on her wrist, as she glanced down she burst out laughing, there, flying beside her wrist was one of Daenerys' two remaining dragons. After a few more seconds of pitiful laughter she swatted the dragon like a fly, breaking its bones and sending it tumbling down to the snow below, Arya took one more step before she felt the same burning sensation around her stomach, once again she looked down and saw the largest of dragons, Drogon, doing his best to melt through her clothing. As carefully as she could Arya pinched the dragon between her fingers and brought it up to her face, just as she suspected Daenerys herself was riding the little guy, with her free hand Arya plucked the ant sized queen from the dragon and pressed together her fingers, bursting Drogon like a grape, she wasn't sure if Daenerys even saw but she hoped so. Arya lifted Daenerys to her face and began laughing again, the dragon queen herself was now her plaything, and she knew just what to do, Arya extended her tongue out from her mouth and let go of the helpless queen, she could only feel the slightest tingle as Daenerys struggled to stand up on her slimy tongue but it was more than enough satisfacton, she enjoyed the tingling a little longer before swallowing the little mite of a queen alive. Having accomplished her initial plan Arya realised she was now in a position to take over Westeros itself, maybe even beyond that, her next step was __________________________</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Arya looked down at her ancestral home, Winterfell. She knew she had an audience in there right now, Jon and Sansa had just watched her slaughter their ally and an entire army, the more she thought about it the more it turned her on. She watched the little specks inside the castle walls moving around, there was no way she'd ever figure out which ones were her siblings but it didn't matter to her. Arya raised her boot and held it there for a moment, before lowering it again. She was going to smash a hole in the wall, but as much fun as it would be she didn't want anything, no matter how small, escaping her. She crouched down and starting making a snowball, once it was round enough she slammed it into the gate of Winterfell, blocking off the only escape. Satisfied with her cute little solution she took her first step inside the walls of Winterfell, annihilating a house entirely with her first foot and a guard tower with her second. Arya watched intently as the specks started gathering in the courtyard, hoping to be spared from her wrath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon and Sansa made their way to the courtyard, staring up at their titan sister, they didn't even bother begging for her to stop, they were much to small to be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think she's going to do to us?\" Sansa asked Jon,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Jon could even answer, Arya spoke,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate how easy you've made this for me\" the goddess boomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence on the ground ended and the crowd erupted in screaming as Arya raised her boot over the civilians. Looking down at the pathetic bugs Arya ran her hand against her pussy from outside her clothing, no amount of men women or children could stop her now. She moaned in satisfaction as she dropped her boot to the ground and flattened almost every resident of Winterfell. It didn't take her long to turn the rest of the castle to rubble under her feet, but it wasn't as fun without the people, she wanted more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does Arya go next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Arya knew exactly where she wanted to go. She never intended to kill Cersei like this, but it was going to be a lot more enjoyable for her. She began walking her way south, stomping through forests and small villages without even looking down at the carnage she was causing below, people were smaller than ants to her now, they were worthless, but that didn't stop Arya from wanting to have some fun with them. Midway through her journey to King's landing she found a small town close-by, her journey so far had been incredibly boring, and this was a good opportunity to have a little fun. She hadn't seen or heard of this town growing up but she didn't care much for it's name anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody said a word. One minute everybody was going about their lives as usual, the next minute the ground began to quake. The more observant citizens saw her coming from quite far away, but most people didn't even notice until she was standing before them, staring down at their town. Her brown boots alone were larger than any house in the village, in fact her boots were almost larger than the whole town itself. The ~500 citizens stared up in a mixture of both awe and fear at the giant girl, a handful of them recognized the stark girl but most were clueless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArya looked down at the town for a few moments, she could make out the little speck sized citizens but they weren't big enough to see their faces, she didn't need to see their faces to know how scared they must be, Arya thought. Being as careful as possible Arya gently lowered her butt and sat down in front of the town, surrounding the town with her legs and walling them in completely. She lowered her hand down into the town and smashed her palm into a group of houses, smearing it along the dirt and bulldozing a large chunk of homes, creating a flat, open area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone that isn't standing here within the next minute is going to die.\" Arya threatened, pointing to the space she just created. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she expected almost every citizen grouped up before her, forming a crowd that was still smaller than Arya's hand. What Arya did next shocked them all, in one swift motion the giant girl swiped her hand down toward the crowd and snatched them up, some unfortunate people were crushed as she did this but their new goddess didn't seem to care. Arya raised the palm of her hand up to her eyeball to get the closest possible look at the bugs, she still couldn't see their faces but she could make out the shape of their bodies at least. Then, without so much as a warning Arya opened her mouth wide and tilted her palm over the giant maw. The microscopic people rained from her hand like grains of sand and landed on her tongue, immediately glued by her saliva. Arya could feel a slight squirming sensation on her tongue but the feeling wasn't enjoyable enough to stop her from swallowing. With a quick gulp Arya devoured the towns population and stood back up. Her boot crashed into the town and obliterated the remaining houses, the few stragglers that ignored her command become nothing more than paste under her foot. Arya continued her journey south with a slight tingle between her legs, eating the villagers wasn't particularly tasty but it was definitely exciting, the feeling of excitement grew immensely when Arya spotted the walls of King's landing in the distance, she had arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Arya do first?</span></div></div>",

Arya carefully entered the room, holding a glass of wine in each hand, she slowly walked over to Daenerys who was currently sitting on her bed. \"I wasn't expecting a visit from you this evening\" She stated,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I haven't had the pleasure of speaking to you myself yet my Queen\" Arya said, slightly annoyed with herself for being this formal, \"Here, I got you some wine\" She continued, handing a glass to Daenerys. Wasting no time Daenerys took a sip of the wine before speaking again, \"Thank you, to tell you the truth I didn't think you liked m-\" Before she could finish she felt a roaring pain inside herself before collapsing on the bed and blacking out, Only seconds later her body began to shrink, bringing her to the new height of 2 inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArya sat there for almost an hour thinking about all the things she could now do to her \"Queen\" before the little body began to move. Daenerys opened her eyes and looked around, everything was..HUGE?! She let out a scream before turning around and realising the real danger, the Stark girl was towering over her with a smile on her face. Arya couldn't help but let out a giggle after hearing her new toy scream, she sounded like a squeaking mouse, she got up and bolted the door before walking back over to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Arya do with the tiny Daenerys?</span></div></div>",

Reaching for her leather boots she pulled them off and tossed them to the side. Daenerys watched the young assassin carefully as she began removing her clothes piece by piece, even she thought Arya's body looked incredible but at her size it was much too terrifying. Now entirely nude Arya took a step toward the bed and crouched down, lowering her eyes to Daenery's height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at you, once a queen, now you're just a pathetic little bug.\" Arya said whilst prodding the naked little woman with her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please stop this! Please! Jon will hear about this, you'll regret it!\" Daenerys replied, doing her best to dodge Arya's poking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jon won't hear about anything, nobody will hear anything from you for the rest of your little life.\" Arya said coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys was now panicking, she wasn't sure of Arya's intentions before but now it was clear, she wasn't going to survive. Arya stood back up to her full height, towering over the bug in all of her naked glory. She lowered her finger down to her pussy, and gently swiped it along her glistening lips,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at this\" Arya said, lowering the cum coated finger toward Daenerys, \"Thinking about all the ways I can destroy your helpless little body did this.\" Arya continued, carefully Arya pushed the finger into Daenerys, sticking her to it with ease. She raised the ant sized dragon queen up to her belly height and pondered where to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid Arya...</span></div></div>",

She took one last look at the pathetic little dragon queen on her finger, flailing her arms and legs around trying to free herself from Arya's cum, \"So weak..\" Arya mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys screamed as she started to move once again, she watched as she was lowered along Arya's body until she came to a terrifying stop, she was face to face with Arya's dripping wet pussy lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PLEASE SOMEBODY! HELP ME! JON! SANSA! ANYONE!\" she screamed, Arya couldn't even hear her, let alone other giants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally getting her pleasure Arya pressed Daenery's against her clitoris, gently grinding her body against it, gasps and moans escaping her lips as she toyed with the little queen. Daenerys was in pain, she screamed and writhed as her body was forced against the young girl's clit, she was entirely helpless. As much as Arya was enjoying this, it was time for the main event, she lifted her finger away from her clitoris, allowing Daenerys a brief sigh of relief, before ramming the finger straight between her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\" Daenery's screamed as she was forced inside Arya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrying out with moans of pleasure Arya collapsed onto the bed, violently grinding Daenery's squirming body against every sensitive wall inside of her. Harder and harder she pressed, Daenery's life didn't matter to her anymore, only her pleasure did. She continued torturing her for another minute before she couldn't take it anymore, Arya bucked and moaned as she orgasmed, closing her eyes in pure bliss for a few moments. Arya pulled the finger out from inside herself and lifted it to her face,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas Daenerys alive or does Arya need a new toy?</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">I was surprised that there was no Game of Thrones size interactive on this site already, so I decided to rectify that.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is basically what it says on the tin. A Game of Thrones size changing interactive. Have you ever wanted to see a giantess Daenerys Targaryen crush a city beneath her as she continues her conquest? Go for it. Have you ever wanted to see Cersei Lannister pleasure herself with a shrunken foe, or see her shrunk and toyed with by a foe? Have at it. Get as sexual or violent as you want. Have a ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, a few ground rules.<br>\r\n#1.  Keep it to the show. For now, lets just try to draw from characters and events already introduced in the show. This seems fair since not everyone has read the books<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#2. I\u2019m good with almost anything sexual. Giantess, giants, shrunken people, couples. I personally prefer women over men, but I know Thrones has a large and diverse fan base and I don\u2019t want anyone to be excluded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n#3. No sexual content with under-aged characters. You can have stuff in the story featuring characters like Arya, but don\u2019t do anything pedophilic. If a person\u2019s actor is of age, like Joffrey\u2019s, then that is fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#4. Try and keep the chapters of a somewhat decent length and NO text speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n#5. Always leave an option open. Don\u2019t just end it for everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI doubt I\u2019ll delete much, and I won\u2019t edit unless it\u2019s to touch up something here or there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, have fun.  All size related fetishes are allowed. There is no size limit. Get as big or as small as you want.<br>\r\n</td>",
