He was looking twards the dusky sky and saw what appeared to be a shooting star and he closed his eyes to wish. But when he opened his eues the shooting star turned and aim ywords him! He ran about 25 feet before the object crashed. Wen Jason went to see what has ctashed he saw a upside down lifeboat with two black boots peering under them. Jason quickly ran and flipped the boat over and saw a shocking Discovery. The famous Captain Amelia was out cold with a bruise on her arm and her uniform torn. He carefully hoisted her on her shoulder and snuck her into his room without his family seeing her and set her on his bed. For 6 hours Jason was treating the felines wounds with great motivation and speed.

Captain of the RLS legacy. very strict when it comes to giving orders.<br>\r\nbut otherwise really nice and caring and smart she is a Captain after-all . also don't forget those feline reflexes and instincts.<br>\r\nlikes: maritime tradition, space, ships, and some domestic feline characteristics. she thinks Jason is not her type at first but reconsiders, in time .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nok now for the rules <br>\r\n <br>\r\n1. despite the fact he is 18, Jason has a big crush on Amelia and will not lose interest in her  throughout the story.  However he can control him self and maintain his cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. it would be great if a chapter can be made with a romanic drive in the DeLorean with Jason and the Captain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.Captain Amelia cannot be in a relationship anyone else past or present other than with Jason<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Jason and Amelia cannot die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. sex is encouraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. otherwise indulge yourself.</td>",
