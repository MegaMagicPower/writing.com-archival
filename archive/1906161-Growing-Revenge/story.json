He had had a great workout that day. His muscles were still pumped up, making him look positively huge. Well, there was no doubt that he was gifted. All throughout high school Caleb had been one of the biggest, strongest guys in the school. In fact, by the time he started his junior year he had become the tallest and most muscular guy in school! At 6'5\" and 245 lbs. of pure muscle he could have easily been mistaken for a pro bodybuilder contestant! And not only was he big, he was strong too. In the gym, he could outlift anybody. And it didn't even take that much effort to keep up his body! He could eat as much junk food as he wanted and the only weight he would put on would be rock hard, fat free muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition to his great body, he had great looks as well. His face could rival any teen heartthrob celebrity with gold-brown hair, flawlessly clear tan skin, dreamy blue eyes and a killer smile. And if that wasn't enough, the generous bulge in his pants more than pushed him over the line of perfection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Being big is great!</i> He thought to himself as he climbed the stairs to his room. <i>I can do anything I want, and if anybody gives me any lip, I just flex my muscles and they do whatever I tell them to.</i> He opened the door to his room and walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's precisely why I lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on the edge of his bed was what looked like a 12 year old boy that Caleb had never seen before. He was wearing what looked like some sort of Halloween costume. The kid had blue and brown robes on tied at the waist by a piece of rope, and his hair LOOKED white, but when the light caught it it turned a bright blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the fuck are you and what the hell are you doing in my room!?\" Caleb took a step towards the intruder...and stopped. For some unexplained reason he couldn't move anymore! He struggled and strained and used all of his strength, but his body didn't even budge in the slightest! It was as if he was frozen in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Xan, and I've always been in your room, even before this house was even built.\" The kid stood up and walked up to Caleb. The guy didn't even reach up to the bottom of Caleb's chest, but he somehow looked down on the bigger jock. \"Look at you, all the strength and power any man could ever dream of, and you waste it away by being a jerk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid gave Caleb an angry look. \"Because of you and your swollen head, I lost my bet to another interdimensional being! You costed me a lot of points! I thought giving a scrawny kid like you who watched superhero cartoons every day would bring out a decent good guy, but noooo, those muscles just HAD to feed your ego and you HAD to abuse your gift! You tortured your little brother Mikey, bullied the weaker guys at school and did nothing with your strength but show off and push other people around! Because of your idiocy, I've lost a lot of rank!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXan took a deep breath, regaining his composure. \"But now that the bet is over, I'm free to do whatever I want with you, and I plan to make your life a living hell...\" The kid gave a frightening sneer, and suddenly vanished into thin air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Caleb was able to move again. Did that really just happen? Or did he just imagine the whole thing? He shook his head, trying to make heads and tails of what just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, maybe I pushed myself too hard in that last workout, the blood's rushing to my head.\" He muttered, convincing himself it was some sort of freaky daydream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunetely for Caleb, it was no daydream at all. Xan WAS real, and was fully intent on following up on his promise of revenge...</span></div></div>",

It dropped and when he bent over to pick it up, his shirt ripped across the shoulders, exposing his chest and bigger pecs than he had ever seen.  <br>\r\n\"Caleb!\"  Mrs. Calderon scolded.  \"We all know how proud you are of those muscles but this is no place for showing off.  Go home and fix your wardrobe malfunction.  Don't come back until you are decent.\"<br>\r\nCaleb got up as best he could.  His legs were numb and his arms didn't seem to flex like they should.  He blushed with embarrassment as he shuffled  out of the room.  He was holding his shirt to cover his chest as best he could.  It was all he could do to drive home and drag himself up the stair to his room.  <br>\r\nHis jeans were too tight to get off.  What was he going to do?<br>\r\nSuddenly Xan appeared.  \"You wanted more muscles?\" he asked.<br>\r\n\"Well, you've got them.\"<br>\r\nSuddenly Caleb's clothes vanished leaving him wearing only a posing bikini.  Caleb was powerfully muscled with 30 inch thighs,  A sixty inch chest,  65 inch but and a 48 inch waist. He was wide as a barn and solid muscle.<br>\r\nCaleb couldn't believe what he was seeing.  He looked like a caricature of a body building, a cartoon.  Was it really him?  Was he really that big.  <br>\r\nYou may find that your mobility isn't quite like before.\"  Xan told him.  \"But I'm sure that it's a small price to pay for all that muscle.  You are quite the prize jock.\"<br>\r\nCaleb stared at himself in the mirror, astonished, amazed,  embarrassed and yet somehow proud.  He was big as a house.  He took some body builder poses.<br>\r\n\"You like?\"  Xan asked.   <br>\r\nCaleb considered.  He'd never even dreamed of being this big.  What would it be like to be the biggest man wherever he went?  Was it too much?</span></div></div>",

During this time, he started to feel a little strange. He couldn't quite place it, but something definitely felt off for him.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Caleb roamed around the kitchen, getting everything ready for his usual breakfast. As he did, he knew something about the place felt off. Places and objects that were hard to reach even for him before were now easy to get to. He felt like he was bending down more than usual to reach for the milk in the refrigerator. His clothes again felt tighter on him again. It was strange for him since he had changed into bigger clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stood up, he realized something very wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was at eye level with the top of his refrigerator. His shirt and pants made tearing noises as he moved his body. \"Holy...\" Caleb muttered as he almost dropped the milk. The kid from his dream...he was real! What's worse, his magic seem to be real as well.  With each breath Caleb took, the more constricting his clothes became. If Caleb had to guess, he was a little over 7 feet tall now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis growth seem to be happening in spurts. With each breath he took, he would grow just little bit more. However, upon the realization of his growing stature, Caleb's heart was racing and so was his breathing. Oddly enough, excitement filled his heart as his clothes slowly teared from his expanding body. If this was some curse, then Caleb didn't mind it. 'Bigger is always better' was the mantra Caleb lived by, and if he wasn't already, he was now the biggest kid in school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his hasten breath, his growth took a slightly more violent spurt. His broadening shoulders and chest filled his shirt until the seams teared apart. His arms flexed, ripping off whatever type of conform space the shirt had as it hung loosely by his neck. The button of his pants was the first to go, blasting away into some part of the kitchen. His pant legs tightened, showing the form of his legs. Soon, those too began tearing at the seams. It started at the bottom and worked its way to his hips, as the fabric once again dangled. Much to Caleb's surprise, his boxer shorts were the only ones that kept up with his growing body. It did little to hide the excitement of Caleb however as a distinct bulge formed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis tattered clothes remained on him, although he figured it would not be for long as he surpassed 8 feet. In his mind, Caleb thought that this spurt would be all there was to this 'curse' and he could go on the rest of his day as normal as he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb started to go upstairs to his room, before his parents could see him. </span></div></div>",

His growing body made for a very tight fit, his broadening shoulders scraping against the banister and wall, nearly wedging him in place a few times. Caleb tried to walk as silently as possibly, but his growing feet weighed heavily on the steps, creaking loudly and threatening to break. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a miracle that he managed to get upstairs without encountering his parents. Caleb was forced to lean over a bit as the back of his neck pressed against the ceiling and the growing teen found it much easier to crawl on his hands and knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking it to his room, he was stopped as his hips were too wide to fit through the narrow doorway. Caleb moaned and strained, forcing himself through and into his room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore any of his parents could notice, he shut the door with his foot and sat down on his bed, which creaked and sank under his weight. He was now too big to leave the room and it wouldn't be long before it outgrew it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then~<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He immediately turned around, almost upset that this person was going to blow his cover. Then, he heard the voice of Nina, his girlfriend. Nina was apart of the volleyball team and she was quite good. It was an attribute to her fairly developed body, standing at 6 feet exactly and an athletic build to go along with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the voice of his girlfriend got Caleb flustered as his heart beat pumped faster again. Once again, his growth began to kick in just a little bit faster than usual. He inched up higher and higher as he made his way to the door. He was so tall now that he had to bend down slightly to reach the door knob. \"Caleb, get out here! It's time for school!\" Nina said through the door. If there was one thing that Caleb hated, it was that Nina was quite bossy and punctual when it came to school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, he didn't care. \"Nina...\" Caleb started. \"Come inside.\" Caleb opened the door slowly, as Nina hesitantly waited at the door. She finally let herself in as Caleb 'hid' himself by standing behind the door. Caleb was now a head taller than the door to his house, and could now touch the ceiling of his home. Nina turned around and she Caleb. Immediately, Caleb motioned for her to keep quiet as her mouth opened, on the verge of screaming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb now reached 9 feet, which was something he didn't expect to happen. He was hoping that his growth would stop a foot before, but it seem like the wizard kid was going to make him pay in a big way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina looked up and down at her boyfriend, examining his body. All of clothes except for his boxers were the only ones that remained, and it was obvious to her that Caleb was excited about something. Caleb dropped to his knees gently. Even then, Nina was just mere 'inches' taller than him when he was crouching, and his growth was slowly closing that gap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caleb, what's-\" Nina tried to ask, but Caleb had an answer. \"I had this strange dream that this kid cursed me for being a pushover with my size. Now, I'm getting bigger.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does anyone know about this? How are you going to live? What is going to happen to you?...\" Nina began trailing question after question, concern for Caleb. The big man simply shook his head as he said, \"Listen, this is obviously some trick. He'll eventually make me return to normal. I just have to wait it out...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina didn't like the sound of that idea. \"What if he doesn't?\" She asked. \"Well, I'll be the biggest person in history...as if I'm not already.\" Caleb said as he stood up to his full height. He flexed, trying to impress his girlfriend. Nina wasn't having it. \"This is serious, Caleb! You can get hurt...\" Caleb scoffed at the idea. How could he get hurt by anyone? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he heard his parents upstairs. They yelled, wondering why he has not left for school yet and who was there with him. Caleb still had a sense of embarrassment and modesty as he realized he was half naked. He looked down at Nina and whispered, \"I don't want them to see me like this...help!\" </span></div></div>",

What he didn\u2019t realize was that he was growing faster from this. <br>\r\nHis boxers tighten up even more at 10 feet, reaching to their limits. Soon, he was reaching 13 feet, each deep exhale giving him a shot of growth. He suddenly found his upper back touching the ceiling, each breath finding it more difficult to stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb!\u201d Caleb turned around and saw his mother. His dad was behind her, both with a look of shock on their faces. His twist finally made his boxers tear itself apart. Barely able to stand up and now naked, Caleb couldn\u2019t find any words to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening to you?!\u201d His father shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of answering, Caleb decided to get out of the house the best way he could. He was still embarrassed for his parents to see him like this. He tried to fit through the door without breaking it, but he had no choice. He tackled the door shoulders first, easily breaking it apart. It was the first time Caleb had tested out his strength with his new growth, and he kind of liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb now emerged out of his house. He could see his girlfriend standing at the front yard, having fallen down from the sudden surprise of him breaking out. Meanwhile, Caleb in his effects to break the door, caused him to pant a little. Added on this new feeling of fear and excitement, Caleb\u2019s body was rapidly growing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was now half a body taller than his house. And only growing faster. He looked down at Nina. \u201cNina\u2026\u201d He muttered, a strange look in his eyes. Nina must of caught onto it as she started to run away. She got into her car upfront and drove away into the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb thought about running to her. Still try to convince her to be by his side. But he had already attracted more attention than he thought. Maybe it was best to hide it out for a while. Caleb decided-<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"GAH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pair of metal teeth painfully dug themselves through Caleb's tight boxer briefs and into his thick --yet tender-- meat. His temper flared, his perfect features flushed and he punched a coiled fist hard into his bedroom wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA delicate voice responded instantly, muffled and several rooms away, \"Young man, what have we said about hitting the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb instinctively grinded his teeth as his mother's snappy reminder sank in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Mom.\" he angrily grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill seething from his manhood's dulling pain, he swiped up his size 14, all black Nike's from the ground. As he had a thousand times, he hopped on one foot as he tried to slip the first shoe on. No good. His foot just wouldn't go in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UURR!\" Caleb grunted, slamming himself into his nearby desk chair and throwing the shoes back to the ground. His enormous frame filled every square inch of the plush office chair. His back was so wide that his arms hung past the petite arm rests by several inches on each side. Despite being small, the chair was comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Caleb tried to shove his foot into the loosely laced shoe. Again, the wide balls of his feet would not fit into the narrow hole. His tan skin boiled another shade redder. \"What is the deal this morning?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb unlaced the first shoe with violent ripping motions. The fabric audibly snapped, though not in half. It was still enough to piss Caleb off. He instantly threw that shoe across the room, slamming it against a dresser on the opposite wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caleb!\" his mother called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom,\" Caleb's voice quietly seethed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally unlaced the left shoe and forced his foot inside. The fabric visibly bulged around the sides of his foot and his big toe. His favorite tennis shoes had never felt this tight before, but Caleb dismissed his foot's growing discomfort on account of his frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally getting his other shoe on, he ritualistically checked his appearance in his full length, closet door mirror. His flawless features stared and bulged back at him. While checking over his messy, golden brown hair, he was forced to crouch a little to get a full view. He teased a few strands into different places, but otherwise, just right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBUZZ<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis girlfriend just texted: \"Where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting ready. What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You take longer than me! <img style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/wink.png\" alt=\"*Wink*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Wink\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb huffed, dropping his heavy weight back into his chair. \"Whatever. I'll pick you up when I'm ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRIP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck?\" Caleb gasped, shoving the already buzzing phone back into his pocket. It took half a minute of meticulous review to find the source of the rip: the back of his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb's rock-solid bubble butt had literally split his khaki shorts at the seam. The hole was over an inch long and nearly a perfect circle. Even now, each firm cheek pulled at the hole, grateful for a little more room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb vibrated with frustration! \"WHAT THE HELL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ripped the cloth belt away from his shorts and dropped them around his ankles, leaving his perfectly sculpted legs fully exposed. A light dusting of fine, dirty blond hair covered hills and valleys of bulging muscle. Caleb hopped up onto one foot, trying to rip the pants off of himself, but somehow the cloth belt got caught under his other shoe and in moments, the 6' 7\" behemoth crashed into the ground. He also distinctly felt the crunch of his smartphone being obliterated by a dense chunk of his thigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on earth is going on up there?\" his mother called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb could hardly breathe he was so mad, but in his mind, he shouted, \"Worst morning ever!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Caleb worms along the floor, struggling to force his shorts completely off, Mikey opens the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, Caleb. Mom says to stop being a dick and---\" the sight before him registers. \"Whoa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb thick legs are spread wide apart. His ripped shorts grip a single ankle for dear life. Caleb crunches his huge shoulder forward. His thick chest looms heavily over a thinly exposed eight pack. Caleb's piercing blue eyes glare at his black haired, pale skinned brother. \"GET. OUT,\" Caleb's voice commands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey barely holds back his bubbling laughter, while pulling out his phone. \"Not before this goes on all my social media!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCLICK<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin an instant, Caleb jumps up and firmly lands on his heels. Mikey is already halfway down the hall before Caleb's thick frame has a chance to move further. \"Stop invading my privacy you little vampire!\" Caleb booms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGale shakes her head. \"Teenagers,\" she sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey suddenly reappears in the kitchen, half winded, taking his usual seat at the glass breakfast table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how's your brother?\" she asks knowingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Super, mom,\" he laughs, \"Let's just say-- I may have caught him with his pants down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGale gives her son an icy stare before continuing with sack lunch preparations. \"I said <i>check</i> on him. Not antagonize him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't help it mom,\" Mikey began as he slurped down some more of his cereal. \"He was literally sprawled out on the floor with his pants around his ankles. Lady luck has never been kinder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGale takes a breath to repeat the, \"brothers-must-stick-together\" speech, but is interrupted by the slam of the refrigerator door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb was finally fully dressed in a turquoise polo, off white shorts, a pair of white running shoes and was guzzling down a full gallon of milk. His neck swelled with each gulp, forcing thick veins on each side to bulge with each swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Classy, Caleb,\" Mikey said as he tilted his cereal bowl back and drank the rest of the contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that really necessary Caleb?\" Gale asked reasonably, choking back her own frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jug was half empty before he stopped. After a loud belch, Caleb responded. \"A little short on time this morning, cuz some jackass doesn't know how to knock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. Mom sent me to check on you,\" he reflexively responded. \"Not my fault you decided to try and tear up the house ---and your clothes--- piece by piece.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You <i>will</i> delete that picture from your phone, or I'll crush it,\" Caleb threatened taking a step closer to his 5'5\" brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGale stepped between the boys, touching Caleb on the chest. \"Nobody will be crushing anything.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up at Caleb with authority, though her eyes were level with the behemoth 17 year old's chest.  \"Understood,\" she finished firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb stood silent for a moment before breaking eye contact with Mikey, putting the milk away. Caleb stomped back out of the kitchen to gather his things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd better hurry or you'll miss your ride,\" Gale motioned to Mikey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I really have to ride with him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That or the bus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey considered that for a moment. \"Decisions decisions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go,\" she affirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey grabbed his lunch and soldered his thin backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you,\" Gale smiled, kissing her boy squarely on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too mom,\" he hastily replied before running outside to catch up with Caleb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb was only a few feet ahead of Mikey and he couldn't help but notice how short Caleb's shorts actually were. They only came a little over half way down Caleb's steel pipes and gripped him like a second skin. Caleb's wallet obscenely bulged from one of the back pockets. \"Going out for cheerleader, meathead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb didn't respond, he didn't even look back as he slid into the driver's seat. Mikey opened the passenger door, but was suddenly stopped by Caleb's voice, \"No nimrod. That's Nina's seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever,\" Mikey said, slamming the door back. \"What does she see in you anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb grinned, flexing an arm for Mikey to see. \"A few things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head of Caleb's bicep bulged fiercely against his polo. A single vein snaked around it and into his equally impressive forearms. Mikey enjoyed giving his brother a hard time, especially because Caleb relished the same--- but moment's like these reminded him just how big and powerful his brother really was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next several minutes were silent until Caleb pulled up to Nina's house a few blocks over. \"I've been texting,\" Nina said, her voice like venom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phone's busted,\" Caleb replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gripped the steering wheel extra-hard as they pulled away from her house, remembering how he had accidentally crushed it earlier. The chords in his forearm flared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likely story,\" she scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the truth, Nina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Fine. I believe you,\" she coldly finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car ride was again, a silent one. Nina starred out the window, pretending everything but her boyfriend was interesting. Mikey knew better than to get in the middle of a lover's quarrel, so he put in some earbuds and played one of the many games on his phone. Caleb was still blaming the phone, his pants, his shoes, his mom and his brother for the horrible start to his morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina finally turned to look at Caleb for the first time and actually <i>noticed</i> him for the first time. She couldn't put her finger on it, but he was looking even hotter than usual. All of Caleb's muscles looked extra thick and defined. Even the one's hiding under his polo were leaving firm bulges and shadows. The top of his exposed thighs wrapped with thick bulges, each twitching and twisting with each press on the brake and accelerator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then her eyes flicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit,\" Nina thought, trying not to stare at Caleb's crotch, \"He must be in a good mood today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina placed her hand on Caleb's thigh, stoking one of the grooves in between the tight folds of muscle. Caleb immediately responded with a soft groan and gentle push of his hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bulge doubled in size within a few seconds and began to forcefully push its way down his pant leg. Nina licked her lips softly as she continued to stroke Caleb's legs. Slowly, but surely her hand was drifting higher up his thigh. She could feel each chord of muscle reflexively tightening under her touch. Caleb had slide even further down in his seat, spreading his legs as wide as they could go in such a tight space. Something about Caleb was making Nina yearn for him more than she ever had, and Caleb was enjoying every moment of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrees and nameless buildings whizzed by as Nina continued to stroke Caleb's soft skin and rippling frame. Caleb's chest heaved with short, hungry breaths, begging for her hands to move higher on his leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FINALLY!\" Mikey exclaimed, jumping out of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb and Nina regained some of their senses. They were now parked at the high school. Mikey was half way to the building and the head of Caleb's dick was nuzzling Nina's hand. The engorged flesh had somehow freed itself from Caleb's shorts, traveled down his thigh and was gently oozing a clear liquid on Nina's forefinger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of the aroused teens stared with equal amazement at Caleb's throbbing member. He stretched another half inch down his leg, gently filling Nina's hand with his flesh. His shorts were so tight that even the veins around his shaft displayed themselves with perfect clarity. He was big. But---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be in a <i>really</i> good mood,\" Nina slyly grinned.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Caleb relaxed back into his seat, feeling Nina\u2019s warm hand around the head of his cock for the very first time. His huge arms relax, filling the center console on one side and crushing into the door on the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe mentally soaked in her features as his bright blue eyes rolled back, creating various fantasies of what she was about to do for him. What would that rigidly straight, unnaturally platinum blonde hair look like as she invited his growing manhood deeper into her throat? What could that thin, toned, cheerleading frame do behind the wheel of his swelling testosterone? Or maybe he should throttle his long shaft between those firm C cups while flicking---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee you in class!\u201d a muffled voice sneered, followed by a slam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb came to. Nina triumphantly strolled away, leaving him alone and, for the first time in a long time-- ashamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb hated this old feeling raging inside of him. All of his pleasure replaced by bitter embarrassment. He slammed an arm down, directly into the center console, rattling the car. His already short sleeve polo thinned as it tried to stretch even further around his flexed arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the pleasure was gone, his enormous penis needed more time to reach a size where he could stuff it back into his boxer briefs. He was cocky, but an exhibitionist? Caleb had never given it that much thought. Instead he dwelled on the last few moments in the car:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had he done wrong? \u201cShe was enjoying it right?\u201d he questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat else can I do? Who else looks this good? Who else could make her feel as good as I would!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb muscles instinctively tensed, filling even more of the already small space. He felt his clothes constrict around every bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind continued to shout cries of self-doubt as his enormous rod deflated. Well, it may no longer have been stiff, but it was still as thick as a glass bottle. As Caleb carefully adjusted himself back together, he heard the first bell ring across the car-filled parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnger flared again. \u201cGet\u2019s me all worked up and now makes me late for class!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is just not your day,\u201d an acidic voice distantly echoed. Caleb may not have heard Xan\u2019s sneer, but he felt it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stormed into the the school, his shoes painfully tight as he strode passed the office. A plump, middled aged secretary called through the open door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCaleb Johnson!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb fumed, but stopped in the middle of the open lobby. The voice called out again from the office, \u201cStar quarterback or no, you\u2019re late and the rule\u2019s the rule.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb took a few, heavy steps, landing menacingly in front of the stout woman. She might have been a cheerleader in her day, if she were a hundred pounds lighter. But now, her body looks form fitted to that chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive this to your first period teacher,\u201d she said, handing up a yellow sheet of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thick hand immediately crushed the flimsy carbon paper, barely missing the secretary\u2019s own fingers. If she noticed his arm swell threateningly, she didn\u2019t let on. He turned to leave, but her voice caught him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, and Caleb.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood luck this Friday! Homecoming is always a special time. Especially for a star quarterback who has never lost,\u201d she finished sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb softened a bit and strode off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe locker room was empty by the time Caleb arrived to dress out. Instant relief came when Caleb pulled his shoes off. He rubbed the feeling back into them, happy they were finally free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now that one part of his body was free, the rest demanded the same. Caleb had dismissed how tight his pants and polo were until this moment and now needed to get out of them. The shorts were easy enough. He eased each leg around his bulging quads, past his tight, diamond shaped calves and off his ankles. The polo was going to be a bit tougher. Caleb crossed his thick arms, grabbing the bottom of his shirt on either side and tried to pull up in one fluid motion. The thickness of his muscles instantly slowed him down as each bulged larger and larger getting in the others way. The narrow paint chipped lockers stared at the struggling quarterback with unblinking, narrow eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after several shimmies, his body was free. Well, almost free. The bulge in his light blue boxer briefs was always a bit excessive, but his manhood was really thick today. From above, his strapped manhood easily hid a section of the narrow wooden bench in between the two rows of tall wall lockers. His shaft thickly wrapped off over one leg while his balls easily filled the center pouch. They too were begging to be freed, and Caleb obliged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, all he had left were his white ankle socks and the glory that was his 6 foot 8 inch, 260 pound body. \"And she denied <i>this</i>?\" his temper suddenly flared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen his eyes came back into focus, Caleb saw his nude reflection in one of the large locker room mirrors. Even he was impressed with his form. The harsh fluorescent lighting accentuated every bulging curve. Even small strands of muscle rippled to life like an undertow as he flexed his chest and arms. \"She denied this?\" His temper waned into incredulity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb thought he looked even better than he did yesterday, if that was possible. All of his muscles looked extra pumped and a bit leaner than the day before. His cock swung hefty between his thighs, throbbing at bit at his own visage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was the alpha. Caleb knew it. Caleb liked it. And Nina could suck it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Finally tearing his eyes away from himself, he started throwing on his lifting clothes: a school issue t-shirt and shorts. Immediately, both gave him trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe standard athletic wear had always been a bit snug on Caleb and today it was especially so. The usual XXL cupped his chest like a overly-breasted anime girl. The school\u2019s logo morphed uncharacteristically wide, before immediately vanishing off the cliff\u2019s of Caleb\u2019s huge, thick slabs. His nipples stabbed the fabric even more so. And today, his uniform didn't even come down to his naval. Though this was a bit unusual, Caleb didn't mind too much. His reflection was still to die for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis shorts gave him even more trouble however. The usually loose, athletic fabric gripped his form, showing off every huge band of muscle. His bubble butt forced the fabric back, while each thick chord in his quads pulled the fabric forward. And more interestingly, with the elastic waistband tied off around the navel, this left three bare inches of his free hanging dick exposed. He was too comfortable to stuff it back into tight underwear so soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Caleb decided to pull the shorts down a bit. Half of the head was exposed. He pulled them down a bit more. The elastic band now straddled beneath the deep cuts of his V-shaped abs. The tip still hung out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeez, I'm one hung son of a bitch,\u201d he mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Caleb pulled the shorts down a bit further. The very top of his butt crack felt the a brush of cool air, but at least his bottle sized member was \u201ccovered\u201d. Caleb stroked the obvious outline of his shaft, tracing it all the way down, almost half the length of his thigh before stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime to work Johnson!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat raspy grumble only belonged to one person, Highwind High School\u2019s head football coach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb turned to face the fifty year old man. \u201cJust dressing out sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe locker room had two main entrances, one from the hallways and one that lead directly to the gym. The 11\u201d tall, 10\u201d wide gaps were just like the restrooms with different signage. Coach Walters stood center in the gap leading to the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re late son,\u201d his narrow eyes pierced. He looked like a man who had seen both world wars and acted like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Caleb stumbled, rubbing his hand through his hair. \u201cGot, um, held up-- on my way here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis bicep jumped and fell with every twitch of his finger, pulling the shirt tighter and tighter around his arm and thickly winged back. The motion also left four of his fully formed eight abs completely exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoach Walter\u2019s didn\u2019t flinch. \u201cExcused won\u2019t win games son. Homecoming is four days away and that winning streak of ours won\u2019t defend itself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb strode confidently back to his locker, slamming all of his belongings inside like a hurricane. \u201cI think we got this in the bag coach. The other team is missing a few,\u201d Caleb grinned smugly, \u201cassets that Highwind is full of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoach Walter\u2019s face was stone. \u201cJust get in the weight room Johnson. And no PR\u2019s today. Don\u2019t need my starter pulling something days before our biggest game of the season.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb\u2019s arrogance filled the room as he strode up to the coach. Although Coach Walters was 6\u20193\u201d and fairly fit for his age, he was no physical match for the huge 17 year old now standing inches away from him. The gap was completely filled by Caleb\u2019s thick, heaving chest. If he had breathed all the way in, his chest would surely push into the older man.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cSure, coach.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb sauntered passed Coach Walters, through the gym and toward the weight room on the far side. The full sized, basketball court had been all decked out with every piece of flair, poster board and glitter in the school. \u201cHours of work by dozens of people. All for me,\u201d Caleb arrogantly thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe school pep rally would be all afternoon on Friday, followed by the big game, and of course, homecoming court during halftime. Nina as head cheerleader and Caleb as star quarterback were shoe-ins to win. No other alternative had even materialized in Caleb\u2019s mind. He wondered how their crowns would fit and how he could use the high of the moment to try and convince Nina to go a little--further--this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, the school was so confident in their team, and their star quarterback, that they didn\u2019t follow the usual tradition of scheduling a school they were sure to beat. This year, they scheduled to face the toughest team in the whole district, who, up until last year, had been the district champions for six consecutive years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifty freshmen ran laps around the court, huffing and wheezing and all of them stared unblinkingly at Caleb as they ran past him. Voice huffed in and out of earshot has he passed each clump of runners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s so much bigger in person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow does he do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a god!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose eyes?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe muscles!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou like that kind of thing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat must it be like being a giant?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is such a man!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBet his ego\u2019s bigger than his---\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust by entering a space, the whole room would always be abuzz about him, and that is how Caleb liked it. The little freshmen came up no higher than his chest, some were even lower than that. The scrawny ones were no thicker than his arm, and the chubby one\u2019s still were smaller than his chest at a full pump. And none of them had his killer looks. Flawlessly tanned skin. Unnaturally bright blue eyes. Perfect, golden brown hair and a baritone voice that sung like honey when he wanted it to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSoak me in you little assholes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden tightness followed by a: RIIIIP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb stopped just inches in front of the weight room door and looked down. His right foot had literally burst out of his shoe. His toes hung heavily over the rubber, obviously wider and longer than the shoe was. \u201cHow\u2019d I ever fit in a 14,\u201d he wondered. \u201cMore like 16\u2019s now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb flexed his toes and smirked. \u201cGuess coach is going to need to get me a bigger set of cleats for the game. Might rip out of those too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled away the tattered shoe with ease, painfully aware of just how tight the other shoe was. His toes violently crunched and curled against the walls of the fabric, begging to be released. Caleb stared down at his feet and with one hard flex of his foot, ripped straight through the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMust still be growing after all,\u201d he smirked, ducking through the weight room door. </span></div></div>",

Fifteen or so football players ranging in all ages and sizes were all dressed in the same red shirt and black shorts as Caleb, but none of them filled it out half as well. James, a first string running back and fellow senior noticed Caleb first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBout time you show up!\u201d He wiped some sweat from his dripping brow. \u201cCoach was looking for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe found me,\u201d Caleb indifferently offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames laughed. \u201cDid he give you one of these?\u201d James squinted his eyes and tightening his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe always looks like that,\u201d Caleb grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames followed Caleb to the dumbbell racks, where others of the team were still hard at work grunting and groaning. Caleb pulled a pair of 30\u2019s off the rack and began warming up. James copied him with a pair of 20\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, did they shrink in the wash?\u201d James asked, pumping his arms with a slight swing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Caleb replied, not taking his eyes of the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShirt\u2019s looking a little small on you and---\u201d James\u2019 eyes finally looked down. \u201cDude, where\u2019s your shoes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGym.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat I mean is, why aren\u2019t they on your feet?\u201d he groaned setting the weights back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBusted \u2018em.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames stared up at Caleb incredulously. He was a head and a half shorter than him and a hundred pounds narrower. \u201cHow do you bust your shoes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb re-racked the 30\u2019s and grabbed a pair of 40\u2019s. \u201cOut grew \u2018em.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames tried to keep pace, pumping his 20 pound weights back and forth, but he was already tiring. \u201cDoes that even happen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb finished another set, moving up to a pair of 50\u2019s. \u201cDid to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMight want to go easy on those weights Colossus. Coach strictly said---\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo PR\u2019s,\u201d Caleb finished with a firm and even  tone. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is, but these are feeling a bit light today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames eyed the numbers 5-0 on Caleb\u2019s dumbbells. \u201cSo says you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe workout continued as the team mindlessly chatted about today\u2019s gossip, Friday\u2019s game, their dates to the Homecoming dance, some new supplement they were trying or how much weight they could lift. All the while, Caleb fell deeper and deeper into the zone, struggling to find any decent weight to give him a challenge. All of his muscles glowed with a blood filled pump as he moved from arms, to back, to legs and finally to chest. Others on the team gawked at how obscenely small his clothes were and how big his muscles looked, but didn\u2019t dare say anything to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c---speaking of supplements,\u201d Kenny, a defensive lineman whispered, \u201cThink Caleb\u2019s been-- you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s just gifted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZane, a chocolate skinned lineman scoffed, \u201cYou don\u2019t look like that on gifts alone. Someone\u2019s been putting a little extra in their water bottle or something.\u201d he finished with a knowing glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLot of pressure on our star quarterback,\u201d Kenny added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t screw it up now,\u201d Zane nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s not like that,\u201d James interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever you say, Nina,\u201d Zane lashed, \u201cWe\u2019re just saying, it takes a bit more than dedication to make the gains he has over the past couple of years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames ignored their pessimism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb packed on another pair of 25\u2019s on the bench press and pushed out a set of 12 like it was nothing. More of the team stood around watching Caleb machine his way through set after set. Although he glistened with sweat, the work seemed effortless. With each rep, Caleb\u2019s chest swelled thicker and thicker, pulling the shirt even tighter and even higher than it had been an hour ago. Most of the other activity had come to a halt as each starred in jealousy or amazement at Caleb\u2019s work. Caleb\u2019s shirt had become a drenched second skin. The sleeves rode up past his biceps, hugging his lower shoulder. The bottom of his shirt squeezed its way around the top of his obliques. And there was no hiding his huge member which was now on full display through his shorts and partially exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb finally sat up, hulking over the tiny bench he was sitting on. 500 pounds of weight hung precariously behind him when he finally noticed the whole team staring at him. \u201cProblem girls?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trance was broken and everyone immediately scattered back into their own conversations, leaving James and the 2 linemen near Caleb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was sick!\u201d James exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah man, you\u2019re a machine,\u201d Zane added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it,\u201d Kenny offered, trying to sound as unamazed as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb soaked in the attention, cupping a huge slab of his chest partially with one hand. \u201cEverything\u2019s just so-- light-- today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three guys stood like deer in the headlights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou even know how much weight you were putting up?\u201d Zane asked with his rumbling bass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude. I\u2019m 250 and wouldn\u2019t try to put up that much on the bench unless I was trying to PR or something,\u201d Zane continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn your dreams,\u201d Kenny scoffed, \u201cYou couldn\u2019t put up 500 if you tried.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike to see you do better,\u201d Zane flaired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames wanted to say something, but had nothing. 160 pounds of well defined muscle was one thing. But he had nothing to match these heavy set titans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI what?\u201d Caleb asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys snapped out of their bickering and faced Caleb again. \u201cDo you even know how much weight you were putting up?\u201d James asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb twisted his thick shoulders around just enough to count the number of plates on one side. He sat silent for a moment before turning back. \u201c500?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames nodded. \u201cAny more and you\u2019d probably break the bar.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb nodded along with James. \u201cI am a beast!\u201d he reassured himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZane and Kenny\u2019s stares turned to ice. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re a beast,\u201d they chimed with deadened voiced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb finally stood up, towering above the three boys at a full 6\u2019 9\u201d, taller than any of them had ever seen him. James was 5\u20198\u201d. Kenny was 6 foot even and Zane was 6\u2019 1\u201d. Their eyes followed him up---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd up--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd up--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, a beast,\u201d Zane gulped.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The rest of the day passed in its usual blur. Caleb didn\u2019t see Nina over lunch and in the one class they shared, she ensured that she was surrounded by her usual girlfriends. Putting up an impenetrable social barrier that even Caleb could never break through. This was one of the many games she liked to play, especially when she wanted to remind Caleb of his place. It was infuriating, but she was one of the hottest girls in school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she belong to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Caleb was already several inches taller than he had been yesterday, most people either didn\u2019t notice or didn\u2019t say anything. He was such a giant to them already, that a few more inches didn\u2019t make that much of a difference. Caleb too was barely phased by doorways being a bit smaller than his liking since they were already small to begin with. And since no one was even close to his height before, save for 1 or 2 people, everyone just continued to look small now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere it did make a difference was with his clothes. All of his muscles hadn\u2019t lost their pump from this morning\u2019s workout and filled out his polo and short-shorts with comedic fullness. If anything, they were even bigger. Each muscle mounded higher than the next, fighting for limited space under his tight, bronzed skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as if he wasn\u2019t even wearing clothes, everything was so tight. Teachers were too intimidated to say anything and students who continued to stare didn\u2019t mind the show. Of course, he couldn\u2019t get his feet back into the shoes he had worn this morning. The tip of those shoes barely reached the balls of his feet now. So, he had to borrow the one and only pair of 16\u2019s the school had in its athletic stock. And even they were a little snug on Caleb\u2019s thick feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his stomach half empty and the day a waste, the final bell finally rung, signaling the football team to assemble for practice. The talk of Caleb\u2019s display earlier had only continued to buzz around. Some were completely convinced he was taking some performance enhancement. Others tried to pretend they didn\u2019t care. But James, one of Caleb\u2019s few real friends, whether either one knew it or not, was excited for his gains and was ready to crush their rivals on Friday more than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs everyone stood in various states of dress in the locker room, everyone was painfully aware of just how full and developed Caleb was. 6\u2019 10\u201d made him a tower above everyone else. All of his muscles were swollen with thick overlapping bands on every square inch of his body. And of course, his foot long meat swayed thickly over the coils in his legs. Some of the younger team mates gulped at the thought of that monster being fully hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb struggled to find any pads that would fit properly. As he settled on his third set of pads, \u201cI\u2019d be better off without them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly a few days left until we face off against Fairbrook High!\u201d Coach Walters barked from midfield. \u201cWhile we have had a great streak so far, even one mistake could take it all away! That\u2019s why each of you are essential to victory!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb smugly eyed the tops of his teammates heads, for the first time noticing just how \u201clow\u201d everyone looked. \u201cWere they always this scrawny?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c---and it takes a team to win!\u201d the coach continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb rolled his eyes, while feeling the same tightness he had felt all morning closing in around him. \u201cWhy is everything so damn small!\u201d he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone took the field for several hours of practice. Caleb performed the plays he was supposed to for the first hour, passing rather than running the ball. But for the last few plays, he decided to change things up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to run it this time,\u201d Caleb commanded in the huddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the boys were actually standing straight up. Only Caleb had to crouch. \u201cThat\u2019s not what coach asked for us to practice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not telling you what coach said. I\u2019m telling you what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m going to run the ball right and I dare any of those pricks to try and tackle me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys stood in silent frustration before taking their spots. Sure enough, Caleb ran the ball this time and when the first lineman tried to tackle Caleb, it barely slowed him down. The 5\u201910\u201d lineman was little more than a nuisance to him. This flooded Caleb was excitement, propelling him another 10 yards down the field. It took two more guys before the 17 yo behemoth dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coach blew his whistle. \u201cJohnson! That was not the play we discussed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb pushed the other guys off of him with a few heavy shoves. Each stumbled back a few steps before catching their balance. \u201cGot results, didn\u2019t it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lineman backed away as Coach Walter approached. His stone expression didn\u2019t move. \u201cPractice the play\u2019s Johnson,\u201d he demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d Caleb huffed, stomping back to his spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coach blew the whistle again. \u201cHit the showers everyone!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe field of teenagers relaxed and immediately turned back to the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcept you, Johnson,\u201d the coach finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb stood rigid, filling the same fire he felt this morning boil in his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoach Walter\u2019s approached with unexpected speed. He dug his heels into the grass with each heavy step. \u201cWhat was that son?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was what. Coach,\u201d Caleb seethed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis!\u201d he stabbed. \u201cI\u2019m used to attitude from star players, but something has gotten into you today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019m just realizing my full potential,\u201d Caleb slung back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo one person is as good as a team, son,\u201d he enunciated each word with poignancy. \u201cI do not care how big you are or how strong you are or how talented you are---\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you should,\u201d Caleb glared, staring over half a foot down at the fifty year old man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you should care how strong I am,\u201d Caleb took a step closer, \u201cOr how big I am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoach Walter\u2019s gaze crained higher as Caleb moved closer, but never flinched. \u201cTake tomorrow off, Johnson. You need to consider what it means to be on a team. No one. And I mean no one is better than anyone else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb\u2019s eyes darkened. \u201cSo you say\u2026 coach.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several painful seconds of utter silence, Caleb broke first. The titan strode passed Coach Walters, purposefully grazing the old man\u2019s shoulder against his tightly coiled arm. Mikey sat up in the stands, straining to read his science book under the cloudless twilight. Caleb approached the fence with his backpack limply hanging in one hand. \u201cYou ready shrimp?\u201d he boomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey pulled out his earbuds and look across the stands at his hulking brother. \u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to put the pads back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot worried about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd aren\u2019t they supposed to be wider than your shoulders?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb reached his free hand around and snapped his \u201ctiny\u201d shoulder pads off with a one easy pull. They fell lifelessly onto the track with a hard clunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey rolled his eyes, \u201cThat\u2019s one way to do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Mikey finally got down from the stands, this was the first time he had been with his brother all day. He wasn\u2019t sure if the darkness was playing tricks on his eyes, but Caleb looked a lot bigger than he did this morning. All of his clothes looked like they belonged on a doll. And now his eyes were level with the middle of his back, rather than his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou been eating your Wheaties today, Caleb?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot you too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot me too?\u201d Mikey asked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone won\u2019t shut up about how big I am today. That\u2019s all the team could talk about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould it be because it\u2019s true?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been this big, Mikey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorrection, you\u2019ve been big for the past couple of years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMikey,\u201d his voice darkened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what I mean. One minute you were a little bigger than me. The next you were a brick wall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPuberty, man. Wonderful thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were nicer then,\u201d Mikey sighed under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys rounded a corner of the building and entered the parking lot. Mikey mindlessly scrapped one hand against the rough, tan painted cinderblock. Their car was one of the few left in the whole place, bathed in an unappealing, buzzing yellow light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey broke the silence once again. \u201cI\u2019ve been through puberty and nothing like that happened!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorrection: you are going through puberty, and you are a shrimp because you will always be a shrimp,\u201d Caleb replied with a matter-of-fact tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame logic means you\u2019d still be small,\u201d Mikey bristled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb tensed as he opened the driver door, \u201cI already told you once, dick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll I\u2019m saying is,\u201d Mikey took a breath before hopping into the passenger seat, \u201cYou just look a lot bigger today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t you forget it,\u201d Caleb wheezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb\u2019s oversized body dwarfed the driver\u2019s seat. Plastic and glass constricted him on all sides. His knees crunched up, pinned in place by the steering wheel and his swollen chest. Caleb\u2019s quads flexed into the solid slabs, fighting to unfold the bound titan. He squeezed his oversized arm between the door and seat, fingering for the latch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike watched Caleb\u2019s struggle with amusement. \u201cNeed some help there big guy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seat slide back several inches, locking into place with a loud BANG. Although Caleb was still tightly confined, his knees dropped to the bottom of the steering wheel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb revved the engine to life unblinking and eyes forward, finally responding to his shrimpy little brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Let's have caleb show what a man he is to his teammates and classmates\" Xan says deviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb starts to grow hairier, his forearms growing thick and dark hair, then his chest hair grows thicker, darker and bushier. His happy trail grows thicker and darker which leads to his pubes and creates thick curly hairs down there. Caleb's thigh and leg hairs grow thicker and bushier. Caleb's huge feet grow thick with hair and his toe hair have grown thicker and darker. Caleb can pass off as a werewolf at this point. Caleb's bear grows thicker, darker and bushier like never before. Xan likes what he sees and decides to grow Caleb's ass to be bigger, which becomes a muscle bubble butt that any man would love to put their tongue into. His huge bubble butt starts to grow hair between his ass cheeks which sprout out. It is now a thick and bushy area, which gives Xan a boner. Finally his armpit hair grows darker, thicker, and bushier than a forest. His armpits start to give off a strong manly aroma which gives Caleb a boner. Caleb starts to move around and moan as his boner throbs for release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well such a beautiful sight, but I am not done just yet. Let's grow you even bigger and maybe I might do the same for your best friend Mitchell\" Xan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb grew to fill up the entire room, His pecs were so big now that his chin was pushed upwards due to them pressing into it. They jutted out farther than I was tall. From his gargantuan, hanging nips poured a constant stream of milk that ran down his body. His shoulders, traps and back muscles were so large now, they actually towered over his head. Each one of his abs was the size of my fist, like stacks of apples pressing into each other. His legs were inconceivable, the muscles so big that he had to sit splayed on the ground because they pushed themselves apart. Caleb\u2019s biceps were fucking crazy. Like, take the man with the biggest biceps you\u2019ve ever seen. Hell, the biggest photoshopped biceps you\u2019ve ever seen. I\u2019m pretty sure his arms were so huge at this point he couldn\u2019t even bend them. His cock stuck straight out and pressed into the bedroom ceiling. Cum and pre was smeared across it. Caleb\u2019s dick was as big around as a telephone pole and throbbing. His balls grew enormously and heavy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nXan created a huge and hairy behemoth. Xan could not take his boner any longer and decided to teleport Caleb to an abandoned factory. Caleb proceeded to wake up and see his huge self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a deep and baritone voice that shook the room Caleb yelled \"BRO WTF! Im fucking huge and hairy. My dick is fucking massive and im horny as hell. My nipples are hella fucking sensitive and I think im leaking some white substance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXan changed his appearance to match the likes of Caleb. \"I wanna fuck you Caleb! My dick is hurting over you. But I think we should get someone else to, so we can spice things up\" Xan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Mitchell appeared in the middle of two huge muscle men and looked scared, but his dick start to throb. \"What am I doing here? Caleb is that you?\" Mitchell said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"haha Wassup Mitchell, Do you wanna be as huge as me bro?\" Caleb said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck it, grow me bro. I want that huge hairy ass of yours\" Mitchell said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXan grew Mitchell in an instant and smoke surrounded him until Mitchell was done growing. Mitchell turned out to be even bigger than Caleb. A tight, bright green pair of shorts were stretched to the point of looking like a second skin across the monster's pelvis. The legs of the shorts couldn't reach to his thighs so his all the extra fabric attempted to try and contain a massive bulge that looked like multiple pillows stuffed into the crotch area. The beast's glutes were tight against the back of the shorts as they seemed to try and hold the opposite side of the fabric together with their hardness. He raised a beastly arm and a forest of armpit hair revealed itself, seeming to follow suit with everything else on Mitchell's hairy upper body.  Each leg was bulging like its own pillar, the muscles distinctly revealing their three heads and bulging with angry veins that went up and down from his thick, protruding calf to the revealing green shorts that were loosing the battle against so much size. Mitchell leaned his large head over to his raised, sweat covered arm and licked it as though it were the most tasty lollipop you'd ever seen. Only one limb was meant to be flexed but so much power and muscularity was clearly not enough for his arm as the veins pumped blood into his massive shoulder, which tried to block his head's path to his bicep, and caused his left pec to bulge along with it. Suddenly, Mitchell seemed to go into a muscle frenzy as he raised both arms and flexed his entire upper body, all the muscles converging to for a garden of muscle on top of one torso. His hairy abs cringed as he tried to flex both his arms and his abs, the muscled steps forming a symmetrically perfect eight pack that must have been stronger and harder than steel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitchell's cock was moving like an angry stallion, its confines trying their best to contain its fury and failing against the supposedly extra stretch fabric. A tears began to form along the hips of the shorts as the endowment beneath jumped and moved with excitement. It seemed the beast was beginning to awaken and wanted out. NOW. An enormous pillar began to form in the giant's pants as he got off on his muscle, his attention appearing to be on his pecs as he performed a non-stop pec bounce. The beast was awake and, judging by Mitchell's expression on his handsome face, would not go back to sleep without some serious attention. With a loud RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIPPP, the shorts lied on the ground defeated, a giant weapon of mass destruction appearing in its wake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FUCK MAN IM TOO FUCKING HORNY!\" Mitchell said with his powerful voice, the testosterone coming from him was too intense for Xan and Caleb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After he fell asleep his legs inched further and further to the ground, his calves and quads splitting the fabric of his already small shorts. His chest and arms puffed up to twice the size they already were, splitting every single seam on the shirt. And his cock inched up all night, with no sign of stopping getting larger and thicker.<br>\r\nFrom 11 at night to 5 in the morning Caleb did nothing but grow from an already giant 6' 10\" to 7' 10\" at 12 in the morning, 8' 10\" at 1 in the morning and finally 11' 10\" at 5 in the morning, the exact moment when Caleb's alarm went off like a fog horn.<br>\r\nThe Titan of a man groaned in a deep baritone voice that seemed to have shaken the windows of the house. Still groggy from being tired, Caleb smashed the snoozed button and sat up, only to be greeted by a creaking sound from his bed.<br>\r\n\"Ugh...,\" Caleb said half awake. \"Five more minutes, I promise.\" Caleb made the deal to his alarm clock.<br>\r\nHe fell fully asleep in two minutes and started to slightly grow once again, his muscles becoming larger slowly but still noteworthy. He slowly inched up, 11' 10\",then  11' 11\" after a minute had passed. His bed continued to creak and moan and warp as Caleb slowly turned into a true giant.<br>\r\nAfter four minutes of the torture to the bed, it finally gave out, dropping Caleb, muscle and all, to the floor.<br>\r\nCaleb awoke suddenly from the sound of the cracking wood and metal. After he got up, he noticed just how bigger he had gotten. Surely this couldn't have been a trick of the mind. He then attempted to run over to his full length mirror to view himself, except he couldn't exactly get up correctly.</span></div></div>",

It makes no difference in the end. I\u2019m here\u2026 For a reason, right, Caleb?\u201d Xan said to Caleb as he gave him a wink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Caleb very uncomfortable. So, he just turned around and closed the door, for he just remembered that he had to take out the trash for his mother. He figured he would deal with Mikey and Xan later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh man!

Xan followed right behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll help you with it!

In fact, Mikey would think that the things Xan did were completely normal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys then sat on the pillows on the carpet, each holding on to their game controllers. They played games for about twenty minutes, until they began to get hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan\u2026 I could go for some milk and cookies right now, can\u2019t you?\u201d Mikey sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah!\u201d Xan grinned. \u201cGood idea!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXan just snapped his fingers again, and a large plate filled with OREO cookies appeared on the floor, right between the two boys, filled with chocolate cookies and a large bowl of milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDig in, Mike!\u201d Xan chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa!

Oh, and did I forget to mention his humongous muscles?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXan just shrugged as he took a cookie from the plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo? He used to be short and scrawny, just like you!\u201d Xan replied. \u201cThen he began to grow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 Well, it will take YEARS for me to catch up to him!\u201d Mikey sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot if you get some help!\u201d Xan remarked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhh\u2026 Who\u2019s gonna help me grow big and tall?\u201d Mikey laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess why I\u2019m here?\u201d Xan responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what are you gonna do? Take me to the gym?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot quite!\u201d Xan replied. \u201cYou\u2019ll see!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys continued to play video games until Julie called them downstairs for dinner. They all sat at the dinner table and enjoyed split pea soup with bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring dinner they were mostly quiet. Xan and Mikey sat next to each other, and Caleb and Julie sat opposite them on the other side of the dinner table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had just spoken with your mother, Dan!\u201d Julie said to them. \u201cYour parents are going out-of-town for two weeks and you are more than welcome to stay with us while they\u2019re gone. That way, you won\u2019t be missing any days from school!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYay! Awesome!\u201d Mikey cheered out loud. \u201cTwo weeks!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Wait a minute! How is that possible?\u201d Caleb protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, now, dear!\u201d Julie said to her bigger, oldest son. \u201cI promised Mikey that Dan can stay with us, as long as his grades don\u2019t suffer at school and he gets his homework done every day!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Miss Julie!\u201d Xan said politely. \u201cWe\u2019ll get all our homework done! I\u2019m a straight-A student in school!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Xan turned towards Mikey, who had finished most of his soup, but left almost all his vegetables on his other plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should eat your spinach! That way, you\u2019ll become big and muscular!\u201d Xan instructed. His own plate was completely clean and Xan had finished all his soup and veggies as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, I hate spinach!\u201d Mikey protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEat it anyway!\u201d Xan added. \u201cIt\u2019s good for you! Plus\u2026 It\u2019s the food of the gods!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb immediately looked up and raised his eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, Mikey? I really like your friend Dan! He ate all his food! Now, you ought to follow his example!\u201d Julie pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHis name isn\u2019t Dan!\u201d Caleb said out loud. \u201cIt\u2019s Xan!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh gosh, there he goes again!\u201d Mikey sighed. \u201cCalling my friend by his gamer-tag!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd, how did you get my Xbox out of my bedroom?\u201d Caleb growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, now, Caleb! I think you should allow the boys to borrow your Xbox. When Dan goes back home, you can have it back!\u201d Julie replied calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT!?\u201d Caleb shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, mom!\u201d Mikey said, with a big grin on his face. In the meantime, Xan just decided to remain quiet, while he began to work his magic on Mikey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen supper was done, the boys got up and helped clean up and wash the dishes. After they were finished, they returned to the bedroom upstairs, where they made a startling discovery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Mikey had closed the door, he looked over and Xan was standing right before him, when he suddenly began to notice something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Dan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s weird!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou shrunk!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNoooo Mikey! People don\u2019t shrink!\u201d Xan giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy am I looking down on you?\u201d Mikey wondered. \u201cI thought we were the same height?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s because you grew a little bit!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey got a tape measure out of his desk and Xan made a pencil mark against the wall while Mikey stood with his back against the wall for a brief moment. Then, they used a tape measure to measure the distance from the floor to the pencil mark on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! 5-foot-two-inches tall!\u201d Mikey remarked. \u201cI\u2026 I think I gained an inch!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you that you were going to start growing!\u201d Xan smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 So\u2026 I\u2019m a little taller than you!\u201d Mikey shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry! You\u2019ll grow more\u2026 A LOT more!\u201d Xan said, as he placed his hands on Mikey\u2019s shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 Let\u2019s play some more video games, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Mikey and Xan just played games until they dozed off. Then they crawled in bed and slept till late the following morning\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Xan woke Mikey up and said <b>'Hey, let us get some breakfast. We can play afterwards.'</b>  Mikey rubbed his eyes and said <b>' Well, let me make up my bed first. Mom likes a clean room.'  </b>Xan smiled at the considerate actions of Mikey as he made up his bed. Xan then said to him.. <b>Let me take care of the rest of the room.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nXan wave his hand over the room and suddenly the room was free of trash,furniture polished, and windows washed. Mike gasped in amazement and started to be scared. But Xan simply made Mikey forget how he did it. Xan just made Mikey think that they both cleaned it together.--Then they got dressed for a day to play outside after breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a voice from downstairs called them both for breakfast...eggs, bacon, apple slices, and chocolate milk. The two boys ran down the stairs for a delicious breakfast.  Mikey's mom was smiling and complicated on how nice the boys looked. After breakfast, both Xan and Mikey offered to clean the table and plates. Mikey's mom Julie said<b> ' Just take your dishes, silverwares, and cups to the sink. I will take care of the rest. Just go outside and play. Oh, by the way, Caleb had to leave early. He has football practice in the football field.'</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Xan and Mikey rushed outside and closed the front door behind them. Suddenly Xan decided that Mikey was ready for some more growing. But first he wanted Mikey to stand still. Luckily, Mikey was watching a neighbor's house where his friend Donna lives.[She lived two houses down the street.] <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Xan made Mikey grow another inch while accommodating his clothes on him as well as those in his closet. But Mikey was unaware that he grew another inch- at least, for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXan asked Mikey who lived next door. Mikey responded dreamily '<b>Oh, that is my friend Donna's place. She goes to school with me. She is nice to me. But we are not dating. She took judo for a year but quit due to budget reasons and that it was too hard for her..'</b>  Then Mikey asked Xan <b>' Say, what should we do now for some fun?'</b></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mikey started to protest that maybe she didn't want to see him. Dan smiled and said 'Relax, we are just here to visit. Besides she is your friend.'  Dan almost had to 'force' Mikey to walk up the steps. At that time, Dan felt it was time for Mikey to have a little Muscle Growth in his arms,abs, and legs. But Dan wanted to go slowly on the muscle growth now.Maybe he could tell Mikey later his secret. Dan knew about Donna and felt that she could be a good ally even though Dan had no plans to make her a superjock with muscles all over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally they reached the front door. Dan focused on Mikey when Mikey was in a temporarily daze. Slowly small biceps appeared on Mikey's arms and his leg muscle grew a little bit too. And his abs was somewhat more defined but was not a 6 pack ab. But still it was not bad for someone Mikey's age. Then Dan rang the doorbell at the same time Mikey came out of his daze. Mikey felt stronger and wondered how that happened. He did suspect Dan had something to do with it. But Mikey said nothing about it. He felt that just having silver hair does not mean that he is an alien or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna opened the door and smiled broadly ' Hello, Mikey. Hey, I see that you brought a friend along. Come on inside. Then they walked inside.' Donna looked at Mikey and smiled ' I see that you have been working out a little. I am thinking about trying Judo again.' She gave him a gentle tap on Mikey's small but noticable bicep on his right arm. Mikey felt a bit embarrassed but still sort of liked the attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey said ' H-Hello D-Donna. this is my friend Dan.'  Then Dan and Donna shook hands. At that time, Dan knew that Donna could be a second prospect but not necessarily lots of muscle growth. Being an expert on Judo could be great too. Dan daydreamed about Donna someday being able to flip Caleb over her shoulders and shaming Caleb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan replied ' Good idea. Knowing Judo would be great for you. I know some martial arts.' Dan kicked his legs over his head--one leg at a time. Donna said 'Well, I have some scoliosis in my spine so I can't be that good.'  Dan looked at her ' Well, Yes you can.' First Dan greatly boosted Donna's determination and willpower to practice Judo and maybe another form of martial arts. Besides he knew that Mikey can't be everywhere. Then slowly and painlessly Dan straightened Donna's spine until it was normal. He smiled, knowing that she can be good soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sharing a few glasses of hot tea and chatting about school, friends, and soccer,  Donna smiled ' I am glad that I met your friend Dan, Mikey. Hope we all can be good friends. I think that I will try Judo again. I still have that Judo set of 6 DVDs that I bought.'  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan smiled. ' Let us do the first 30 minutes together. I could use some stretching myself.' So they turned on the tape which actually was a yoga stretching exercise.  After they finished it, they all felt relaxed. Donna said 'Well, I got some homework to do. Then I am going to do that Judo practice. It might come in handy soon.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Dan and Mikey left, Donna gave both Mikey and Dan a handshake and a hug. Just before Mikey and Dan left her house, Dan had to do ONE more thing, he instantly gave her training as if she already trained three weeks. In addition, Dan gave her a small small increase in her biceps..an one half inch increase. Her leg muscles was the same. Her abs was set to grow hard and become a solid 6 pack<b> within a month</b>...maybe more IF needed. But Dan didn't say anything to her. It just was going to be his gift to her. Dan had no desire to give her that much muscle growth. Just her abs was going to be really strong and hard <b>if</b> Caleb dared to punch her in the abs someday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile walking down the street, Dan looked at Mikey and smiled 'See, I told you that Donna likes you.'  Mikey wanted to agree but changed the subject. Mikey asked Dan where he wanted to go. He paused to think.. Then he replied...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The other kid already looked dressed and ready for the day, despite the fact that it was Saturday and most other kids liked to sleep in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you up so early?\" Mikey yawned loudly. They had spent most of the night playing with each other on Caleb's Xbox. While Mikey still felt like he needed four more hours of sleep, Xan was looking refreshed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I don't really need that much sleep, I'm always full of energy!\" Xan smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well unless you can share some of that with me, I'm going back to sleep.\" Mikey gave a big, loud yawn. \"G'night...\" He laid back down on his bed, fully intent on trying to go back to sleep when suddenly his drowsiness disappeared altogether and a bolt of adrenaline rushed through him. Suddenly he wasn't the slightest bit sleepy at all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, wake up, your mom has breakfast on the table already!\" Xan said as he threw the sheets off Mikey and tugged him out of bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the breakfast table, Caleb kept on looking over at Xan who sat across from him. He didn't know what the kid was planning, but he didn't trust him one bit. Caleb kept on expecting Xan to DO something, but the kid just sat there, eating his eggs and chatting with Mikey like some normal boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb was so focused on Xan that he failed to see that Xan was already making his move, but on Mikey. Mikey had always been so much shorter than Caleb so the big jock didn't even notice the extra inch on him. If he had been paying close attention, he would have seen that very slowly, so slowly it was almost unnoticeable, that Mikey was growing just a little bit bigger. Each bite of his breakfast seemed to convert itself into instant body mass, filling things out here, growing something there, very subtle growth all around. By the time Mikey had finished his plate, he had gained 4 and a half pounds of muscle and another quarter inch of height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as he wanted to stay and keep an eye on Xan, Caleb had practice to go to. He was tempted to skip it just so he can watch the kid, but he just couldn't...for some unexplained reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the reason was Xan. As he watched Caleb head off for practice, he grinned broadly. Now it was time for the fun to start!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Xan had already planned out the day, although Mikey had no idea what was going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the boys were doing the dishes and putting them away for Julie, the phone rang. Giovanni, one of the boys on Mikey's soccer team, was going to the park to kick the ball around, and he wanted to know if Mikey could come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey and Xan packed a small backpack with soccer clothes and shoes, along with their ball, towels and some extra cash while Julie went to work at the clothing store in the mall where she was a manager. This was a total blessing, since Mikey would be in need of bigger clothes, come very soon. Of course, nobody knew this, except Xan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Mikey and Xan left the house, Xan teleported the boys to Tom Brown Park, which was 3 miles up the road. This way, he spared them a fifteen-minute walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! How did we get here so fast?\" Mikey wondered, as soon as the boys walked through the main park entrance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We walk fast, dude!\" Xan smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they reached the soccer field, they put on their cleats. They were instantly greeted by Giovanni and Parker, who were also there. They had the entire soccer field to themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys kicked the ball around and ended up playing a small pick-up game. They ran up-and-down the field several times, chasing after the ball if not then chasing after whoever was dribbling the soccer ball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey had it easy. While running around on the soccer field, he felt his legs growing stronger and stronger. Xan's amazing powers were quietly working on him while Mikey was running up and down the field. His quads were getting more firm and filling out with muscle while his calves were getting harder and bigger. His abdominal muscles were becoming more defined as well. Not to mention his arms and chest. But his growth was just beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour of chasing the soccer ball on the soccer field, the boys were all hot, thirsty, sweaty and tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys,\" Giovanni suggested, \"Let's go for a swim in the pool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXan and Mikey immediately agreed, so they walked off the field and wandered over to the locker room, located by the public pool. The pool was just a few yards away from the soccer field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the boys had changed into their swimming trunks, they jumped into the pool and enjoyed another two hours of swimming, diving off the high diving board, playing water polo, and swimming under water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd while Mikey was using all the muscles in the water, Xan was making him grow even more muscular! Mikey's legs and arms were growing longer and thicker, bulging with muscles while the boy swam and kicked around in the water. Mikey climbed out of the pool several times and ran along the edge, just to jump back in. Every time he did that, his arms and legs grew bigger and more muscular. Added to the fact that Xan was quietly making Mikey grow an additional three inches taller that afternoon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Giovanni and Parker were picked up by their parents and taken home, Xan and Mikey decided to walk home as well. Again, Xan decided to shorten the walk, and to teleport the boys to about two houses before Miss Julie's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were walking past the neighbor's house, they spotted a delivery truck and several small boxes, which had been left by the front door. Mrs. Smith, the elderly lady who lived next door, had just signed for the delivery when the boys walked past the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Mrs. Smith!\" Mikey said to her, as he walked by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hi there, Mike!\" the lady said. She was obviously distressed, since the delivery man left her with a dozen boxes in front of her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you need a hand with those boxes, Mrs. Smith?\" Mikey asked her, as he stopped by the entrance to her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, that would be so nice of you!\" she said, as Mikey and Xan walked up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this is my friend Daniel!\" Mikey said to her, as he pointed to Xan. \"He's my friend from school. He's staying at my house for the next two weeks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXan and Mrs. Smith shook hands for a brief moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pleased to meet you, Mrs. Smith!\" Xan said politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the two boys walked to the stack of boxes and lifted them up. Xan only carried two boxes while Mikey managed to easily carry six boxes by stacking them up and lifting the bottom box with both hands!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys made two trips, with Mikey carrying almost everything on the second trip! His muscles were bulging with power!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the boys were done with their good deed, they walked back in the house where they decided to take turns in the shower. Xan let Mikey go first, since he was the most sweaty by far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Mikey got in the bathroom, he removed all his clothes. But, when he saw his reflection in the mirror, he was very surprised. Not only did he realize for the first time that he had gained several inches in height that day, but he had also gained a significant amount of muscle! His chest was hard and first, and his pectorals were already well shaped and defined. Abdominal muscles were already forming a nice washboard that resembled a six-pack. He was showing hard biceps on his arms and he had big, football-sized calves on his legs. He was becoming quite muscular, like a starting gymnast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" he whispered to himself. \"Where... Where did all those muscles suddenly come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe measured his height as well. He was now standing 5 foot 5 inches tall! he was 4 inches taller than Xan! Amazing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut his biggest concern was... What would Caleb say, when he came home from football practice?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Of course, being 6 foot 8 meant that Mikey still had a lot of catching up to do, but Caleb did get a little concerned. Wasn't 4 inches a lot for a boy to grow in just one day?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Caleb just walked up to the kitchen counter where Xan was making his sandwich and Mikey was making the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...

Mikey was already away as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be home early with a big surprise for you two boys! Now you two be good!\" Julie said to Mikey as she got up and walked over to Xan's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Daniel! You're such a good boy! I want you to stay with us!\" she whispered to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am!\" he replied politely. He already knew what was going to happen but for Mikey it was going to be a complete surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you two going to the pool today?\" Julie asked them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! We're going swimming all day!\" Mikey said impatiently. \"So, what's the surprise? Are you bringing pizza?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh the surprise is bigger than that!\" Julie grinned as she grabbed her bag and walked out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, the boys got up and had cereal for breakfast. Then, they put on their Speedos, they grabbed their towels and they put on sandals before heading over to the pool at the YMCA which was just a block from their house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they arrived there they just jumped in the pool and they splashed around in the water all morning and all afternoon long, jumping from the diving board and swimming around in the pool until they were dead tired and very hungry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Xan quietly added another two inches to Mikey, making the boy grow to 5 ft 7 inches tall and adding a little more muscle to him, in anticipation to the big announcement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening, when they were back at the house watching TV in the living room, Julie came home with Caleb, who had just returned from football practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb took time to shower and get dressed while Julie prepared and cut the slices of pizza for the two boys, who were starving. Then she sat down on the couch next to the two boys just as Caleb sat down on the big recliner in front of the TV set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an announcement to make!\" Julie said out loud. \"I spoke with Daniel's parents. They have been re-assigned to work in the Middle East for the State Department for the next ten years and they don't want to drag Daniel with them because of safety reasons. So, I spoke with an attorney and I have here Daniel's adoption papers, ready to sign! It went very quick and easy but as of now, Dan will be Mike's little brother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Mikey cheered out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say what?\" Caleb gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome!\" Xan said as he gave Mikey a big hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caleb! Daniel is now your little brother! He's not leaving anymore!\" Julie said with a huge smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? But... How... What???\" Caleb stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're brothers!\" Mikey cheered, as he almost started crying tears of joy as Caleb looked on in complete disbelief!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was going to happen next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mikey had some compassion on his older brother. Mikey turned to Xan and said ' We could let him play with the Xbox games and TV for a few days in his own room. It might help him settle down. Besides I could use the exercise.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXan nodded. He did feel a bit sorry for Caleb's crying and caused him to have a restful sleep and a pleasant dream about him being in Hawaii. So the crying quickly ended. But Xan had better plans for Mikey the next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following day in PE classes, Dan (Xan) and Mikey was standing with the rest of the PE class. The PE instructor marched up and down the floor. Mr Mansville barked liked a Sargent in the army. He shouted <b>' Let see how fit you 12 years old are.' </b>Then he sent each one through an obstacle course that was appropriate for their age group. Many of the boys struggled to make it through the course. A few could not even make it through. However there was 3 boys that made it through the course at that particular class. Finally it was Dan and Mikey's turn to do the course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe PE teacher shouted to Dan <b>' Your Time to Go- So Go!'</b> Dan ran through the course reasonably well. But naturally he was holding back his skills. He got a few High-Fives from a few of the boys. Now He was ready to help Mikey even more. Dan (Xan) decided to be careful on how he did his growth. He caused Mikey to grow another inch in height. Mikey's biceps grew a mere 1/2 inch this time. His legs muscles grew almost an inch more. Dan wanted the PE teacher to notice Mikey's skills. Maybe something could happen if he was impressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Mikey started running through the course. Everyone in the class was amazed at how well Mikey did.  Even though Mikey did NOT break the record in his 12 years old group. he did amazingly well. Even Mikey was pleasantly shocked at his increased strength. Yet he was worried about becoming a jerk like his brother Caleb. Suddenly he was determined not to be one. Everyone in the class shook Mikey's hand. Mikey was gracious to shake hands with each boy, even the weaker ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikey calmly said ' Hey, let all look after each other. We do not have to be pals with everyone.But we will be kind and nice to everyone. Middle School is tough already like it is. We can protect each other.'   The rest of the class listened carefully and nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan smiled, knowing that Mikey just made Middle School a better and happier place to attend school. After PE, Mr Manville was trying to get a wrestling team started and thought about Mikey. He felt that Mikey had potential but is totally inexperienced. Besides Mikey may or may not be interested.    - Meanwhile Mikey headed to Biology Class with Dan. Donna joined them, sitting next to Mikey. Donna sighed, saying that Biology is so hard. Mikey turned to hear saying \" I agree. I am just barely passing now with a C but it  is just going to get harder'</span></div></div>",

When Arnold's face responded by twisting ever so slightly with skepticism, an impish grin spread across the superior being's lips. \"You look puzzled. Don't you believe me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to be rude, sir,\" Arnold replied, pushing the rim of his glasses to the back of his nose, \"but frankly, would YOU believe you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXan stroked his chin thoughtfully and laughed, \"I think I like you.\" With a simple gesture, Arnold's textbook snapped through the air and into Xan's hand. \"Oh child, this material is beneath you,\" he said, browsing its pages with a disapproving shake of his head, \"I can sense your intellect. Why do you fear failure? You hold yourself up to such an irregular standard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnold blinked, his expression melting into an insulted smirk. \"Child?\" he scoffed, as if to point out Xan's own, even more youthful appearance, \"What would you know about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? You're going to doubt the intuitive capability of a being who appears at will and can take your property through telekinesis? Even a boy as logical as you, witnessing what you've just witnessed, must realize there's more to this earthly plane than meets the eye. I've demonstrated my power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnold considered this for a moment and gave a stiff shrug. \"Well, you do use big words...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take that as a good enough compromise! Well then,\" Xan said, smiling triumphantly, \"As I already said, friend, you have been chosen -- your days of meekness, at this very moment, end.  The spindly wimp before me shall become a lordly stud. But! Surely, a lad as well-versed as yourself in history knows there is no such thing as a free lunch. I do have conditions. Fortunately for you, my condition is in a way another blessing. There's a boy who's humiliated you, dominated you publicly, made you retreat into your books and studying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caleb,\" Arnold said, practically gritting his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Even then, Xan could sense Arnold's fury boiling, and he felt certain he'd chosen the right mark. \"I want you to visit upon him twice the humiliation he's shown you, in whatever manner you see fit. Get creative with it. Have fun. I'll be watching.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second!\" Arnold exclaimed, his skepticism suddenly all but vanished as he entertained the possibility of revenge, \"Why are you doing this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXan laughed as he started to fade away, \"Does it matter?\" And with that, he was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... My history book.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stared into the vacant air, Arnold considered the possibility, as any logical person would, that what he'd just experienced was either a dream or hallucination. He was too timid to try drugs, so that wasn't it, and he wasn't particularly exhausted by stress. Was he dreaming, then? He felt conscious. Was there a gas leak somewhere? After a moment of pondering this, he began to feel a warmth filling him, accompanied by something else. He'd helped his uncle move once, and the day after his unused muscles felt like they were on fire. This was like that, except instead of that painful, half-paralyzed stiffness, he felt surprisingly good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe top button on his black-and-white patterned shirt popped, causing Arnold to realize just how tight his clothes had become. Could the puckish creature's promise be real? Quickly, he moved to undo the rest of his buttons before his shirt was ruined, when to his amazement he spied something he never thought he'd see through the plain white undershirt beneath -- definition. What had been a boring plateau of pale skin now gave way to the early formations of what were undoubtedly very real pectoral muscles. \"No way...\" he gasped, running his fingers along the newly tightened abdominals forming before his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnold's typical height of 5'8\" fostered an envy in him toward the much more admired and successful sports players in school. Not only was he suddenly among their stature, he was on the verge of surpassing the tallest of them! With a giddy laugh, he lifted up his shirt to witness first-hand the changes. His pressed khakis conformed to the bulging muscles in his thighs, and were certain to give if his growth continued. Nearing 7', the former nerd was, to say the least, as studly as Xan said he'd be. Arnold had always had bookish good looks, but for the first time in his youth, he could honestly say he was smoking hot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is really me,\" Arnold mused aloud. Even his voice startled him, an octave deeper and full of something he'd sincerely lacked: confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXan's promise fulfilled, Arnold knew he had a responsibility of his own to follow through on.  The next day at school could not come soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He sacked the quarterback 3 times, intercepted the ball once, and forced 4 fumbles. He even returned once for a touchdown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb imagined of several colleges wanting to recruit him with a full scholarship. Today, he arrived home and threw his jacket on the floor. Rebecca frowned at him and replied ' Pick up that jacket.  At least hang it up over your chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb was not looking at his mom at that moment. ' Ah, Mom, Lifting a jacket is not that HARD for you to do.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca smiled ' Maybe not, but I probably can out-lift you in weights. Since we are not near a gym, why don't we arm-wrestle? Loser will clean the kitchen this afternoon. Winner will choose what to eat tonight.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb mocked his Mom. ' Ah, Mom, You know that I am much Stronger than.\u2026\u2019  At that moment, Caleb's eyes realized that his mom did look much stronger than any normal person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mom, Rebecca,  then smiled sweetly at Caleb.  She toyed with her brownish hair. ' Come on, Son. Try arm wrestling me.'<br>\r\nCaleb gulped at first. Then he said ' Well, I have experience in arm wrestling and in resisting pain. You are a rookie. Prepare to lose, mommy.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went out in the back porch and laid on the soft grass. Rebecca became much more confident in herself. Caleb still was stubborn and determined to win anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got into the starting position. Each one's eyes stared at the other one's eyes. They waiting until the timer buzzed. Then the match began.<br>\r\nCaleb tried pulling down his mom's arm with all the power he had in him. But he was not able to move it. Meanwhile his mom was humming a melody from the musical 'Sound of Music.'.  She looked at her son, Caleb, after she finished. She said ' Tired yet.' <br>\r\nCaleb shook his head and growled. Sighing out of boredom, she brought Caleb's arm down halfway.<br>\r\n Then he was beginning to tire. At that moment, Mickey the younger brother walked Mickey gasped at amazement and admiration at his buff looking mom. He replied ' Wow, Mom, awesome muscles! '<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled and said ' Well,it is time for me to win.' and she slowly brought Caleb's arm down slowly just for dramatic purposes. Caleb was furious at being humiliated by his mom in front of his younger brother. And his arm was so sore too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMickey gave his mom a big hug and a kiss on the cheek. Caleb stared at his mom in frustration. After a minute of deciding what to day.he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was shocked how buff his mom became.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let loose slightly and sweetly replied ' Are you gong to clean the kitchen or not.. It should not take long for a strong boy like you. The cleaning materials are under the sink. It should take maybe 20 minutes at most.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb started to shake his head  NO but thought the best of it. Slowly he started cleaning it.

She flexed.\"If it takes more than 25 minutes, be prepared to face the consequences.'  She flexed again.  Caleb wanted to feel it but his mom sternly said NO. GET TO WORK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn terror, Caleb started working quickly cleaning the kitchen. At the corner of his eye, Caleb noticed that his younger brother was allowed to touch his mom's biceps. Caleb was angry but too scared to stop working. After all, he loved her chocolate pie. He managed to clean the kitchen in 20 minutes. So he was able to get a piece of chocolate pie after  supper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Caleb was fuming that night. Around 2 AM. Caleb tried sneaking out of the house to go somewhere.</span></div></div>",

And he felt that something was not right. He couldn't describe the sensation, so he just shrugged and went to get ready for school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at school he felt again that strange sensation, especially when he was near somebody. Again, the shrugged off the sensation: why bother about it when you are the alpha? Maybe it was only envy. He was the biggest and most muscular one; everybody should be envy of him.<br>\r\nWithout thinking anymore about that, he went on and then returned home, after a stop to the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut during the week this strange sensation was always there, around him like an aura. Every time, when he was near somebody he could feel it there, stronger and stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensation he was feeling was the start of Xan's revenge. He was proud being the biggest one? Not anymore. Xan was literally enlarging humankind, making it taller. Everybody, except Caleb. He started slow, less than an inch per day. After a week, everybody would 6 inches taller, then 1 foot, 2 feet and so on, till Caleb changes his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a week, Caleb noticed (finally) these changes; he wasn't towering as usual above his family: his father was 6'1, his mother 5'11, and his little bratty brother 5'6. He was still the bigger one, but the size disparity was reducing quite fast. Even at school he wasn't the biggest anymore: there were some students taller than him, reaching and surpassing 7 feet mark in height, his girlfriend was as tall as him. The shortest one was a 6'3 student. Now the average height in the US was 6'4, Caleb now was a perfect average student.<br>\r\nThe strangest thing was that anybody wasn't noticing anything. He hoped this growth thing end soon. He couldn't bear the idea of becoming the smallest one ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for him, he was only the beginning. Xan made the growth accelerate: now everybody would grow more than an inch per day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third day after the \"growth-acceleration\", Caleb saw his fear come real. Now his father was taller (again) than him at 6'6.The fifth day, it was his mother's turn to surpass him, and the seventh day his stupid brother became 6'6. Now he was the shortest one his family.<br>\r\nAt school it was even worse. With the average height of 7'4 in US, Caleb became the dwarf of the school. There were lots of students already 8 feet tall and taller, his girlfriend now stood 7'5. Even the principal, a really short woman now stood 6'6. And still nobody didn't notice anything. everything was changing too to accommodate this bigger beings.<br>\r\nWhen he tried to talk with his girlfriend about it, he only received a hug and a kiss on his head. \"You shouldn't feel ashamed about your height Caleb, I love you just the way you are\". He noticed that everybody was friendlier with him, maybe because they were feeling pity about his short stature?<br>\r\nAt the end of the week His father was 7'1, his mother 6'11 and his brother 6'6. Why was it happening to him? Now he couldn't do anything, he had to obey again to his parents rules, like making breakfast for himself, wash dishes sometimes after meals. His girlfriend was becoming more dominant, deciding everything about their sexual life and everything else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was losing every bit of power he had. The only thing remaining bigger than usual was his muscles. At the gym he as still going strong, lifting more than some 7'7 guys. They started calling him \"Mini-Arnold\", he was hating it, but could let himself lose that small respect he still had in the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXan was quite pleased about it, but now? Caleb was still showing resistance, especially because he was muscular. Maybe he could change even that.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But other things were different: the door was bigger, at least 12 feet; not only taller but way wider, like made to fit two \"before changes\" bodybuilders together. his trophies disappeared totally, all his workout gear gone.<br>\r\n\"What the fuck? Mom where are you?\" Shouted Caleb, maybe his mom could help about this, even that he was scared to see her even bigger.<br>\r\n\"Coming! Don't shout or you'll wake up your brother!!\" Better follow that advice, Now that he was the bigger one, he should be really careful; his parents could be understanding, his brother not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile waiting, he pepped outside his room and received a really big shock: in his parents room he saw an enormous man, dressed in a really stretched business-suit. It was stretched not only because he was 10 feet tall or more, but he was fucking muscular! His back was filled with muscles, his lats were pushing outside enormous arms, his thighs like oak trunks (and the left one was slight bigger, why?).<br>\r\nCaleb was going to piss himself if not for a female voice calling behind him<br>\r\n\"I'm here honey, what do you need?\" Turning around, he saw in front of a 10-pack, with equally hard obliques, jutting out for an inch; looking down, he saw enormous legs, with muscles fighting for space. Afraid of look up, and when he did it he saw only boobs, big ones; perky and going out for half a foot, threatening to destroy the small top holding them. He couldn't speak.<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you all right?\" Said his mother, while lowering herself, to let her son looking right at her face.<br>\r\nThis enormous being was his mother? It was too much, he fainted and pissed himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Xan was having the time of his life. It was too much fun!!! He was quite a good thing losing the bet. Caleb was so easy to torment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Caleb woke up, hoping that it was only a worse nightmares than usual. It wasn't.<br>\r\nIn front of him there was his family and his girlfriend. His father was the businessman he already saw before, 10'1 feet tall; her mother was 9'11; his younger brother (little wasn't appropriate now) 9'6. His girlfriend was the biggest, 10'5. Like his parents, everybody was freaking muscular. That's why everything was a lot bigger and wider. He noticed also a thing about their clothing. Everything they wore was super stretchy, ready to burst open; maybe made intentionally to show the muscles underneath them.<br>\r\nEverybody was concerned about him, except his brother, looking at him with a mocking grin.<br>\r\n\"Are you ok?\" Asked his mother. \"I fell fine, what happened?\"<br>\r\n\"You're weak as usual, bug bro\" started Mickey, his brother \" you can't stand the view of our bodies, and wondering why you are so small and useless\" Caleb was going to cry \" There were the same things he said to the others when he was so proud about his muscles and size. Now he lost everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't talk like that you jerk, it's my boyfriend you're talking about!\" Cindy, Caleb's girlfriend, replied while giving him a jack hammer slap. But she apologized: \"Sorry Mr&amp;Mrs Johnson, I overreacted\"<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about that, he deserved it\" replied gently his mom \"and besides, you give better slaps. you are more muscular than my small 35-inch biceps\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Small?\" Caleb couldn't believe it. Her mother was small? So the rest of the world?<br>\r\nLater, Caleb recovered totally, but discovered that now he wasn't going to school anymore because of the bullies, and also because sometimes other students were knocking out while walking because of his small stature; And also everybody was naturally this big. Gyms, exercise equipment never existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb was desperate,now he was an useless piece of the society now, even though his parents and girlfriend were trying to help him and cheer him up.<br>\r\nHe was really depressed. and thought of finishing his life.<br>\r\nOne night, he managed to get a knife; at midnight, he was going to kill when Xan appeared.<br>\r\n\"This is not what I wanted!\" while making disappear the knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's going to happen now?</span></div></div>",

Trying to resist because you were still strong, and then you weren't considered strong anymore. But now It went too far, and seeing that you were trying to kill yourself Is enough to make me stop messing with you. I'm not an evil interdimensional being.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, now you're gonna make everything back to normal?\" Caleb was felling happy; the nightmare has come to an end.<br>\r\n\"Back? This is normal now. I said I will stop to mess with you; It means that I will not touch anything else.\" Replied Xan with a smirk.<br>\r\nThis for Caleb was like being shot, stabbed, punched in the balls; all together: an eternal life reduced like a inferior being? He was surely joking.<br>\r\n\"I never joke about that. Don't worry, you'll be fine. I will made sure that your girlfriend will always be loyal to you. And also don 't even think about suicide; every attempt will be vain.\" With these words, Xan vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb remained some moment still like a statue, processing what he has just heard. Forever like this, a dwarf in a society of bodybuilder giants? He fell down, and started crying freely.<br>\r\n\"Please\" he started talking to Xan like he was still with him between sobs \"I don't want to remain like this, I am a doll in the hands of my family. I understood my mistakes, I must respect everybody and don't judge anybody by size. I will do anything; please, make reality return to normal, I will do anything. I am completely honest, I'm not bribing you.\"<br>\r\nSeeing that It wasn't happening anything, Caleb tried again to kill himself: The knife morphed in a flower while it was touching his chest.<br>\r\nAt the end, Caleb could only go to bed, trying to sleep and preparing himself for his life as a dwarf.<br>\r\nFortunately for him, Xan was listening to him. Feeling his honest change of heart, he reconsidered his previous statement: \"after all, I've made my point; let's make him a bit happy, but I make sure he will remember about this experience and also he will never go back to his old behavior\" And he started again making the final changes to Caleb's reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext day, Caleb woke up sad, remembering Xan's words of yesterday night.<br>\r\nBut when he got up from the bed, he felt that again something was different: looking around, he saw that his trophies were back (some was missing thought), his workout gear was back, and the doors was back to normal size.<br>\r\nIt was a good sight! Xan listened to his pleas and return everything back to normal. He was so happy, that he failed to noticed that his photos of family and friends weren't back to normal, but he was going to discover these differences soon.<br>\r\nOn his desk, he found a note from Xan. \"Yesterday night you showed me that you were really sorry, so I've returned everything to normal. Well, quite everything. You still need some reminder about what I can do. Farewell, my lost bet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything back to normal? Caleb was too happy. He rushed down to the kitchen, happy to be again the bigger one, and found the first reminder: his mother. She wasn't back to normal; smaller then the 10 ft behemoth he saw yesterday, but stil really big. Xan gave him mentally her measurements:<br>\r\n6'5 feet tall, 270 pounds of muscles,big boobs jutting out for a foot thanks also to her meaty pecs, 22 inch biceps, 8-pack, etc... She was as tall as Caleb but wider (and bustier). Caleb stopped in front of her, frozen-like. Her mother, unsure about what to do, went near him and touched his hand \"Are you alright? It seems you saw a ghost\"<br>\r\nRecovering from the surprise, Caleb hugged her without saying anything. He didn't care that her mother was a bit bigger. Surprised, her mother returned his hug: \" ok, big guy, what do you need?\" \"Nothing mom, just wanna hug you for a bit\" \"Well, that's a new thing, But I'm not complaining\". The hug lasted for some minutes, and they were interrupted by Mickey, Caleb's brother and second reminder.<br>\r\nNow Caleb's brother was 6'4, and 200 pounds, smaller than Caleb for now, because Mickey Was going through puberty (a fierce one, said Xan) and he was still growing ( probably he will reach 7'3 and more than 350 pounds of muscles, he will be the biggest bodybuilder ever).<br>\r\n\"Aww, big bro needs some affection? so cute\" But Caleb didn't react, he resisted the temptation, and started eating breakfast made by her mom. It was time for the third reminder: his dad.<br>\r\nHe was 6'8 feet tall, 230 pounds and fit like an Olympic swimmer, with something really (REALLY) big stuffed in his underwear (gotta keep your mother happy, said Xan). But Caleb didn't care anymore. Better having 6'9 parents than 10 feet tall ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast, he went to school to find his final reminders: his girlfriend and his friends.<br>\r\nIt seemed that all his friends received a big increase in muscle mass; some of them, even if shorter than him, were outlifting him with ease. And now he was the second tallest of his group.<br>\r\nXan made a new friend for Caleb: He was Samuel, the nerdy, scrawny kid always bullied by Caleb. He still had the nerd face, but now that face was put on a 6'9 feet tall, 290 pounds iper-muscular body, with something really big in his underwear, like his father.<br>\r\nAlso everybody at school was 2 inches taller and fitter, but his girlfriend was obviously different.<br>\r\nShe was 7'5 feet tall (jokingly called Sequoia girl at school), 300 pounds of muscles, 25 inch biceps, shoulder so big that Caleb could sit on them, wide lats pushing her arms out, 8 rock hard abs, meaty thigh bigger than Caleb's torso, enormous calves. She was virtually fat-free, except the two heavy, perky orbs that were her boobs, so big that when she was hugging Caleb, they engulfed his head, making it disappear. She still had the proportion and the grace of a female, only enlarged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to these reminders (after a month Mickey was already bigger than him), Caleb continued his life without bullying anymore, helping people, and becoming the guy Xan bet him to be in the past.</span></div></div>",

Mikey was about 12 and was super  thin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, that's what Caleb had thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Caleb went downstairs he saw rather large replicas of all his furniture. \"The hell is this..\" he said to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know mom hates it when you cuss.\" a voice boomed from across the room. Caleb turned to see his once little brother eating ceral at the table. Mikey was now literally twice Caleb's size. Mikey was 13 feet tall now, and each of his muscles were double what Caleb's were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mikey? What the hell happened to you?\" Caleb stammered. \"Don't cuss! And I don't know what you're talking about. Nothing's any different that it was yesterday.\" \"But you're so...big!\" \"No. I'm normal for my age. Besides, if anyone in this house is at a wierd height for their age it's you, shorty!\" Mikey laughed as he spoke. \"Anyways, I'm done with breakfast now. Drive me to school! I've already got the phonebooks set up so you can see over the steering wheel, shorty!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb was shocked. This was all normal? It sure as hell wasn't yesterday. Did that Xan guy really do something to his life? If so, then Caleb's life was truely about to become a living hell.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Caleb briefly considered rummaging through the ground level cabinets for breakfast until he heard Mikey smack the car horn outside and realized he had no appetite or time for it anyway. He got his notably heavier book bag and went to the car, wondering how on Earth he was going to drive them to school if the car was proportionally over-sized as everything else in his imposing new world, and when he found out, it was almost as much a surprise as his initial take of this world had been. Almost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA half-dozen small but thick books had been crudely tied in a stack to each of the pedals, with several more on the seat as height-boosters. Caleb\u2019s brother looked at him expectantly from across the driver\u2019s seat in the passenger\u2019s side, waiting for him to jump up and be the chauffeur. Caleb slowly did so, climbing up a stack including Ivanhoe and War And Peace to sit on a few encyclopedia volumes, but all Caleb could think blankly for ten straight seconds was that there was no way this could possibly work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, it <i>did</i> work, but even as he pulled in to the parking lot between their respective schools and his brother bailed out with a glancing \u201cbye,\u201d he couldn\u2019t have said how. It was like some instinct had driven him to go through the motions naturally, no pun intended. He\u2019d had no trouble navigating the wheel twice the size of a hula hoop or the turn signal the length of a walking stick. Even as he\u2019d pushed down abnormally hard on the books to break and accelerate, he still found the feeling strangely familiar.  That worried him, but Caleb eventually put it out of his mind- he\u2019d think about it later. He didn\u2019t want to get comfy in this world as a runt.<br>\r\nHe needed to talk to someone about it, and the one he wanted to talk to the most right now was his girlfriend and lover, Karen. He walked through the teeming mass of tall people, trying to ignore a couple of rude snickers, comments and glances from the 17-foot monsters, and found her right where her usual clique resided before the first bell, just beside and outside the front doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had never looked so sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer uniform had always had a way of accentuating her chest with admirable detail, but the creature she had become was another matter entirely. Her arms and calves were toned to a perfect balance, being defined and well-developed without being over-sized or bulky. Her thighs stood out as strong and broad without being overblown, and a modest set of abs could be seen with a squint through the rather thin school-mandated uniform shirt- all of which were accompanied by an IMmodestly huge, perky, athletic set of breasts. If they hadn\u2019t been on a body with such astounding musculature, Caleb would\u2019ve said they looked like they were too large to carry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was hanging out with several other Amazonian girls Caleb recognized only by face. One of them pointed Caleb out to Karen. (This girl seemed to make a comment of which Caleb didn't hear much, only  \"...looking at you.\") When it became clear she couldn't ignore you without being rude, she turned and gave an awkward grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Can I help you with something?\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, Karen. Do you remember me?\"<br>\r\n\"Pardon me, but is there some reason I should? And how do you know my name?\"<br>\r\nCaleb's smile faltered. \"Yeah... I'm Caleb. I'm your boyfriend, we were going out.\"<br>\r\nKaren's little clique of girlfriends burst into tittering, stifled giggles at this. Karen herself had a little more poise, and she covered her mouth as she huffed out a quick chuckle. Then she saw how seriously Caleb was looking at her.<br>\r\n\"Look... ah, Caleb? I'm sorry, but I think I'd remember going out with you. You kind of... <i>stand out</i>.\"<br>\r\nAt this, the Karen's giggling friends gave up on subtlety and burst into full laughter. Caleb's heart sunk in his chest. Comments about an inter-dimensional being changing reality around him weren't going to exactly bolster trust.<br>\r\n\"Look, Karen... I know this is weird. I get it. But you've gotta believe me- up until last night, when the\u2026 when things changed, we were dating, and I can prove-\"<br>\r\nBRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRING! At that point, the bell went off for first class. Karen's posse gave their scattered goodbyes while Karen tossed her backpack over her shoulder.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Caleb, but I gotta go.\"<br>\r\n\"No- wait!\"<br>\r\nAlready, those long legs of hers were striding away. Other people were crossing his field of vision, their sizable bulks and overblown statures cutting him off. He was about to lose her. Caleb called out in desperation.<br>\r\n\"You were born, August 22, 1997! You have two brothers who drive you nuts, one older, one younger- Aaron can\u2019t act his age, and Jacob can\u2019t stop!\u201d<br>\r\nThe crowd was dispersing. Caleb saw that she had stopped. His heart lifted- had he gotten through to her?<br>\r\n\u201cYou have a tiny cluster of moles under your right armpit that look like Mickey Mouse.\u201d<br>\r\nShe had turned around. She was coming back towards him. Caleb closed his eyes and released a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n\u201cYou have an interest in-\u201c<br>\r\nBOOM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt happened in an instant. Caleb didn\u2019t even see the motions. One second, he had been calming himself down, the next, his feet were off the ground, his back was against the lockers, and he was struggling to breathe. Karen had grabbed him around the neck, lifted him off the ground, and pinned him against the wall, all with one hand. Caleb was looking down her powerfully built arm at a face that was clearly not amused. Those strong, beautiful muscles of hers suddenly looked a lot less attractive and a lot more dangerous.<br>\r\n\"Listen here, you creepy little midget. I don't know how you know those things, but if you've been stalking me, I suggest you drop it. If I catch you spying on me again, I'm going to make you pay for it, and I don't mean in cash.\"<br>\r\nAnd in another instant, her grip was released, and Caleb collapsed, confused and gasping, on the over-sized checkerboard tile floor. Karen quickly strode away through the emptied hallway without a backwards glance, leaving Caleb to his thoughts.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sitting up, he rubbed the sand out his eyes and looked around, trying to figure out what made him think that. As far as his eyes could tell him, everything was pretty much the same. All of his stuff was still there, his weights, his posters, his shelves full of trophies and photos. But something still felt...different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caleb, Mikey, breakfast is ready!\" Caleb's mom called from downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb shook his head, jumping out of bed to get ready for the day. It was probably just some figment of his imagination, like how he his mind made him think that some kid could appear and disappear in his room in the blink of an eye. As he got dressed, however, that feeling that something was off returned, however the rumbling in his stomach made him push it out of his mind. Maybe if he got some food in him he wouldn't be thinking that something is wrong when it's not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Caleb got downstairs and walked into the kitchen, he was greeted by a table loaded with food. There was at least twice as many food as usual, piled high and pipping hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa mom, why did you cook so much? You really went all out today.\" Caleb said as he sat in his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about, it takes a lot of food to feed you growing boys, especially your brother.\" Caleb's mom said as she set down the carton of orange juice on the table. \"Cooking food for you both feels like another full time job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, it's not like the shrimp is gonna grow much.\" Caleb laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Caleb felt himself get lifted into the air, something big and hard wrapping itself around his neck and crushing his windpipe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who is the shrimp around here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb's eyes bulged out even more. His little brother, who used to be half his size, now towered over him. The hard thing that was crushing his neck was Mikey's now thick and muscular arm! Caleb tried to break free, but Mikey held him tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like someone needs to be taught a lesson about whose the big man around here!\" Mikey laughed as he noogied Caleb, messing up his \"older\" brother's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mikey, put him down and eat breakfast.\" Their mom said with a sigh. \"Just because you're bigger doesn't mean you have to torture him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes mom.\" Mikey dropped Caleb onto the floor. Caleb gasped as he finally got a good look at his brother. Mikey had somehow grown into a giant! He stood 6'8\" tall and with the biggest muscles he had ever seen, even bigger than the bodybuilders in his magazines! His arms filled the sleeves of the puny shirt he was wearing, though those shirts must've been 3-4XL! He must've weighed 320 lbs, and yet looking at the veins that pulsed underneath the skin Caleb had to say there wasn't much fat on him, if there were any! his pecs jutted out half a foot from his chest, and his jeans were so tight that Caleb could see every head of those massive tree trunk quads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mikey, how the hell did you grow so big!?\" Caleb asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ate my wheaties and lifted.\" Mikey grinned as he flexed his arm. The huge bicep swelled bigger and bigger until riiiiiiip the sleeve tore apart to make room for the 25 inch gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mikey! How many times have I told you not to rip your clothes!\" Their mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry mom, it's hard when I just keep on growing!\" Mikey laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb looked between his mom and his huge not-so-little brother. Why was his mom acting so normal? From what he was hearing, it was as if Mikey was always this big!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Caleb realized what gave him that uncomfortable feeling that morning. His room, even though looked the same, wasn't. His weights were smaller and worn out, his posters were all torn and messed up and his trophies...now that he thought about it, there seemed to be a lot less. And his clothes...looking down, Caleb discovered that instead of his usual tight fitting muscle tees and jeans he was wearing baggier clothes, and Caleb recognized the pattern on the shirt as Mikey's, yet supersized! he was wearing Mikey's old clothes, but somehow, they were all made for the new, bigger Mikey!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs impossible as it seemed, Caleb was now in a reality where he was no longer the \"bigger\" brother, but Mikey was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So many question that were solved with Mikey's \"You're right Dad. Sorry mom\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad?? This revelation exploded in his mind like a grenade. And how big is he?<br>\r\nAfter a moment, he had his answer: Freaking enormous!! At least 7'3, 400 pound of rock hard muscles, making the floor shook when walking, he has become an Adonis in one night, thanks to Xan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing and crouching into the kitchen, dressed only with underwear that were struggling to keep his enormous cock in place, their father Stan made his appearance \"morning kids!!\" giving a friendly slap at the son's shoulders (destroying Caleb's one) \"and good morning to my sunshine\" lifting and kissing his minute wife (mom is 5'1 tall). Quite a comical picture. \"Hi honey\" said mom \"Slept well? Did you already showered after work-out? Didn't hear you\". \"Sometimes even a big man like me can be as silent as a ninja\", replied my father laughing while mimicking one.<br>\r\n\"Work-out went well dad?\" Asked Mickey \"Sure did!, see for yourself\" Said Stan while doing some poses. His body exploded with muscles and making him even more imposing. Shoulders so big that \"enlarged\" Mickey could sit on them with ease, biceps at least 30 inches at rest exploded into 35 inch mountains, 10-pack abs, legs as big as Caleb's torso, bulging hearts calves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb was really scared. Xan was really intentional about making him pay, and probably this was only the beginning. While he was musing about his future his dad sit next to him (with a reinforced chair). \"So Caleb, how are going the workouts?, made some progresses?\" asked his dad quite nicely.\" Why do you care dad\" said Mickey \"He will NEVER be as big as us!!\" while flexing his mighty biceps. \"First of all, I'm the bigger one here, and you have to at least reach my level before saying those things; and more important, show respect to your brother! One of the most important thing I want from both of you is to give the best in any circumstances\" said Stan counterattacking with a flex of his mightier biceps \" I don't care if he won't become as big as me, I still want him to be the best\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, Dad was defending him, It never happened before. Well, before this events. Maybe because now he was the shortest one, except his mother.<br>\r\n\"Give me one second and you'll have to think again\" popped a voice in Caleb's head.<br>\r\n\"NO!

She seemed a copy of Mickey's body and muscles, only a little taller, wider with boobs. She was wearing only a minuscule bikini to show her \"hard-worked\" body. Her hair were really lustrous, golden with some parts so clear they seemed white (like Xan), and her skin cleared a lot; she was nearly perfect. Obviously she didn't react to her transformation, for her perspective she was always huge like that, and now she was pissed against Mickey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really Mickey, you're talking about who is the bigger one?

But as soon as he left the house he bumped into a strange pillar. Looking up he saw his \"little\" brother Mickey staring down at him standing at no inch shorter than 15 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked from this change, Caleb looked around only to see that the door of his house was now about 20 feet high and there was a small door next to it that almost looked like a dog flap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Caleb felt a impact on his back as he was forced on the ground. <b>\"I thought I told you that you should whatch where you are going you little runt.\"</b> Mickey said as he lifted Caleb up with just one hand. 15 feet above the ground Mickey was now fully in control of his once taller brother. <b>\"You\u00b4re so pathetic! Not even as tall as our three year old cousin. And I don\u00b4t think you could even lift my bar without any added weights.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was when it hit Caleb. As the universe got buffer and buffer Calebs body got slimmer because in this universe he didn\u00b4t have the chance to train his body.<br>\r\nMickey let go of Caleb and he landed on the warm asphalt in front of the door.<br>\r\n<b>\"Now f*ck off or I\u00b4m gonna use you as a sweat rag again like I did yesterday you insignificant bug.\"</b> Caleb didn\u00b4t wait any longer because at this hight, he knew that his brother could do exactly what he was threatening him with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfraid of what this day would look like if Caleb went to school he climbed back through the dog flap and pulled himself up the stairs just to find himself standing in front of a wall where his bedroom door once was. Caleb went down the stairs again just to encounter his dad standing at 18'3 leaning on the kitchen counter, drinking a cup of coffee and reading the news.<br>\r\nShocked because of the stature of his now more than 3-times-his-size father but nonetheless Caleb approached his dad and asked <b>\"Where did my bedroom go?\"</b><br>\r\nYour enormous father turned around, his left leg sending you straight to the ground of the kitchen floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Sorry didn\u00b4t see you there Caleb. What do you mean with \"Where is my bed room\"? Since you didn\u00b4t grow up to be even 10 feet tall we decided that you should have your room on the ground floor where the old storeroom was at.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Oh right, sorry I totally forgot, hehe.\"</b> Caleb stated and ran through the kitchen as he felt two big fingers lifting him up by grabbing his hoddie. Now dangling at a dangerous hight, Calebs dad says.....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While Mikey ate his breakfast, something happened:<br>\r\nA young, boy-like face appeared at the window smiling mischievous at Caleb. he didn\u00b4t believe his eyes: It was Xan! Caleb realized that he has a big problem, and Xan nods, because all powerful he is, he read Calebs mind. Soon after that he disappeared, but before that he touches mikey on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaleb sat there as if he were frozen, his eyes posted on his \"little\" brother. Then it happened: Mikey grew larger, he gained several inches in height, letting the 7 ft. mark far behind, his muscles swelled, giving Mikey several pounds extra. When he finished breakfast, he stood up and Caleb sees, how godlike his brother has become:<br>\r\nAt a height of 8\"7\u00b4 and a eight of easily 400 pounds, Mikey looked like a human wrecking-ball! His arms looked like watermelons, they could easily have 38 inches around, and his pecs are each one as broad as Calebs shoulders. But somehow his clothes still fit him. Somehow Xan made them bigger, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Mikey realized, what has happened to him, and grinned from ear to ear. As he walked towards Caleb, he felt so mighty, so strong, like he is invincible and no one could harm him in any way. Caleb on the other side felt like he was puny and weak, and his fear became stronger with every step of this monster of brother towards him.<br>\r\nXan got his revenge, Caleb thought, and at this moment, a little spark appeared next to him and said: \"So, Caleb, here is a little foretaste of the things that will happen in near future.What could I do else? Aaaaaaahhh! I have an idea,... \"</span></div></div>",
