            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the middle of the night, a bright flash suddenly engulfed the world and everybody on earth shrunk down to mere inches.<br>\r\nNow, they are desperately trying to adapt to this new, gargantuan world. But it has only been hours - most people cower in their homes, waiting for salvation. Some are convinced, that this is a dream and they only have to wait until they wake up to their normal lives. Some haven't even noticed, still sleeping in their beds, oblivious to their new lifes. And only very few have ventured out to find help. Somewhere out there had to be someone still at their original size. Someone, who could help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they are right. Someone has only just woken up - completely their normal self. The only strange thing they note, as they get ready for the day, is the extraordinary quiet street. Normally, the noise of cars and trucks going by wakes them up way earlier.<br>\r\nWashing their face is the last thing they do before they dress themsleves, ready to tackle their work. A final look in the mirror shows:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>July Hall:</b><br>\r\nJuly is a college student, studying english literature. Despite the stuffy subject, she has always been known as a party girl, much to the chagrin of her roommates. Even more annoying to them were her constant dates which she always brought home for a night or two - quickly forgetting most of them. It was easy for her. She had looks most other girls would kill for. Long, blond hair falls down towards her slim waist, and her shirts always look a little too tight for her chest.<br>\r\nJuly is outgoing and friendly, though she does have a knack for drunken mischief. She likes pranking her roommates or even introducing herself to new people with one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Nadja Price:</b><br>\r\nNadja is a friendly, but shy woman. She has always been known to be kind of a nerd, something that her shelf full of comicbooks doesn't exactly disprove. While other people go out, she likes to stay in with her computer or watch the latest blockbuster. Which is a shame - cause she would be a hit with the men. Her butt seems to have a magnetizing power, drawing looks everywhere she goes.<br>\r\nThough she might seem kind of aloof and beyond reproach, the people close to her know better. Nadja is probably the kindest woman you could ever meet. She's always ready to help someone out. She loves to take care of pets - which is why she studied to become a veterinarian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Lee June:</b><br>\r\nDuring the day, Lee works customer service for a tech company. Of course, she hates the job, just barely less than the callers. But recently, she has found a profitable way to relieve some stress. To supplement her income, she streams very adult material of herself to a camsite. In only a short amount of time, she has become one of the most viewed streamers on the site - not least because of her enormous curves. Her breasts are gigantic, as is her butt. She gets daily messages from 'fans', begging her to smother them. She quite likes the attention.<br>\r\nDespite her occupation, she is mostly a reserved and quiet woman, and very helpful once you get to know her. Though the stress of her dayjob is getting to her. And the usual relief isn't quite cutting it, anymore...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Roxanne Watkins:</b><br>\r\nRoxanne is a rich girl. THE rich girl. Her parents passed away a while ago - not that she cared much - leaving her with the wealth of multiple generations, all for herself. She never had to work a day in her life. But despite the stereotype, she was smarter than anyone else in her class. She coasted through school and then through college, getting a degree in physics and mathematics without much difficulty. Not in need for a job, she spends her days either at her enormous townhouse or one of her many apartments, scattered throughout the worlds largest cities.<br>\r\nSadly it seems like her wealth has replaced her empathy. She barely related to any of her classmates, viewing them as beneath her. Sometimes, she was outright cruel if she wasn't left alone. Not even boys interested her all that much - though she wasn't lacking attention on their part. She simply didn't want someone talking back at her...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>July's head was still pounding. Maybe she overdid it last night - or rather, the last few days.She moaned, while she brushed her teeth. The afternoon sun was just way to bright for her right now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was summer, and college was on break. Finally! Though July loved reading, she rarely found time for it during vacation. Because that was the time to live out her wild side! July always knew about the biggest events in the city and almost every evening, she went to a bar, a club, or a festival, partying until the sun was rising. The days she spent sleeping off her stupor, before she readied herself again for the next party. Her roommates, Jessie and Sandra couldn't grasp, how much energy she had. Sometimes it seemed, like all she needed to survive was a wild dance, an even wilder drink, and, of course, a date for the night. Though her roommates were by no means prudes, they sometimes got annoyed at July's libido - particularly when it got in the way of her other plans. Though it didn't happen as often anymore, there were still occasions where July would abandon plans she made to visit one of her 'boys', as Jessie called them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, and after a few glasses of water, July's hangover abated somewhat. To greet the summer sun, she had put on her usual outfit: A thin, black crop top, only secured by very thin strings. Her midriff was free - she wanted to feel the sun on as much of her skin as possible. For the same reason, she had decided on denim shorts, which didn't cover much of her legs, and light, brown sandals.<br>\r\nShe sat down in the small kitchen of her apartment, eating a light breakfast. College would soon be picking up again, so she thought about how she wanted to spend her remaining free time. As far as she knew, there wasn't a party worth going to, today. But there were other things she could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing on her mind was, of course, to get someone to keep her company. She rarely stayed in contact with her dates. She didn't have to. With her figure, it was easy enough to find someone willing to give her a good time. There was a bar she had been met with lots of success, recently - maybe she could find someone there. Plus, the bartender was cute as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thing popped into her mind. She had barely noticed the lack of noise when she woke up, but now the odd quietness piqued her curiosity. Not just, that the usually busy city seemed all but deserted - her roommates as well were uncharacteristically silent. Normally, Sandra would blast her music at this time, while Jessie would try to outmatch her in the volume departemnt with the Television. Maybe she could see, what was up with them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could also just spend the day at the mall. She rarely went on a shopping spree, but she didn't have anything planned for today - and it had been a while since she ate something more substantial than noodles. Her cooking skills weren't exactly refined, which made her all the more eager to hit up the food court and shop around for anything that might catch her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, as much as she would like to do something fun today, she couldn't ignore college forever. In just a week she would have to attend lectures again. She didn't hate her studies - but she wasn't looking forward to her free time going up in smoke as she'd get smothered by assignments. Maybe, she should start preparing. If she put the work in now, the first few weeks would be so much easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile July thought over her options, she was completely unaware of how much the world had changed in the last few hours. No matter how she chose to spend the day - it was only a matter of time until she discovered the shrunken inhabitants of this new world. The only question now, was where would discover them - and how she would react.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As July thought about all her options, she decided that she should prepare for the night. Or at least get someone for the night. Given her body she wasn't going to have a problem with that. Even at a time like this in the morning, there would be a lot of guys that would love to get with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuly smiled as she got up, walked to the mirror and looked over herself \u201cHm... yeah good enough\u201d She said giving herself a check. She'd done this before, a lot of times before so she knew what was needed to get a guy to by her a drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked some more, she grabbed her keys and headed for the door \u201cGirls! Im going out to the bar! Have fun... being quiet i guess!\u201d July said as she didn't understand that part. It was odd, but then again they could simply not be home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuly opened the door and walked out, which was a problem<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! Don't leave!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck please come back July!\u201d<br>\r\n\u2028These voices were unheard, as July simply left the room and went off to the bar. Sandra and Jessie were freaking out, eventually getting together. When July came in normal sized the girls, although scared, had tried to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking it perfectly clear how difficult that would be, given their difference in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs July got out she looked around the place, not seeing a single person. Really odd, in fact confusion in general. It was almost like there had been a rapture, and she got left behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich did make a bit of sense, July thought, giggling to herself. She simply shrugged as she went to her car, got on and started to drive. Both Sandra\u2019s and Jessie\u2019s cars were home. It seemed, they were just having a long sleep.<br>\r\n\u2028July didn't mind that much as she started to drive. Going onto the road and as she expected... it was empty. Beside her's, there was not a single other moving car. Granted, there were cars in the streets, annoyingly parked in her way. But they weren't moving either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, this is fucking weird,\u201d she said to herself as she tried to distract herself from the freakiness. Turning on the Radio, she expected to hear her favourite channel. As she turned it on though, not a single voice came through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d she said as she drove through town, not seeing a single person. Maybe a Rapture did happen. It would make more sense then this, just empty streets. She did see animals, though. Birds swooping down and grabbing something that she couldn't really see. She assumed it was a bug or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo of course she kept driving, not paying attention. If she did, she would have seen a poor lady getting attacked and eventually eaten by the pigeons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs July pulled up to the bar, she shrugged off the weirdness. She was planning on flirting with a cute man in there. Truth be told the one she really wanted was Derrick, the Bartender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe worked night shifts though, so he probably wouldn't be in there. He was the one guy who July couldn't seem to get. No matter the flirting, no matter the skimpy dresses she wore, no matter what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich of course made her want him even more. He was around her age, with dark skin and a short cut. Damn if he didn't look good in his clothes, though. There were plenty of reasons, why July was desiring him. But of course it wouldn't happen, so she went home with a different guy, most nights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked in, she looked around the place. Taking a look at the sign as she had to double check. The place said 'open', but no one was around her. In fact it was as empty as the whole town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFigures. Hey! Anyone here!\u201d She said as she looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the drunks and workers that had been in there all night, saw the giant blonde enter! Needless to say the sight was enough to make most of the men amazed! The sight was gorgeous, and the little girls that were in the bar last night had nothing on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome were already screaming up to her, desperate for her to hear them. They didn't know that July was still a little out of it and her hearing really hadn't fully recovered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was a real problem as she walked even closer. Taking steps and waiting for any words. Everyone started to run from her, screaming as they didn't want to get stepped on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing only a couple of inches tall, they were nothing compared to this girl. Luckily no one really got stepped on, as they had plenty of time to run as July just thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could try to assume it was a coincidence, but as it kept happening it was clear that something happened. Maybe a rapture, maybe everybody had just moved. Maybe she was dreaming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless there was one thing she knew. \u201cOpen Bar!!\u201d She cheered with arms up. A smile on her face, she moved over, walking across the bar and onto the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe danced around, happily ready to not only take some bottles but maybe even pour herself one right now. She knew it wasn't right to steal, and normally she wouldn't, but at the same time she was having fun. And no one was here to stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, after the mess of this morning she could use a drink. She headed out and grabbed a glass and some bottles, placing them onto the empty counter. It still had some drinks on it, only adding to the weirdest.<br>\r\n\u2028As she was about to start pouring a bottle, she paused, looking down to the stool on this side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one she usually spotted Derrick sitting at. She paused as she saw something on it. Leaning down at it, and brushing some hair out of her face, she tried to see what it really was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she got closer and got a better look, July saw that it was ______________</span></div></div>",

She watched in amusement as the strange, white bug repeatedly jumped up and down on the stool. \u201cAhh, is the little guy trying to get my attention?\u201d July cooed at it with a smile, her drunken mind coming up with a fun little idea. \u201cTell you what. Normally I like my men big, strong and handsome but since I am getting free drinks anyway how about I give you a little lap-dance to celebrate?\u201d She faux-asked as he gave her big booty a slap before pouring herself a second drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bug started jumping faster and July could have sworn that it was actually waving at her\u2026 hell, she even thought she heard a squeak from the bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere I come little guy!\u201d July spoke out, new drink in hand, as she took a few steps towards the stool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bug wasn\u2019t jumping anymore, instead it was slowly backing away, not realizing that it was heading toward the middle of the seat. Then suddenly, it fell backwards as its foot got caught in one of the rips on the stool\u2019s cushions, leaving it sprawled out in the middle of the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like somebody\u2019s eager!\u201d July sang out as she turned around and plopped down onto the stool. She then began to rock back and forth and even bounced a few times before getting bored and downing her second drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuly looked around at the empty bar and released a sigh. It just wasn\u2019t that fun when no one else was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll go have walk in the park or go to the pool, it\u2019s a nice sunny day after all.

He sat down on his stool\u2026 and then he found himself trapped, at the minuscule size of one inch, on the same chair he sat on every night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had tried calling out for help but soon realized that it was pointless. He saw other people, also shrunk, on the ground far below and realized that no one would be able to help him. His only options were to either jump to his death to the tiled floor below or wait on his stool for starvation or dehydration to eventually kill him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours of looking at the clock, sleeping, waking up, pissing off the side of the stool, and once more looking at the clock later and Derrick was starting to think that maybe jumping wouldn\u2019t be such a bad way to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he heard the door to the bar opening and a surge of hope rushed through him. Somebody who wasn\u2019t shrunk had entered the bar!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Anyone here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick collapsed as the massive voice yelled out. Quickly standing back up he got ready to try and grab the attention of whoever might be there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopefully they would come to the workers side of the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOpen Bar!!\u201d the voice cried out again but this time Derrick was ready and didn\u2019t fall over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead he was stunned when a beautiful titaness of epic proportions started to dance her way into the back, unknowingly trampling a patron on the ground, and started to grab herself drinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then by chance she looked his way! Derrick immediately tried to get her attention by jumping up and down and waving with all his might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd his efforts were rewarded as the Titaness peered closer at him with a look of wonder on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah, what a weird looking bug,\u201d The woman said before turning back to her drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly disheartened at her reply Derrick continued to try and get her attention. Because if he didn\u2019t, he would likely die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh, is this little guy trying to get my attention?\u201d The woman cooed at him, which was only a small blow to his ego, but at least she was still talking to\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell you what. Normally I like my men big, strong and handsome but since I am getting free drinks anyway how about I give you a little lap-dance to celebrate?\u201d The women teased as she gave her own giant ass a slap, before turning back to grab a second drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick\u2019s blood froze for just a moment as a sense of dread went through him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he was shouting toward the giantess, hoping that maybe she might actually hear him or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere I come little guy.\u201d She called out as she started to come closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick tried to back up, where to he had no idea but maybe if he was on the edge of the stool, he would be able to dodge the woman\u2019s ass if he was lucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn\u2019t lucky. Instead he tripped on one of the small rips on the stool\u2019s cushion and ended up sprawled out right in the middle, the absolute worse place to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like somebody\u2019s eager!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick lifted up his hands as if to hold up the descending moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis arms snapped like twigs as the giantess sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick screamed from underneath her denim shorts, the unbearable pressure slowly crushing him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she started to rock back and forth. In one moment the crushing weight would release its grip on him only to return the next with even greater force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerrick felt his legs snap but he couldn\u2019t scream. All the air had been forced out of his lungs by the woman's 'lap-dance'. He couldn't even make a sound. The only thing keeping him up was the sheer amount of pain he was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the Titaness started to bounce up and down on the stool. Each time he would watch the ass rise up only for it to fall right back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd each time it fell Derrick felt one of his ribs break from the blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the women stopped, her cruel fun over. Instead she simply sat on him, letting her own great weight slowly snuff out his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before he could pass on the ass once more rose up but this time it didn\u2019t come back down. Instead the woman walked away, leaving the poor, broken bartender to suffer on his own work cushion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n xxx\u2026xxx\u2026xxx\u2026xxx\u2026xxx\u2026xxx\u2026xxx\u2026xxx\u2026xxx<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out of the bar with a bounce in her step, unknowingly stepping on another person, July enjoyed the feel of the sun on her skin before finally deciding to head over to the\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.\tPark: It\u2019s literally right across the street from the bar, so if she gets thirsty again, she could just head back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.\tPool: July has her bikini in her car from a beach trip she and her friends took a few days ago.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>July shot a few of her friends a message if they wanted to hang out, but she didn't receive any responses. Frowning, she wondered what was up with everyone. First a completely deserted bar, now all of her friends didn't answer her. Her roommates were nowhere to be seen.<br>\r\nAnd the streets were just empty. Just what was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quickly as her curiosity was peaked, it vanished again. Who cared where everyone was. It was probably just something ordinary, like a big football game happening in the area. This place always became a ghost town as soon as a sports team was in the mere vicinity. Which meant only one thing to July:<br>\r\nShe could have the pool all to herself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, she went to her car, snatched out her bikini and towel - she kept an \"emergency beach kit\" in her car at all times - and strolled through the empty streets towards the public bath!<br>\r\nShe was barely surprised when no one greeted her, though it was odd, that there wasn't even a guy on the register. Still, the entrance was wide open.<br>\r\nIt took five minutes for July to tire of waiting for the guy. If there was no one here, she didn't have to pay, either, she thought to herself. If they had a problem with that, they could just tell her later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuly headed for the changing room, quickly slipping into her bikini. It had been a gift from one of her one-week boyfriends, but she loved it nonetheless. It was bright yellow and very skimpy. More than once, some old hag had yelled at her to dress more modest when she was here. But it was easy to ignore her, simply because it drew the looks of countless men and women who couldn't help but check her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking her clothes with her, she finally entered the pool and was greeted by - absolutely no one. She simply shrugged. July had thought there would be at least a couple of people here. At least, she was expecting a lifeguard. But apparently no one could be bothered to show up today.<br>\r\nBut now she couldn't ignore that something strange was going on anymore. Furrowing her brow, she went over to the small restaurant right next to the large field of grass, where the guests would usually relax. No one was in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mischievous part of July took over once more. If the whole staff had decided to leave the pool unattended, it was only fair to assume that they wouldn't mind her serving herself.<br>\r\nJuly grinned wildly. This might be the perfect way for the pool to be: completely empty and completely free! Spending the day here sounded more and more fun by the second.<br>\r\nShe lay down the bunched up pile of her clothes next to a lounger and excitedly strolled towards the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she didn't notice any of the countless tiny people desperately trying to get her attention. Some of them were running towards the enormous girl, only to be pulverized underneath her bare feet. Others were more clever, trying to get up on to the lounger. Surely she would see them, once she came back.<br>\r\nBut their hopes were dashed. July played in the water for some time and after swimming some laps, she returned to her lounger. The minuscule people jumped and waved up at her - only to be met by her enormous body bathing them in shadow as she lied down. For a moment, July thought something tickled her belly, but the feeling vanished just as quick as it came. She didn't notice how her weight snuffed out multiple lives underneath her.<br>\r\nJuly spend the next hour simply enjoying the sun. She didn't care anymore where everybody went. This was awesome!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon though, her stomach rumbled. The drinks from the bar had only been a temporary solution for her first, as well. Thankfully, the restaurant had remained unattended. And as no one was there to stop her, July got up to get herself some food!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nadja blinked blearily. She could see nothing in the darkness. She always kept the shutters down, not so much because she preferred the dark, but more to muffle the sounds of busy road next to her apartment at least somewhat. For once, it seemed to have worked. Not a single noise penetrated into her room. She smiled a tired smile and let her head hit the pillow again. It wasn't busy - no, it was dead silent. Unusal, but welcome.<br>\r\nShe felt around her bed. Somewhere in the countless folds of her massive blanket, she found her phone. Usually, she spent her nights browsing her favourite sites - videostreams and wikis of her favourite games, sometimes tech forums - until she fell asleep and simply dropped it into her sheets. It took her five minutes to find it - a new record for her. She brought the phone infront of her face, eager to see if that ass on youtube had ever replied to her snarks about him. But when she pressed the switch to start it up, a whole other thing came to her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>It's nine already!?</b> she shrieked, throwing her blanket off of herself. Quickly, she rushed out of her room and into the bath! She had to get ready! It was, after all, a big day for her!<br>\r\nPutting on some tight, black leggins, a cute, colourful T-shirt, a rocking, red skirt and her favourite pair of pink sneakers, she was ready to face the day. She had many things to do!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, she had a date lined up - the first in ages! She wasn't usually all that active, romanitcally, especially not outside. She found it difficult to start a conversation with a stranger, no matter how nice. It was more a 'her'-problem than a simple 'hadn't-found-the-right-guy-yet'-problem. Sometimes, when she was feeling adventurous, she would load up a dating- or hook-up app, just to see if anybody was interested. But even if the answer was yes - which it was almost all the time - she quickly lost interest again, content to stay in and reread some comics.<br>\r\nBut now, she had finally agreed to meet someone! Her name was Andrea (<i>so elegant!</i>), and she would meet her in the mall! Going shopping sounded fun! Maybe she could show her her favourite place - the arcade!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thing that she had to do today was picking up a package. Nadja had ordered some parts from a computer store nearby. As well as she liked her old computer, she couldn't deny that it was getting a bit old. The hardware was worn out - and she didn't want her harddrive to die on her, <i>again</i> - so she had ordered almost everything she needed, of the highest quality, of course. She had the money to spare. The only thing she'd keep, was the deep blue tower casing with white stripes on it. It had been a gift from one of her best friends, Violet. It had cased the first computer she'd ever owned - and continued to do so for every new one she bought.<br>\r\nBut going to the store would be a chore. Most of the staff was nice enough, but the guy who handled packages was just absolutely leacherous. Everytime she entered, she could feel his sticky gaze linger on her backside. He had taken quite an interest in her, it seemed, though he hadn't even bothered to ask her her name. To be fair, neither had she. She just wanted as little to do with him as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she thought of Violet, another thing came into her mind. She hadn't visited her friend in a while, both of them simply being to busy most of the time, nowadays. Violet worked as a consultant for a law firm - and the only reason she wasn't boss of it yet was, that the guy in charge, a slimy prick called Marvin, was apparently very bothered by her professionalism. His mind seemed stuck in the fifties, despite him being quite young, actually. There was hardly a day now, where Violet wouldn't post and angry rant about him on social media. Through her posts, and a couple of drunk conversations at girl's night, Nadja had become quite pissed off at him.<br>\r\nBut today, Violet probably wouldn't be at the firm. Nadja knew for a fact, that she had taken the day aside - because Violet's birthday was today! A surprise visit would certainly be nice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, Nadja would have to check into the clinic, sometime, just to see if the new guys there had everything under control. They didn't have any acute cases right now, but emergencies could happen and she just wanted to be sure, that they were doing alright.<br>\r\nThere was another reason to her visit as well. One of the newest guys on her team was Jack, fresh out of college and an absolute hunk. Though she already had a date, she wouldn't mind having him as a back-up. He was just nice to look at with his short, blonde hair, his <i>hunky</i> chest, his tight shirts...<br>\r\nNadja caught herself before she drifted into a day dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a big day ahead of her, and would tackle these things one at a time. Thankfully, she wasn't bound to a tight schedule (anymore). So she could choose, what to do first!</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Well at the moment, Nadja maybe wanted to go over to her friend's place. Not only because it was her birthday and she wanted to see Violet, but because she had a date later on and... well she wasn\u2019t exactly savy when it came to clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNadja's usual outfit was a combination of comfy jeans, worn sneakers and one of her many pop culture shirts. Violet would definitely be able to help. Thinking for a little bit, she considered getting her a gift at the mall, but figured that money would be enough. They didn\u2019t really have the same interests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce dressed, she walked right through the door and got out. Her garage was tiny and she barely had enough room to reach her small car. She wasn\u2019t one to really care about expensive cars, not that she could really afford one anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drove off, going to her friend\u2019s house. The road looking a bit interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nadja got out of the car, she knocked a couple of times on her friend\u2019s door. She knew Violet was home, her car parked in her large driveway, but she didn\u2019t get a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey uh... Violet! It\u2019s me Nadja! Happy birthday!\u201d She said, trying to get her friend to open the door. However there was no response, which got her a bit worried. Violet had always been one to wake up early, almost annoyingly early. It was usually for a run or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo right now, she Nadja was concerned. Jumping to conclusions like she usually did, she went and got the spare key Violet had hidden for her in the case of an emergency. It was right in the flowerpot where it should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the door and peered inside. No lights were on, but it didn\u2019t look like there had been a struggle. So no intruder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she was in her bed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Violet! I am here!\u201d She said, taking several steps towards her friends bedroom. Something bugged Nadja as she looked inside. Then she noticed: The bed was made almost perfect! Something that Violet absolutely refused to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Violet where are you?\u201d She said taking a couple of steps in. \u201cI got cash for your birthday, and I need your help with a date.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she turned, she moved and sat down at the foot of the bed. A look of disappointment on her face as she lowered her ass. Her jeans, although baggie didn\u2019t hide her ass at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down, and pulled out her phone, punching in Violet's number. Again, she got no response which was easily explained. Violet's cheery ringtone sounded from one of her nightstand drawers. She had forgotten it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould have known,\u201d Nadja sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hung up the phone and was a little bit unsure of what she was going to do now, when suddenly she felt something. Right under her butt, something was shifting! Despite it being under her blanket - as well as her butt - she could still feel it poking into her behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhaa!\u201d She freaked out, jumping up and onto her feet, though she calmed down soon enough as she thought about it some more. <br>\r\n\u201cA bug?\u201d she asked herself. Violet\u2019s home would be the last place a bug should be, but what other explanation was there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow as a Veterinarian she loved all types of animals and this also went for bugs. Now some might argue they weren\u2019t animals but Nadja still cared for them. When she was young, she even had an ant nest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she wasn\u2019t scared, \u00b4but startled. But she needed to investigate, if only to throw the bug out. She grabbed the blanket, pulled it back and off of the bed. Once off, she looked the where she sat and saw the little bug. Standing over she smiled down at it. At least it wasn't a spider or centipede.<br>\r\nHonestly, she did not know what kind of insect it was. It was pale all the way through instead of one black bit on the head. It also apparetnly had lost some of its limbs, having only four appendages poking out of its torso. Taking several looks at it as she was trying to figure out what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNadja!\u201d suddenly she heard someone call her name. Starteled, she turned, spinning her head and looking around. That was no doubt Violet, but where was she.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cViolet! Are you here?\u201d She questioned, taking several steps out of the room. Much to the little \u2018bugs\u2019 distress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCause this was not an actual bug. In fact, it was Violet. The woman had shrunken down like everyone else on this planet. She was just lucky enough to be in her home, and did her best not to think of anyone who wasn't as fortunate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was stranded on her own bed though, unable to get down. Hearing her friends voice had given her hope, though, and she was desperately yelling for Nadja to notice her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly for her to get sat on by her shy friend. Thankfully, Nadja's behind wasn't only large, but soft enough for her not to get crushed to a pulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Nadja had pulled the blanket of her, finally freeing her, Violet was in awe of her god like stature. Still she managed to shake of her amazement and yelled her name again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly for Nadja to miss where her voice was coming from and walk away. She redoubeled her efforts, trying to lead her friend towards herself. She had to wait a while until Nadja came back into the room! Her towering form was intimidating Violet a lot, even if she knew who her friend is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the heck,\u201d She said, censoring herself, which she had a habit to do. \u201cViolet's not here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am! I am here Nadja! You got to look down, figure out what the hell happened!\u201d She screamed with worry. \u201cLook down! Look down!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNadja did look down, hearing her friend\u2019s faint voice. A part of her thought she was just going crazy, but she listened intently. Looking down at the bug once again. Curious, she took another, deeper look at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't any bug she knew, which was interesting. But had she really nothing more important to worry about? Her friend was missing on her birthday, that's something she should investigate, rather than studying a strange insect she found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she was curious. Moving her face down, she looked right at the little thing. For Violet, Nadja's face seemed like a gigantic meteorite descending upon her. It worried her, but she just kept waving her arms around, knowing that this was her only chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNadja looked down at her, training her eyes on the \u2018bug\u2019. After about twenty seconds of looking, she ____________________</span></div></div>",

How had...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nadja!\" Violet yelled, her voice shaking the giantess out of her stupor. \"Help!\"<br>\r\n\"How...\" Nadja didn't know how to start. A million questions raced through her head.<br>\r\n\"What happened to you?\" she finally asked.<br>\r\n\"I don't know! All I can remember is a really bright flash of light. I couldn't see anything else. And when I woke up, I was lost under my own hecking blanket!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNadja had to suppress a giggle. Despite the situation, the way Violet always avoided swearing was just to funny.<br>\r\n\"I've been trying for hours to get out of there. So thanks, at least I can see something again.\"<br>\r\nSuddenly something dawned on Nadja. A horrified expression came over her face as she remembered sitting down on the bed and feeling...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! Did I sit on you, Violet?\" Nadja almost screamed. Without waiting for an answer, she grabbed the minuscule woman and held her up to her eyes. With the trained sight of a veterinarian, she investigated Violets body, feeling her limps and torso.<br>\r\n\"You aren't hurt, are you? You can feel everything, right? Please tell me I didn't...\"<br>\r\nViolet had to forcefully push Nadja's probing finger away from her.<br>\r\n\"Relax Nad, I'm fine. Guess sitting around all day has done wonders for your butt. It was a bit smothering, but you got up quickly enough. See?\" She held up her arms. \"Nothing's broken, so don't worry. I'm not blaming you for not noticing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelieved, Nadja took a deep breath.<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad. I promise I'll be more careful from now on!\"<br>\r\n\"Again, relax Nadja. I'm just happy that I'm finally out of there,\" she pointed to the bed, \"and can get something to eat. Wouldn't you know, shrinking this much somehow hasn't slowed my metabolism. Oh well, at least now I can brag that I 150 pounds in a day!\" She giggled. \"Just have to find out how I've done it and I'm rich!\"<br>\r\nNadja laughed as well. It was good to see her friend taking this strange situation with a bit of gallows humor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something to eat sounds good. You have something here?\"<br>\r\nViolet nodded. Nadja let her rest on her palm as she carefully carried her into the kitchen. A few minutes later, both of them were sat at a small table. Nadja had made herself a bowl of sugary cornflakes, something that Violet despised but still kept around for some reason. Wisely, Nadja had avoided looking at the expiry date. She didn't want to loose her appetite after all.<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Violet was fighting with a salad she had prepared. When she had put the dressing on she hadn't thought she would have to dive into her food just to grab a hold of something. After reaching in once, and smearing her entire arm in juice, she looked up at Nadja.<br>\r\n\"A little help?\" she asked, clearly embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Nadja had chopped the salad into manageable pieces, they ate in silence for a while. None of them quite knew what to say and despite her jokes, Violet was clearly distraught about her sudden loss of size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, there was a flash of light?\" Nadja probed her friend.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but as I said, that's all I can remember. It flashed and the next moment I was this size. There was nothing else. No noise before or after. It just happened.\"<br>\r\n\"That's so strange,\" Nadja answered. She thought about it. In all her time researching technology - as well as in her actual school efforts - she had never heard of anything like this. As far as she knew, Violet shouldn't even be alive at this size. Her body wasn't made for it. So either the whole world had gotten something wrong about a fundamental law of nature, or this wasn't caused by anything natural. Nadja wasn't a believer, but she had to admit she had no other explanation than divine intervention.<br>\r\nHer thoughts drifted and something else entered her mind. The strange quiet this morning. She lived next to a busy street leading into the city center. The sounds could be measured from annoying to deafening - but quiet was an absolute outlier. In all the time she had lived there, the street had always been source of noise.<br>\r\nFurthermore, she hadn't even seen anyone else except Violet the whole day. And while she may have gotten up late, seeing absolutely no one on the streets was strange. And she couldn't remember seeing another car, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet jumped backwards, startled by Nadja's spoon suddenly dropping onto the table. Looking up, she saw the shocked look on Nadja's face.<br>\r\n\"Hey, what happened? Are you okay?\" she asked, worried.<br>\r\n\"I'm... not sure,\" Nadja answered, slowly stammering out the words. She looked at her tiny friend.<br>\r\n\"I just have a bad feeling, because... well, you're the first person I'm seeing today.\"<br>\r\n\"Wait, the first? You're joking, right? How could a small fry like me be the first person you've seen?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but there was no one else. No pedestrians, no cars, no children playing on the street, no shitty builder turning on his jackhammer at six in the morning, just... nothing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked at each other. It was clear what they were thinking.<br>\r\n\"So...\" Violet started, \"you think this has happened to others too?\"<br>\r\n\"Probably. We need to find out. If there are more people shrunken down, we need to help! Who knows what might happen.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, more like <b>you</b> need to help. I'm not really capable of that, you know.\"<br>\r\n\"Damn, I know, Violet.\"<br>\r\nNadja looked torn. On one hand, every instinct in her body told her to find out what happened. If more people had been shrunken, it was only a matter of time until they were hurt. She couldn't let that happen. But carrying Violet in her hand while searching for others was not really an option. It was too unsafe. Besides, would she just carry every single person by hand? No, she needed something larger. A bag or a container.<br>\r\nShe slapped her forehead. Of course, a container! She was in a kitchen, god dammit! There were loads of boxes around! With that, she could carry any people she found and wouldn't have to worry about Violet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe explained her plan to Violet as she rummaged through her cupboards. Her friend was hesitant about being carried around in a plastic box, but she had to admit that it was the best option they had.<br>\r\nFinally, Nadja pulled out a huge plastic tub. Now, armed and ready, she lowered Violet into the container and carried her out of her apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let her eyes wander over the empty street. Nothing, not even a single person was up and about. Her suspicions only became stronger.<br>\r\n\"Okay, we need a plan. I can't just run around, trying to find people at random. Where should I search first?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the two woman talked about their plans, they eventually decided on going into the neighbourhood houses and grabbing everyone. It was simple, but it was going to be tiring work. So many houses, and Nadja simply couldn\u2019t get every single person at once. It would require multiple trips at least. She was going to try though. Grabbing her friend and putting her in the container, she brought her hands to either side. To Violet it was like a giant warehouse, so it should be able to fit a lot of people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over the street, seeing it deserted. Even though she planned on getting people in their homes, she still had to make sure some people weren\u2019t left out on the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her eyes weren't perfect. As she walked over to the closest house, she stepped on another human being without even realizing it. Thankfully she didn't notice. Nadja would never forgive herself, if she found out. Moving to the neighbour\u2019s house, she found the door locked. Pausing for a second she looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe door\u2019s locked, what do I do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBreak it down!\u201d Violet said back up, seeing reason for that. She blinked twice talking to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you kidding me, i\u2019m not that big. I just got to... umm...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDrop the container here and go through the windows.\u201d Violet said. \u201cBreak it down if you have to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDropping it here? Will you be okay? What if like... a bird comes! You have no way of defending yourself!\u201d Nadja said, raising a good point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. You got to save those other people. I will wait.\u201d Violet said, knowing just how caring her friend was. Najda listened to her, and moved her way down. She place the container close underneath a small windowsill to hide it from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not something she usually did, but it was something she was going to have to. Lifting a rock from the garden, she tossed it right at the window. It shattered into pieces with an ear wrenching sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing one shoe on the windowsill, Nadja lifted herself through the window. She walked right over and inside, looking at the room. She had got to be quick, after all there were so many more houses she would still have to visit. Checking around the place she eventually stopped at the first bedroom. Walking in, she could see some tiny people panicking on the pillows. It was the parents of the house. Taking a few steps closer she raised her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, i\u2019m not here to hurt you. I\u2019m here to help!\u201d she said to them, stepping to the side. The mother and the father were basically gripping each other out of fear. \u201cI\u2019m not here to hurt, I promise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter how many times she said this, they were still terrified. Eventually she stopped trying to calm down, and simply grabbed them. With one hand as a platform and the other as a crane, she grabbed the father and then the mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth together on her palm. \u201cTell me, do you have any kids. I\u2019ll save them too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe parents calmed down when she brought their kids into it. \u201cWe got a son and a daughter. They are probably still in their beds!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNadja listened and moved, walking around the home. Eventually finding the daughter as well as the brother. Both of them screaming at her, which she was expecting after the terrified reaction of the adults. She hadn't thought how scary she must be to those smaller than her. It would make her job much harder. She carried the whole small huddled family as she went outside. Going through the door this time as she grabbed the key. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocking it behind her just in case, she moved over and went to her container. Happy to see her friend again, who was a bit shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got down and gently placed them all in the plastic tub, as she watched Violet console them. Thankfully, they were more willing to talk to a fellow shrunken person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNadja moved down, crouching down as she grabbed the container. Lifting it up and moving with it. If she was going to do this, best to do it with her car. That way they could be safe inside while she... extracted more people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved and put them into the backseat, looking down at the shrunken people one last time before closing the door. Then she moved on to the next house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly the door was locked again, so she had to break another window. She noticed that she was getting better at breaking and entering, a skill she wasn't proud of to have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got into the house the first thin she noticed were the clothes on the floor which seemed to be leading somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackets, shirts, pants, a bra... with a gulp, she made the connection of what she might be walking into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe path was laid out right in front of her and she moved and went into the bedroom. More clothes were scattered around, leading her straight to the bed. Lifting the blanket up, she saw who was in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a couple, or rather a one night stand she assumed. One naked blonde, and a naked man beside her. Both... well both were pretty hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn\u2019t one to go on tinder, but they seemed to be the classic hotties and floozies one would find on these dating apps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them were sleeping, so grabbing them would be easy. They didn\u2019t even wake up when her fingers reached them. Not even stirring a little. If she hadn\u2019t noticed their breathing, she would have assume they were dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in her hand she couldn\u2019t help but inspect them. If the blonde was normal size, she would have a bigger pair of tits and a bigger ass then Nadja would. However at this size, they were laughable in comparison. It was funny, at least a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy was a total hunk though. His body was covered with the bluge of well defined muscles, as well as a good looking face and a large... package. Though he did kind of remind her of the jocks in her class during school. They hadn\u2019t exactly the friendliest, so maybe this guy was one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to search the house, searching for any more shrunken people. But her eyes continued to linger on the tiny couple as she thought about what to do with them. She knew she should drop them off with the others... but something within her stirred. Seeing their tiny, naked bodies was kind of... hot?<br>\r\nA thought popped into her head. Since she assumed this whole shrinking epidemic had ruined her date, she could keep these two around to keep her company. She was saving them after all, so it was only fair to demand a little something in return... and stowing them somewhere wouldn't be a big problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Nadja knew she was only trying to rationalize her own desire. She wanted to do the right thing, but could she fight back against her more lusty desires?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the key she decided on ___________</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mentally, she slapped herself. How could she even think that! These were living, breathing people and she wanted to keep them as... what? Pets? Toys? No, she knew that she wasn't like that. Her morals wouldn't allow her to use these poor people like that.<br>\r\nBut her will didn't make those feelings go away. Nadja was worried - had something awakened within her? If so, she needed to address that. If she somehow became a danger to these people, she needed to take precautions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that could come later. Hastily, she brought the two sleeping lovers back to her car, put them into the tub, and rushed to the next house. Building by building, she collected the shrunken residents. Most of them were terrified like the first family she had saved - but after she had calmed them somewhat, they started to trust her. Still, she was working faster and faster, simply to keep her desires in check. Even though she tried to banish the dark thoughts entering her mind, she didn't succeed. Images of tiny people in all kinds of positions flared up in front of her inner eye.<br>\r\nNadja bit her lip. Hopefully there was another normal sized person out there. If not, there would be no one to keep her in check, and right now she didn't fully trust herself not to do something... bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, her efforts paid off and the tub was filled up with hundreds of tiny people. They had gathered into groups, speaking with their neighbours. Some were crying at the awful situation, others tried to calm everyone down. Violet went from person to person, reassuring them that everything would be all right. Nadja was taking care of them, after all. Since she knew the giantess that had taken them all here, it wasn't hard to convince everybody that they were in good hands. And so, as she returned for the last time with a handful of fraternity members, Nadja was greeted with large smiles and hopeful eyes.<br>\r\nA warm feeling blossomed in her stomach. Seeing all these people so thankful for her efforts kind of embarrassed her. She wasn't really eager to be the center of attention, but with her size she really had no other choice. And besides, it felt good to take care of so many fragile beings. It was the same good feeling she got when treating a pet - only a million times stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, everybody,\" she announced after she had deposited the last people into the tub, \"I'm going to bring you to my home now, you'll be safe there! And don't worry, I'll be driving extra carefully. And I'm going to secure you, just a second.\"<br>\r\nShe pulled out one of the seat belts and tucked the tub containing hundreds of people into the seat. With a click, the latch went shut.<br>\r\n\"There we go, all safe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the drive back, the car was filled with chatter from the tiny people. Nadja couldn't make out much, simply because everybody was speaking at once. She didn't want to chime in, anyway. A conversation with one of them would just be unfair to the rest. Her voice would just drown out everything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she reached her apartment complex and she carried the box upwards, until she entered her home. She set it down onto her desk, after clearing it of various junk.<br>\r\nBut now, a new problem presented itself. She needed to keep the box so she could rescue more people - but where should she put  the ones she already had? It needed to be a safe place, but it shouldn't be to cramped. And their needs would have to be taken care of as well. She didn't want them to go hungry, after all.<br>\r\nNadja thought about it. She knew that some of the tenants here had kids, so it should be easy to find some dollhouses to keep the tiny people in. And even if it might be embarrassing, the doll clothes would also give them the opportunity to change or, in some cases, cover themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there might be a better option. There was a store that had recently opened not far from here, that specialized in models, and very intricate ones at that. When she passed it once, there was a gigantic model city displayed in the window, advertised as 'full realistic'. Apparently, it even had a water circulation system and was run by a battery. It would be perfect for the shrunken people.<br>\r\nBut it would also take up a whole lot of room in her apartment, and that wasn't even taking into account getting it here in the first place. It would be difficult for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she could also just leave them on the desk for a while. There were still so many people that needed rescuing and Nadja couldn't bear the thought of them stranded at their tiny size. She needed to rescue more! And she knew just where to start: the downtown! All the stores were probably full with tiny people, and she could get some more boxes to keep them in. With her car, she could probably save thousands with a single trip!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should she do...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lee had already been up for an hour before her alarm rang. She rarely had trouble to fall asleep, but the last few days... she had been waking up, earlier and earlier. Her clock almost taunted her, slowly ticking away towards the time she'd actually have to get up. Just more time to dread going into the office for another horrid day, again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only silver lining was, that if she couldn't sleep, she could just as well be productive. Lee had always taken great care into her appearance, but after she started her current job, she found it harder and harder to summon the enthusiasm for a nice outfit. Well, at least not for her colleagues. Her clients, however, were a different story...<br>\r\nCamming had been the only thing that kept Lee relatively sane. All the things her dayjob sucked out of her, she got right back when she started up her livestream. Where her customers were rude, demanding, and assholes just in general, her viewers were mostly respectful, if a bit overly chummy. Where her boss wrote her up for the tinest misstep, trying to cut her pay whereever he could, her viewers encouraged her to do more and more adventurous things. With compensation, of course. And most important off all, her viewers never neglected to mention, how <b>hot</b> she was. Lee took great pride in her looks - they hadn't been easy to achieve and even harder, to keep. Only for her breasts she couldn't take the credit - though she chalked it up to the universe trying to balance out the rest of her, frankly, shitty life. The rest of her body was toned. She went to the gym regularly, focusing on her thighs and butt, most of all! A fact, that her viewers never failed to appreciate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she finished her morning routine, applying the last dash of make-up to her radiant face. For today, she had decided on some provokingly tight blue jeans, as well as a nice, form fitting blouse. She even put on some very nice, black sandals, leaving her feet bare. Even if her coworkers didn't seem to care, she liked looking good simply for her own sake. It made her feel confident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed. She had to get out of the house now, no? Well, it wouldn't be so bad. At least, she could look forward to her cam-session, later tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she had to check into her office. Her boss, a prick called Cullen, would be angry if she didn't, even if she wasn't needed. Lee didn't want to deal with him - but she should get it over with quickly, else he might find some reason to cut her pay again. it wouldn't be too bad. The worst things she would have to deal with were barely veiled comments about her competence and lurid stares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she sould find time to go to the bank. There was a problem with her account. <i>Again</i>. Ever since she started her little side-gig, her bank account would be frozen every other week because of 'suspicious payments'. She had explained the situation a hundred times, though the bank manager couldn't wrap his mind around a woman voluntarily working as a camgirl. So all her comments fell on deaf ears and week after week, she would have to explain it all over again. Sometimes she thougth, they did it deliberately, just to fuck with her. But the manager didn't seem malicious. Just dumb as hell.<br>\r\nWhich didn't mean, that everybody working there was like that. Recently, a very pollite - and handsome! - man had started to work at the reception desk. He was always cordial, but in a warm way. He definitely knew about her troubles and seemed genuinely sorry. Maybe she should talk to him some more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome errands needed running - she was almost out of food, again. And also, she had been searching for while now for a better camera. Her webcam was doing fine, but she had saved some money to upgrade her quality. It was one of her only gripes about her side-work. Thankfully, she had a fast internet connection. She would have hated to see her image stuttering and pixelated. If she put in all this effort to look good, it shouldn't be technology's fault that her beauty didn't shine through.<br>\r\nAlso, the girl operating the camera section in the nearest tech store was in one word: supercute! She was always enthusiastic, ready to talk Lee's ear off as soon as she showed any interest in cameras. She had, in fact, offered her some advice on how to improve her quality. Maybe Lee should thank her for her help...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, there was something fun on her list. For a while now, she had wanted to spice up her camming-sessions a bit more. Her viewers continued to be happy, but lately, Lee didn't feel as... reliefed, as she had been before. The stress of her job was getting to her.<br>\r\nSo it had been great luck, that a sex shop had opened just around the corner! Until today, she didn't have the opportunity to visit. But today, she should be able to make time. She was excited. A few new toys, and her stream would be even more exciting than before...</span></div></div>",

She had to get it over with, and besides, she didn't actually have to work that long today. She could tolerate Cullen and her coworkers for a few hours. At least she could be sure all of them would be either enthralled or envious by her outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she drove along the road, she kept thinking about work. So much so, that she barely even noticed how deserted the street was. Not a single car drove in her direction, nor could she see any pedestrians. Was today a holiday she had somehow missed? It was possible, Lee wasn't tracking time by day anymore, but rather by shift.<br>\r\nShe shrugged her shoulders and continued to her workplace. An empty street only meant that she didn't have to pay all that much attention. At least for that, she could be thankful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLee drove up into the company parking lot. Strangely, there weren't many cars here, either. Maybe she really did forget something. But Cullen had been adamant that she come in today. Not that it would be unlike him to call her in on a free day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe strode through the bare parking lot, dreading every step that took her closer to the accursed steel tower that was her workplace. Gritting her teeth, she stepped inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd was baffled. The reception area, usually busy as hell, was completely empty. Not even the receptionist himself - maybe the only pleasant person in the entire company - was here.<br>\r\nJune thought about leaving. If no one else had bothered to come, why should she? It was obviously some kind of holiday she had forgotten, so she should be lying in bed right now.<br>\r\nBut something was stirring inside her. She could have sworn today was just a normal Wednesday. So where was everybody? First the empty streets, now her office building seemed completely deserted. Just what was going on? Was someone playing a prank on her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgainst her better judgment, she continued towards the elevator. Whatever was going on, she was curious now. If it was a prank, she could only admire the dedication of the trickster. If it wasn't... hell, she couldn't even imagine what it could be instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a <b>ding</b> the elevator opened it's doors and Lee rode up to the 10th floor - her office. As she stepped out, she was barely even surprised anymore to find it empty as well. Slowly, she strolled through the open floor office, past the desks of her coworkers until she reached her own.<br>\r\nShe had expected some kind of hint, or at least something out of place. But there was nothing. Only her desk as it had always been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLee sighed, depositing her stuff on the desk. Whatever was happening, it could wait for her to figure it out. For now though, she had to meet with her boss. Something that she didn't look forward to at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what she hadn't noticed were the many tiny people scurrying over the floor. Some of them had tried to reach her, but she was simply to fast for them. A single step for Lee was countless yards for her shrunken coworkers. When they had finally accepted that they wouldn't get her attention, they had opted to avoid her instead. Getting caught underneath her feet was the last thing any of them wanted.<br>\r\nBut now, the gargantuan woman was moving again, striding through the office without a care in the world. Her coworkers didn't know what would be worse. Her ignoring them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr her noticing them?</span></div></div>",

He tried to get her attention and that bitch crushed him under her heel without even looking back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSteven died because he stood right in front of her waving and shouting like a moron.\u201d Himako, a Japanese woman who was the opposite of Lee in every way. Where as Lee was tall and ridiculously curvy, Himako was short; even before the shrinking she was barely four and a half feet tall and petite. Where Lee\u2019s face always seemed seductive Himako looked like she should still be in middle school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFunny considering that the two were actually classmates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI believe that our best course of action is to get her attention in a way that doesn\u2019t make her think that we are bugs.\u201d Himako continued, \u201cBefore I shrank, I had been bringing some papers towards your office, sir. Those papers are currently on the ground in my cubical, if we work together, we could drag one of the papers here and use it as a sign. Four little black shapes on the ground might be seen as bugs, but four little black shapes dragging a large piece of paper behind them might draw enough attention to make Lee take a closer look at us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great plan.\u201d Edward, a well-muscled thirty-year-old white guy, replied sarcastically, \u201cExcept you forgot the part where your cubical is on the other side of the room from Lee\u2019s and just getting there could take us hours. We\u2019d be lucky to get to your cubical before she leaves, let alone making the trip back with the paper.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen what would you suggest Edward?\u201d Cullen asked, hoping to nip any arguments in the bud. The last thing the group needed was for a fight to start between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimple, we climb her and get her attention.\u201d Edward stated<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow THAT is a stupid plan.\u201d Susan cut in, and the other two nodded in agreement. \u201cLee is basically a skyscraper to us. How the fuck do you expect us to reach that bitches fat head without falling to our deaths?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst off, your fat bitchyness, I don\u2019t expect US to make it up there. I expect MYSELF to make it up there. I happen to be great at rock climbing after all. Second, I don\u2019t have make it up to her head, I just have to get onto her seat. From there I just need to dive into her pussy and set her off. Badda bing badda boom she notices me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s sexual harassment!\u201d Himako shouted with a red face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward scoffed, \u201cPlease, you're only mad that you can\u2019t make it up there you fake jailbait lesbian. I know for a fact that you watch her cam shows and that you want her to \u201csmother you with her breasts\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHimako\u2019s mouth snapped shut at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow if you excuse me everyone, paradise awaits.\u201d Edward said as he started walking towards the giant Lee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCullen\u2019s own mouth stood agape for a while longer before he could shake himself out of it.

But Edward was right, it's probably gonna take us a while to get there.\"<br>\r\n\"Then let's not loose any more time twiddling our thumbs,\" Cullen grunted and started to march forward.<br>\r\n\"Are we really doing this?\" Susan complained, \"Why can't we just stay away from her? Haven't you seen what she has already done? She'll just trample us like she did Steven!\"<br>\r\n\"And what are you suggesting? Just stay here until the rodents get in?\" Cullen barked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan mumbled something unintelligible, but eventually she trailed behind her remaining coworkers. Meanwhile, Himako struggled to keep up with Cullen's long, striding steps, having to jog behind him.<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do with Edward? We can't just leave him here! What if Lee... you know, gets up?\"<br>\r\n\"His fault,\" Cullen grumbled, \"but he shouldn't stay knocked out for long, so he's got ample chance to get to safety. Or get himself killed trying to climb her. I'm fine with both, personally.\"<br>\r\nHimako was shocked. Sure, Edward was a creep and not even a good worker. Genuinely, he might have been the worst person she ever had the displeasure to meet. But she couldn't wish death upon him.<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't we at least try to convince him?\" Himako asked timidly.<br>\r\n\"My fist already did the talking. Now its up to him to make good decisions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHimako fell silent. It was obvious that Cullen still saw himself in charge, something that she didn't think about until now. But his bullheadedness wouldn't be helpful. He had been mild by saying his relationship with Lee 'wasn't the best'. Even though she and Lee had kinda stopped talking, they still caught up with each other every now and then, and Cullen was a common topic of conversation between the two. To say that Lee hated his guts was an understatement.<br>\r\nAnd Himako knew, as soon as they had made contact with her, Cullen would start ordering Lee around like always. He was the kind of person that couldn't bear any hit to his ego. Usually, this was just annoying but with their reduced size it became downright dangerous. Himako didn't want to be caught between a stupid man and an angry giantess. She knew which side she wanted to be on in that case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them didn't talk much as they made their way towards Himako's cubicle. Cullen was still grumbling angrily, cursing Edward and the whole situation. Susan was silently fuming. It was obvious she wanted to do anything else, but she also didn't want to be alone.<br>\r\nHimako meanwhile thought about how she could get Lee to even help them. Himako had a chance, at least. Maybe their time at school together counted for something. But she couldn't see Lee helping anyone else in this office. She hated this job and probably everybody working with her as well. A pit formed in Himako's stomach. She would have to be very convincing to get Lee on to their side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, they reached the place where Himako had shrunk and, just as she said, papers were scattered all over the floor. Thankfully, she had been carrying a couple of pens as well.<br>\r\n\"Okay, we need to write a message on there,\" she said. She walked to the nearest pen. Cullen and Susan followed.<br>\r\nIt took them quite a while to just write the simple word \"<b>HELP!</b>\" at a size that would be readable for Lee. Wielding a pen that was twice your own size wasn't an easy task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, they also had to walk all the way back again, this time dragging the large paper behind them. It was surprisingly exhausting. The carpeted floor didn't help, either. They had to keep pushing the thick strands of fiber out of their way to even keep walking.<br>\r\nBut after two hours of dragging the enormous sheet, they finally arrived at Lee's desk again. Thankfully, she was still sat there. She was obviously bored, but still punching away on her keyboard. Himako raised an eyebrow. Were there still customer tickets coming in? She hadn't heard a single phone ring in all the time she had been shrunken. But maybe there was hope after all. Hope, that more people were still normal sized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they got closer, Himako was the first to notice that Edward wasn't there anymore. Only a small splatter of red on the carpet marked the place he had been lying on previously. She only hoped he hadn't gone through with his plan. But at least, Lee didn't seem to have noticed anything. If he was still trying to climb her, he was obviously having a hard time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let's get the sign up so she can see it!\" Cullen nodded and went to work. While Himako and Susan kept dragging the paper over the floor, he went to the other side and lifted the paper as far as he could. He only hoped it would be visible.<br>\r\n\"This is it...\" Himako mumbled, \"Please notice us, Lee. We need help...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as they got closer, they saw...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Roxanne was angry. Her morning had been horrible. She had gotten up, bathed, got dressed, but when it was time to turn on her TV - an enromous LCD screen built into her living room wal - all she had gotten, was static! Obviously, it was broken. Now, she could just buy another one - twenty thousand dollars weren't exactly a big deal to her - but she hated to wait for her stuff to get fixed.<br>\r\nPouting, she went downstairs into the large eating room of her spacious apartment, just to see that breakfeast hadn't been done! The table was completely empty. Now, few things got Roxanne as riled up as missing out on breakfeast, but what really made her seeth was that her maids had not even left a note explaining themselves!<br>\r\nOn further examination, none of the cleaning had been done. Dust covered all the precious surfaces in her home. Pillows she had been lying on yesterday hadn't been puffed back up. Books and magazines littered the extravagant coffee table. What was she even paying her staff for!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxanne stomped through her apartment, determined to give her servants a tongue lashing. But no one was there - which was even worse. They were meant to tell her, when they went out. She wasn't a slave driver, after all, though it felt like it to her servants. She was more than willing to let them have some vacation time. They just needed to ask first - now that they had taken off without a word, she was tempted to fire them all on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even after a few minutes, nothing was stirring in her house except for herself. Her servants were simply impossible to find.<br>\r\nRoxanne sighed. She would have to swallow her anger for now, at least until she had someone to shout at. There were still other things, she could do today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst of all, she coud have a meeting with the city council. Not that she had an appointment she needed to honor. Roxanne never made appointments. Rather, the council had adapted to her habit of dropping in every now and again, to make sure they didn't try anything smart behind her back. Like the thing with the land-owning-tax increase. She had threatened to move every last bit of her money out of the city, should they go through with it. That got them back in line, quick. Even though they didn't want to admit it - it was Roxanne who truly held the power in this city. Her wealth kept it running, her empire kept the people employed, and her money kept it from decaying. Her word was as good as law. She should make that known once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut an empire didn't build itself. Which meant that she had an actual meeting sometime today. Though she didn't care all that much about the business site of her wealth, she knew that she should at least check in sometime. When she did, she had noticed that a little competition had sprung up, hoping to escape her gaze. Some clothing chain had opened a large shopping center in the city, trying to vie for her customers. That couldn't be left standing - so she decided to buy the entire chain. The meeting with the owners would go over smoothely - they always did.<br>\r\nNot that they were actual competition. Roxanne just couldn't stand having a building in the city that didn't have her name on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she may just take the day to relax. It was warm out, the height of summer - and luckily, she had her own private beach resort not all that far away. It was builld right next to a public beach, which kind of annoyed her - but the conditions she'd have to meet should she buy the entire beach sounded simply annoying. She had enough tourism agencies already, anyway.<br>\r\nEvery now and then, some daring kids tried to sneak into the resort. They never got in very far, and if they did, they would be promply thrown out. She just hoped, that no one would bother her during her relaxation...</span></div></div>",

None of us know what happened - and we doubt, that we will ever find out. Now, that our houses, are technology, everything is to large for us, we struggle to survive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not everyone has been affected. This morning, someone simply wakes up in their bed, wondering where everybody has gone. The last normal sized human on earth - now, a giant. When they find out, what will they do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can be humanity's salvation. You can be it's destruction. Or it's new, ultimate ruler.<br>\r\nChoose wisely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<b>Rules:</b><br>\r\n1. I will mainly focus on giantess content, but giants are fair game as well.<br>\r\n2. Underage characters are not to be introduced in a sexual setting.<br>\r\n3. Almost all fetishes are allowed. For now the exception is scat, but I may widen it in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Guidelines:</b><br>\r\n- 1st/2nd/3rd person are all fine - but you should stay consistent.<br>\r\n- Build of each others creativity! Try to introduce one new element in a chapter (for example: a new character, a changing or escalating <br>\r\n  situation, or a new location) and try to build of the elements of the past chapters as well.<br>\r\n- Choice chapters should be kept to a minimum.<br>\r\n- I understand if grammar isn't your strong suit. I will try to fix any glaring errors I spot. You can E-Mail me, if you want me to check your <br>\r\n  chapter.<br>\r\n- Most important of all: <b>Have Fun!</b></td>",
