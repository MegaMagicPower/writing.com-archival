They were also the last words you heard from your interview with your new boss Kim. You were happy beyond belief. This was your first real job since you graduated from university. Before that you had worked at the beach for minimum money, barely managing to make ends meet as you had worked as a chef, a waiter, a housekeeper and had gone through all types of labor work during your university years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was about to change! You were finally employed by one of the biggest companies in the city and in the state, which would help you skyrocket your future career and to eventually become the one on the managerial position, as that was your goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do whatever it takes to reach my goals! I didn't put up with university professors so I could boost my GPA and not work my way up to the top!\" Those were the words you thought to yourself while you were getting ready for work. Shortly after you were already out of your apartment and strolled to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were already in the company for a week, however, you were not really familiar with the atmosphere, as you were stuck in one small room with a trainer that was preparing you for what was to come. She was a beauty but from what you heard you would only see her for the first week, as she was not part of the working staff on the floor above. The week by itself went really slow, as the training was mundane, as it was but a repeat of what you had learned from your days in higher education.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurthermore, you were also distracted by your tutor's dazzling feet. Feet had always been your weakness, despite how much you tried to fight it. She was wearing nylon thigh socks which allured you even more. You had imagined how nice it would be to just have her put her legs on the desk and tell you to come to give her feet a nice and sweet rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's all! You are ready for work, I am sure you will be our top seller!\" The tutor exclaimed as the final moments of your training had come to an end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the story of how your first, arguably dull week went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow will your first workday go?</span></div></div>",

The story from here will depend on how you, the reader, would want it to go. I would love to hear what you would want to read. Feel free to contact me via a personal message.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Mr James.\" Those were the first words you heard the moment you got into the manager, Kim's office. You had to admit that Kim was a nice-looking woman, looking like she was in her late thirties or early forties. The first thing that you had ogled the moment you walked into the room was the manager's long, pale legs.<br>\r\n\"Control yourself, James.\" You said to yourself as you slowly started to speed up your heartbeat, without causing too much attention to yourself. \"I am more than glad to see Mrs Kim.  I have heard a lot of good things about you, especially when it comes to the sales jump since you became the manager in the office not too long ago. It would be an honour to work under you!\". Sucking up to the boss wasn't such a bad idea, you thought. That's how you make an excellent first impression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am glad to have such an eager employee under me! You seem like you do your homework regularly!\" Kim smiled right back at you then proceeded to send a message via iMessage on her phone.<br>\r\n\"You see, I've also done some homework on you. You graduated recently, with flying colours and have had the most outside of college work out there! It would be a shame not to take an interest in you.\" Kim slowly added.<br>\r\n\"You flatter me, Mrs Kim, I hope that I meet your expectations. At least to the point that my grading holds.\" You half-jokingly smiled at her.<br>\r\nSuddenly you heard a little opening on the manager's door. It was another woman that came in. She looked younger than Kim and also had quite beautiful looks.<br>\r\n\"James! I'd like you to meet Denise. She will be your new supervisor for the next two weeks to let you get the hang of how we do work here. She has been in the company for the past five years and is our best closer. I am sure that you can get along with her!\" Kim said with a sincere smile and looked at the both of you.<br>\r\n\"It's an honour working with you, Denise! I hope that I can learn from someone like you!\" There was no sarcasm in your voice. You were glad to hear that you were appointed a top performer on your first week off of training, especially when that meant spending more time with a beautiful young lady such as Denise.<br>\r\n\"The pleasure is all mine, James. I am glad to coach a future top seller. How about we get to it right away? There are a few clients that will need our attention in a couple of hours.\" Denise smiled back at you as she extended her right hand for a handshake. She was not someone that shied away from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does the story continue from here, Mr James? What happens after you and Denise go to her office?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Arriving at the familiar building, walking up the spiral staircase and setting foot inside the hubbub of the workplace; all of this has a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu and mundanity about it. Having worked there for nearly four years now, you practically yearned for something different, a change - anything to liven things up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, there are plenty of hot women at work, but you have always lived by the motto: \"Don't shit where you eat!\" Being a single guy in his mid 20s, part of you sometimes thinks to hell with it - why not go for an office romance? Yet there are so many reasons not to. For starters, Denise - the absolute chief bitch of the office - knows the ins and outs of all the going ons. As you have a mutual hatred for one another, she would without a doubt make it her mission to systematically destroy any burgeoning romance you could potentially build. Plus, with Candice (her partner in gossip-related crime) always at her side, word would spread so quickly, making life unbearable for sure!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, there is another reason. You have a secret - something you have kept well-hidden all your life. Something that has always held you back in relationships and made you naturally more than impressed with dominant females... You have a foot fetish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue - it should't be anything to worry about, but if Denise or Candice ever managed to find out, you would surely be the laughing stock of the office, and have your personal life completely compromised too! The thought of being embarrassed and seeing Denise's smug blonde face... Just the thought if it fills you with fear and dread! So for all these reasons, you have tried your best to keep yourself to yourself. Unfortunately for you, despite your best intentions, this strategy will not help you for much longer: starrting from today...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sit down at your desk and begin checking your emails, you see your boss, Kim walking past with an unfamiliar figure accompanying her. Resentment boils every time you see your redheaded, admittedly sexy boss. Watching her start at your office (with seemingly little experience) a year after you, and rise up the management scale to the point of being the Director of Operations - just one step below the CEO - is tough. Especially as at one point, you were neck-and-neck in terms of sales and performance. She has completely eclipsed you: something she seems to have no qualms in reminding you about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, the sight of this new stranger sends nervous excitement spreading throughout you. Turning your head to get a better look, your immediate thought is that this girl is cute, no...better than cute... seriously hot! Petite size, brown hair, a sexy white, summery dress...you can't help but stare!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James! Let me introduce you!\" Kim says in her slightly husky voice. Marching over with the newbie, you wonder if she noticed you staring...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" you say smiling, rising to your feet to shake the newcomer's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" the pretty brunette replies, her nose crinkling in a ridiculously cute fashion. You can't help but flicker your eyes over her sexy outfit - not exactly strictly professional. Then again, the dress code at work, for the women especially, is pretty relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Michelle,\" Kim states, the corners of her mouth twitching a little. \"It's her first day; I'm going to give her the full induction throughout the week, but I need someone to show her the ropes, mentor her basically. Now I know it's a big responsibility...\" She smirks a little at this, taking off her glasses for a moment. \"But mentoring a new colleague is a sure-fire way to getting promoted, you know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause. True - it would definitely be good for your career prospects. Mentoring a newbie would be strong evidence to show your capability for responsibility and sharing your expertise...but there's an uneasiness lurking that you can't shake away: this girl is so damn beautiful! What if you're unable to concentrate or find yourself unable to resist her... The way she's smiling at you could mean that your attraction is mutual...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do say, James? I haven't got all day,\" Kim speaks with curtness, folding her arms and tapping her foot impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know that whether you accept this responsibility, this challenge - and possible risk - or not, you have to make a decision quickly...</span></div></div>",

Leaving you to it, she marches away. You both watch her leave before turning back to one another, smiling awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at the newbie, you simply can't help being enamoured with her. She has such beautiful hazel eyes that you almost feel lost in them! Quickly adopting a professional manner, you gesture for her to follow you past your workstation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...first day huh? I remember when I was in your shoes. Seems like only yesterday!\" You laugh, trying to lessen some the nervousness you feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. So how long've you been here?\" She replies, observing you shrewdly. She walks so elegantly, as her bare arms swing from side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh - four years now. Anyway, let me show you some stuff..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou proceed to give her a tour of the office - showing her the main computer system, what the various manager's offices and meeting rooms are for. - mostly mundane stuff, which Michelle does little to disguise her disinterest for. Heading towards reception, you steer her away from the bitchy Candice and manoeuvre the pair of you towards where Jenny is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny smiles warmly at you, tossing some her wavy, light red hair out of her eyes. \"Hey James! So you're the new mentor...I'm really pleased for you. I honestly thought Kim would've gone with Denise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat really bugged you. Every time there is an opportunity for promotion, your arch-rival Denise would be there, exaggerating her skills and justifying why she is always the best person for the job. To be fair, Jenny was right: ever since becoming the boss, Kim has been inclined to favour Denise over practically anyone at your level. Still, you have made it your mission to prove that you are every bit as good as that blonde vixen! Plus, Jenny is your friend - your only true ally in the office; you know she means well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Michelle - and yeah I'll be mentoring her,\" you reply, grinning with the pride you feel after stating your responsibility out loud. A smile is mirrored on your friend's cute, freckly face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" Michelle says briefly, not looking as smily as she did before. \"So what else is there to show me James?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh - there're a couple more things...\" You say, following Michelle who has already started walking off. Flashing a quick, apologetic smile to Jenny, you follow the newbie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down at your desk next to her, you steal a glance down at the petite brunette's shoes. Open-toed flats, literally no heel...you can see how several of her toes are each adorned with pink nail varnish...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>said</i> will I have my own email address?\" Michelle's voice sounds more than a touch bratty as she stares expectantly at you, forcing you to refocus away from her feet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Good question...erm I'm not sure to be honest,\" you answer, caught off guard with how direct this young woman is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, sure,\" she smiles at you, but it seems more of a smirk this time. \"I mean at college I had one so I just assumed there would be one set up for me. At college, people would email me, like all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at the gorgeous newbie. Already she seems to be becoming more comfortable and confident around you. You have to admit that girls who know and speak their own mind turn you on infinitely more than passive girls...but should she be this forthright to her mentor, within the first hour of her new job? She continues to talk to you about her college degree, with more than a trace of pomposity, while you subtly flicker your eyes back down to her cute toes, which are rubbing slightly alongside one another...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, something happens that puts you in an awkward position...!</span></div></div>",

Please!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a breathy voice she started to lightly sing, \"Someone likes feet, someone likes feet.\"  Your only saving grace that no one was immediately around you right now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please just be quiet.  I'm supposed to be mentoring you.  I can't do that if you keep making false accusations.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pretty young girl's eyes flashed in victory.  You knew that she knew that she had the goods on you.  It gave her power and now the entire dynamic between the two of you had changed.  Your body posture was now meek and harried while hers was forward and aggressive.  The ball was now in her court and you could sense that she was going to take advantage of it.. but how?  </span></div></div>",

You can either let her tempt you to arousal and reveal your deepest secret to this evil little brat that you met 15 minutes ago... Or you can refuse and have her tell Kim you were perving on her, and probably lose all credibility and your chances at beating Denise to a promotion. It seems like you don't have a choice.

But things turn from bad to worse as Michelle's bare foot touches your leg. Her touch was soft, but her intent was as hard as a kick to the balls, and you felt it just as much! It was no contest, Michelle had won the second her perfect milky foot had come into contact with your leg. Hell, she had won the second her foot slipped out of her shoe. Try as you might, you could not resist her and you could not fight the blood rushing to your cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, are you serious? James, not even 10 seconds into your minute and your throbbing in your pants!\" Michelle laughs at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took her 15 minutes... 15 god damn minutes to reveal your biggest secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Michelle, fine. You win, I have a foot fetish. But that is a personal thing, it has nothing to do with work. So put your shoes back on and forget about this so we can continue with your training\" you say, one last hope of getting past this train wreck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right James, you're absolutely right\" Michelle begins. You sigh with relief as it seems Michelle is willing to look past this nonsense. \"Your foot fetish is a personal thing, yet here you are at WORK, perving on my feet and getting an erection at WORK. This is not acceptable, this is sexual harassment James. I am going to have to report you to Kim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes open wide with horror. Surely she isn't serious!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michelle, no! Please, I am begging you, don't do that!\" You begin to beg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I won't just do that James. I feel like it is my duty to tell the other ladies in the office, I mean, surely they should know if there is a guy perving on their bare feet every time they slip their shoes of at the desk to relax a bit! I feel like the two women over at reception who have been death staring you all morning have the right to know.\" Michelle continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over at the reception desk and see your two worst enemies staring back at you, Denise and Candice. You can NOT let them know about your foot fetish, if they knew they would not hesitate to ruin you. It appears Michelle has the upper hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...

I have people to text and FaceBook pages to update.  I never really did like the whole work thing anyway.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a bit appalled that the new hire didn't even want to lift a finger!  Though why should she?  She had you after all.  Her feet compelled your obedience, possibly even more so than the threat of blackmail lingering over your head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next you'll make sure that I'm viewed as a super star here at work.  I like getting praised for how awesome I am, even if it is because I suckered some loser into doing my work for me.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could kiss any future promotions goodbye.  It pissed you off that Denise was going to get one up on you quite easily from here on in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And not only will you be my work bitch but you'll also be my laundry bitch, car wash bitch, and general gofer bitch.  I don't want to lift one pretty little hand to do work when I have some pathetic foot guy on hand to do it for me.   Now if you agree with all of this seal it with one last kiss on each of my pretty little toes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a desperate desire to kiss her toes but dammit this was too much!  You would be losing all of your free time.  You would be losing all hope of promotion.  Denise would gain more power in the office and Michelle could at a whim ruin you.  If you kissed her toes you would seal your fate!  But if you didn't you better have a real good plan in place otherwise Michelle would go straight to Kim!  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's no use; Michelle has won - she knows it and deep down, you know it! Dropping back to your knees, a look of pure triumph adorns her pretty features, before you lower your head towards her gorgeous bare feet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good choice, bitch. You're mine from now on - there's nothing you can do about it,\" she says arrogantly, so much so that you almost consider jumping up and taking this bratty girl down a peg or two. But you're powerless - completely unable to resist her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing a meek kiss against her big toe, you feel your pants tighten even more. As you move your lips across sideways, each of her pink varnished toenails wiggle a little, as if to tease and gloat over your surrender to Michelle. The slightly salty, and admittedly delicious flavour dances around your tongue. It's hard to distinguish between this being the taste of pleasure or defeat! The petite brunette giggles slightly as you complete your soft kisses of the toes on one foot and proceed on to the other. Whether her laughter is because she's ticklish, or is because she's simply enjoying witnessing your capitulation is irrelevant at this point. You've given in. Completely!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some guys are just born to serve. No offence - I mean I'm sure you're good at your job and everything. But from now on, your priority is to serve <i>me</i>. I'm just better than you - that's why I'm calling the shots and you're kissing my toes like a pathetic loser-foot boy!\" She bounces her little pinkie toe against your lips - the final toe to kiss as you seal your fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stay kneeling before her, your cheeks scarlet with shame, knowing that you've just agreed to sacrifice your prospects for promotions, a plethora of your own time to be given up....just because this bratty bitch has blackmailed you, and has ridiculously hot feet, which you simply cannot resist. Her feet are so soft, so perfect...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, work bitch. Like I said to you before, you're my little errand boy from now on. For the next hour or so, I want you to fill out ALL of the paper work - all of the online tasks and assessments that I'm supposed to carry out. I've got some totally important social media stuff to take care of,\" she says pompously, beckoning you to rise back to your feet so you can continue working at your desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh - and make sure you ace EVERYTHING! I want to be the best new employee in this office. Got it?\" She smirks at you, her hazel eyes shining with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you got it,\" you sigh resignedly. You've been beaten, outmanoeuvred, dominated even by this brat - a damn sexy brat who knows exactly how to manipulate weak individuals such as yourself. Wishing you had never taken on the responsibility of being a mentor, you start cracking on with Michelle's various assessment tasks: the ones she should be doing herself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next hour passes awkwardly; Michelle lets out giggles as she updates her Facebook, twitter, or whatever else it is she is basically procrastinating around on her computer with. Every minute or so, you can't help but steal a look at the sight of her sexy feet, sometimes running against one another, occasionally sliding tantalisingly up and down her office chair. Just when you think your erection is about to subside, it returns again, just at the thought of her bare feet! The petite brunette seems well aware of your flustered state, as she hums and sings with apparent, false innocence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little while longer, Michelle's sharp tone snaps you away from your online assessment task you are completing for her. \"Are you done yet? When can I see the results for what an office superstar I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, gimme a minute,\" you mumble, trying to ensure that you give Michelle as flawless a record as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, let's try that again, work bitch. When I speak to you, you address me with some damn respect. Are you done yet, bitch?\" She says, practically sneering at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumiliation swirls inside you, yet you have no fight in you to disobey this confident young woman. Just as you are about to answer again, in a more obsequious manner, something happens...</span></div></div>",

You were in a state of pure shock.  You had just been found out by the senior manager!  You didn't know what to do or say.  You looked helplessly at Michelle who grinned confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing much.  Just making sure my 'mentor' understands the facts of life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were shocked by the bratty girl's confidence!  It was one thing to put you under her thumb.  You had a foot fetish and a submissive streak.  It was quite another to try to do the same thing to the manager who was a woman!  How was Kim going to react?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKin arched an eyebrow.  \"This is not appropriate work place language or an appropriate relationship to have.  I need both of you in my office now.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood shakily onto your feet.  What was going to happen?  Were you going to get fired?  Were you going to get demoted?  Filled with worry you followed after Michelle who confidently walked behind Kim like she had done nothing wrong.  What was going through her head?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim opened her office door and you both filed in.  She motioned and you both took seats in front of her oak desk.  To say that you were nervous would have been the understatement of the century.  What the hell was going to happen?  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I want you both to explain exactly what the hell that was.\" Kim states with pauses on the brink of fury while massaging her <br>\r\nglabella in clear disbelief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour nerves threaten to tighten the grip they have on your throat, but nonetheless you try to explain yourself as best as you can... only to get immediately interrupted by Michelle's bratty voice \"I told you! I was just showing my mentor where his place in life is, at my feet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you try to explain the situation but you are interrupted before uttering a word, this time by Kim \"And do you think that whatever that was is an appropriate work behavior?! You just got here and you already think you have the right to act like that?\" After that, even if Kim had interrupted you, you can't help but feel thankful for her words, as furious as she is at least she is clearly defending you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Michelle still seems unfazed by Kim's anger and she simply shrugs at Kim \"What can I say? I've always had my way around things!\" she says with a cheeky grin on her pretty lips, so seeing how things are getting rather tense you decide it is best to step away from them both since Kim's anger seems to be growing by the minute... and you are so very glad it seems to be only targeted at Michelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just got here <i>today</i>, miss\" Kim starts \"I assigned you one of my best workers to help you kickstart your career, and you just order him around and make him serve you like he's some kind of... some kind of <i>slave</i>?!\" By this point Kim has turned red with anger, but you still feel thankful for what she is doing. She is your boss, and seems to be acting like a proper boss, something way better than you expected, especially because Michelle's treatment seems to have left you with the impression that they both would jump against you simply for being a man, and one with a foot fetish at that. But still, for some reason it also feels like Kim's anger doesn't just come from a professional stand-point, but rather something more personal, and you slightly amuse yourself at the thought that it may be jealousy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but he <i>IS</i> my slave, Mrs. boss-woman!\" Michelle returns sarcastically with her smile unfaded as she takes off the shoe of the foot you kissed \"He even signed his contract riiiiight here\" she continues while pointing at the exact spot where you kissed her foot, a sight that makes Kim turn towards you in disbelief \"So you DID kiss her foot?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more you open your mouth to respond, but you get interrupted by Michelle right away \"Oh not only did he kiss it, he also enjoyed it!\" she says merrily \"And chances are he will do it again! Come here slave, give the lady a demonstration.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you were not in enough of a shock already, you definitely are now, Michelle's words come out so naturally, so dominant, so confident that nothing will go wrong for her, and you almost feel compelled to obey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you bloody DARE to listen to her!\" comes the voice of Kim, stopping you on the spot. \"I am your boss and you will do as I say!\" she needlessly adds, but Michelle goes as far as to defy Kim's authority \"Yes maybe... But he is <i>mine</i> now, aren't you, little slave?\" she adds while pointing at you with her bare foot and making a mock pouty face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point you are completely uncertain of what to do. On one hand you know that Kim is your boss, and she beyond anyone else has the right to give you orders... but on the other hand Michelle's foot is hanging there, practically ordering you to kiss it, something that you will probably never get tired of doing and that you would be more than happy to do. One way or another this seems like a definitive decision that will decide how things will go from here on out.</span></div></div>",

I am not 'yours' and I will not give in to your stupid demands.\" You continue while admittedly surprised at your own new-found courage. Maybe Kim's passion about the subject rubbed off on you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Michelle doesn't seem to take your words seriously, for she makes a mocking face even though she seems to be growing angry herself \"Oh I'm sorry, but didn't you already give in? Namely earlier right before this nagging hag caught you while worshiping me?\" Michelle blurts out while pointing at Kim during the mention of the words 'nagging hag', something that may well have surprised you more than Kim herself... but that is not to say that Kim was without reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you call me you little...?!\" Kim starts but Michelle freely interrupts her. \"Little what? 'Little bitch' is that what you want to say? Go ahead! Say it! Oh but I'm sorry, maybe that is not 'appropiate language' for you hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tension between these two just doesn't stop growing, and by this point you could even swear that it has become palpable, but like Kim mentioned this is a work environment and even as shaken as you are because of all of this you decide that it is best to cool things down before anyone gets actually hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok ladies this is getting out of hand, why don't we...?\" You start, but all of a sudden both of them roar at you with \"Shut your mouth!\" almost on chorus, with the only difference being Michelle adding the word \"Bitch\" at the end of her order, so pretty much all you seem to be able to do now is to stay quiet and let the titans clash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You little unworthy smudge of dirt...\" Kim starts, showing off how even her insults sound more decorous than whatever Michelle says \"I accepted you in this office because I though you showed promise, ambition and dedication, but not even one day goes by and you already find yourself giving orders, to your very mentor no less, belittling him, making him do YOUR work, and making him kiss your feet like you are some sort of goddess?!\" she says with a big amount of spite in every word \"Oh honey, I AM a goddess\" Michelle returns with just as much spite despite her cocky grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment it seems like Kim is about to lose it, like she is going to scream despite the workers unaware of the situation outside, but instead she simply closes her eyes, takes a deep breath, and after a short moment she opens her eyes back up to say in a very calm tone \"Get out, you're fired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim's words bring an unexpected grateful smile to your lips, but even more unexpected is the fact that Michelle seems to be genuinely surprised by them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! You can't fire me, you bitch!\" Michelle starts with complete shock and anger in her voice, threatening to rise Kim's anger again, but Kim doesn't grant her that \"Yes I can, I am your boss and that is how things work, 'honey' \" Kim states in an oddly collected way before continuing with a chuckle and a grin of her own \"Well I guess I am not your boss anymore, but you know what I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would fire ME over this SISSY here?!\" Michelle continues with her tantrum while pointing at you as if expecting YOU to be fired instead, but again Kim is quick to bring her argument \"This 'sissy' as you so delicately put it, has been serving me and this office well for quite a few years now, so yes, I'd rather keep the good worker that has done nothing wrong other than falling for your <b><i>bullshit </i></b>than keeping the bratty new girl who just got here to pout and make others do her work. So good luck finding a new job after this! Well other than as a prostitute of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour smile widens automatically as you hear Kim defending you with so much resolve, even if this was the most logical thing to do for your boss you still feel grateful to Kim beyond belief, not only for getting rid of Michelle for you (and by extension any problems that she may cause in the future for knowing your fetish), but also for showing that even as stern and bossy as she is, Kim still cares deeply for her loyal employees. And loyal you certainly are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment you notice that Michelle's tantrum has caused her to speak in gibberish. Between her whimpering and insults nor you nor Kim can manage to make out any concrete statements, but after a while Michelle collects herself enough to say \"How do you fucking think I went through college?! I made all of my male teachers my obedient little bitches!\" to which Kim simply shrugs before giving Michelle a piercing victorious glare \"Sorry kid, this one has an owner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs amusing as seeing Michelle suffer this way was, you immediately stop smiling as you hear these last words from Kim. What did she mean by that? Was this just a cinematic way to finally push Michelle out of the building, or did Kim have a deeper intent in her choice of words? Whatever the case, Michelle seems to be clearly defeated, so she simply says \"FINE keep your feet loving freak and your shitty ass work, I DON'T NEED ANY OF THAT!\" before storming out of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour smile barely begins to return to your lips at the sight of Michelle's departure, sure you may miss that pair of precious feet, but you sure as hell will not miss that bratty bitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Kim that was awesome!\" You say wholeheartedly while still thinking of a proper way to thank her, but even though Kim is in a calmer state now that Michelle is gone, she still interrupts you taking command of the situation while sitting on her desk \"James, why did you kiss her feet?\" She asks simply, the directness of her words freezing you in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel tempted to play around, to make up a lie and say that Michelle wasn't being serious, but this whole situation started precisely because Kim caught you on the act. She saw your defeat before Michelle, so defying her statement would bring no good to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh... well I...\" you try to respond, only for Kim to encourage your words in a reassuring way \"James you can say it, I won't judge you for it.\" And so, with her calm voice you finally give in \"I'm sorry Kim... I have a foot fetish and I... well I kinda got carried along...\" you reluctantly say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't say\" she wittily responds. \"I suppose I don't need to tell you that such behavior can be severely punished, and I know that Michelle took advantage of her discovery, but now that I know this too I need to tell you that you need to keep things under control...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim goes on with her soft lecture and all you can bring yourself to do is to nod in resignation, still not being able to believe that someone, let alone a rookie, could break you so easily just by using your fetish.</span></div></div>",

I'll control it I promise...\" you say in a way that admittedly made you sound and feel like a kid who was being lectured for not doing his homework or for not paying attention in class, a feeling that only increased thanks to Kim's formal appearance and her professional attitude. Even so, Kim didn't seem to want to be as dismissive as you. \"Take a seat James, this will take a while.\" she asked-- no, <i>ordered</i>, and seeing how the only places to sit at were either her own office chair or the ones in front of her desk, you decide to seat on the one where her feet aren't resting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How have you been controlling it so far, James?\" she suddenly asks as soon as you sit down while ominously staring down at you with expectancy shining in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well uh... it-it isn't that hard really.\" You utter, making yourself feel more nervous with each word you let out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And yet the rookie made you admit it within her first day of working here...\" Kim adds while crossing her legs as support for her arms while she raised an eyebrow at you \"Which leads me to believe that it isn't that hard to discover either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well I...\" You clear your throat \"She was pushy about it... you saw how she was, and besides, it's not like any other woman in the building has caught me glaring at their-\" You quickly cover your mouth in a cartoony way after realizing what you were to say... to <i>admit</i>, that being something that Kim would probably not be glad to hear or know... regardless, it is too late now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At their feet.\" Kim completes your sentence with an unfazed tone but a piercing glance, to which you couldn't bring yourself to respond to properly due to a lack of arguments to defend yourself with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim allows the short moment of silence to remain, forcing you to resign at the fact that she already knew all that she needed to know about your fetish. \"What do you think would happen if another woman caught you staring at her feet?\" Kim asks dryly \"Don't you think this event would be repeated? Don't you think she might want to take advantage of that information? Or what if she takes it in a different way and files in a report of sexual harassment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim's rapid fire of questions make you blush immediately as you realize that you hadn't taken such scenarios into consideration before because you never though they would happen, but today's encounter with the goddess-wannabe that is Michelle proved that thought wrong. What if Denise or Candice came to know of your fetish as well and tried to abuse you through it? What if Jenny heard of it and lost all respect for you? What if Jacinta took advantage of it by trying to seduce you with her feet? Would you be able to resist? Would you be able to bear with the humiliation?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's the thing, James.\" Kim continues \"The rumor is going to spread, I am almost certain of that, and people are going to want to tease you about it, maybe even test you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you listen to her you simply keep your head down trying not to glance sideways to where Kim\u2019s feet were sitting, but despite your efforts you still manage to see out of the corner of your eye that one of her shoes started dangling off.<br>\r\n\u201cBut that won\u2019t happen if you are\u2026\u201d Kim continues before clearing her throat for extra emphasis \u201c<i>satisfied</i>\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSatisfied?\u201d You ask while looking up at her \u201cWhat do you\u2026?\u201d And right before finishing your question a sudden blur of movement and a clacking sound take your eyes back down to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim had taken her pump off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight, as well as the situation, prove to be enough to make you blush right off the bat. Despite your previous attempts to avoid looking at her feet before you can\u2019t help but stare now that they caught your attention and her toes were deliberately pointing at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is why, in order to avoid further incidents like the one presented today with Michelle, I am\u2026 <i>willing</i> to let you\u2026 you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim\u2019s words come out between stutters and semi-whispers that she had never expressed before, she\u2019s usually collected and cold about everything but her sudden change of attitude from commanding to\u2026 <i>shy?</i> does peek your interest away from her foot and back to her face. Sure enough, Kim was blushing as she clearly struggled to keep eye contact with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-do not misunderstand the situation, James!\u201d she starts trying to regain her authoritative figure \u201cIf I am offering this to you is because I do not need NOR want another useless drama making people waste precious time that they could be using at work! So if you are willing to take my offer just say it at once instead of ogling at me like a magazine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 you want me to indulge..?\u201d you start only to be interrupted again by Kim\u2019s nervous words \u201cOh for crying out loud yes! Now do you want to accept or should I just fire you when the next Michelle appears?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou come to realize that you actually kind of like this side of Kim, the oh so mighty boss of the office is literally asking you if you want to use her feet to keep yourself at bay\u2026 but alas, she is still your boss. \u201cS-sure! I mean, if you\u2019re cool with it then\u2026\u201d you pause to look at her still waiting foot. While it was not Michelle\u2019s, this foot proved that Kim took good care of them for not only did she seem to have a fresh layer of nail polish under her nylons, but you could also make out how smooth her foot was if the appearance alone was anything to go by \u201cI mean your foot does look quite pretty\u201d you add with a cheeky smile, something that made her blush a shade darker meaning that she was actually flattered by your comment even if the frown she threw at you in response said otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut like\u2026\u201d you continue \u201cWhat WOULD I be allowed to do?\u201d a question that seemingly helped Kim regain some of her composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, foot rubs seem like an obvious way to start, being the boss has me walking here and there all day and these pumps are not exactly comfortable for that kind of treatment so I can agree to have you massage my feet at a certain hour\u2026 but\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t\u2026 mind\u2026\u201d And just like that, Kim\u2019s words start to get more and more muffled with every pause, so much so that you can\u2019t make out the last thing she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm? You wouldn\u2019t mind what?\u201d you ask with genuine curiosity, making her sigh and close her eyes with an annoyed look. \u201cLICKING\u2026 Iwouldn\u2019tmindlicking\u2026 if you want to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you weren\u2019t surprised enough before you certainly were now. To think that KIM, your BOSS would be okay with you licking her feet after a long day of work? You just can\u2019t help but feel like you\u2019re dreaming!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while Kim clearly noticed your dumbfounded look and quickly realized it was due to this confusion of yours, so she decides to speak up again. \u201cLook I\u2026\u201d she starts in a gentle and somewhat stern tone \u201cI have dated men with foot fetishes before and\u2026 well if one thing is for certain is that they know how to properly treat a lady\u2019s feet so\u2026 while I am not asking you to date me, I figured we could both take something out of this situation because\u2026 well\u2026 I haven\u2019t dated in a while\u2026 I get tired and\u2026 and my feet miss being pampered.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour disbelief simply refuses to go away. Here you have a golden opportunity practically begging to be taken\u2026 but at the same time, is it wise to do with your boss?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For today though, just give me a foot massage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then.\" You get to work rubbing her feet. You would want to do more to her, but she insisted on only a massage for now.

For the most part it was business as usual with the occasional coworker coming by to express how sorry they were and give their best wishes. The only exception was when you ran into Denise by the vending machine. Rather than giving you the snark she usually does, she avoids eye contact until her bag of chips falls down, with a friend. She pulled out both bags and, in a move that still has you suprised hours later, threw you the extra bag. \"Don't get used to it\" is all she said before going back to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now the end of your work day. You packed up your work for the day and got in the elevator heading down to the parking lot. As you exited, you saw Kim standing by what you assume to be her car. To your suprise, it was one of those bright red convertible sports cars pop culture just loved to put everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About time you finished James. Come on, I'll lead you to my home.\" She jumps in her car and starts the engine. Meanwhile, you run to your own car and get in, trying not to fall behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you both arrive at Kim's house, it was every bit as nice as you thought. Two stories, a nice big lawn, you even saw a swimming pool in her back yard. \"Come on in, I'll show you to your room.\" Kim says, waving you inside. You grab your things and head in. It was every bit as big and nice looking inside as out. She brings you to a door. \"Here we are.\" She opens the door and your eyes widen. While the room itself was rather plain looking, it was certainly a step up. The room itself was bigger than your whole apartment. Rather than a couch with a bed inside, this was a king-sized bed ready for someone to use it. \"I'll give you some time to get unpacked and settle in. I'll be downstairs in the living room... <i>preparing</i>.\" She says with a sly smile before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take you long to put your clothes away and get your other items set up as you wanted. You head downstairs and see Kim sitting on her couch with her bare feet up on the coffee table, and around them, various foot care products. Files, polishes, lotions, oils, you name it. She even laid out a can of whipped cream. \"So James, shall we begin our first session?\" You nod and sit down by her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you start?</span></div></div>",

So you decided that you should spend your first time getting that fill. You lean in and give a deep, audible sniff of her feet, followed by several faster sniffs. They had a sweet, fruity smell to them, implying that she had though washed them the night before in preparation. Kim let's out a giggle as the air from your nose is actually tickling her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you've had your fill of their smell, you decide it's time to move on. She's scrunching her soles at you, still glistening with sweat from a hard day's work. You stick out your tongue and give her a long lick from the heel of her foot all the way up to her big toe. She tries in vain to fight back a moan of pleasure at the feeling. You continue to lick her feet, feeling every wrinkle on her soles as you go, and giving one of her toes a kiss when you reach them. Soon, you stop being exclusive and spread kisses across her sole. Meanwhile, Kim was trying not to laugh at how much your efforts were tickling her. She lays her feet flat, giving you access to the tops, which you lick and kiss with equal ferver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, Kim was in heaven. Not only did it feel good to be pampered again, it felt even better to have a man appreciate her body again. She didn't care that James was her employee, all she cared about was that he was worshipping her like a goddess. She pulled her feet away from James, internally chuckling at the whine of disappointment he made. \"Okay James, time for dessert.\" She took the can of whipped cream in her hands and pips of the top. She then squirts a dollop of cream in between each of her toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith as much joy as a small child on Christmas morning, you dive in, sticking your tongue in between her toes and lapping the cream like it was vital to survive. You even took her big toe in your mouth and began to suck on it. At this point, Kim no longer bothered to hold back her laughs, your treatment tickled too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith every last bit of cream cleaned and her feet now spotless and kissed from top to bottom, you step back and admire your work. \"That felt amazing James. Now then...\"</span></div></div>",

How's it all going?\" She looks between the two of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great...really great!\" You reply instantly. \"Michelle's gone through all the necessary induction procedures and has aced the initial online assessment task..look, I've got the results right here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim peers over her glasses, her expression clearly conveying approval. \"Wow, I don't think I've ever seen a score that high from a newbie!\" She looks across at Michelle and smiles. \"Well done. I am extremely impressed! James, what was your initial assessment score when you started?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel your cheeks reddening at the fact that Kim is saying this right in front of Michelle. \"Er...well...well, her score is over 30 percent higher than mine was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim practically ignores you as she continues to stare at Michelle. \"<i>Very</i> impressive. So, James here must be quite the mentor, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle shrugs, a look of apparent sincerity about her. \"I'm a quick learner to be honest. I've had to speed James up a bit, you know try to cut out his waffle a bit. The assessment was pretty easy. I did similar things in college - I reckon I'm ready to move to the next level!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...such ambition! Reminds me of...<i>me</i>.\" Kim and Michelle exchange grins, while you look uselessly between them, powerless to prevent Michelle from taking all of the credit for her impressive score. You did it for her! Still, you can't say anything, knowing that Michelle could reveal your secret at any time... Michelle's made you her bitch all right!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour redhead boss frowns for a moment as she glances down at the floor, noticing that your trainee is barefoot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No shoes, huh? What's that all about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging again, the cute brunette gives Kim an innocent smile. \"Oh, I just find it more comfortable. It's not a problem, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim pauses for a moment before breaking into a smile. \"What the hell - if it gets you scores like that, you can be barefoot as much as you like!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart sinks; Michelle being told not to be barefoot could help restore some sense of pride or self-respect, allowing you to stand up to the brat...who are you kidding! You're her willing work bitch now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You OK, James?\" Kim raises her eyebrows, staring directly at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle sighs. \"He does this a lot. Don't worry, I can deal with it. James, now print out my assessment results so we can analyse the data.\" The petite brunette says this with such authority that you find yourself meekly nodding and standing to your feet at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like Michelle's the one training you!\" Kim chuckles at you before turning on her heel and stalking away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good work, bitch,\" Michelle says smugly as she looks up at you, one foot swaying hypnotically from side to side. \"Now, I'm going to go out with some friends for brunch. If anyone asks, just explain that I'm familiarising myself with some other department in the office. You'll think of something. You can do my induction tasks. I want an ever higher score than last time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stands up, slipping her shoes back on and staring challengingly at you, hands on her hips. \"Oh, I want my car cleaned too. You can't miss it - it's a white BMW 3 series. My number plate is 'Mich Wins'. I'll be back at lunch so get it done before then. I want it so clean that I can see my face in the windscreen!

Michelle smirks in satisfaction as she slinks away, leaving you to stand hopelessly in front of your computer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing and sitting down, you begin working on her next assessment task. You can't help but rue the fact that Michelle is getting all the plaudits from Kim for doing absolutely nothing! And now leaving this early in the day for brunch with friends?!

Sighing with resignation, you dutifully do as you're told, working away on the next assignment task, which - at your level - is not particularly challenging. Still, it takes time as there are over two hundred multiple choice questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether you like it or not, you simply have to accept that Michelle is going to become Kim's favourite very soon! The way the two women were practically ignoring you as they revelled in Michelle's success is a cringing one. <i>And it's all because of your foot fetish!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the last few years, since working at this office, you've never let anyone - female or otherwise - take advantage of you. Your foot fetish has never been an issue. Perhaps that's why you've been overly macho, talking down to the likes of Denise and Candice, in order to convince yourself that you're an alpha male. Well, Michelle has certainly dispelled any illusions of that now! Cursing yourself for being so stupid as to let this brat discover your fetish, now exploit it to the max, you refocus on the task in hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA half hour or so later, you're done. 95%! That is slightly higher than the initial assessment...Michelle will be pleased! Remembering that all this means is that Kim will be even more impressed with the cute brunette, you let out another defeated sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you've done the third task, again averaging 95%, you remember Michelle's other task - cleaning her car! Checking the time, it's now past midday. Almost lunch time! Thinking it best to borrow some cleaning supplies from the janitor's office, you manage to retrieve a bucket, water, sponge and cleaning fluid without Helena, the janitor who seems to hate your guts, see you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSneaking into the car park, you look nervously around but no one appears to be here. It doesn't take you long to find Michelle's car. The numberplate 'Mich Wins' is obviously customised and sums up your situation succinctly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet her Daddy bought this for her,\" you mutter quietly aloud as you begin sponging the windscreen of the BMW 3 series. Even though she's several years younger than you, she has a more expensive car. Soon she's going to be earning more money than you, you grimly muse to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make sure to do a thorough job of cleaning Michelle's car, wiping clean every single square inch of the vehicle, including the alloys and even under some of the car. Being careful not to get any water or dirt on your shirt or pants, you begin trudging away, back to the office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is interesting!\" A familiar voice behind you stops you dead in your tracks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is it?</span></div></div>",

I am not the one...\" She nods in the direction of Michelle's car. \"Being a car cleaning bitch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReeling a little from her blunt assessment, you try to keep your cool. \"Me...cleaning her car. Oh, it's nothing....I was just checking something for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pa!\" She sees through your bullshit straight away. Walking closer to you with a hand on one hip she clicks at the bucket of water and sponge. \"So, what's all this. Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlowering at the janitor, you revert to your cold manner with her. \"Whatever. It's no big deal. Thank you <i>so</i> much for borrowing your valuable cleaning equipment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround a year ago, Denise and Candice took it upon themselves to make Helena absolutely hate you. Initially, you tried to explain that these were just lies that you never called her \"just a cleaning woman\". Unfortunately, the Hispanic janitor did not believe you and has despised you ever since! In turn, you've returned her hostility, meeting her glares with your own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sarcastic retort seems to please her, as if to confirm to her that you are a real jerk. \"I didn't let you borrow my stuff...<i>gringo</i>. So you better apologise to me. Now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha! You really think I'm gonna apologise to <i>you</i>?\" You scoff, shaking your head and walking away from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apologise now, you piece of shit, or I'm gonna tell boss lady Kim! I'll tell her that you stole my things, then cleaned that new girl's car!\" She shouts angrily, making you - for the second time - be rooted to the spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New girl...how do you...?\" Your words trail off uselessly as Helena points to the number plate 'Mich Wins'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I met <i>Michelle</i> this morning,\" Helena says with a glint in her eyes. \"Ha - whoud'a thought that little piece of skirt would have you by the balls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She doesn't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I want that too. To have you bow down to me and show me some fucking respect! You've been a patronising bastard to me for the last year and I've had enough!\" She interrupts you, a look of triumph adorning her hard, yet pretty features. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you...want?\" You gulp, trying to assert some authority over the situation, but finding it increasingly difficult to do so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirks as she walks right up to you, her breathing a little wild. \"Bow down to me and apologise for being a jerk to me. Promise from now on you will show me respect! If you do that, then I won't tell Miss Kim about how you're 'helping' that new girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a decisive look about her that's hard to refuse. Being ordered around today by yet another woman...are you really going to allow yourself to go through with this?!</span></div></div>",

You haven't got into the position you're in by people - a janitor of all people - walking over you! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up from her croc shoes and meet her smirk, causing her pretty eyes to widen in surprise. \"What...what's so funny, gringo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are,\" you retort, giving her your best smug look as you begin walking away from her. \"You can tell Kim whatever you want.

Having a foot fetish is one thing, but being blackmailed by the frickin' janitor...you are not going to hit that new low!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring Helena's furious yells, you smile to yourself as you feel like you're walking on clouds. By pushing you this far, the Hispanic janitor has actually made you stronger than ever, rather than broken you! You grimace as you think about how easily you allowed Michelle to run roughshod all over you this morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That little brat,\" you growl to yourself. It's not too late to redress things - at the moment it would only be your word against Michelle's, if the newbie would attempt to dob you in to Kim. Chewing this over, you stop by at one of the reception desks - not that bitch Candice, who gives you a customary glare, but to your friend, Jenny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Jenny! How are you this fine afternoon?\" You ask her with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cute redhead returns it. \"Not as well as you, apparently! Is it because you're, like, the most awesome mentor in the world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink for a moment before realising what she means. Of course, word of Michelle's initial assessment scores must have spread around the office like wildfire. Trying to be modest, you smile at her. \"Well, you know, she's a quick learner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour friend leans in, as if she's about to tell you something confidential. Jenny has been a loyal friend to you for several years now. Admittedly, you've never felt any romantic inclination towards her. Perhaps it's because she's such a useful ally that you wouldn't want to risk compromising the strong working relationship you have with her. She always keeps you up to speed with Denise, Candice and the other goings on at the office, which have proved invaluable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...Denise is really pissed. Kim told her that this newbie is amazing. She's freaking out that you're gonna get some massive promotion, and that the rookie is gonna move up the ladder - above her - too!\" She grins at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart sinks a little. Truthfully, Kim is not impressed with you at all; she made it crystal clear that it is solely Michelle who has earned brownie points. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Jenny frowns at you. \"Thought you would be loving it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou consider confiding in Jenny. She has proven to be a confidant, friend and ultimately someone that you can trust. But telling her about Michelle is certainly risky....</span></div></div>",

From the moment that you've worked here, she has been your nemesis. <i>Thank God she doesn't know about your fetish</i>... you can't help but suddenly think, considering your current predicament with Michelle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's popped out. Office supplies,\" you tell her coldly and curtly, giving her the most unbothered expression that you can muster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer returning gaze is equally icy. \"Office supplies? Really? Well I'll just wait here until she gets back. I can't <i>wait</i> to meet the girl who Kim is apparently calling a 'natural'.\" She sits next to you and folds her arms. \"Since when did you become so good at training, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but smirk. \"Oh, you know. Some of us are just 'naturals', I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise rolls her eyes and checks her fingernails. \"Yeah, whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" You can't resist taunting her. \"Worried that you'll be out of a job?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, James, don't even try attempting to banter with me. You know I'll win,\" She gives you a smirk wider than yours. \"And don't worry, anyone who's anyone in this office knows that I'm better than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you hate her, it feels almost good to be exchanging barbs with Denise. After being so thoroughly humbled by Michelle, and embarrassed in front of Kim, it's like you're returning to your old self. Grinning at your blonde nemesis, you realise that it will be dangerous to keep her here when Michelle could be back at any moment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, much as I'd enjoy this intellectual back-and-forth, I better crack on.\" You gesture to your computer while Denise pulls a face.

Shaking the thought away, you hear footsteps coming toward you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey bitch!\" Michelle says cheerily, plonking herself down in the chair next to you.

All thoughts of standing up to her were swept aside the moment she called you a bitch and was barefoot next to you.

Maybe she has been walking around barefoot all afternoon, you can't help but muse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgreeing to complete the fifth and final module, Michelle sits next to you a little longer, messaging friends on Facebook and talking politely to anyone who happens to stop by. She's damned good at giving the impression of being a studious, conscientious rookie. A talented rookie who is clearly a natural at the office. Frustratingly, word has got around that it's in no way thanks to you. Even Denise can't help but be impressed with her, especially now that she knows you're not getting the plaudits for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, imagine if you were <i>my</i> protege...I'd be getting you 100%!\" Denise says with a smirk as she nods approvingly at the scores Michelle shows her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, James is...\" Michelle pauses as if politely thinking of something positive to say. \"You, know, he knows where everything is. Coffee?\" She looks at you, while Denise looks between the two of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah, thanks,\" you murmur, glad that you've been shown some respect in front of Denise at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle stares at you. \"I meant for me. You want one too, right Denise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumiliated, you avoid looking Denise in the eye as you scurry off to make your nemesis and conqueror coffees. As you come back minutes later, you see that Candice has joined them. Great, this is the last thing you need. Approaching them, Candice gives you a smug grin while practically licking her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A coffee for me too. Black, no sugar. Thanks James!\" She gives you the fakest smile, before turning back to giggle with the other two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurning red with embarrassment you stay fixed to the spot. Michelle ordering you to get coffee is one thing, but that piece of work Candice - Denise's best friend... \"James, I said COFFEE. BLACK. NO SUGAR...\" The brunette receptionist says, while all three women stare at you. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her hazel ones are shining with triumph. In the time it took you to fetch the coffee, she must have relayed to the other two how easily she has manipulated and seduced you. Your eyes lower down...but how much has she said; has she mentioned her feet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are such a jerk. Well, <i>were</i> suck a jerk. Since your little crush on Michelle has made you all weak and helpless, we're gonna take full advantage!\" Denise says with triumph, leaning back in your chair and smirking at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crush?\" You say uneasily, as you look between your blonde nemesis and Michelle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya, that's right James. You told me before, you're totally in love with me. And this was, like, an hour into training me. I knew then that I could make you do whatever I say. It's no big deal - everyone has an office crush at some point. I just couldn't help but tell Denise and Candice,\" the beautiful brunette smiles at the other two. \"Sorry, I didn't realise that you're not friends. But if you've really been a jerk in the past, you should say sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry?\" You repeat, dumbfounded. Michelle is good, you have to admit. She's backed you into a corner - deliberately not telling the others about your foot fetish, knowing that you're desperate to avoid this secret from being revealed! Sighing with resignation, you know that her version of events to Denise and Candice - that you're infatuated with her and just can't say no to her, is far better than the actual truth - that's it's not just Michelle but her feet too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, they know that you're hopeless, that I've practically talked you through the assessments myself. I can't help it - I am a natural,\" Michelle says, biting her lip a little. \"But if you want them...\" She points either side of her at Denise and Candice...\"To go easy on you and not tell everyone that you're in love with me, then you need to say it: sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan you really do this? Apologise to your least two favourite people in the world? If you don't, Michelle could make things far, far worse for you...</span></div></div>",

What the hell have you gotten yourself into?! The only saving grace is that Michelle did not reveal your fetish. That would make life as you know it truly over. As you hurry back to your workstation, you see Candice has found another office chair and is sitting on Michelle's other side. As instructed, you kneel down before Denise's brunette pal and present her with the drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandice peers into it, nodding approvingly. \"Good job - at least you can do something right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that gives me an idea! Every day, you have to make Candice and I a coffee. 9 o'clock sharp!\" Denise says, looking down at you with a superior look on her face. Your cheeks burning red with shame, you glance at Michelle who is nodding approvingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, this has been like, so cool!\" Michelle gushes. \"But I gotta get back to work. Stop by any time. Like I said, James is my widdle puppy dog now...aren't you?\" She pouts at you, while you hang your head and nod dejectedly. This makes Denise and Candice explode with laughter once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrushing a tear of laughter away from her eye, Denise sighs. \"This is too much. Michelle, you totally deserve whatever promotion you get. It'll be worth it, especially now my so-called rival has been put in his place!\" The blonde fixes you with a steely look. \"You're zero competition from now on, loser. One word against me, one sniff of a promotion ahead of me and I - or Candice - will tell everyone we know that you're a lovesick puppy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stands up with her friend, the two giggling happily as they casually stride past you and away, giving Michelle a cheery wave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle looks down at you with contempt. \"You are a lucky bitch. I could have told them sooooo much more! For not doing what you were told and for nearly embarrassing me, you can do the rest of my work while I take the rest of the day off! If anyone asks where I've, like, gone, tell 'em something believable. You got all that, bitch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, boss,\" you say humbly as you stare at the ground at her feet, watching her soles lift up off the ground as they walk away from you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing what you're told, you do the final module for Michelle, which takes several hours. Scoring 99% on it should be a cause of celebration. All it means is more praise for the rookie, a ton of work still for you to do and very little sleep tonight. Fortunately no one comes over to ask why Michelle has left early. Picturing her strolling barefoot to her BMW, with 'Mich Wins' on the the number plate, you let out a small moan. There really are winners and losers in life; it's obvious who is which!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim stops by to wonder why you're still at work. \"I'm staying late due to my conference meeting...why are you still here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you know, catching up on some work...I..I guess I'm a little slow today,\" you tell her, knowing it's best to denigrate yourself than risk Michelle getting any questions her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, right. Anyway, that Michelle. How did she score on the other modules? How many has she done now, 3?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five,\" you reply, causing Kim to practically swoon. \"And she's scored an average of 97.5%. 99% in the last module alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Kim says softly. \"She really is a smart little cookie. Bet you're feeling lucky you get to brush shoulders with someone that talented! Five modules in a day, for a rookie. Right, tomorrow James you're going to get her straight onto sales. I know that's unprecedented but I reckon we've got a diamond here. Let's not hold her back with anymore paperwork. Get her selling and do the paperwork for her. You got that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod rather numbly as she gives you a hurried goodbye. Michelle has already superseded you and Kim has no qualms in relegating you to a supporting role. After finally finishing some paperwork that was due hours earlier, you finally leave your desk and head towards your car. As you do, you see Helena, the janitor, walking in the other direction. Remembering how rude you were to her earlier, you have the sudden urge to clear the air. She's not someone you want to stay pissed off with you....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After cumming into your boxers after a mere twenty seconds of being erect, you drift off into a troubled sleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking the next morning, still in the caked boxers, you realise you've overslept. Getting ready in record time, you are still ten minutes late getting to work. Racing over to your workstation, you begin babbling your apologies, only falling silent when you see Kim is standing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not good, James. Not good at all!\" She frowns at you, shaking her head while Michelle fakes a concerned look, her bare feet gently swinging around. \"Anyway, your lateness only seems to confirm your incompetence to me. Now, tell me about that client you have - you know, the one who's planning a big order...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou relay the details of the potential buyer you have in Dubai. Michelle takes notes and nods in all the right places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooo,\" the gorgeous brunette says when you've finished explaining. \"I have to basically push him to go 15% more, then it's a done deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a nervous laugh. \"You'll never get 15%, trust me. If you get 5%, it will be huge. That's what I was going to do....today...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim dismisses this with a wave. \"James, you're here to give the details. Now, make notes while Michelle makes the call. I want all the reports, charts, graphs and data typed up for Michelle. She'll take the lead and you'll do the admin, basically.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling humiliated by your boss's complete lack of faith in you and her trust in this rookie who you faked the assessments for, you merely nod as she walks away and wishes Michelle luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...boss...you want me to make the call?\" You ask Michelle humbly as you sit next to her, now in the assistant's chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggles as she playfully taps your leg with one foot. \"Why would I want you to do that, bitch? I'm gonna do your job better than you ever could! Now, get those reports thingies and all the boring stuff ready while I show you why I'm your boss...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at her, both mortified and impressed with her nerve. What if she ruins the deal? What if...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour questions become irrelevant as Michelle confidently speaks to the client, adopting a far more professional tone than when she speaks to you. Within several minutes, she even begins to flirt a little, but not in a tacky way. It's charming, impressive and after a few more positive words, your ears prick up when she mentions \"twenty per cent\". All you can do is stare open-mouthed, as Michelle wraps up the deal, a couple more minutes later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew! Seven minutes and 18% more than he originally said. What were you saying? Fifteen per cent would have been impossible?\" She stares at you triumphantly, jumping up in the air and doing a victory dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandice and Denise hear the commotion and rush over, delighted for Michelle for her first deal. Both of them smirk at you, which is actually worse than the glares that you've been accustomed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you must feel really impotent now,\" Denise giggles at you. \"Why do you even have a job here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of jobs,\" Candice chimes in, pointing to her watch. \"Isn't it coffee time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get me a cappuccino this time,\" Michelle orders you, not even looking at you while she resumes her animated chat with her new friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkulking away, you realise that Denise is right. You do feel impotent. Michelle has usurped and now outperformed you - easily. Sure enough, Kim is delighted for Michelle, promising her a bonus and a renegotiation on her contract. Giving you a stern look, she summons you into her office, leaving Michelle and a gathering crowd to revel in her success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James, look, it's obvious what I'm about to say. Michelle is, well she's better than you,\" she states matter-of-factly while you stare at the floor. \"It's nothing personal - you've always been a good worker. The thing is, I've compared your assessment scores with her and there's no comparison. Not just with you, but with anyone. She truly is exceptional. <i>Anyone</i> to get those scores, even if they'd been working here for years would be on the road to promotion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour ears prick up at this. It was you who scored so highly on the assessments; you just assumed that anyone who had done them before would ace them easily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James, what is it? Do you have something to tell me?\" Kim stares at you, an expectant look on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you tell her the truth about the assessments and Michelle's fake high scores which are actually yours? </span></div></div>",

However, you're Michelle's. In the space of just a day, you've been so thoroughly humbled by the gorgeous newbie that you realise you have to put her success first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, as I was saying, I think you could learn a lot from Michelle. She's a natural - 18% higher when you were expecting 5! That's unheard of. So, don't see it so much as a demotion but as an opportunity. From now on, you'll be Michelle's assistant. Do whatever she tells you, learn from her. James, this is a rare chance - a chance for you to learn from the best. I could give this to anyone else but they'd see it as a negative. But not you - I know that you see greatness in her. I know that if you give your all in listening to her, soaking up her natural ability...if just some of it rubs off on you then you'll be heading places, long term speaking.\" Kim looks at you approvingly, you find yourself buying into it, that you've been given a real opportunity here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, er...thank you..\" you say, confused by how you truly feel. A demotion but a chance...what does this really mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if reading your mind, Kim continues. \"Of course, your salaries will need to be adjusted to reflect your new positions - I just can't give one person that much more - the money doesn't just magic itself! So you and Michelle will swap salaries. For her, it will be commission based. That means that she will get 10% of what she sells straight into her pay check. You, well you will learn from her and as soon as you start proving you've gleaned something from her, well there'll be plenty of options for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave her office, feeling rather numb at what's just happened. Michelle now has your job while you're basically her assistant. She'll have the commission-based pay on top of that, which means she'll be earning far more than you ever did. All just in one day! Summoned to fetch Michelle and take her to Kim's office, with you there to witness it all you try not to feel too hard done by. Like Kim said, <i>it's not personal</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the fuss around Michelle died down, she sits in your old chair and grins at you while you stand before her, awaiting orders. \"See, I told you that I was better than you,\" she says smugly. \"Aww, don't feel too bad! You can still do all the boring bits of the work - you know, the bits I never learned...\" She giggles at this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo for the next four hours, you type up all of the reports, do the necessary excel grids and charts, while Michelle lounges back and has a relaxed afternoon. She makes you line up several more calls, which she'll take tomorrow as she's off for a leisurely lunch with her friend, Kayleigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wash my car again when I'm gone,\" Michelle instructs you casually. \"Laters!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling defeated, you do what you're told. Scrubbing away at the 'Mich Wins' number plate, the words reverberate inside your head.<i> Michelle Wins, Michelle Wins, Michelle Wins!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha! What do we have hear, eh? Gringo cleaning his fancy lady's car again?\" Helena's cackles make you sigh internally. Not again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, you realise you don't have the gall to chastise or even argue with her. \"Yeah,\" you tell her. \"I'm her assistant now, so I clean her car every day. It's just one job that I do for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena stares at you open-mouthed, her lips slowly curving into a triumphant, joyful smile. \"What!! This is just too much, white boy! You been a jerk to me for so long! Now you tell me that you a loser boy! Hahahahaha! Get down on your knees and apologise, bitch boy! Apologise and kiss my shoe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel your knees weakening. Having been so humiliated and demoted, you feel your surrender inevitable. While Helena grins at you, her eyes flashing with excitement, you bend down and prepare to kiss the top of one of her crocs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, gringo. Do it! Kiss my shoe and tell me how sorry you are for messing with me the past few years!

As you taste the dirt from her shoes, the Latina laughs down at you, clearly revelling in the fact that you have surrendered so easily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like your new boss!\" She says with glee. \"She make you realise what you are - a gringo bitch boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's right. Michelle has dominated you so effortlessly that she's caused that submissive part in you - the part that adores women's feet - to take over and reduce you to a weak, mess of a man. All those times that you made of fun of Helena, or traded barbs with Denise were you putting on a show, convincing yourself and others around you that you were a tough guy. Now the mask has gone, you feel defenceless and hopeless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...Helena...for...being...such...a...jerk...to...you...sorry,\" you murmur, between kisses, while Helena nods with approval. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good bitch,\" she grins after you've humiliated yourself in front of her for a good five minutes. \"Now meet me at my office - the basement - at 5:30, when everyone's finished work. Don't be late!\" Cackling, and leaving you face down on the car park floor, the janitor strolls happily away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould things actually get any worse? Now the lowly cleaner holds authority over you! To think, you were actually vying for promotion just a couple of days back, now you're at the mercy of Helena of all people! After you carefully finish cleaning Michelle's car, ensuring that there is not a speck of dirt on or under it, you resume your admin tasks: basically typing everything that Michelle should be doing after her successful deal earlier. But she's at lunch with her friend Kayleigh, you bitterly muse while doing all of the 'boring' bits of the job for her. No one, not even Kim makes a comment on the fact that the new office superstar isn't anywhere to be seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt around 4 o'clock, the gorgeous brunette returns, demanding a rundown of all of the work that you've completed, not even pretending to be sorry for having a near three hour lunch break. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, loser, I'm gonna go now. I've got a date with this guy. He's a serious hottie so I need to get my nails done, maybe a pedicure too. Would you like...?\" She grins at you, cutely biting her lip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...yes please!\" You gush, far too quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pouts. \"Aw, I wasn't offering you to give me a pedicure, silly! No, I was just seeing if you wanted to get under the desk and be my footrest while I called him on the office phone! You do want to, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that you do, humiliating as it is, you crawl under her desk and kneel on all fours while she rests her bare feet on your back and talks to some guy that she is going to see this evening. She giggles constantly and makes remarks like 'Yeah, I've got promoted straight away - the guy whose job I took is now my bitch!'. This goes on for a good twenty minutes, while you stay silent and accept that you have to appreciate this is the most contact your new boss will allow you with her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she stands up, slips her shoes back on and ducks under the desk to give you a thumbs up. \"He's so cute! Wish me luck for tonight, bitch! If he lets me I'm totally gonna fuck his brains out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good...luck, boss,\" you say weakly, not even able to look her in the eye. She laughs at you before calling out a cheery 'Laters!'. You watch her walk away before resuming the mountain of tasks that she's set you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Denise and Candice leave you alone for the rest of the day, though they do give you smug, cheery goodbye, that you try to ignore. Before you know it, it's nearly half past five, and time to see Helena. What does the Hispanic woman have in store for you?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You used to make fun of me, white boy...\" She narrows her eyes at you and folds her arms. \"What's changed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems pointless to lie to her. \"My new boss - Michelle - she's helped me to, er, see how...pathetic I am...\" you murmur, telling enough of the truth for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grin returns. \"This is perfect! I'm gonna take out everything on YOU! You're the bitch boy who's gonna make me feel good about myself! When you were all macho and tough, I was a little scared of you. But not no more!\" She giggles. \"Get down on the floor and kiss my feet again - this time without my shoes on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even hesitating, you do so, fully accepting that Helena can do whatever she wants to you. Although she is a few years older - around her mid-30s, she is admittedly attractive, if hard-faced. Placing meek kisses to the tops of her bare feet makes you feel increasingly inferior to the janitor. She soaks it all in, laughing down at you and making it clear who's the boss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the boss now. Got it, bitch?\" She cackles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...boss...\" You say between kisses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, lie down on your back and let me cover your ugly face with my bare feet!\" She clicks at you, speaking with such authority that you do so at once while she sits on a chair.  You can't deny it, even though her feet are nowhere near as beautiful as Michelle's you moan softly as they descend onto your face. Her soles are sweaty, quite dirty and calloused, but they are still sexy enough for you to feel some wood building immediately in your pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHA!\" The Latina woman can't hide her excitement when she notices you sporting an erection. \"You're one of those foot freaks! You get turned on by this, right bitch?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-y-yes....b-boss...\" You whimper into her feet as they rest on your face. Your total surrender to Helena has happened far easier than either of you could ever have imagined!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding her bare feet all over your face, she laughs hysterically. \"Gringo bitch...! Loving my feet! Ah, this is too much! Fucking loser white boy...lie still while I rub my feet in your face! Your little cock is shaking, I can't believe this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you can do is whimper under her feet and feel your dick reach fall mast while she rubs her sweaty soles all over your face. To be fair to you, the amount of teasing that Michelle has done to you has made you so pliable, so easily broken that you had no chance, the moment the Latina's feet touched your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Helena decide to do next?</span></div></div>",

It hasn't helped either that Michelle's relentless teasing as made you more pliable and willing to explore your fetish....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling nastily, the powerful Latina continues to slide her sweaty feet all over your face, while you weakly moan. You let out a small gasp when you suddenly feel your flies being undone and Helena's hand wrapped around your cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanna see how long you last, gringo!\" Helena says, her hand so tight around your dick that you grunt slightly in pain. \"Let's see how much of a foot freak you white boy bitch are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long is the answer! It takes just five or six tugs on your cock for you to spurt your load, as you convulse and whimper into Helena's soles while she snorts with laughter, clearly entertained by how quick you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahahah! 10 seconds! You are a pathetic loser! To think that you used to joke around and make me feel like a piece of shit! Not anymore! You're mine...all MINE!\" The janitor says with authority, grabbing a tissue and cleaning wipe to get rid of your semen from her hand. Of course a janitor would casually sort out mess like this! \"Say it - say it foot bitch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...a-all yours, b-boss!\" You whine, feeling both disgusted with yourself yet so beneath this Hispanic woman that you can't possibly defy her. \"Th-thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena's ridiculously quick jerking off with her feet in your face confirms the fact that you are totally broken. She sighs contentedly and leans back, lighting a cigarette while casually telling you to lick her bare feet clean. Of course you do so, accepting that a pathetic loser like you deserves to lick off the dirt and grime from a woman who's clearly superior to you, even though she's the office cleaner! You feel yourself going hard again after twenty minutes or so, but Helena doesn't show any indication that she wants to touch your cock again. She doesn't even notice your erection when she places her feet down, looking very pleased with herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInevitably, Helena orders you to do an entire clean of the office - what she would normally do at this time of the day. Two hours later, you drop to the floor of the basement on your knees and place meek kisses on Helena's soles, while she smirks at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You all done, bitch boy? I'm so chilled and relaxed! You can do this every meaning. Tomorrow I will go home so I don't have to wait for your slow ass to clean the office. Si?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, boss,\" You murmur in a small defeated voice, exhausted from all of the cleaning. You've scrubbed floors, hoovered carpets, cleaned the toilets, polished desks, emptied bins...all while Helena has been lounging back and enjoying some chill time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks down at you, pure triumph adorning her pretty yet hard features. \"You can lock up...\" She tosses you the keys and gets to her feet, slowly strolling away from your kneeled form. When she leaves, you drop to the floor and jerk off, unable to control yourself. Within thirty seconds, you're climaxing, calling out Helena's name unashamedly. She's right - she totally owns you! By the time you've cleaned up and got your stuff together, you realise that it's around 9pm and you are on the verge of collapsing with exhaustion. Is it even worth going home?!</span></div></div>",

Wiping away some drool from your mouth, you shake your head around, confused by your surroundings. Why are you in the office basement? Why is Helena with you...?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You slept down here, dirty bitch?\" The Hispanic janitor saunters over to you, quickly slipping off her crocs and placing one bare foot down on your chest when she makes her way over to you.  Rubbing your sore eyes and groaning, you allow yourself to stare up at your conqueror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry, boss. I h-had to sleep...\" You murmur, finding yourself averting your gaze as you simply cannot look the Latina in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pathetic!\" She spits down at you. \"Look at you - you look like crap!\" Helena looks hot, in a pink t-shirt, showing off her long, light brown legs. As she ties her dark brown hair into a bun, she suddenly laughs as if thinking of something. \"I know - here you go!\" She steps off you to grab a set of cleaning overalls in the cupboard - the ones that she normally wears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know what's going to happen next, and there's nothing you to do to avoid it. Minutes later, you are wearing blue cleaning skivvies, meekly mopping and cleaning the entire office, even though you had already done so last night. It's only 7am - a good hour before anyone will arrive. Helena always does a morning clean, as Kim insists that all dust that is gathered overnight is mopped, wiped and swept away. You would feel a pang of sympathy for Helena if it were her doing all of this cleaning. But it's not - it's you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorse than that, you have to get everything done before anyone at the office arrives. Desperately finishing the last ladies' cubicle, you look at your watch. 8 am. Anyone could arrive at any moment! The sound of the door of the ladies' bathroom opening makes you freeze in your tracks. Thinking quickly, you lock the cubicle door, hoping that it is Helena who has come in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding your breath, you hear the sound of high heels clicking towards you, then stopping. Whoever it is seems to be heading towards the cubicle next to you. This is confirmed when you look to your side to see a heel shoe dropped to the ground and a bare foot appear. It's not the Latina skin tone of Helena, so whoever it is cannot see you here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you stay put, wait for the woman to go, or make a dash for it now!</span></div></div>",

Whoever is in the cubicle next to you continues to shuffle around until the toilet flushes and they unlock the door. If they could see anything under the gap above the floor, then they presumably thought that it was Helena, given that your blue cleaning skivvies pretty much reach the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, mercifully, the unknown woman departs and allows you to breathe a sigh of relief and quickly finish off your cleaning duties for Helena. Returning to the Latina's 'office', she smiles at you, clearly happy with how easily she has been able to control you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good cleaning bitch,\" she says as you take of the skivvies so that you are back in your work clothes, the same ones that you slept in and wore yesterday. Catching a glimpse of yourself in the mirror, you try not to groan. You really do look like shit! Your clothes are crumpled, your hair looks a mess and you look generally unkempt and unprofessional. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, gringo, you can kiss my feet before you go to your work with that new girl...\" She points at the floor, which you meekly and instantly drop down on, flat on your back as she hovers a bare sole just over your mouth. Closing your eyes, allowing the heady, vinegary stench of her foot to fill your nostrils, you immediately feel turned on. Several kisses of Helena's bare foot are enough for you to have a full-on erection. \"Hahahaha!\" She roars with laughter. \"So easy to excite! I had boyfriends before, you know. This is the least effort I've ever made, si! Some would take hours...some would make me dress up, do dirty things...but I've never had a white boy loser who gets turned on by feet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you can do is whimper, while kissing away at Helena's bare foot, the salty flavour simply delicious to you. Letting out increasingly loud moans, Helena shakes her head and snorts, moving her other foot over to your erect member. With a glint in her eye, she begins to slowly grind her heel against your dick, making you wince at first. Pain soon turns to pleasure as a few more movements from her foot cause you to shoot your load, making your body spasm and your lips to allow a full on whine to escape. Helena chuckles as your body finally goes dead still, her foot resting gently over your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are my bitch. For as long as I say! Ain't that right, gringo?\" She asks you with authority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...am...your...bitch...\" You gasp, feeling both ashamed after your orgasm but so beneath this Latina janitor that you simply cannot refuse her. She nods with satisfaction before stepping off you, grabbing the cleaning skivvies to put on while you slowly get to your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you after work, foot boy!\" She gives you a grin. \"Bet you wished when you joined this company a few years ago that you'd have admitted your dirty little white boy fantasises then... all those times you've made fun of me...it means I'm gonna humiliate you as much as I can! AND make you do my work for me too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get back to your - no, <i>Michelle's</i> - desk, you try not to stare at her bare feet, which are casually resting there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bitch!\" She smiles at you, looking pleased with herself. Her smile soon turns into a frown. \"What the hell happened to you? You look like shit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, boss,\" you mumble, sitting in the chair next to her and trying not to look at her freshly painted pink toenails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, lots to do today,\" she continues breezily. \"First I want you to get me AND Denise and Candice coffees... then I want you to type up some more of those business reports for me - in my name of course, then I want my car cleaned, then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to concentrate on her various demands but find her words floating away. An uncomfortable sleep, all of that cleaning, plus the sexual relief that Helena has given you...exhausted doesn't cover it! Are you able to do a good job for Michelle today, or do you slip in concentration and annoy her?</span></div></div>",

Just sign here - I'll do the rest of the paperwork later today. All it says is that your responsibilities will now be to work from 7AM to 7PM, in that time you will mop and sweep the floors, hoover the carpets, empty the bins...\" Kim explains the various jobs that you need to do, most of which you already were aware of from Helena. \"Signing this means that you accept that you must carry out ALL of these tasks, every day, and your salary will now be $1000 a month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grand a month?! You swallow thickly but before you can voice your concerns, Kim waves a hand impatiently at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you're going to a support staff contract, you are on the first pay point scale. Each year, it will go up incrementally, don't worry about that. Hey, in two or three years time, performance-dependent of course, you could be up to $1100 or $1200!\" She smiles at you, not in a malevolent way, but more like a strict headteacher who expects a delinquent student to be grateful for a reduced punishment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling helpless, you meekly accept and sign the document. Perhaps if Michelle hadn't dominated you so effortlessly, and Helena had you orgasm under her feet...maybe then you would have some self-respect and self-worth left. In addition to all that, Kim has a way of making you do exactly what she wants - her confident expression and low opinion of you makes you accept that being the office janitor, a lowly cleaner, is what you truly deserve!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next order of business is to relay this all to Helena. The Latina is positively thrilled, actually welling up and trying to hide tears of joys when Kim explains her new job - and salary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure Gabriella will be pleased too,\" Kim tells Helena with a smile. \"I know that you're saving up for that college fund for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Si, si! I mean, thank you so much Miss Kim!\" She rushes forward to hug the redhead, who looks uncomfortable as she pats the Mexican woman's back. Michelle's new assistant gives you a look, which is hard to read. Is it gratitude? Triumph? Either way, you find yourself shifting your gaze at the floor, and hope that the women will let you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Helena departs, allowed to go home to tell her daughter the good news, and buy some 'appropriate work attire', which Kim gives some cash for her - a salary advance. <i>She'll be doubling her income - at least,</i> you muse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim gives you a slightly pitying look. \"James...I know that this probably hasn't gone how you were hoping, but it is for the best. In all seriousness,\" she gives you a suggestive smile. \"Find a way to impress me. Show me something, something unexpected, and that could help you get your old job back - and more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words reverberating around your head, you are allowed to leave Kim's office at last. Your first port of business is to finish cleaning the ladies' toilet - hopefully no one will be in there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs continue where you left off, scrubbing rhythmically up and down on the floor, someone enters the bathroom...who is it?!</span></div></div>",

Taking a breath, you relay what's happened over the past couple of days, leaving out one key detail: that you have a foot fetish, oh, and that Helena had pleasured you with her feet! Watching Jenny's smile turn gradually to a look of pity and surprise is not a pleasant experience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James, why didn't you tell this to me? The other day when you said we'd go for coffee? You said everything was fine with the newbie that you were training! Surely you can't just be throwing your career away like this because this Michelle has spun your head and that the...that Helena... has taken advantage of this new submissive nature of yours?!\" She sighs a little impatiently. \"I'm sorry, but I don't get it. There's something you're not telling me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Jenny,\" you find yourself pleading - an all too natural default tone for you, since Michelle broke you. \"Please...it's...that's it.

How can I say no to that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny laughs, her expression sympathetic rather than scornful. \"Honestly, what has happened to you? You've always been a nice guy to me - we're friends after all. But you used to have some swagger, some charisma...are you seriously telling me that Michelle has reduced you to this - a guy who accepts that he is made the janitor of the office? And for what?

No way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what's it to be?

You admit how turned you on you were by Michelle's bare feet, how she teased you incessantly, how you've been cleaning her car, how you accepted the fact that she take your job and walk all over you. Jenny looks aghast but doesn't say anything. Pressing on, you confess how you were mere putty in Helena's hands when she ordered you to kiss her shoe, then made you lick her feet, which you could not resist and got a hand job, then later, a foot job for your efforts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, that's it,\" you say, hanging your head in shame. \"That's why I just can't stand up for myself and make any demands to Kim.

You should've told me before. Still, foot fetish or not - that doesn't mean you should be dominated and used like this! Kim is being a total bitch! She knows that you being the janitor will kill your career - with your experience and skill you could get a much better job elsewhere!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about it, you shake your head slowly. \"But would I? Kim's reference for me would be appalling, no doubt. Let's face it, Jenny, this is what I deserve. Being Michelle's assistant was embarrassing but I accepted it. Knowing that Helena has swapped jobs from me is...humiliating...but I'm not the same friend you knew.

Look, I'll make it simple for you - do you want to accept my help, or would you rather I just left you to it - let you wallow in your self-declared role in life as a loser?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead has a fierce look in her eyes.

James, I can rebuild your confidence, convince you that your foot fetish isn't...\" Jenny sighs mid-sentence and rolls her eyes. \"What's the point? You've made up your mind. Good luck being a janitor, James.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching her walk away is painful but it seems necessary. Like you've voiced to yourself several times recently, <i>you deserve this</i>. You allowed your weakness for feet to affect your career and your personal life. It's <i>you</i> to blame! So, it makes total sense to cut ties with Jenny. How could you realistically look her in the eye, knowing how far from grace you've fallen? Trying to shake the thought away of her walking away from you and your friendship, you quickly finish mopping the toilets, keen to get out of there before you see anyone else. You can clean the cubicles themselves later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealising that everyone is going to see you at some point, you decide to embrace your new position, fixing on a smile and dealing with one humiliating situation at a time. On your way out of the bathroom, you see Jacinta - the blonde who has had an obvious crush on you for the past few years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James! You're...you look different?\" Jacinta says, her eyes widening as she stops before the washroom and looks you up and down. \"What's with the cleaning skivvies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the...new janitor,\" you say thickly, feeling embarrassed beyond belief, yet you suck it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggles. \"Aw, come on. What is it really?\" Jacinta is kinda cute, even though she's pale and a little horsey. Who are you kidding...she's a goddess compared to what you can hope to achieve woman-wise from now on! Maybe you should pretend...oh screw it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am. I, er, haven't been doing so well at work.

So I have her - Helena's - job. I'm the janitor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacinta's disbelieving expression changes to one of sympathy. \"Oh, James, I'm so sorry to hear that!

You feel almost strengthened from your encounter - you said the bare bones of the truth - that you are now the janitor of the office, with much less shame then you would ever have imagined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading down to the basement - the place that Helena used to call her 'office', you start the mammoth task of organising the various bits of equipment, cleaning products, tools and various other things that are scattered all around the floor and haphazardly shoved in cupboards. One thing is clear - the Latina woman did not care much for tidiness! As you bury yourself into the reorganisation process, a good hour or so passes by. Although you're consumed in your work, you hear footsteps coming down the office...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gringo!\" Helena's familiar voice stops you dead. Turning around, you can't help but feel your dick twitch at the sight of her. She's only been gone a little while, but the business attire that she's wearing - a long black skirt, a white blouse and open-toed black heels are simple but very stylish and elegant. Her long, dark brown hair hangs either side of her face, which has a good deal of makeup applied. She looks more feminine yet intimidating than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...er...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour words trickle away as she walks over to you and stands before you, hands on hips. \"I owe you a 'thank you', white boy. If it weren't for your bitch-ass, I would never have got this job from Miss Kim. I been asking her for years, si! So, thank you.\" She holds out a hand and stares down at you, her pretty face looking utterly pleased and satisfied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a little reluctance, you hold out your hand, and shake, wincing at the fact that she has a strong grip - stronger than yours! Gazing up at this Latina goddess from this lowly position on the floor, you should be raging that you lost your job to her, that she humiliated under her feet to the point that you had no self-respect to say 'no' to Kim. You should be mad that she made you wear cleaning skivvies this morning and ended up being caught by your boss, which led to you becoming the permanent janitor. Yet, you accept it. Like you did with watching Jenny and Jacinta walk away from you, you know deep down that Helena is better than you - you're a foot pervert who deserves to be beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing the hand shake, Helena steps back and smiles at you. \"So, I gonna go and be Miss Michelle's assistant. I gonna learn, get promoted and do well for myself. You'll be a good janitor,\" she tells you, with some genuine sincerity. \"Good luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart shudders a little. Part of you knows it's best if you sever your 'relationship' with her, but the idea of being under her feet again is an enticing one. Do you allow her to leave you, letting you both get on with your respective new jobs, or do you ask if you can taste her feet again...?</span></div></div>",

There seems to be little to do during the actual working day, other than hang around the toilets and clean up after people, which is humiliating. You don't vacuum, empty bins, clean the communal areas or anything else until 5PM, which is when most people clock off. Until then, you're supposed to be at hand, in the bathrooms, whose floors need to be regularly mopped, with the toilet rolls, soaps, hand wash regularly replenished...it doesn't take long for it it to dawn on you that being the office janitor means being a toilet attendant and cleaner for most of the day!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a doubt, the worst parts of the day are when people stop in their tracks and gawp, or laugh at you for wearing cleaning skivvies. Tired of explaining the whole story (well the selected highlights), you simply tell people that you've been demoted and that this is your job now. Some of your male colleagues, well former colleagues now, avoid eye contact and pretend they haven't seen you by their second visits to the WC, which is probably better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInevitably, seeing Denise is one of the most excruciating and humbling experiences...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well! It's true!\" The admittedly pretty blonde cackles as she and Candice stalk towards you, sneers on their faces. \"We thought we'd see it for our very own eyes...James the janitor!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah,\" you grunt, closing your eyes and wishing the ground would swallow you up as your two nemeses accost you while you're in the middle of changing the hand wash in the ladies' bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise giggles. \"This is quite the sight. I never thought I'd see the day that YOU would be the office cleaning bitch! What happened? Kim finally realised that you were crap at your job?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to slip past them, but Candice blocks the way. \"Where do you think <i>you're</i> going?\" The bitchy receptionist says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please,\" you mutter, feeling pathetic but knowing that you can't stand up to them in any conceivable way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling again, Denise stands side-to-side with her friend and smirks at you. \"Try that again, on your knees, loser.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour knees wobbling, you've been so easily dominated by Michelle and Helena that it feels almost natural to give in to more women, even though they are your worst enemies!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith both Denise and Candice staring a hole right through you, you know that this could be a critical point in your day...and in your life! Bowing down to these bitches could open up a whole new world of humiliation! Then again, do you want that, deep down? Have Michelle and Helena opened up a door that can never be closed?! Also, could refusing them spell even more trouble for you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of these thoughts swirling around your head, you make your decision...</span></div></div>",

Got that, janitor boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" reply dumbly, feeling so pathetic in front of your former competition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, <i>boss</i>!\" Denise instructs you with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...boss,\" you utter in a small voice, wishing that the ground could just swallow you up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" Denise continues while Candice giggles. \"Yesterday you promised us coffee at 9 am sharp. You failed, loser.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...boss...\" You mumble, still on your knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be sorry, idiot. Be useful! Go and get us our coffees.  Got that, or are you so stupid that I need to repeat it to you?\" Candice says patronisingly, clearly buoyed up by how submissive you are around them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...boss,\" you say meekly, which causes both women to giggle again as they allow you to finally leave the bathroom and make them coffee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, you avoid Michelle and Helena as you fetch the coffees, remembering their orders from yesterday. The lady at Starbucks grins at you - perhaps because you've been here quite a lot recently, or because you're still in cleaning skivvies. Resigned to your fate, you let it wash over you as you bring back Denise and Candice their drinks. Arriving to Denise's desk, you nervously await her reaction as she sips the coffee. With a dismissive wave of her hand, she allows you to drop off Candice's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bitchy receptionist grins as you hand her the coffee without looking her in the eye. To make things worse, Jenny is there too and rolls her eyes and mutters something to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, there's one more thing you can do for me...\" Candice smiles evilly at you, clearly enjoying the fact that she can lord it over you in front of Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does the brunette instruct you to do next?</span></div></div>",

You're gonna be the best assistant!\" Michelle giggles, high-fiving the Hispanic woman before giving you a smug, content look. \"You janitor, get the fuck out of our office. At 8 am sharp tomorrow morning, I wanna see our new shoes and our shoe rack set up in that cupboard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...boss...\" You reply meekly and actually bow to each of the ladies, who burst into laughter once more at your pathetic display. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScurrying out of their office with your tail between your legs, you carry on with your day.

Her face is wearing a full-on sneer as she brushes her shortish, light blonde hair haphazardly out of her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what to do, foot bitch,\" Jacinta says, turning her nose up on you, her pale blue eyes shining with excitement. \"Say thank you to this young lady for the honour of licking her shoes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" you say weakly, feeling lower tan you ever have. \"Thank you for...letting me...lick your shoes clean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three women giggle and smirk at you while you bring the red shoe to your mouth and stick out your tongue, placing it at the very bottom of it. As you drag your tongue upwards, your tastebuds are assaulted by a mixture of flavours - dampness, wine, an acrid, bitter taste as well as all sorts of pieces of dirt and grime. Even though the brunette who's shoe you're licking is hot, licking her shoe is frankly revolting. Yet you're so accustomed now to giving into women and their feet, it's strangely natural to be in this position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you continue to lick her red high heel clean, swapping between shoes when the girls are satisfied with your work, they continue to belittle you. Jacinta happily explains that you were up until recently a competent and impressive worker at her office, now you're simply the janitor!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man you are such a freak!\" The other girl says with disdain at you, while she watches you licking her friend's dirty shoe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes, they swap. The other girl, a gorgeous black woman with long, raven hair is more disgusted than excited with your total lack of resistance. Her shoes are pair of blue Laboutins, which must have cost a lot of money. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you ruin those, freak,\" The black girl says, wrinkling her nose at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give them a smell first,\" Jacinta instructs you, clearly loving the whole situation. \"Smell the inside of her shoe and thank her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thank you...\" You murmur, in between deep inhales of the girl's Laboutins. \"Thank you....for...allowing me to....smell your shoe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three women, even the black girl who was more disgusted than anything, break into snorts of laughter. They have to hold each other up to prevent themselves for drunkenly falling to the ground. After you've sniffed the inside of each shoe, you proceed to meekly lap your tongue against the bottoms of the shoes, relieved that they are nowhere near as disgusting as Jacinta's or the brunette's, probably because they appear to be relatively new. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was fun!\" The brunette giggles, hiccuping a little. \"Thanks, janitor boy for cleaning our shoes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we can have more fun than <i>that</i>....\" Jacinta grins at you and the others. \"Do you wanna come back to mine for a little night cap and have some more fun with this freak?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls exchange a glance...will they accept Jacinta's office?</span></div></div>",

Please let me taste your feet, please, Jacinta!\" You whine up at her, already feeling rock hard in your pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlayfully tapping her chin with a thoughtful expression on her face, the blonde prolongs the torture. \"Hmmm, let me see. I do have other pressing engagements, like trimming my toenails. Maybe if you do a good job at that first, I'll let you have a little taste..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stares at you expectantly, you comply at once, stretching your lips to position your teeth at the best angle to trim her toenails. Letting out a small moan of pleasure, you hold her sumptuous bare foot steady and manoeuvre her big toe so it slightly enters your mouth, the strong salty flavour making your tastebuds dance with delight. Carefully, you work from left to right, being cautious of biting the skin. Tasting her toe jam and foot sweat, you focus your best on trimming Jacinta's toenails with your teeth as well as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs Jacinta pleased with your work or do you manage to annoy her?</span></div></div>",

Get trimming properly or no feet for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a small whine, Jacinta is unfazed by your non-verbal pleading. A little desperately, you grind your teeth around Jacinta's big toe again, gently placing them over the nail and trying to carefully work away at the nail. Whatever you try, it doesn't seem to work, which makes you more panicky and ineffective. Another minute or two of this disappointing display from you is enough for Jacinta. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it, I gave you a chance,\" the blonde woman says in an annoyed tone. Shoving her bare foot forward, you merely grunt as it pushes your face hard and makes you flip over, flat on your back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding over you, hands on hips and a look of disappointment on her face, Jacinta shakes her head from side to side. \"You had one job - one job! All you had to do was trim my toenails! Are you that useless that you can't even do that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...sorry,\" you croak up at her, ashamed and frustrated with yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I heard at work was that you're the foot guy - a foot expert! I mean, what's the point of having you here if you can't perform one simple task?\" She sighs again as she stands over you. She continues after your silence. \"Well, you don't deserve to be rewarded with worshiping my feet. You can be my foot stool instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting back down, she crosses her legs and lowers both bare soles over your face. Immediately, you feel eternally grateful to her, gracing your face with her gorgeous feet! Her silky soft soles feel so reassuring and delightful on you; the sweet, yet sharp foot scent dominates your senses and you stick your tongue out to show your gratitude. Wincing in pain, you let out a cry as Jacinta catches your tongue between two of her toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Na, ah. No, you don't get to kiss or lick my feet, loser. You're just a piece of furniture for my feet. Kiss or lick them again and you're out of here! Last chance!\" She tells you, reprimanding you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's easier said than done. Jacinta's feet are not quite in the same league as Michelle's but they're incredibly sexy! It seems as though she wants to make you earn the right to slather away at them, which is incredibly tough but you are certainly not in a position to argue!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you able to control yourself and be content with smelling her feet, rather than kissing or licking them?</span></div></div>",

Coming from Jacinta, someone who you knew had the hots for you for years, now seeing you as a piece of dirt is really crushing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...please, let me...\" Your words trail off as Jacinta leans forward, exerting pressure from her bare feet onto your face and smothering out your words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy this for the next few seconds, 'cos it's the last you're gonna see of my feet...\" She sniffs disapprovingly before releasing you and pointing at the door. \"Get the hell out of my apartment, loser.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeekly doing so, staying on all fours and shuffling away, your heart is beating fast from the excitement and humiliation she just put you through. There is literally no point in trying to change her mind; you are nothing more than a worm to her now! Knowing you'll never look her in the eye again, you rapidly depart and awkwardly shuffle to your feet in the corridor. How could you mess that up so badly! All you had to do was control your fetish and do what she told you but you failed!

Looking at the time on your phone, you had no idea how late it was - gone midnight and the shoes you purchased must have been left where you encountered Jacinta and the girls. There's no point in checking that they are still there....in fact, you're pretty sure that you saw the drunk girls picking up something from the ground when they departed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that it's too late to get any more shoes, an idea springs to mind. You're pretty sure that Jacinta is a size 4 - her feet are fairly small after all. If you paid her a huge wad of money, she may allow you to purchase some shoes off you. Or, or if she's asleep and her door's unlocked, you could sneak into her apartment and take a few of her shoes! You've never stolen from someone before, but it's a desperate situation. Plus, Jacinta was very harsh on you this evening...</span></div></div>",

Moving stealthily back to Jacinta's apartment door, you take a breath before slowly turning the handle. You nearly stop for a second; what if the blonde is wide awake?! You could always claim that you've come back to apologise...or to be at her feet again...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, the lights are off, indicating that Jacinta is probably asleep. There is just enough light from outside the apartment; the curtains are still open, so your eyes adjust pretty quickly. Creeping along the hallway, you nearly stumble right into a shoe rack, full of heels, flats, sneakers, sandals...for a moment you're tempted to get down on your knees and sniff Jacinta's footwear but you manage to control yourself. <i>You can always do that back home in your apartment! </i> However, you must choose the newest-looking shoes - Michelle is not going to be pleased with a worn pair of anything! For now, you're ignoring the fact that Helena will need some shoes, the Latina being several sizes bigger than Michelle and Jacinta. The focus for the moment is just to get a few pairs of Jacinta's newest heels!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFumbling around in the dark, you know that turning on the light could potentially awake Jacinta. Carefully lifting off what feels like a pair of heels from the top rack, you feel around to ensure that they are not too scuffed. Repeating this several times until you have taken down four pairs of heels, you feel proud of yourself for being so stealthy! The only noise you can hear is the air-conditioning and buzz from the fridge in her apartment. With two armfuls of shoes, you begin turning back towards the door, before you hear the noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounds like a yawn, and then some muttering. Jacinta must be asleep on the couch! Placing the shoes very gradually on the floor, you stretch up on your toes so you can see Jacinta lying face down on the couch...she's probably passed out there! Your heart flutters when you realise that her bare soles are dangling off the edge of it, facing you. Licking your lips as you gaze on her soft, sumptuous soles, you feel like a moth drawn to the flame. Edging further forward, your heart beats ever faster yet you can't resist the urge just to stare at her bare feet for a few more moments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought crosses your mind...if she really is passed out from the number of drinks she's had, you could probably get away with taking another whiff of her gorgeous feet....better than that, you could carefully lick them up and down without her even knowing! It could be the last ever chance you'll ever have to taste Jacinta's feet! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, is this too risky? However tempted you are, can you fight it and return to the urgent business of taking her shoes?</span></div></div>",

Jacinta is really dead to the world; you'll be impressed if she makes it into work tomorrow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in the hallway, your heart is beating so hard it feels as though it could break your chest! Taking a deep breath, you take a look at the heels in your hands. A great selection! However, you think back to Helena's demands, earlier today: blue, white and blue open toed shoes. In the panicked state you were in, you had genuinely forgotten about the specifics. The shoes from Jacinta are red, white and black; the white pair is open-toed and could be passed as work shoes, but the others are simply heels. Sighing with frustration, you also remember that these shoes are for Michelle anyway, you still need to get footwear for Helena! One thing you were spot on with though, Jacinta is indeed a size 4!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking dejectedly out of the building, you hail a cab, the driver giving you a few odd looks on the journey back at the fact you're clutching eight women's shoes. It's not until nearly 12:30 am that you stagger back to your apartment, dropping the shoes on the ground and collapsing on the couch. What a day! If only you hadn't run in to Jacinta, then the inebriated girls. You'd have the shoes for Michelle and Helena as promised. Resolved to make the best of the situation, you pick up the shoes, feeling the overwhelming urge to give the insoles a sniff...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you know it, you're moaning away with several pairs of Jacinta's shoes covering your nose and mouth. With an undeniable erection springing up in mere moments, it takes less than a minute to ejaculate into your boxer shorts, too turned on to even considering removing them or your pants. Sitting for a minute or two in a guilty, soporific state, you know that you still have some work to do. Jacinta's heels are new enough; it doesn't take too long to polish and clean them so they look pretty much new. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, what about Helena's shoes? Michelle may be satisfied with these, but the Hispanic former janitor...not so much! There's always the excuse of her size being out of stock...with an ever-growing wave of tiredness sweeping through you, it's tempting just to leave it, catch some sleep so you're ready for tomorrow! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea does pop into your head. The woman who lives in the apartment opposite you, a beautiful Lebanese-born woman called Farah, has fairly long feet. You know this because you've seen her walking in flip flops along the hallway before. You've  done it once already - can you really steal another women's shoes from her apartment?! </span></div></div>",

Doing exactly the same as before, you carefully make your way across the corridor to Farah's apartment, opening the door slowly, relieved yet anxious as you realise it is indeed unlocked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like in Jacinta's apartment, the lights are off but this time the curtains are closed. It takes longer for eyes to adjust to the total darkness so you end up using your phone to help guide you along. Although the size of the apartment is pretty much identical to yours, the layout isn't - the couches, the table and chairs...it's a bit disconcerting when yours is obviously so much more familiar. Another difference is that there is no shoe rack in sight, unlike Jacinta's which was luckily right by the front door. At least Farah isn't sleeping on the couch though! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is the sheer anxiety pulsing through you that refrains a frustrated sigh from escaping your lips. Where would her shoes be? In the bedroom?! Determined to succeed in your mission, despite your mounting terror, you creep towards it and very, very gradually turn the door handle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Farah is in bed, lying on her side with a peaceful expression on her face - you can just make this out, despite the dark. To the right hand side of her bed, you catch the sight of some shoes...your target! Tiptoeing over there, you crouch down to start inspecting the shoes. YES! They are size 8! It take some self control not to pump your fist in the air! Refocusing, you carefully start taking off the shoes that most closely match Helena's instructions: blue, brown and white open-toed heels. Farah has some beautiful looking shoes, though it's hard to tell the colour and style for sure. A shuffling sound makes you freeze in horror. Daring to look behind you, the Lebanese-born beauty has turned to the other side! Staring at her face for a few moments, her blonde-brown hair tumbling over on each side, you appreciate how gorgeous she is. Maybe, maybe once you've got this mess with Helena and Michelle cleared up you could ask her out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho the hell are you kidding! You're a meek, beaten janitor! You're also such a slave to your fetish now that this stunning woman would tire of you quickly. Shaking the thought away, you suck up the fact that you're unlikely to date a hot girl ever again, or be able to afford to keep your apartment, or have any sort of career... Pushing those thoughts firmly away, you turn back around and resume your careful rummaging around. Reckoning that you've located some light - possibly white - open-toed heels, you gently place them on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...what the...\" You hear Farah's thick, Lebanese accent as a light is suddenly turned on. Thankfully, you have your wits about you to drop silently to the ground and roll swiftly under her bed. Seeing Farah's legs extend over the edge of the bed and leaning forward to inspect her shoe rack, she picks up the open-toed heels you took from the rack, which are indeed white. \"Stupid...need a new rack...\" She mutters sleepily, attributing being woken up by the fact that her shoes fell down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFarah places both feet on the floor, scrunching her toes on the carpet. Getting a good look at them up close, you try your best not to salivate. Her bare soles are divine - on a par with Michelle's, only darter and longer! Holding your breath, staying totally still, you hope dearly that Farah doesn't spot you...how the hell could you explain this?!</span></div></div>",

You've gone from having two women to serve to now having a <i>Goddess</i> to live for!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps this is better! Not being at Michelle, Helena's and let's face it - EVERY other women at work's mercy...getting to lick Farah's gorgeous feet and get to be in her presence. Even if it moves selling your apartment - hell, you were probably going to have to do that anyway after your pay cut! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding your head nodding weakly, Farah's grin widens as she looks satisfied with her new, compliant slave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good slave! Now, what's the first thing that I can get you to do...\"</span></div></div>",

To think that Farah would let you lick her beautiful feet! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you try to get rid of your restraints, she looks at you, \"nonono, boy. You only use your tongue.\" She sits on the side of her bed and rolls you over. As you lay on your back, still bothered by your restraints, you can see Farah grab a long piece of cloth. \"head up.\" She commands, obviously, you obey your new Goddess. Suddenly everything goes black as she firmly wraps the cloth around your eyes, securing it behind your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now lay still... And enjoy.\" Farah says with a very enticing tone. Suddenly you feel the ball of her foot on your mouth and her toes slowly tapping your nose. \"Lick. Now.\" Farah's command is irresistable, not only were you very submissive towards women, this whole situation; being bound, blindfolded and having the most beautiful feet in the world laying atop your face... You start licking her feet and almost moan at the taste of the delicious sweat that had accumulated on her soles over the course of the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then unzips your pants and lowers them a little bit, along with your underwear. There is no denying it, you got pretty damn excited, and it is obvious to Farah as well. Suddenly you feel something slowly rubbing at your groin... Uh-oh. Still on the bed, Farah used her other foot and starts to grind it in-between your balls and your tool. She is moving torturously slowly and you start increasing the speed at which you are licking... You are getting rock hard!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying it already, huh? Gosh... Why didn't you come to me sooner? I love dominating easy bitch-boys like you, now get in-between the toes.\" Farah slightly stretches her long silky toes and you do your best to lick them as clean as you can. The taste is amazing and the texture of her silky feet makes you want to keep going... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoreover, you are almost humping against her other foot by now, which is still moving at a terribly slow pace, just to tease you. \"Tongue out.\" Farah commands and you happily oblige. She then drags her foot accross your tongue, all the way from her toes to her heel. She does this several times and the taste of her soles is just heavenly... You happily swallow all the sweat and whatever else has made it onto your tongue! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really like my feet, huh?\" Farah says with a playful tone, dragging the sole of her foot across your tongue. She then puts her heel on your tongue and drags her foot across your tongue all the way to her toes, \"gosh, I kinda like dominating you like a little beta-bitch. You like alphas like me, don't you?\" Your only response is a moan, which brings a smile on Farah's face. Then, with the ball of her other foot she traces from the base of your cock all the way to its tip, and with an erotic tone she says, \"well, not like you have a choice... Let's seal the deal shall we?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You think to yourself. \"well, not the worst fate in the world, these socks belonged to Farah after all...\" Your thoughts are interrupted by the sound of Farah undressing herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Head up boy.\" Farah commands, once again, you obediently raise your head slightly. \"Hold your breath till I say you can breathe.\" The dominant tone of your goddess is irresistable... With your mouth still gagged, you hold your breath and then something is shoved over your face, it seems be a piece of cloth, it is rather tightly wrapped around only the frontside of your face... it is also slightly wet around your nose. You then feel her foot resting on your face and her toes clamp your nose shut, rubbing the cloth into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's about time that we seal our arrangement, don't you think?\" You start to squirm and move a little bit, struggling for air. Then her toes release your nose, \"breathe in, deeply.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWham! A very strong odor hits your nose and invades your lungs, this must be her underwear that she wore this night... The smell is amazing and Farah is even commanding your breathing. \"now breathe out through your mouth and then breathe in deeply through your nose again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks towards your legs and she puts her foot on your balls and your tool, pressing your tool against your belly and slightly squeezing your balls with her heel.

Open up!\" You open up your mouth and she takes her socks out, drenched by your saliva. \"Wow, you pretty much sucked all the sweat out of it, didn't you?\" You hear her evil laugh, \"ha, I think you will LOVE this then.\" She folds the underwear you had smelling inside-out and shoves it in your mouth and quickly covers your mouth with tape. \"Enjoy that my dear.\" In response, you moan and wiggle, tasting Farah's panties and smelling her old socks while restrained by her... How beautiful it is to serve this Goddess!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFarah replies with satisfaction, \"Okay, guess you will be enjoying yourself here.\" She teasingly puts more force behind her legs and makes your nose dive really deep into her old shoe, rubbing your nose firmly into her socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFarah then continues, \"in the meantime, I'll go to my work and then I go pick up some things from a friend's place, just texted her.

To make matters worse, all the air you breath is initially kept inside the old gym shoe that your nose is buried into. You can't help but wiggle in your restraints as you enjoy the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, all you can do is getting edged by the constant allure of tasting and breathing Farah's erotic scents. Not only that, she is BEAUTIFUL as well... This might not be the worst fate that could have befallen you... Let's hope you didn't jinx yourse-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Click- -Click- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the sound of a key entering the frontdoor and Farah enters with a big sigh. \"Gosh, what a workout I did today!\" She walks towards you, \"hey beta, I got you some nice gifts! You must be really excited!\" You think to yourself, gifts?! This Goddess is going to give you gifts on your first day of service?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you hear a big leather bag opening and all kinds of leathery, metal and even wooden sounds. \"Dragging all this equipment here was a work-out by itself!\" She then takes off your restraints, gets your blindfold off and takes the panties out of your mouth. \"Put all my laundry in the bathroom and get yourself a shower.\" Thankful, you rub your wrists a little, being happy to move your muscles around with a bit of freedom again. You stretch your body a bit and then you take her socks and panties and drop them in the laundry basket... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the shower and let the water rinse you clean. It's a very comforting change of pace, all the trouble you have been through to get here... And now, here you are, showering at the place of arguably the most hot woman you ever met and she is willing to keep you as her beta! However, you do grow a bit suspicious as you hear a lot of sounds coming from the living room, it sounds as if someone is putting a desk together or something! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 15 minutes you finish showering and drying yourself off, with a towel around your middle you enter the living room again. You see Farah with a big object in front of her bed, concealed by a blanket. \"Come here beta, on your knees.\" You get on your knees before your goddess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a big bag in front of you, filled with all kinds of leather and... SM gear?! First, Farah grabs out a complex and strange-looking collar out of the bag and dangles it on her long and sexy index finger... \"Raise your head a bit boy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObediently, you raise your head and get kinda hard from Farah putting a collar on your neck, tightly. \"No better way than asserting your dominance than by collaring someone who let's you do so willingly. Good boy.\" She pats your head and she clicks on something on your collar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Bzzzzt- -Click-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a mechanical noise and then a click from the strange-looking collar. \"This collar is now locked and if you ever move too far from this house, where I hid a remote, you will get an immense shock.\" You look up at hear with a slight bit of fear in your eyes, she then pats your head again, \"Shhh.. You would never think of running anyways, right? Because if you will...\" Farah then grabs a remote control out of her bag... Uh-oh. \"Yes boy, if I press this...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Bzzzz!- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch!\" You shout as you roll onto the floor with your hands on your collar while a heavy shock just surprised your neck.  \"Oh, that thing works very well, great! This is just for training purposes, don't worry. Back to kneeling.\" You kneel again and then Farah grabs the next attribute... It seems like a complicated leather mask, like a gimp mask! Farah then smiles at you, \"this will allow me to decide what you smell at what time and also whether I want you to be able to use your mouth and eyes or not. Let's start with the simplest variant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, you hold still while Farah slides a gimp mask over your head. She secures all kinds of straps around your head and the mask starts to really fold aroud your head and face. \"Good boy, shhh, Farah will take care of you.\" She then closes the pads at your eyes, taking away your sight and restrains the mask further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes her shoes off along with one of her socks, then proceeds to shove the freshly sweaty sock in your mouth and closes the pad over your mouth. You make some muffled noses, now only able to smell and hear your Goddess. She then presses her other sock against your nose and her other hand is firmly on your head. \"This will be fun. Breathe in.\" Having only your nose to breathe, you breathe in the smell from the drenched wet and sweaty sock... The whole situation is actually rather arousing to you. Then she drags you along to her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a playful tone, she says: \"I kinda wanted this to be a surprise... So, when you were in the shower, I put this thing together at the end of the bed. It's a stock that I put together, impressive right?\" You shudder a little at the thought... Realizing you can't speak up or see what's going on. \"Don't worry, it might be designed like a medieval wooden stock, but it has nice padding!\" She says with a sarcastic laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your shock collar and your sensory-deprivation mask on, she leads you to the stock. She opens it and you bend over, laying your neck and your hands on specific leather pads. Then the contraption closes and your neck and wrists are all caught in the holes. She adjusts some handles and the leather padded holes secure very tightly around your neck and your wrists, immobilizing you completely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you can hear your Goddess lay down on her bed, \"now I know for sure you will be restrainted properly!\" She then shoves her silky, long, sexy and extremely sweaty feet straight into your face. You are so well restrained that you cannot even move one inch while her sweaty toes are caressing all over the tip of your nose, filling your lungs with the erotic smell of her mature sweat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passes while she relaxes on her bed, her feet playfully dragging across your face, forcing you to smell her sweaty feet. \"This is a good position for you to discuss our new houserules, is'n't it?\" She turns around laying on her back and forces you to breathe between her toes. \"Breathe in deeply and listen.\" Your legs are getting weak while you keep getting aroused by the intense smell of her toes. She then giggles, \"oh yeh, I might shock your collar a few times if you give the wrong answer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Bzzzz-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then gives your neck a shock and your struggle in your restraints, only to find out you can't even move an inch. You start breathing heavily and she teasingly shoves the crevice between her toes even further against your nose. \"Oh, are you breathing so heavily because you love the smell?\" She says playfully. Your knees go even weaker and you get more and more aroused.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, with a serious tone she continues, \"Well, the collar works even in the stock. So, moan twice if you agree and moan once if you disagree.\" With her toes she then clamps your nose and no longer allows you to breathe. \"First question: Will you be my slave forever? We will settle things with your previous bosses as well...\"</span></div></div>",

True, you have been dominated, abused and literally shocked but with a real conscious effort you manage to refrain from any more noises. Farah's toes seem to go very still for a moment, before they slide down your face and you hear her breathing become heavy, almost like panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this a joke, beta?\" She spits at you, her voice almost shaking with rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>-Bzzzz-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYelping out in pain, you start regretting your decision at once. So why did you decide to disagree with this Lebanese Goddess and not simply accept your lot in life - as her devoted, broken foot slave?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is exactly the question that is on Farah's mind as she slaps you hard across the face. \"Who the fuck do you think you are?! You're my beta bitch and you will agree with everything I say! Now, this time moan TWICE to show that you will be my slave FOREVER, BITCH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again you moan, even more weakly than before but you manage to hold your breath. The truth is, submitting in this manner, strange as sounds considering how subservient you have been, seems so <i>final</i>. Being mistreated and abused - and getting to be near your Goddess's incredible feet is so, so arousing. Yet, this declaration of total devotion just seems too much. You never to chose to be in a medieval stock-like contraption, or wearing a fucking <i>gimp mask</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the old James, how you were before this nightmare situation starting with Michelle's pretty bare feet unravelled you starts to return. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it's not much of a match for Farah and the shock collar...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Bzzzz-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-BZZZZ-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second, longer shock makes your body convulse and you feel incredibly lightheaded for a few moments.

It's barely a struggle as your body goes limp at once, surrendering in seconds to this Goddess. Trying to plead with her is no good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing one hand she proceeds to slap you, alternating the palm with her backhand, causing you to cry out in pain, tasting the coppery flavour of your own blood as she splits your lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will SURRENDER!\" She thunders down at you. 'Last chance, beta....\" She stops slapping you, breathing heavily. Despite all of the pain and suffering, you realise that you have a huge boner in this position. She notices this to and sneers down at you. \"Why are you even fighting me? You are too weak, to helpless. Now, my little bitch - you will BEG me to be my slave forever. Beg me.

For a crazy moment, you feel like laughing with relief but you manage to control yourself. Deciding to wait until Farah actually falls asleep, you stay put until you hear the sound of her gentle snores up above you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding ever so carefully across, you are back at the foot rack. Knowing that you can't spend long here, since Farah has woken up once already, you randomly choose four pairs of heels; as it's unlikely you won't get the colours and style Helena has demanded, getting a fourth pair may still satisfy her. Still crouched down, eight of the Lebanese woman's shoes in your possession, you shuffle gradually forward, out of her bedroom and close the door. Not wasting a second, you head straight out of the door, closing it gently behind you, leaning against it and sighing heavily, your heart thumping like crazy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've done it! It's meant that you've basically the law and stolen women's property, but you now have eight pairs of shoes - all of them heels and the correct size for Michelle and Helena. Getting back inside your apartment and placing Farah's shoes down next to Jacinta's, you are mightily relieved to see that they are all new-looking and well cared for. A couple of pairs are open-toed heels, including the white ones you temporarily removed from the shoe rack before. Anyway, they will do! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheer exhaustion taking you over, - it's approximately 1 AM after all - you stumble blindly towards your bed and practically collapse onto it, falling asleep in seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing you know, your alarm is going off, jerking you upright, a foam of saliva on your mouth plastered to the bed sheets. It takes a few moments to remember your situation. You're still in your janitors' clothes...which makes you feel a little revolted with yourself, considering how much you stink. However, there's no time to shower or change - it's gone 6:30 AM and you need to be at work! Finding a couple of large carrier bags to put all of your new acquired shoes into, you just about have time to brush your teeth and wash some water on your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMan, you look like crap! There are heavy bags under your eyes, your face is pale and pallid-looking. With a groan, you realise that you've still got the same boxers on from yesterday - the ones you creamed into while sniffing Jacinta's shoes. Rummaging through your drawers, you have none to change into! Dammit...the last few days have put you way out of routine! Tonight you must get home, get some washing on, have a proper shower.... But there's no time - you can't be late to work!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving just in time, you stay just enough ahead of Kim to avoid what would be another embarrassing conversation. You open up, then head straight down to your 'office' in the basement with the shoes. Crap...the shoe rack! Hastily finding some wood and assembling it amateurishly together, you spend the next 20 minutes assembling it together so that it resembles some sort of furniture. Anxiety building, you abandon this to go on with your morning chores - emptying the bins, vacuuming, mopping the floors....fortunately you manage to avoid any women when you hastily clean the ladies' bathroom floors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking the time, you feel a cold shiver of sweat pour down you as you see it's 10 past 8...shit, late for Helena and Michelle! Abandoning the mop and bucket, you race back down to the basement, pick up your hastily-assembled shoe rack with the two large bags of shoes and drag them back upstairs towards Michelle's new office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you get there do you see anyone?

A few seconds passes before Helena appears, a glare on her tough yet pretty face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bitch...\" She says in a soft, menacing voice. \"You're late, si. You better have good stuff for us.\" Opening the door, revealing Michelle sat on her office chair, bare feet up on the desk, you nearly drop to your knees and willingly bow down to the petite goddess! You manage to resist, manoeuvring into the room your makeshift shoe rack and two large bags of shoes - all of which are stolen items of course! Helena closes the door behind her and stands next to her boss, arms folded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle and her assistant look at one another, the corners of their mouths twitching. Finally, Michelle speaks. \"What the fuck is this?\" Snorting a little, she points at the planks of wood you've assembled together. \"You call that a shoe rack?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes boss...sorry boss,\" You say weakly. \"I...I couldn't get one at the mall....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liar,\" Helena hisses walking over to you, and grabbing you by the ear, shoving you roughly to the ground. \"Stay on your knees, gringo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do so, noticing that the Latina is also barefoot. Michelle stares at you with contempt for a few seconds, savouring the moment. \"Helena's right. You're a cheapskate, lying little bitch. You will buy us a proper shoe rack this evening - I want the best. Keep the receipt - I want a thousand dollars spent on it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeart sinking, you're already concerned about finances since your pay cut, not to mention the wasted grand or so you spent on shoes yesterday, before you lost them of course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, boss,\" You say meekly, staring at the sumptuously soft bare soles, which you would love to caress your tongue around right now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping her fingers at you, Michelle clicks her tongue impatiently. \"Hellooo? Back up here, foot boy. Now, let's see the shoes you got us. What was it you wanted, Helena?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three pairs of open-toed heels each. White, blue and brown,\" The Hispanic woman states, looking excited at the prospect of having this many new work shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod fervently, feeling anxiety spread to every single part of you. With trembling fingers, you open the bag for Michelle, pulling out each shoe, lining them up neatly on the floor while the two women exchange glances. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four pairs?\" Michelle frowns. \"Well, that's good. But these aren't the right colours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm s-sorry, b-boss,\" you stammer. \"I, I mean...they didn't have those colours...I got the closest...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only one pair of open-toed heels,\" Helena growls. \"Why did you get three regular heels, bitch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...\" Your words trail off as the Latina grabs the other carrier bag from you impatiently and drops the shoes to the ground. Gulping, you look at your bosses' reactions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, not what Helena asked for...\" Michelle says, a frown still on her face. \"Still, four pairs...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you can do is stay knelt before the two women and hope that they don't punish you too harshly for not following Helena's instructions...</span></div></div>",

What do you have to say for yourself, bitch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...sorry, boss!\" You whine up at her, finding that despite being spoken to like dirt, you're actually getting a hard on by being this close to her bare feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena tuts and narrows her dark eyes at you. \"Sorry isn't good enough, gringo. You <i>perdedor</i>!\" She spits at you, leaning forward to slap you hard across the face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I honestly don't know what's worse,\" Michelle says in a cold tone, though there's a smirk on her lips. \"Getting the wrong colour, the wrong style, your pathetic excuse for a shoe rack...being LATE here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...\" is all you can mumble, knowing that you've seriously messed up here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell, you even got the number wrong!\" Michelle leans forwards and grabs you by the scruff of the neck, pulling you closer to her bare soles so they are practically touching your face. \"You wanna please mine and Helena's feet, don't you bitch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...<i>yes</i>!\" You whimper, using all of your self control to resist kissing or licking her heavenly soles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to the shoes on the floor, Helena has a look of disgust on her face as she inspects a couple of the shoes - the ones you stole from your neighbour, Farah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These...these aren't even new!\" The Latina rages, practically shaking with anger as she kicks you hard in the ribs. You'd probably have fallen over, were it not for Michelle holding you steady. \"Where the fuck did you get these, some charity shop?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...\" You say weakly, trying still to avoid pursing your lips together to taste Michelle's glorious, soft, slightly-wrinkled soles. The moment passes - not from your self-control, but as Michelle lets you go, causing you to shuffle backwards, nearly falling on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She asked you a question. Did you get these from a fucking charity shop, bitch?\" Michelle asks you, the petite brunette raising an eyebrow at you, a stony expression on her pretty face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you 'fess up to your bosses? You're so in awe of them that the idea of lying is not as easy as it would be. However, telling them the truth could spell disastrous consequences for you! Do you tell the truth or pretend they are indeed from the charity shop?!</span></div></div>",

Huh, you'd probably like that, wouldn't you, loser?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...please, boss!\" You whimper, bowing down to the two women and staring at their feet on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please what?

I'll do whatever you say. Please, let me be your shoe bitch! I'll d-do a b-better job! I'll dedicate my life to you!\" You prostate yourself before them, lying spread-eagled on the floor, shifting uncomfortably at the fact that you have a definite boner in your pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth women seem to notice this simultaneously and laugh at your pathetic display. \"Hahahah! Getting turned on, even when we're mad at him...he really is a hopeless creature!\" Michelle sighs, wiping a tear of laughter away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena doesn't seem as pleased; her laughter is harsh and gloating. She rests a bare foot on the back of your head so your face is crushed into the carpet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what... I'm gonna make this your call, Helena. You're my assistant and I trust your judgement. I know you'll make the right decision! What shall we do with this foot gimp - see if Kim wants him as a personal foot pet, ruin his life by revealing his pervy secret to the world online, or give him one final chance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou desperately hope that Helena will go for the latter option!

No, I... I mean.... How do you even know this is for Michelle?\" you ask almost immediately, but Jacinta seems to be quick to notice your choice of words to refer to the rookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Michelle</i>\" she says while staring directly at you as you try to continue scrubbing the bottom of the car. \"It took you a bit longer than a day to start referring to me by my name after we met, James. About... 4 months if I'm not mistaken\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continue scrubbing you can't help but notice that her friendly tone from before had become kinda bitter, and knowing her as much as you do so far, you can clearly deduce she's getting jealous, but even though you don't really feel the same attraction to her as she does to you, you still feel the need to soften things up to be in good terms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah I mean... Kim assigned me to be her mentor and all. It would be kinda rude from me to refer to her as just a rookie, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh... And you are such a good mentor that you even decided to wash her car\" Jacinta adds. Looking up at her again you see that she has a rather sly grin on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say this was <i>her</i> car.\" You say, trying to cling on to whatever credibility you might have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on James, do you expect me to believe that you are just washing some random stranger's car coincidentally the same day as the rookie showed up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... w-why not?\" You respond coyly and stubbornly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well first of all because this is the most unnecessarily expensive car parked in the employees' parking lot, which, by the way, hasn't been here before... and that numberplate kinda gives it away too\" Jacinta responds with a victorious tone in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mentally slap yourself as you realize that you completely forgot about the numberplate, making you look like a complete fool for trying to deny who was this car's owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And second of all...\" She continues as she crouches next to you \"Because I know you, James. You are strong, determined, accomplished and proud. You are not one to make favors to any random stranger just because.\" She says matter-of-factly, which quite honestly boosts your ego a little bit and makes you feel grateful for having someone admire you like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, James, what is really going on?\" she asks with a sincere look of worry in her eyes \"Is the rookie blackmailing you? You know you can tell me, and I'll do my best to help you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPreviously Jacinta seemed to be too timid for your taste, every time she approached you it was to clumsily try to seduce you in any way that she thought fitting, and while you did find her attempts to be cute, you never really thought about giving her a proper chance. Right now however, Jacinta did not seem to be trying to seduce you, but rather she seemed to be genuinely worried about you, with a very real desire to help you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitate for a while, but seeing as how she had already caught you, you figure that it might be worth it to have someone to talk to about all this. So you simply explain your situation while trying to avoid the details concerning <i>your fetish.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou explain to Jacinta how the rookie saw a weakness in your methods of teaching and decided to use that against you. How she threatened to replace you with Denice, how she threatened to accuse you of sexual harassment, how she made you do all her work just to make her look good in front of Kim, and lastly how she took advantage of your position to make you wash her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacinta just stays there listening closely with clear disbelief in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That little bitch!\" she expresses wholeheartedly \"I can't believe she decided to pick on you like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well... my hands are tied as you can see\" you say as you go back to scrubbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... but why did you let her get away with it? You have been working here for way longer than she has, surely Kim would believe you more than she would believe her!\" Jacinta exclaims as she stands up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't Jacinta, I... I really feel like the rookie would find a way to put Kim against me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I would take your side! I don't care if she's new, if she just came here to have everything served to her in a silver plate while she humiliates you in the process then she clearly needs to be fired right away!\" Jacinta says while bringing her hands to her hips, which admittedly makes her look rather dominant and in control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do, I really do, but the rookie knows way too much and I am sure she would use that information to get me demoted or even fired while making sure she destroys my reputation. I simply cannot take that risk.\" You say, feeling crushed by the fact that you are actually turning down the help Jacinta's offering you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw come on, James! You can't let her <i>stomp</i> you like that! Especially not after all the hard work you have done here!\" she exclaims, making you pause for a moment to wonder if her use of the word 'stomp' was on purpose... but you quickly shrug the thought off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What could she even use against you when she has zero credibility with Kim?\" Jacinta continues her rant, and as you keep scrubbing while being lost in your thoughts you realize far too late that what you were thinking to yourself was accidentally revealed by your mouth too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My foot fetish, to begin with\" you let out with a heavy sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden silence falls upon the scene as you both freeze in place because of what you just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap! No! I mean...\" You try to explain yourself but Jacinta quickly interrupts you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your... foot fetish? So you are into... <i>feet</i>?\" she asks with an unidentifiable tone in her voice while looking directly at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling your cheeks darkening with embarrassment you simply lower your head not daring to look up at her. \"Please don't tell anyone\" Is all you say, not willing to resist just to be mercilessly defeated twice in the same day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that weakness you mentioned wasn't work related but about the rookie's feet?\" She asks, to which you only bring yourself to nod in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though she's not berating you or offending you in any way, you can't help but feel defeated and disgusted with yourself for letting yet another person know about your fetish, and you are quick to assume that not even Jacinta would want to help you out now, but surprisingly this doesn't seem to be the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I am not telling anyone, so you don't have to worry about that...\" Jacinta says softly, which you are really grateful for, but all of a sudden you hear a clacking sound and you turn around to see...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jacinta took off her shoe and is using her foot to invade your face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you <i>do</i> have to worry about, though, is how you're going to show me and my tootsies a good time, Jamesy!\" Jacinta pleasantly says in the back as she uses her foot to explore every single spot of your face, but while you heard and understood what she said completely, you still can't help to be stuck processing your current situation. Here was the lady who you long knew to have a crush on you, but who you never really bothered to pay attention to, and now you were literally under her foot with the very first effective move from her part. Getting a more than proper whiff of her delicious smelling pantyhosed foot, you start to steadily forget what you were doing before this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's what we're gonna do.\" Jacinta starts \"From now on I am going to let you indulge yourself with me AND my feet whenever you want. In our offices, a meeting room, a secret closet, it doesn't matter, all you have to do is ask and I'll make sure to fulfill all your fantasies!\" As she says this, your eyes finally unlock themselves from the sole that has been rubbing your face all over and turn to look at Jacinta directly, who was now leaning upon Michelle's car with one hand while still having the other hand on her hip. Jacinta's cheeks are now a shade darker due to her now obvious arousal over her position and all you can think about is how marvelous her proposition sounds so far, so much so than an obvious tent starts to form up in your pants. \"<b>BUT...</b>\" She continues \"I will only do this if you agree to my demands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Demands.... w-wha...?\" Is all that comes out of your mouth as you seem to be currently unable to be eloquent, but thankfully Jacinta seems to have been expecting that sort of reaction, so she plays it off as she initially may have intended while her sensual grin grows even wider. \"Well I am glad you asked, Jamesy!\" She starts again with a surprisingly joyful tone in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, hearing how the rookie has been stepping over you in such a short amount of time quite honestly breaks my heart, so I'm going to ask you to forget about her completely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but I'm...\" You mutter, but you are quickly silenced by Jacinta's toes finding their way to your lips and being pressed against them \"<i>But I'm her mentor!</i> I hear you say...\" Jacinta adds dominantly and smugly, clearly taking in every last drip of power she discovered to have over you now \"Don't worry about that, I have TWO plans for that, so you are free to choose whichever you like. Now, I know you are a <i>very</i> responsible man, so just dropping her off out of the blue would look bad on your record...\" As she says this, Jacinta starts to thoroughly trace your lips with her big toe as if to needlessly make sure she had your full attention, which she did, having you only wondering how she could be this permissive, dominant and caring at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Firstly, to soften things up, you'll have to go to Kim and explain to her your situation. Not the details of course, I'm very happy with being one of the only two people to know about your fetish~\" Jacinta says while teasingly poking your nose with each of her toes one at a time. \"So this is where your first choice begins. You can either tell Kim that you do not wish to be... <i>Michelle's</i> mentor anymore due to excess work...\" she says with obvious spite while pronouncing Michelle's name \"<b>OR</b> you can just tell her as much as you have told me so far, excluding the fetish part, and most certainly get her fired! To which I'll obviously back you up if Kim decides to ask for confirmation.\" this time speaking with a more eager tone in her voice, making you realize which of these she would like you to pick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bu... What if...\" you start, only to have Jacinta's smooth arch stop your mouth from continuing this time \"What if the rookie decides to reveal your fetish? Oh Jamesy, the things these tootsies will do to you will make you completely forget about other women's feet!\" Jacinta adds with complete confidence as she wriggles her toes right under your nose, making the delightful aroma stuck between them to rise and bless your nostrils. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis certainly seems to be an amazing proposition so far; Jacinta is not only willing to indulge your fetish but she has proven to be quite happy to do so as well! And not only that, she is also planning to support you if you decide to get rid of Michelle once and for all, getting rid of that bad weed before it grows into something more dangerous... <i>\"But do I want to get rid of it?\"</i> You suddenly and unwillingly ask yourself. Michelle may be a bratty and disrespectful bitch but her feet certainly seemed to make all the humiliation of the world worth it... right? Pondering about this makes you take a glance at Jacinta's pantyhosed feet to inspect them and compare them to Michelle's, and indeed, Jacinta's are not the petite goddess-like peds that Michelle has, but they are nowhere near unpleasant either, in fact, they seem to be quite attractive on their own regard, and if you agree to Jacinta's proposition you will have <i>THIS</i> pair available to you anytime you want, not only when you do some degrading task only to get a short glance at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you find yourself suddenly lost in thought, Jacinta simply continues with her short list of demands. \"Regardless of what you choose about that, the next issue is much simpler...\" she says before a pause to take a deep breath and start rubbing her breast through the fabric of her business attire, making you notice that she has been panting slightly for a while now. \"I want us to start dating... I want you all for myself, Jamesy~\" And immediately after saying this, Jacinta suddenly removes her foot from your face to bring it down to your waist and start \"scratching\" the tip of your tent with the very tip of her big toe, allowing the fabric of your pants absorb just the tiniest amount of Jacinta's foot sweat from the fabric of her nylons, the picture of which proves to be painfully merciless to your already raging erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow <b>this</b>, despite being somewhat expected from her by now, still takes you completely by surprise, but given your current position instead of dismissing the request, like every other time she invited you out before, you start to blush even harder than you already were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come ooooon~\" Jacinta cooes \"I'll make you feel <i>real</i> good if you accept. I'll even train my feet to be the ultimate pleasure machines just for you~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point your head is spinning like crazy, completely wanting to give in to Jacinta and her demands given how perfectly things would turn out for you if you did, but at the same time knowing full well that it would mean possibly risking the image Kim has of you for deciding to take Michelle under your wing only to suddenly abandon her, not to mention that by doing this you would be giving Denise somewhat of an advantage over you AND you would be loosing access to the most perfect pair of feet you have ever seen, however inaccessible they may be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs Jacinta's proposal truly worth it?</span></div></div>",

Of course, this IS the same building you work in! At least that gives you a hint as to who the sender may be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInitially you find yourself to be really confused -if slightly pleased- but even though you start to get over the initial shock of such a pleasant surprise, your nerves do not fade at all. You know of two women who are aware of your secret so you initially think this must Michelle playing with you, teasing you just to keep you under her thumb. \"That little bitch...\" you think to yourself while you remember the humiliation her feet alone caused you, but as you continue scrolling you notice that this pair of feet is rather different than Michelle's. Not ugly by any means, in fact, they are still prettier than normal but not as perfect as Michelle's. You continue scrolling through the various poses granted by this pair and you focus on the fact that Michelle doesn't wear nylons either, or at least you haven't seen her with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe she took pictures of someone else for some of her stupid plans.\" You think to yourself while you continue scrolling \"But what would she even get from this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to see more of those feet. In some pictures they are on the carpeted floor, on others they are on a computer's keyboard as if typing, on others you can only see the toes and in a few other you see them back in their shoes. And as you continue to scroll you notice that they all come from a point of view of the person taking the pictures. \"This woman took these herself\" You conclude \"But why would...?\" And it suddenly hits you. Could this in fact be Jacinta sending you these pictures?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember the nylons on her legs being the same color of the ones in these pictures, and the legs themselves, on closer inspection, do look very similar to hers... but why? Sure she had a crush on you but after accidentally revealing your fetish to her she immediately left you alone as if she was disgusted by it, or at least that's the impression you got from her actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue scrolling through these trying to figure out who truly was behind the camera, but it all comes to an end as you get the perfect confirmation right at the end of the chain: A video showing a preview of Jacinta smiling while holding one foot near her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's Jacinta after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the appealing preview though, your finger start trembling from a sudden and stronger wave of nerves \"Should I play it? Should I respond? What should I say? What is even going on? Does she want to blackmail me just like Michelle is?\" Your mind is completely flooded with questions and you start nagging to yourself when you notice that your member has already turned into an erection (even though you know that it has probably been like this since you started seeing the pictures).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow you feel like the very simple fact of playing this video can very easily hook you to Jacinta almost automatically, but at the same time it feels to you like it could either be release from Michelle... or cheat on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Cheat.</i> The word bouncing inside your mind \"Why is that even cheating? The bitch is taking advantage of me!\" you state to the air as if it was listening to you, and after another pause you scroll once more through the pictures of Jacinta's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe... Maybe this is for the best...\" You say in a whisper, already noticing how much importance you are giving to this chain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You already saw her feet, so it might as well be worth it to see what Jacinta had in store for you next, but as you do so you can't help but wonder how she found out your cellphone number to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe video starts with Jacinta smiling at the camera while moving her pretty little toes inside her nylons, an oddly hypnotizing sight that Jacinta seemed to be fully aware of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi James!\" she starts before dismissing her smile and continue with a serious tone \"Sorry for leaving out of the blue earlier but the lunch break was over and people were flowing back into the office. If anyone saw us like we were they might've suspected something.\" The sentence making you release a sarcastic chuckle \"As if things could get worse than what Michelle has done to me\" you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if reading your thoughts the video continues on the subject \"Judging by what you told me about the rookie you pretty much have it quite bad as it is, so you can see why I didn't really want to bring even more unwanted attention from others.\" Jacinta says before making a thoughtful pause and allowing her smile to return to her lips \"But now that you trusted me with your secret I believe I know a way to release you from that little bitch... and ironically enough it does involve giving you some release\" she giggles with her toes still wriggling inside her nylons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown. Jacinta did have something in mind after all and you were beginning to see what it was, but even though you already knew the answer a part of you couldn't help but desire Jacinta to finally declare the official words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacinta takes another small pause in the video while she lowers her foot, her serious expression coming back to her as if she was about to give you a business proposal instead of a way to get rid of Michelle. \"Okay look, first things first.\" she starts \"I have a <i>huge</i> crush on you, and I think you know it.\" You loosely nod to your phone as if it was paying attention to your reaction. \"And now I know you're into feet, so thank you so very much for that confession!\" she joyfully continues \"I know it might've been an accident that you just mentioned your fetish so casually but, and forgive me for this, I can only see the upcoming events as a win-win situation!\" she declares with a smile and a matter-of-fact tone in her words that grabs your attention just as easily as the pictures of her feet did earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply sigh already knowing what she was about to propose. Two times you have revealed your fetish, and two times you have been dragged into something completely unexpected because of it, but at least Jacinta seemed to be truly concerned with your well-being, so at least you can find comfort in the fact that this cannot be worse than Michelle's treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor now though, I will just ask you to come to the secluded meeting room in the far back of the building, you know the one that nobody ever goes to.\u201d She starts saying, giving you a surprising sense of disappointment given your current expectations. \u201cI will be there waiting for you as soon as I am done with work for the day, so since I am well aware that you end at the same time as I do~\u2026\u201d Her words bring a chill up your spine as you hear that she even knows about your schedule \u201c\u2026 I will be giving you 10 minutes of tolerance. If you do not get there by that time, I will take no offense and I will simply stay out of your business for the time being.\u201d Jacinta then pauses to bring a finger to her now mischievous looking lips \u201cWhether or not I decide to <i>anonymously</i> reveal your secret after that will be up for debate~\u201d she coyly adds with a surprisingly sensual grin, but one that ultimately only serves to you feel uneasy\u2026 She isn\u2019t really giving you a choice here\u2026 is she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut!\u201d she suddenly bursts out \u201cIf you <i>do</i> come to me, not only will I take your presence as an immediate sign of your approval for my plans\u2026 I will also make sure to show you a good time~.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA good time? She couldn\u2019t possibly mean\u2026 \u201cRight now I am doing some research on this fetish of yours, Jamesy, and let me tell you, I wouldn\u2019t really mind to have you at my feet like this!\u201d she says right before letting out a very girly giggle. \u201cIn fact, I think I may very well enjoy it. So many ways to enjoy each other just by using my feet! Make you my footslave~, teasing your cock~ Letting you <i>fuck</i>  my feet like an animal\u2026\u201d As Jacinta goes on describing the possibilities you realize that all this dirty talk not only has made you blush wildly, but it has also taken its toll on your member, rising a fully visible tent in your pants that you quickly try to hide. You know that for it to subside you have to stop thinking about Jacinta\u2019s proposal\u2026 but you just HAVE to know what else she has to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you push the play button once again to allow the recording to continue you notice that Jacinta started breathing somewhat heavily, clearly enjoying the erotic pictures coming to her mind involving finally having you for herself, so after a deep breath she continues \u201cPoint being, I will make sure to satisfy you in <i>every way</i> you want, so make your choice Jamesy, do you wanna be humiliated the bad way\u2026?\u201d she pauses to bring her other nyloned foot into the take \u201cOr the nice way?\u201d she adds with a sensual wink before suddenly sticking out her tongue and giving her own foot a long, slow and deliberate lick from the heel to her toes, planting a kiss on her big toe as if she was trying to French-kiss it, licking her lips afterwards with a satisfied-sounding sigh, and ending it all with yet another teasingly sensual phrase \u201cI think I see why you like feet. These tasty treats and I will be waiting~\u201d she finally says as her still risen foot mocks a hand\u2019s movements when expressing a farewell. And just like that, the video ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake!\u201d You silently scream to yourself. Twice has your fetish been exposed, and twice has it been taken advantage of\u2026 Should you be mad about it though? If anything, Michelle\u2019s treatment was certainly less than ideal but it still granted you (somewhat limited) access to her petite and beautiful feet, and on the other hand Jacinta seemed to be rather convinced about wanting to indulge your fetish openly\u2026 but what if any of them reveals your secret?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point you are running out of choices. If you carry on with Michelle she will not report about your perversions and Jacinta MIGHT not do it either, but Michelle will certainly continue to put your career, not to mention mental health, at risk until she officially becomes your superior; and if you do accept to meet up with Jacinta there\u2019s no telling what she will end up doing to you. It might actually feel good, sure, but what if it was just a bait? What if she actually ends up being just as manipulative and abusive as Michelle? You would essentially be trading Michelle\u2019s perfect-looking feet for Jacinta\u2019s normally-attractive feet and the treatment would still be the same, assuming Michelle doesn\u2019t end up revealing your secret due to the lack of attention you may pay to her feet after accepting Jacinta\u2019s offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many possibilities, but how to know which is the right choice? Are their feet really worth that much?<br>\r\nAfter a while you realize that you have been standing there dumbfounded in the middle of the parking lot for quite a while, so adding this to the time you spent washing Michelle\u2019s car you realize that you will be more than delayed on your due work of the day, so you quickly rush off to your office so you can burst off as much work as possible, but of course, Michelle makes sure to intervene all the way through\u2026 and she didn\u2019t even thank you for washing her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for you the rest of the day goes by relatively peacefully. Despite Michelle\u2019s frequent demands to \u201chelp her\u201d with her work and her constant teasing with her feet and sandals, you manage to be almost done with your due work for the day by the time you normally are; you weren\u2019t called \u2018one of the best\u2019 for nothing after all. You realize it\u2019s the end of the work day when you see Michelle rise up and pack her things; before leaving she slides one sandal off while making sure you\u2019re looking at her foot, and gives your lower leg a painfully gentle rub. \u201cSee you tomorrow, my feet addicted mentor~\u201d Is all she says before rushing off to the exit. \u201cWell\u2026 time to finish this and go home.\u201d You say to yourself while cracking your knuckles, but you suddenly remember the video and pictures Jacinta sent you earlier, so you take a quick glance at the clock to see that your 10 minutes of tolerance had already started\u2026 but are you really willing to go? If you leave things as they are right now you may not be able to be completely done with your due work for today and the amount of work you have to do will start to stack up\u2026 but Jacinta\u2019s offer is just so damn tempting\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You sigh in resignation as you finally decide to stand up. This may result in work piling up a bit, but it may also mean the beginning of a lot of stimulation for your fetish, so you simply save your progress, turn off your computer and quickly head off to where Jacinta told you to meet her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk through the building's offices and hallways your mind continues to think about the pictures Jacinta sent to tease you as well as the video with her tantalizing proposition, trying to think of something that may actually have a second meaning or a hidden message or... <i>SOMEthing</i> that may actually prove that this was all just an elaborate trap that will catch you under the will of another woman who wanted to take advantage of you and your proposition... but be it as it may, nothing came to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jacinta isn't Michelle, after all.\" You say to yourself as if to add some unnecessary credibility to the fact, but... <i>Jacinta isn't Michelle</i>. The thought of replacing Michelle with Jacinta crossed your mind again, and despite you being already on your way to find the secluded place that Jacinta was talking about in the video, you cannot help but think about the implications that doing so would mean. \"To replace a petite goddess for an average cutie...\" You mumble half-heartedly. Just <i>how much</i> is this worth doing? you think right before the word \"cutie\" resonates in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-did I just...?\" Call Jacinta a cutie? Yes, yes you did, and to be fair you didn't do so without reason since Jacinta has a lot going on for her as well. Again, she may not be a perfect-looking freshly out of college girl who immediately started to dominate you, but she isn't bad looking at all! Nice body, long legs, perky breasts, and overall fairly attractive, not to add seemingly caring and blissfully kinky for... \"Wait...\" you suddenly stop that train of thought \"Is this me thinking this or is it my...\" And before finishing that sentence you take a glance down between your legs to visually confirm that your second head is already getting ahead of you, so you simply chuckle at the strong reaction Jacinta is causing over you without her even being in your presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's true, Jacinta is quite attractive in her own regard, and she is willing to indulge your fetish if you accept her terms, not only that, but accepting this might actually release you from Michelle's cruel grasp and allow you to steel yourself a little bit more when in her presence... You might actually start acting like a mentor to her instead of a handy slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, after a few more steps you finally reach the place where Jacinta asked you to meet her. The ever so slightly heavy ambient, the echo of your steps traveling through the almost empty aisles, the unkept painting on the walls, the scent of humidity all around you, and the somewhat noticeable warmer temperature only served as indication that this was indeed the least traveled zone in the building. There have been times before when you would just hear from other workers that this place was supposedly \"cursed\" or \"haunted\" and that there was some sort of heavy presence coursing through here, but to someone as methodical and perceptive as you it was quite easy to deduce the very real and mundane reasons as to why people didn't like to be around here, and to be fair you didn't like it either, but this was where Jacinta asked to meet for a reason, and that was probably because it would be harder for anyone to find you two doing who knows what in here, but by now almost everyone has gone home so it was almost completely certain that nobody would ever bother you all the way over here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last you reach the door on the far back and take a glance at your watch with a humorous snort. \"One minute left.\" you mumble as you realize you were actually getting worried about being late, but at least now you're here so you grab the door knob and slowly open the squeaking door while trying to take a peek inside but the noise of the door proves to be enough to give away your presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Jamesy! I'm glad you decided to accept my offer!\" Jacinta cheerfully says. Realizing it no longer made sense to try and be discreet you simply sigh with relief and open the door normally only to see Jacinta comfortably sitting on one of the office chairs of the meeting room with her phone on her hands and her feet dangling on the edge of the big central table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a closer look at the rest of the room you realized, or rather, <i>remembered</i> that there was another reason for people to almost never visit this meeting room in particular; not only was the entire zone humid and unkept, but this meeting room was also the smallest in the entire building, and the fact that it did not even have windows at all only worsened its reputation, but now was not the time to worry about such things. \"Remember what I said on the video right?\" Jacinta continues \"That your mere presence here was to be taken as a 'yes' to whatever I had to say?\" To which you simply sigh and nod in resignation, making Jacinta smile. \"Good. Close the door behind you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you close the door you realize that you have been breathing a little bit heavily, although if it was because of the heavy ambience or out of complete nervousness you did not know, however, Jacinta took it as the latter anyway. \"Aww don't be nervous Jamesy~\" she cooes \"I promise it'll feel <i>real</i> good\" she adds with a flirtatious wink. Looking at her so relaxed and with the soles of her shoes facing you really does give her a dominant aura, one that you honestly never expected to see her surrounded with, so you try to compose yourself with a deep breath and you try your best to keep yourself from stuttering. \"W-What will?\" you finally ask, making Jacinta's eyes shimmer in anticipation \"Well I'm glad you asked!\" she says while reaching for her work bag and start rummaging through her stuff. \"I have to admit, I wasn't completely sure you would show up, especially because of the suddenness of it all.\" You drop your stuff onto one of the chairs as she speaks but you do not sit down yourself, and looking back at her as she looks for something in her bag you notice that her smile hasn't vanished and that she even started blushing, making her look... very cute actually, but as you find yourself finishing to process what was probably going to happen, Jacinta continues speaking \"SO! I made some preparations just in case something did happen!\" she adds in a small burst of giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, here we go.\" she finally says as she takes out a yellow folder and opens it to see if it was the right one. \"Preparations? What do you mean? What are we gonna do exactly?\" you ask impatiently, making Jacinta stare back at you with a somewhat mischievous grin \"Well I did my research of course.\" She responds \"Since I got to know about your secret fetish I thought it might be worth taking a look at a few <i>porn</i> sites to get a better idea of what we'll be doing~\" she confidently states basking completely on your reaction before continuing \"I found a lot of kinky looking stuff, Jamesy, and trust me when I say that I want to try it all... But right now we'll just focus on signing your contract.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Contract?! What are you...?\" you suddenly ask, sounding a lot angrier than you actually were (that is to say, not at all), but before you even finished your question Jacinta quickly interrupted with \"Well this one of course~\" as she hands you the folder and its content, so you start reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><div align=\"center\">**Secretive Agreement between Mr. James And Ms. Jacinta**</div></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nReading only this is enough to make you chuckle nervously as you look back at Jacinta as if to ask for confirmation if this was real, but her unfazed stare is quick to show how serious she was being about it, so you take a deep breath and continue reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>'The present contract is formally presented as a visual form of agreement of Ms. Jacinta's proposal to Mr. James in regards to the treatment of his, until recently, secret foot fetish. In order for the proposal to start in effect, Mr. James shall agree with the following: <br>\r\nA. Mr. James will no longer...' </i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause your reading again, this time because of Jacinta. \"I want you to continue reading it aloud, James. You know, just so I know there aren't any typos or anything\" she says while playfully wrinkling her nose at you and continuing to dangle her feet on the edge of the table, making sure to continue teasing you without even removing her shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take another deep breath before continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>'1. Mr. James will no longer lust after the feet of other women, only Ms. Jacinta's feet are to be pampered with Mr. James's attention.<br>\r\nB. Mr. James will no longer be able to masturbate, his ejaculation shall be completely under Ms. Jacinta's control.'</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to tremble as you read, but not out of fear of course, but out of excitement and overpowering nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>'C. Mr. James shall always listen to Ms. Jacinta's requests and do his best to fulfill them. In case they are too much for him he has the right to say so and it will be up to Ms. Jacinta to decide if he has to fulfill the request or not.<br>\r\n ... <br>\r\nD. Mr. James is expected as a default request to ask the office manager Kim for the reassigning of tutor for the rookie Michelle. He will no longer be in charge of her or any other female newcomers that may come in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the previously mentioned standards are met and agreed on, Ms. Jacinta agrees to fulfill Mr. James's needs with several methods up for future discussion, including, but not limited to:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. At least one footjob per day.<br>\r\n2. Free access to Ms. Jacinta's feet.<br>\r\n3. Freedom to request Ms. Jacinta to wear specific outfits and/or footwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo exploitation shall come from the origin party, but it is expected of both to participate accordingly to the statements here described.'</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis really does look serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sure, there were a few worrying points and implications in this 'contract', mainly the fact that Jacinta would have complete control over your ejaculation... but that only made things more exciting so it hardly matters when you have a raging boner aching for release. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will it be like? Will I be able to handle it? Is this seriously happening?\" The questions are mercilessly starting to flood your mind, but Jacinta quickly intervenes with a burst of giggles as she catches on your trembling and quite obvious blushing \"Should I be taking those sweet reactions of yours as a 'Yes' then, James?\" she asks seductively while ever so slightly rubbing her ankles together, the sound of her nylons making you go even crazier than you already were feeling. Right now your blood is boiling with desire, Jacinta's plan to conquer you is clearly working as she intended, maybe even better than that, and now that she proved to be so open and eager to indulge you all you want to do is drop to your knees, remove Jacinta's shoes and practically make love to her feet in every way imaginable... but you know that, even if it takes every single particle of your being, you have to control yourself to not make yourself look like a desperate feet-craving animal which might make even Jacinta have second thoughts about her crush on you. Right now the best you can do is resist your urges and wait for Jacinta's instructions... Luckily for you, she doesn't take long to do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's official then!\" Jacinta cheerfully says while clasping her hands together after hearing no response from you but instead assuming that your shaking and nervous hesitation to speak up is a \u2018yes\u2019 \"If you would be so kind as to sign it up, I would be <i>so very</i> glad to formally start our... <i>accord</i>.\" At this point Jacinta's eyes and her mischievous smile reveal an excitement, lust and desire just as big as yours, maybe even greater considering that she has had a crush on you for quite a while and, right now, you could not be more thankful for that. You feel your cheeks burning with anticipation as your hands frantically search your pockets for a pen, no longer questioning the logic of this whole situation, and as you finally stumble upon your pen you can barely hold it properly \u201cI might not be able to sign it properly\u201d you think to yourself \u201c\u2026 but <i>fuck</i> it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout the need of a second thought you lay the paper on the table, quite close to Jacinta\u2019s dangling feet which makes you notice a hint of a cheesy/leathery but <i>very</i> pleasant aroma, showing that even Jacinta\u2019s shoes cannot fully contain her feminine scent from this distance and giving your boner another buff of growth. As you reach the pen towards the bottom of the contract you can\u2019t help but feel an overwhelming child-like impatience, you know that the sooner you sign this the sooner all your fantasies will be fulfilled without having to risk your job or your reputation; Jacinta truly does seem to be a gift from the heavens right now, but just as you start to imagine the first things you\u2019ll do to Jacinta\u2019s feet, she suddenly stops you on your tracks. \u201cJames, what are you doing?\u201d she suddenly asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-w-well s-signing the\u2026\u201d you start but Jacinta predicts the rest of your phrase once again and interrupts you \u201cI know that you\u2019re <i>TRYING</i> to do that, James\u2026 but I didn\u2019t tell you to sign it with <i>that</i> pen..\u201d she says dryly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-this pen? Is\u2026 is there something wrong with it?\u201d you nervously ask. What is she trying to say? Did she regret coming up with all of this after all? \u201cWell\u2026\u201d she starts \u201cNot necessarily\u2026 but I want you to use your <i>own.</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about? This is my pen! Did you not see me d-desperately reach for it to sign this\u2026 uh\u2026 this?\u201d you suddenly and hesitantly burst questions in rapid fire, the nerves making you sound angry again for some reason even though you know that you are just overly eager to get this done\u2026 you have come this far after all, but Jacinta does seem to have something better in mind, and you only realize this as she starts giggling uncontrollably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Jamesy! Had I known that teasing you with my feet like this would be so effective we would have started dating the <i>DAY</i> I first met you! But I have to admit, having this much power over you right now was <i>TOTALLY</i> worth the wait!\u201d she pleasantly exclaims before allowing her own giggling to die off with a satisfied sigh. \u201cAhhh\u2026 no Jasmesy, I meant <i>YOUR</i> pen\u201d is all she says before extending one of her legs towards you, making her shoed foot press against the throbbing cock that lies caged under your pants and making you moan in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are completely baffled by Jacinta\u2019s revelation, she couldn\u2019t possibly be asking you to sign it with your\u2026? \u201cI want those pants off\u201d she swiftly says, giving confirmation to your wild thoughts. Still, a contract signed with\u2026 with your cock? \u201cWh-what is\u2026 you can\u2019t be se\u2026\u201d you start, but Jacinta gives you a piercing glance right before you can even formulate a proper question, and that proves to be enough to show you that whatever you were going to say, Jacinta did indeed mean what she said, so you quickly shove your pants off but you keep your underwear just in case, pleasing Jacinta and making her purr and smile once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Jamesy~\u201d Jacinta mutters as she reaches for her breasts, grabbing your attention on that area long enough for you to not pay attention to the clacking sound that suddenly came from near her feet, but your instincts quickly kick in and make you turn to the source of the sound\u2026 Jacinta\u2019s shoes were on the ground and her nyloned feet were rubbing each other while filling the whole room with their erotic aroma. \u201cI suppose I can help you out with that if you get closer~\u201d Jacinta says while pointing at your boner, so without further hesitation you finally position yourself near the edge of the table, granting Jacinta\u2019s feet to have enough space to go to town on your pubic area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst let\u2019s get rid of these as well\u201d she says while already poking your cock with the tip of her toe through the fabric, but before you could even react to reach down and take your underwear off, Jacinta\u2019s feet rush to the spaces between your skin and your underwear and quickly shove the thing down, allowing your raging boner to finally bounce out free and be in the presence of this eager woman and her seemingly skillful feet. As she gets a good look at your erection Jacinta lets out a series of short pleased moans as she continues rubbing her breasts and starts wriggling her toes in anticipation, but things might not turn out <i>exactly</i> as you expected. \u201cAlright! That should do!\u201d she suddenly says as she props her feet on the table again, mercilessly staying put right in front of your penis, making you suddenly shake your head and clear your thoughts as if you had been in a trance during the last few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? W-why? Jacinta please!\u201d you start to plead as if you were just refused a life-saving service, giving Jacinta all the eye candy that she probably was expecting to get and making her throw a mixture of moans and giggles as she watches you beg for her. \u201cOh~ don\u2019t worry Jamesy~ I said I would help you so I will!\u201d she happily states as she places one foot over the other, allowing her upper sole to open up a space between it and the instep of her other foot, all while reaching for the contract and placing it behind her makeshift hole. \u201cYou haven\u2019t <i>signed</i> yet so I can\u2019t really give you a footjob now, can I?\u201d she says with a slow and provocative tone. \u201cBut that is not to say I can\u2019t bend the rules juuust a little bit and let you rub yourself on me in order for you to sign it properly~.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are confused, surprised and excited at the same time, but at least you now know that <b><i>this</i></b> is official! She\u2019s asking you to <b>FUCK</b> her feet and cum on the contract! And the best of it all is that this is only the beginning of what seems to be a promising daily life of foot fetish satisfaction! \u201cGo on then\u2026 I won\u2019t move\u201d she teasingly adds with a provocative wink.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You should totally shake it up, that <i>always</i> helps me to force the ink out of my pens!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacinta's teasing words only serve to make you tremble even more, and as you find yourself grasping onto the table with all your available might you start to notice how strong the scent of her feet has become in this secluded space since she took off her shoes, making you start to take deep breaths with both your mouth and your nose as you try to take all of it inside your system, a sight that makes Jacinta giggle as she slowly slides her hand in between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my~\" she continues with her fake innocent tone \"Is the smell of my feet bothering you Jamesy? You're all red and you're even shaking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis woman... this <u>cruel</u> woman was determined to make you as aroused as humanly possible even though you were still in the office, but then again, that may well be one of the reasons as to why it was working so damn well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true that I spent aaaaall daaaaay~ walking here and there at work, which may have made my feet just a liiiiiiittle sweaty~ And maybe I should've taken my shoes off to air them off a couple times but what if the <i>strong smell</i> bothered some poor innocent by passer hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacinta's excuse isn't helping your situation, you are basically gasping for air right now since her words only serve to emphasize the dank smell around you and the soft and warm moisture that is surrounding your stiff and throbbing member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I knoooow you are not bothered by it because you're a gentleman!\" she continues while ever so slitghtly applying just a little bit of pressure to your erection with her feet, something that could've barely been noticed under different circumstances... but that was proving to be VERY effective right now that your senses are so focused on your cock \"And a gentleman would <i>NEVER</i> tell a lady that her feet stink, right Jamesy?\" To which you nod, proving both to Jacinta and to yourself that you still have <i>some</i> semblance of mental capacity despite your sensory overload.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I am so glad to know that!\" she claps her hands \"Well then, what are you waiting for? Weren't you going to shake that pen? You should hurry or we will be late for dinner~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a moment... dinner? Your curiosity compels you to take your gaze away from the void you were staring at and back to Jacinta who was slowly rubbing her clit with one hand and writing something up on her phone before looking back at you \u201cOh yes I forgot to tell you, I actually booked us for some dinner in that fancy restaurant from down street. You know which one right? I remember you mentioned it was your favorite! It was supposed to be a surprise for later but I\u2019m seeing that time is running short so you might want to move those hips, big boy~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment you try to think how it was that she knew that little fun fact about you even though you never really told her but the blissful situation that you\u2019re in proves to be way more important. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a treat, what an absolute treat, if your ragged breathing wasn\u2019t proving otherwise you might have thought that you died and went to heaven. Here you were, having your first genuine foot fetish experience with a woman that seems to be willing and happy to indulge you in something that you have kept secret for the longest time, and not only that but she also decided to take you on a date to one of your favorite restaurants\u2026 \u201cI better hurry then\u201d you finally think with a very satisfied smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any second thoughts you somewhat recover from the haze in your mind just enough to grab Jacinta\u2019s ankles with one hand and the still moist tips of her toes with the other in order to apply proper pressure, an action that causes her to squeal happily in the most girly way you have heard her sound since you started working here, and that by extension causes your member to throb even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then if you insist\u2026\u201d you start, feeling already emboldened by Jacinta\u2019s eager attitude towards your fetish \u201c\u2026 I agree to the terms and conditions\u201d you cheesily add as you take another deep breath right before commencing to slide your dick out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn and out, in and out. Your movements, while slow at first, become progressively faster as you feel yourself getting lost between Jacinta\u2019s blissfully soft feet and the natural lube that was her sweat; even though you\u2019re somehow not really paying attention to the act itself thanks to the returning sensory overload you can still hear Jacinta\u2019s moaning mixing along with your own. The simple fact that she was getting pleasure out of this just like you helped a great deal in edging you closer and closer towards orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026 YES, fuck my feet like you mean it\u2026\u201d You hear her mumble as her own breathing gets worked up along with yours thanks to the pleasure she\u2019s receiving between her feet, her clitoris, and even within her own pride as a woman. Thinking about this is enough to make you turn your sight towards her, proving that she is indeed quite overwhelmed by a sense of achievement, making you release the softest of chuckles as you realize that your dick is only sliding in and out of her deliciously soft feet thanks to the slip you did earlier today with Michelle\u2026 \u201cOh how wonderful is the thread of destiny\u201d you think to yourself as you allow a smile to come to your lips.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But she knows exactly what she is doing! In your peripheral vision, you can just make out the creamy skin of Michelle's bare foot, slipping out of her open toed flat. It's too much for you! Finding your eyes wander downwards, much like a moth to the light, you manage to suppress a moan from escaping your lips, but only just!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle's foot is, like her, petite and sexy. Her pink-painted toenails bounce lightly off the ground, almost as if to mock you! And she is mocking you; she knows full well that you are hypnotised by her bare foot, powerless to even wrench your eyes away. After a few seconds or so of admiring her gorgeous foot, you can't help but wander what her bare sole would look like - incredible no doubt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're in love with my <i>feet</i>,\" she says sing-song manner, as before. \"You can't even look away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a considerable effort to break from this trance; as you raise your eyes back up to meet hers, you feel admittedly weak and vulnerable. Is there even any point trying to deny it...feasting your eyes upon her beautiful foot for that long has made it practically impossible to assert any kind of authority over this girl. She knows it and you know it: she's calling the shots now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've gotta tell you James, I find shoes <i>sooo</i> uncomfortable. I'm only wearing these shoes 'cos I thought I would have to. At college, I would walk around barefoot most of time, even on campus. You wouldn't mind if I worked barefoot next to you, would you?\" The petite brunette giggles a little at you, clearly enjoying how much she is teasing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...um...I mean, it...it's not a...um - a, problem...er,\" you babble incoherently back at her, rather bamboozled by her assertiveness. The mention of the word 'barefoot' made you flicker your eyes downward once again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Michelle is slowly grazing her foot against the wheels of the office chair, spreading her cute toes so that you can't help but admire how dainty, how elegant her foot is...the creamy colour of her skin makes it look so lovely, so delicious! She must take good care of her feet, you muse, especially as there's a fragrant, pleasant scent wafting up towards your nose. It's hard to tell whether it's from her foot, or her perfume in general, to be fair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take that's a yes then,\" she says smugly before beginning to slip off the other shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is getting out of hand! If you allow Michelle to run roughshod over you like this, you'll have absolutely zero authority over her, making it impossible to perform any of your mentor tasks! What would Kim say if you admitted to her that you weren't able to act as a strong role model, or were unable to carry out any performance management tasks? The whole point is to be tough on a newbie to make sure they hit all their targets; unless Michelle's sole (literally in this case!) target is to work barefoot while teasing her mentor, you're not going to realistically get her to do anything!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan you allow her to take over like this and make your mentor role redundant, or do you somehow find the resolve to separate work from your foot fetish? </span></div></div>",

My email address?\"  She lowers her foot, distancing it from you slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right, sorry.\"  You pull your eyes from Michelle's flawless white foot, and get up from your chair.  You have to perform some adjustments in your pants to hide the results of Michelle's teasing, but you manage to head for your manager, Kim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're a little intimidated by the middle-aged red-head, which thankfully clears some of the haze from your mind.  She's moved to her office, but the door is open, so you step in after a brief knock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim slides her chair back and crosses her legs as she waits to her what you've come to say.  \"What is it, James?  Didn't I just put you in charge of showing Michelle around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About that...Michelle was wondering when she would be getting her own email address, so I came to ask you about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim's lips curve into a faint smirk.  \"Oh?  Already stepping all over you, is she?\"  She laughs as if making an idle joke, but you freeze, your mind filled with the image of being trodden on by Michelle's exquisite feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou miss Kim's next statement, and have to blink a few times and ask her to repeat it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks a bit irritated, but there's a faint hint of knowing amusement in her expression as well... \"I <i>said</i>, IT usually takes a couple days with it.

You find yourself staring fixedly at the pair of ivory feet enthroned in your chair.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would feel <i>so</i> natural, <i>so</i> good to just kneel down on the floor and kiss them.  But you know you can't until Michelle allows it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They should have it ready for you... by tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle sighs as if depressed by your incompetence, then shrugs.  \"I guess you can give my feet a short rub <i>tomorrow</i> then.  In the meantime, you probably have some work to do or something, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bends her legs to pull your chair closer to her, then pulls herself backwards slightly to give herself legroom while leaving your work-space clear.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're forced to stand while you begin working, but the fact that you've given up your seat to Michelle's flawless feet leaves a buzz of excitement inside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours of you working, while Michelle browses the internet, you can't suppress just how badly you want to touch Michelle's feet any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-michelle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\"  She wiggles her foot as if waving in acknowledgement, sneering at you while you stare at it, transfixed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-um, is... there any way...

Normally, you'd have warded off Jacinta's advances, but the sight, then feel of her foot has lowered your defenses...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she steals your lips for several more seconds, you allow Jacinta to push you down to your knees.

Do you want me to be uncomfortable at work?\" She pouts at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...no. It's just...being barefoot: it's just not...protocol,\" you finish rather unconvincingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I was at college, my tutors always let me sit in lectures and seminars barefoot. I just don't understand what the problem is here, James. Unless... what you're <i>really</i> saying is that you find my bare feet and toes too distracting to work near? No offence, but that's your issue rather than mine isn't it?\" She stares challengingly at you, a slight look of triumph about her. This girl clearly is used to getting her own way; you find yourself gulping while she continues to speak...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And my feet are always clean and hygienic: my daddy paid for a maid to pedicure and moisturise them every day when I was fourteen for four years. Since then, I've always taken good care of them. Now I'm back from college I'll probably get another maid hired...\" She says not without arrogance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that...I mean your feet are nice...\" You immediately regret saying this: Michelle seems to sense her prey, as she leans in closer towards you so that you can't help but inhale her sweet perfume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you - that's so sweet! So you don't mind me keeping my shoes  off then?\" She grins at you, sensing victory is near no doubt! A slight tapping sound from her toes bouncing against the office makes you yearn to have another proper look at them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealising that you are stepping into her trap, you decide to stay resolute and force yourself to try to act as a mentor would. \"No - you... need to put your... shoes back on. As your mentor...I'm asking...no, telling you, to put them on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle's smile fades as you take this tough stance. Her eyes seem to become cold and hard as she leans back, folding her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're telling me now, huh? What if I don't want to? Does that mean I'm gonna be in trouble?\" She says in a bratty tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look - it's not such a big deal,\" you speak reasonably. \"Just put your shoes back on and no one needs to be in any sort of trouble.\" You feel some confidence return to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle grazes one foot up the chair, spreading her toes; it's impossible not to notice this. Waiting for another few seconds to reply, she seems to be carefully considering what to say to you. Does she comply with your request?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Clearly, a plan has been hatched...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll put my shoes back on, mentor.\" Her words send relief flooding through you: thank goodness you've been able to establish some authority over this young, sexy woman after all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...I mean, yes. That would be good,\" You reply, a little caught off guard that she has not continued to argue with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll put them back on, if you beg me,\" she states simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of panic washes over you. \"Wh-what...? Beg...you?\" You splutter at her, barely able to believe that she could have the temerity to say that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. The way I see it, I'm doing you a favour here. You've pretty much said that you like my feet - especially with your wandering eyes. Me having to keep my feet locked inside uncomfortable shoes all day is not convenient for me, at all. I like being barefoot - no one else has ever had a problem with it before. And as it's your problem, James, I think that you should be asking me a hell of a lot more nicely. Begging me is the only way that I'm putting my shoes back on.\" She says in a smug, self-satisfied voice. This cute brunette has some nerve...yet your previous resoluteness seems to have simply eroded away after this confident speech from her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...I mean...er...Michelle,\" your words are completely incoherent once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh - good start, but it's gonna take a lot more than that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't...begging! I was asking...Michelle, this is...just so...\" Your voice trails off as Michelle lifts her legs up, her arms wrapping over her knees so the tops of her feet are in full view, her heels placed against the edge of her chair and her toes angled downwards. Being petite, she has plenty of room to accommodate them there. Seeing her gorgeous peds up this close - just a couple of yards away - makes you feel weaker than ever. Bowing down to this confident brunette would seem...natural for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beg me now. If you do it quickly I won't make you do it for too long,\" she says with a giggle even though her voice is completely firm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's no use: you feel compelled to beg the girl you're supposed to mentoring. Feeling weak and pathetic, the words spill out of you. \"Please Michelle...please, I'm begging you to k-keep your shoes on...at work. Please!\" Immediately regret swirls around your gut; begging the newbie, like a complete loser - how humiliating!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictory radiates on her face as observes you with both satisfaction and disdain. There's a look of superiority about her: you realise that begging like that has now rendered you powerless and incapable of holding any sort of seniority over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boy,\" she says patronisingly to you, making your cheeks redden with shame. \"Yes, you can put my shoes back on for me as you begged so well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what? Me...me put your shoes back on?\" You gulp nervously, once again completely ensnared and trapped by Michelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes - of course! You want my shoes back on my feet: so you should put them on for me! It's only fair, right?\" The corners of her mouth twitch while her hazel eyes dazzle, clearly enjoying this power she holds over you. \"Oh and I'm not moving - so you'll have to get down on your knees to put them on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue...being on your knees before this beautiful, sexy young woman does sound tempting. However, would it make you seem like such a laughing stock, so much so that you would struggle to give her any sort of instruction, ever again? You're supposed to be showing her the ropes, and proving, evidencing to Kim that you have done so according to the high expectations of the company...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought occurs: you could just let her stay barefoot. No one else would probably bat an eyelid. Also, working next to a barefoot Michelle while trying to mentor her could be preferable (if ridiculously distracting!) to literally bowing down to her. Either way, it's not an easy choice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you gonna get on your knees and put my shoes back on? Or have you had a change of heart about me being barefoot?\" She flutters her long eyelashes at you while flexing her sexy feet... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sure, this is humiliating beyond all reason, but Michelle's sexiness and bratty attitude just makes it so arousing! Of course, the fact that her feet look utterly detectable adds to this too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you fumble around on the ground for her shoes, you hold one just in front of a wiggling, sexy bare foot. Michelle smirks down at you, relishing the fact that you are, literally in this case, beneath her. You feel like you're in a rather perverse version of Cinderella! Just as you use your other hand to help you start sliding the first open toe heeled shoe on, a voice stops you dead in your tracks!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James, I've got a couple of spare folders you wanted from the...\" The voice trails off while you freeze in pure terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's you. What do you want?\" Michelle says dismissively, her foot halfway into the shoe you are holding up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was James I wanted, not you,\" the female voice replies coldly. You recognise the familiar tone; turning around you have your fears confirmed: it's Jenny!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour friend has a look of disbelief about her as she stares at you, shaking her head a little so her red, tousled hair bounces around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny! I, um, er...thanks for the folders!\" You blurt up at her, still startled in your position on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...James can I have a quick word with you in reception?\" She says, concern dripping through her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're about to hop up and walk off with her; then you remember that Michelle still has another shoe to be put on her foot. Completing this in front of Jenny would be way too weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure...I'll be over in a minute? Ok?\" You say in a voice that is attempting to to be reassuring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, whatever,\" Jenny replies curtly, rolling her brown eyes as she walks off quickly, not even glancing at Michelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe petite brunette calls after her. \"Bye then!\" She fixes you with a sudden stern look. \"Mr Mentor...my first shoe isn't even on properly yet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwiftly, you slide it on, your sweaty fingers briefly caressing the soft creamy top of Michelle's beautiful foot. Not wasting any more time, knowing that Jenny is obviously worried and probably pissed with you, you grab the other black shoe and begin sliding this onto the waiting, wiggling-toed foot. Allowing your thumb to press lightly against her silky smooth sole this time, you lick your lips and just manage to suppress a moan. You haven't had much foot experience in your life; just looking at and touching a beautiful foot like Michelle's is plenty of stimulation for you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you finish sliding the second shoe on, the other one inexplicably drops to the floor...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops!\" Michlle says over-dramatically, her hand placed over her mouth in apparent shock. \"How did that happen...? I guess you'll have to put it back on for me, James.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn unpleasant feeling starts to build; you decide to ignore it and  quickly get the shoe back on. With a small thud and a giggle from Michelle, the other one has now fallen, so her foot is bare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're probably just not putting them on properly. Don't worry - you can have some more practise: like, right now!\" She has a smug expression on her face, which makes you geuninely inferior and frustrated simultaneously. Are you going to play this little game until she gets bored or go over to reception where your friend Jenny is waiting for you?</span></div></div>",

That sexy, cute, attractive... brat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive at reception and say hello to Jenny.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James we need to talk, lets go somewhere private.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do so and Jenny closes the door behind you.  It was one of the training rooms no one came here at all.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you doing on your knees?  And in front of a the new girl?  Are you insane?\"  She asked wildly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... oh god Jenny it's hard to explain I don't know how I found myself like that.  She was being difficult and wouldn't put on her shoes but then she said she would put on her shoes but only if I did it for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny looked at you completely bewildered.  \"Why did you care so much about if she had her shoes on or not?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were very uncomfortable with this and tugged at your collar.  You couldn't think up of any possible reasonable excuse for doing it other than the truth.  Jenny was your ally in the office you needed to keep her on your good side.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look please don't tell anyone but I... uh... well you see... Ikindoflikefeet.\"  You say the last in a rush.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead looks at you strangely and says.  \"All right so you have a foot fetish.  It is kind of strange but that doesn't mean you should lose all sense of professionalism!  What would you have done if Denise or Candice would have seen?  You'd be a laughing stock of the entire office!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know but one thing just led to another - I don't know how to fix this!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put her hands on her hips.  \"Just compose yourself and make it clear that you need to be a professional.  If she slips off her shoes just ignore it!  You aren't the first man to see something he liked in the office.  You were lucky today but you need to make sure Michelle doesn't talk to anyone else either.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were happy Jenny wasn't going to say anything.  She really was a good friend!  You were dreading going back and asking anything more from Michelle.  The girl was a brat and would do whatever she felt like.  If she felt like humiliating you then that is what she would do.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also I got in a few taxes that need your signature which is the reason why I came to see you in the first place.  Now straighten up and go be a good mentor!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am,\" you graciously mock and head back to Michelle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you get there you notice her pretty bare feet are resting on your chair, her pretty toes wiggling at you.  You swallow thickly and try to keep your composure.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michelle I'm going to have to ask you to stay on task.  I'm going to be showing you how we do things around here and we already behind schedule.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe yawned.  \"Ya ya but first put my shoes on.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your will crumbling at her bratty remark.  You cursed your damnable fetish for getting you into this.  You had to stay strong - you just had to.  Otherwise your career, the respect of your co-workers and your future was at stake!

Of course trying to push the issue would be difficult.  She had point blank said no.  If you brought it up with Kim the new manager she would likely think you were being petty and bullying the new girl!  No one in the office would care if someone took their shoes off - they weren't that uptight about things here.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing in frustration you say.  \"Fine.  If you want to keep your shoes off you can but you are making a mistake by ignoring me.  You are the new girl here, the newbie on the bottom of the totem pole.  You'll want to be careful in the future about who you are upsetting.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain the girly laugh.  \"I didn't know my pretty little feet caused you to get sooo upset.  My, my you must have some foot issues don't you?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she spoke she waved her petite feet in front of you and you couldn't help but admire the silky sole.  No callous in sight and perfectly symmetrical.  You involuntarily lick your lips and Michelle laughs some more.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may be young but I'm not ignorant.  Why do you think so many professors allowed me to be in bare feet?  There are a lot of foot freaks among the faculty that I went to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart began to hammer in your chest.  She could read you like a book.  What if she told someone?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you think I got a perfect 4.0 GPA?  My professors were my bitch.  The few female professors and the one or two guys that weren't total losers never suspected I had my other professors doing their homework assignments instead of me.  The way I figure it the 'working world' isn't going to be any different.  People like me will get what they want and foot freaks like you get to see my perfect pedicured feet.  So how about it James are you going to be my little work bitch?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tone was so matter of fact... so <i>bratty </i>.  She didn't even want to put in a full's day work!  She didn't even think that the rules applies to her.  In one sense it made you sick to your stomach to see a girl walk in and expect everything to be handed to her on a silver platter.  On the other hand the thought was somewhat arousing and those feet... she was spreading her toes again and your eyes were drawn in like a moth to a flame.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked you a question Mr. Mentor.

You can prove to her, and yourself that you can resist her...that you can still move up the corporate ladder, not to be walked all over and undone by this petite brunette.

However at this point you realized every second you were around her was another second that you might fall to temptation.  The quickest way out of this would be to just get on with it as quick as possible and complete your mentor duties.  Once those were done you could focus on your own work.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine I'll type and you talk.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pretty grin looked quite fetching on her and you did your best to ignore it as you went through the form with her.  You quickly asked her the questions on the form, she would answer and then you would type up the response.  Things were going smoothly for the first few minutes until she decided to prop up her feet on her desk right next to the keyboard!  Her cute petite feet were right in your field of vision.  You stared at them for a few moments and then said, \"You can't put you feet on the desk!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my desk not yours.  Your desk is over there so I'll put my feet on it if I want to.  Why do they bother you?\"  She asked as she wiggled her toes seductively.  You closed your eyes and tried to take in a deep breath.  When you did you smelled the scent of strawberry foot lotion and your excitement pulsed throughout your body.  Her feet were oh so soft probably because she took such good care of them.  You wondered how soft they would feel on your lips...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo No No!  You can't give in!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith great effort you tried to ignore them while you tried to rush through the induction form.  But how could you ignore such a picture of perfection?  Her dainty feet would flex or her toes would dance in the air drawing your gaze as they moved.  You could feel yourself getting flushed and your pop tent in your pants would be noticeable to anyone if you got up from your chair.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee I never imagined a simple form would be so difficult but it has you all flustered James.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ground your teeth in frustration.  The little brat knew exactly what was wrong.  She was playing with you, toying with you.  You couldn't afford to submit to her though.  Where would it stop?  You finally were able to finish the form and it was time for the next task.  She had to create her own profile and set up user IDs and passwords.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look I can't set that up for you it is in our employee handbook.  You can't share passwords you'll have to do it yourself.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichele pouted prettily but this was one case where she seemed to be logical and went ahead and set up her password herself.  As you stood up to go back to your chair she noticed the boner in your pants.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well did my feet do that?  You must have it real bad.  Why are you making this difficult on yourself.  I know your type, you crave being used by some hot little thing like myself.  Just give in.  You'll be happier for it.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you're talking about!\"  You quickly rush the 10 feet back to your own desk.  If anyone had seen your hard-on it would have been mortifying.  Michelle quickly updated her password and was now set up with her own profile.  She looked back at you.  You had your eyes closed and were trying to add large numbers in your head quickly to distract you and hopefully make your little guy go back to regular size.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Opening your eyes you are about to stand up, then remember your pants tent!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah - there are a few others. I'll introduce you in a sec...\" You cross your legs and practically turn away from where her feet are pointing at you. You consider saying something about her dismissive remark about Jenny, but decide against it so you can help wish your erection away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cute brunette giggles. \"Sure...I guess I should put my shoes back on as we're going for a little walk...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile inside; if Michelle walked around barefoot in front of your colleagues, it would just seem odd and suspicious on your part that you're allowing her to do so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" you say after a minute or so, feeling your hard on subside enough. \"Let me show you the others...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntroducing Michelle to your coworkers proves to be relatively straight forward: your male colleagues smile, some obviously trying to impress the attractive girl with their talking up of themselves. You keep it brief, moving her along quickly so that the petite brunette has little opportunity to say something embarrassing about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of your office is open-plan, so it takes no time at all in showing her around the rest of the staff who are at their computers or phones. However, there are two women you have deliberately avoided introducing her to thus far: the two chief bitches who utterly despise you, something that is completely mutual - Denise and Candice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is that everyone?\" She asks you, her bare arms dangling a little at the sides. God she really is gorgeous, you can't help but muse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, er...there are a couple of others, but you don't need to worry about them: just another receptionist and someone else,\" you say nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show me - I want to meet everyone,\" she says, studying you carefully. This girl does seem to be damned intuitive: the curious look on her face seems to indicate that she could be wondering why you're reluctant to show her the last two women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealising that this is something you simply have to get over and done with, you begin moving towards reception: the other section, away from your friend Jenny. As you approach, the sound of girlish laughter fills your ears; your heart sinks a little as you see both Candice and Denise chattering animatedly. Denise is facing away from you, leaning over the reception counter, her smart business suit complementing her tall, slim frame, however her catty friend spots you straight away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh James! Hooks like you're trying to impress the new girl...ha! Shouldn't you go for someone who's not so out of your league?\" Candice laughs, a smirk on her face. You blush but before you can retort, her companion gets in there quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Denise,\" your blonde arch-rival says grinning, extending her hand and shaking Michelle's. \"And this is Candice. How's your first day going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, pretty well thanks.\" Michelle grins back. \"I've been rushed off my feet, you could say...\" catching your eye briefly. You gulp...the last thing you need is Michelle letting your foot thing slip...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I heard that Kim chose James here to be your mentor. Interesting choice...\" Denise stares coldly at you, a look you happily return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what I can say, Denise. Kim's obviously just a shrewd judge of character I guess!\" You give her your fakest possible smile, getting a little kick over the fact that you were definitively chosen ahead of Denise for something. Being neck-and-neck performance-wise, the two of you were generally considered to be the top workers at your level of experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to Michelle, Denise deliberately ignores your comment and smug demeanour. \"Hey, Michelle - I'm just about to grab a coffee. You wanna come with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoah, whoah,\" you jump in, immediately defensive. \"I'm mentoring Michelle...not you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey - she's a member of staff - she can make her own choices. What d'you say, sweetie?\" She smiles confidently, swishing her long blonde hair back a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic starts to build inside you: just a few minutes in Denise's company could completely turn the girl you are mentoring against you! Equally, Michelle could easily refer to her barefoot experience with you this morning... Both scenarios sound disastrous!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle stares at you, a twinkle in her hazel eyes. She flickers her eyes across at the smart, elegant frame of Denise, as if making a choice between the two of you...</span></div></div>",

It was the other way around... but nonetheless you could only watch them walk off and pray that she wasn't going to making things a 100 times worse for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head back to your desk a nervous wreck.

Denise is...cool,\" she says with a slight giggle. \"Oh and she wants to talk to you about something in Meeting Room 2.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlarm seems to spread over your face, as Michelle looks at you with a mixture of amusement and arrogance. \"What's wrong, James? I hope I haven't stuck my foot in my mouth or anything...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't believe her! If this girl has mentioned the foot thing to Denise. \"Michelle...what did you...how did you?\" You splutter, furious and worried sick that Denise may well know this hugely valuable piece of information. God, your blonde nemesis is going to absolutely torture you if Michelle has let anything slip...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd hurry up if I were you,\" she says smugly. \"She said that if you weren't there quickly, she was going to have a little chat with Kim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit - you can't risk Denise spreading this information, especially to the manager! Glaring at the petite brunette, you storm off as she waves goodbye, giggling at your departure. As you enter the meeting room, you grimace at the look on Denise's malevolent face: sheer triumph. Your arch-rival is sitting on one of the several blue, office chairs, her legs crossed with her high heel dangling slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just in time - I was about to tell Kim some very interesting information. Any idea what that might be, James?\" She smirks at you, leaning back on her chair as you stand in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperately hoping there's a chance that she's bluffing, or that Michelle told her something harmless instead, you decide to plead ignorance. \"Interesting? No - I literally have no idea what you're talking about. Is that all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing interesting? Really? So you don't think there's anything odd, strange...weird about ogling the feet of the new girl? 'Cos I find that very interesting, James!\" She stares at you challengingly, her pretty green eyes boring into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrepidation melts down your spine as you gulp at her. Michelle has seriously fucked you up here...telling Denise this is the stuff of nightmares! You already have visions of being blackmailed to high heaven, forced to watch in silence as your nemesis soaks up all the plaudits, gets promoted while your career simply halts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" you begin. \"I don't know what Michelle told you...but I wasn't...ogling - she just took her shoes off and I asked her to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-So you won't staring at her feet? Getting a hard on in your pants - none of that happened did it? The way I see it is that you're a foot-loving pervert who has zero respect for women.\" She states matter-of-factly as she interrupts you completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare nervously, lost for words.

Stare at my feet for the next five minutes and if you can avoid getting an erection than obviously the newbie was lying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mouth grew dry.  What?  You had a massive foot fetish how could you possibly succeed in this?  On the other hand you hated Denise's guts maybe you could focus on how much you hated the bitch and avoid getting an erection.  You tugged at your collar and finally decided to face this head on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right challenge accepted.  I'll keep my eyes on your feet for the next five minutes and you'll see I don't care about feet.

She kept good care of them and the toenail polish was quite fetching.  She had let one of her heels slip off while the other still dangled there drawing your eye every time she slightly bobbed her foot.  Within seconds you could feel your arousal take hold.  You had to do something!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou focused on what a bitch she was.  You focused on the anger you felt when she undermined you in a team meeting.  You focused on how the bitch got a special assignment that you had been gunning for.  You focused on all of that as you tried with all your might to keep your dick from betraying you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt still wasn't enough.  In a panic you bite down on your tongue hard and the momentary pain snaps you out of your lustful desire to kiss those perfect feet.  Oh hell no you did not want to kiss your rival's feet!  No, no no!  But oh sweet goodness they were attractive and the way they moved.  The other heel dropped and now she pushed both of her feet out and began rubbing them together.  You let out a pathetic moan as your penis shoots up and creates a pop-tent in your pants.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise covers her mouth and laughs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good lord it is true!  You're a pervert with a foot fetish.  Hahaha just wait until I tell Candice and everyone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face burned crimson.

Opening the door, you see that she is submerged in various bits of paper work. Glancing up, she gives you a brief smile. \"Oh, James. What can I do for you? Everything ok with Michelle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA horrible feeling in the pit of your stomach, you know that you're only delaying the inevitable by making any sort of chit chat. So you head straight in... \"Um, yeah about that. I've been thinking about it...and I don't think I'm...the right person to mentor Michelle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim blinks in surprise, putting down her papers and fixing you with a searching look. \"Well I wasn't expecting that. What's happened this morning exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's nothing...specific. I just...don't think I can do it...\" Your voice trails off as Kim folds her arms, a frown now spreading over her attractive features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK...I appreciate your honesty James. But you've disappointed me, If I'm being honest. I put some trust in you - gave you some responsibility, and you quit after what - a couple of hours? If what you're telling me is that you don't know how to lead or give instructions, then I can help you with that. Are you really sure that this is what you want - to let go of this responsibility and disappoint me in this way?\" She raises her eyebrows expectantly at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wish that you had any other answer than the one that is locked inside your head. \"Um, yep. It's what I want,\" you say awkwardly, shifting your eyes away from Kim's gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I see. Well, you mentioned before that you're not the right person to be Michelle's mentor. Who do you think is exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mouth opens automatically to announce Denise as this very person, yet a burning hatred fills your veins and causes you to hesitate...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James - I asked you a question.\" Kim sighs a little in exasperation, clearly irritated with the situation that you have presented her with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you suggest Denise, your arch-nemesis - the person who (along with that brat, Michelle) is responsible for limiting your promotion opportunities?

You already worked hard as a manager but to have to do even more work on top of that?  You'd be stuck at the office for more than 12 hours a day for six days a week!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we clear my little work bitch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to yell at her or slam her arrogant face into the wall.

Are we clear bitch?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise handed you a folder with some of her work.  \"Better get started my little bitch.  Oh and keep mentoring Michelle.  Make sure she doesn't have to lift a finger at her job today.  After all if it wasn't for her I wouldn't completely own you like I do now.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the folder in your hands and once again meekly reply, \"Yes ma'am.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stalk out of the meeting room and back to your desk.  You were furious.  Enraged.  How could this have happened?  This morning you were on top of the world and now you were someone's work bitch.  No not just someone's work bitch.  You were your most hated enemy's work bitch.  And it was all Michelle's fault.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get back you slam the folder that contained the additional work you had to do onto the desk and snarled at Michelle.  \"I hope your fucking  happy you bratty bitch!  You've ruined everything.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle laughed in your face.  \"Of course I'm happy you pathetic freak.  I cut a deal with Denise and in exchange she would make sure you also did all of MY work for me.  This job is going to be completely easy and carefree.  All thanks to your twisted like desire for feet.  If it wasn't so bloody convenient for me I wish they would just sterilize all of you foot freaks.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words were dripping with scorn.  The little cunt didn't give two shits about you.  You were this close to just losing it and going postal at work!  There wasn't even a trace of regret in her words.  She had played you like a fool and was now going to reap the benefits of it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel like sobbing with frustration but instead you force yourself to get started on the work Denise gave you...  </span></div></div>",

It was past 10:00 and you were the only person in the entire building.  Bitterness ate at you.  You're life was absolutely ruined by those bitches.  You finished one of the reports due tomorrow and stretched.  You still had more to do but you needed to take a break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wearily got to your feet and went to the vending machine to see what they would have.  Down the hall you saw the janitor mopping the break room.  Her name was Helena and you knew she hated your guts.  You suspected it was due to the lies that the girls had spread about you.  You did your best to ignore her but you had to cross paths to get over to the vending machine.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena glared at you and muttered something under your breath.  Normally you would have ignored her and moved on.  But right now?  Right now you are pissed at the world.  You're professional career was over. Your free time was over.  You were not in the mood to deal with anyone else's bull shit!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what.  Fuck you!  I've never done a thing to you but you are constantly glaring at me.  You stupid bint, if you had any smarts you would know you were fed a crock of bull shit.  But I guess you don't have two bits for brains otherwise you wouldn't have become a janitor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena slammed her mop back into the bucket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You little prick!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck off and get out of my way.\"  You stalked past her.  All you hear is a slight buzzing sound before the electricity coming out of her hand held Tazer rips into your back.  You let out an anguished scream as the volts enter your system.  You collapse onto the ground and with your muscles shuddering thanks to her weapon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me stupid?  Make fun of my job?  I'm going to enjoy this!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn horror you watch as your helpless body was unable to defend itself as she smashed her foot down right onto your testicles.  </span></div></div>",

You looked around, your mouth still full as Denise entered with a tray of the canteen and some food on it. Hastily you got up and let the beautiful woman sit down. \"What do you have here?\" She asked more to herself than anyone else and inspected the plastic plates you took from home. Mashed potatoes and meatballs with some salad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wrinkled her nose and pushed your plate aside. \"You should feel honored. I have never thought that I would eat together with YOU without feeling completely disgusted\". She took her plates from the tray and poured yours out on it instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put it on the ground\" she said. While watching her crossed legs and circling foot you nearly forgot swallowing. You finally did as told and placed the tray with your mashed up dinner on the ground next to her. \"Come closer. I won't bite you... promise\" she said with a smile and lifted her shoe to mention where to place your meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquashed meat and potatoes oozed out from beneath her shoe as it settled down. And crushed your food beneath. She continued eating with a smile while her feet transormed everything on the plate to a grayish, brown, nearly featureless mess. She twisted and turned,  stomped and stepped and as she was finished eating your food was cold and evenly spread over the tray and her shoe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still hungry?\" She asked. Her sole lifted from your former delicacy while her heel remained in the mess she had produced. Without needing any further instructions you went to the ground and moved your head towards her shoe. \"Go ahead, loser, lick them clean!\" You still pondered but soon enough your tongue touched the leather and a mixed flavour of leather, dirt, dust and food filled your mouth. You heard her chuckle and saw up into her cold blue eyes which were filled with satisfaction and lust for power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like 10 minutes her shoe showed no trace of crushed remains and she pulled it away from you. \"Good boy\" she said and wiped the rest off with a napkin which she threw into the mess and left. \"Don't forget to clean up\".</span></div></div>",

Your face was full of grime and you refused for yourself to use cutlery. It simply didn't seem fit. You ate for a couple of more minutes seemingly in heaven as you suddenly got interrupted by an expensive, black, heeled sandal. The muddy foot remains squirted out from underneath and stained your face and shirt even more. The dark nylons showed red painted nails, now also stained with food. \"You have some explaining to do Mr.\" You immediately knew that voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly you looked up the nylonclad seemingly endless legs and the black, tight skirt which began just above the kneecaps. The belt and a dark blazer. Fire was coming down in waves of hair at breast level and you noticed that it was unbuttoned enough to imagine everything beneath without really seeing something. Kim's green eyes seemed to bore into your soul as she stood on your tray, her arms crossed over her chest and demanding an answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I can explain\" you stutter and she raised an eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am curious to hear. But before you say anything, I have a videofeed of this room in my office.\" Your face went pale. She sat down awaiting an answer. She crossed her legs, lifting her food from the mess and splashing you even more in the process. Before you could say anything she checked her watch. \"Your break ends in 12 minutes. You should better hurry up\" with a nod of her head and a very clear movement of her dirty shoe she made unmistakably clear what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got your tongue to work again but it was different this time. This mature woman actually was your boss. Someone with real power over you and you felt this superior aura surrounding her even before you crawled at her feet and licked the remains of your food off a shoe that would probably cost a month of your salary. You heard that she is known for crushing her opponents and putting a foot on employees that could become troublesome but smelling the odor of her nylons and licking the dirt off her soles was an experience that swung between pleasure and fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough her sole and shoe were near spotless and you retreated. \"4 minutes left. Now take them off. And hurry!\" She demanded as she pressed her foot onto your chest. With shaking hands you released the buckles and took off the expansive footwear as if you geared breaking them. Her toes and ball have left a dark imprint in the cream colored insole and a puddle of edible paste was covering it. \"What are you waiting for? Time is running out...\" without thinking you eagerly slabbed your tongue over the grime, tasting salt instead of dirt and sand as flavour and the beautiful scent simply overwhelmed you. Only the presence of this authority held you from working your penis to ecstasy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you wanted to put her shoe back on the dirty toes off her nylons pushed at your lips. \"You are 2 minutes over your lunchtime and still not done!\" She sounded angry but you thought it was just her commanding voice. A sigh from her prove you right as you started to carefully work your tongue over the fabric and removing the crushed remains from her beautiful toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"10 minutes over\" she says as she gestured you to stop and put her shoe back on. \"I want you in my office at 5:35. And don't dare to be a minute too late. Clean the floor afterwards.\" Then she simply left you alone.</span></div></div>",

The evening neared and you got more and more nervous.

With her usual attitude as if she owned this place she walked straight to you. You always thought this was absolutely arrogant behavior, which it surely was, but you found it incredibly sexy now. You cocked your head to look at her but she turned your chair and placed her pump on the seat, right between your legs and close enough to your crotch that you could nearly feel the tip of her shoe. She bent over and grabbed the back of your head. With a little too much force to make it feel good she pulled you towards her and whispered something in your ear.

Consider this as a warning.\" Her Hands were resting in her lap now and the fingers of both hands where rythmically tapping each other, waiting for an answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Ms. Kim\", you said with lowered head.

Case in point, she slowly slips her delicate little feet out of her flat sandals again and sits in her chair in a way that places her feet at eye level. Almost immediately, you notice this in your peripheral vision and turn to look at her smooth tootsies. \"Michelle, haven't I already voiced my....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chillax, James. Just keep going, please.\" Michelle interrupts, wiggling her toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....alright.\" You agree and resume your teaching, sucking in all your mental fortitude to not be distracted by the prizes dangled in front of you. After finishing up with one round of duties, Michelle gives a huge yawn, stretching her legs in the process. Her bare feet are pushed towards you until her soft soles are touching your outer thigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, are you still sure there's nothing I can do to get you to do all this work for me?\" She interrupts again. With a groan, you turns your head to Michelle to voice your agitation, only to get a face full of sole. Michelle had held both her feet in the air right before you moved your head, so now your face was in contact with the soft, smooth skin of her dainty feet; in addition to smelling the lovely perfumed scent of them. \"Heehee, your breath tickles.\" She giggles, putting her feet back down on the floor. Completely aghast, you look around to make sure no one saw that; thankfully, people you know such as Denise work on the far side of the office and everyone else in your immediate area never really cared much about what you did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michelle,\" You begin to berate her. \"What did you just...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you know exactly what I just did.\" She jokingly taunts. \"Would you like more of that, my little Jamsey? If so, just do my work for me from now on.\" Despite how much your libido and fetish have impacted you today, you realize that it can't go on for too much longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michelle, please. You're in the real world now; despite how you were in college, you must learn to become fully independent. It's just the reality that we live in; now I'm not saying you have to go it alone. But just give it an actual try, and if you ever need help that doesn't mean me doing most of the work, you're welcome to come to me.\" You state to her, placing a hand on her shoulder to emphasize what you're getting at. Michelle was straight up surprised, to say the least. Thus far, she's been able to use her two gifts to manipulate anyone to do what she wanted; yet you, the biggest foot man she's ever met, is able to resist her somehow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't talk like that, Jamesy.\" She plays, lightly kicking your leg with a bare foot. 'Looks like this will be tougher than I thought.' You ponder with a sigh.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a fierce night of masturbating over the sexual struggles given by Michelle at work, you eventually fall asleep; where you ultimately have dreams of nothing but your new coworker's feet doing pleasurable things to you. Thankfully, her feet being the only thought in your mind did not happen during the beginning of the work day; somehow, you managed to actually focus on your job. Maybe even, you were doing your work faster and more efficiently than usual; this time you managed to finish the morning workload an hour earlier. \"Huh, strange. I just feel so invigorated.\" You note, after giving yourself a pat on the back. After a bit of time though, you feel like the reason for this burst of energy was rather obvious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarlier today, you new coworker, Michelle came walking into the office today, but something was different. Everywhere she went, there was a certain sound accompanying her; a sort of slapping sound would be the best way to describe it. \"Hey there, Jamesy!\" She greeted, sitting down at her desk right next to yours. To your surprise, today Michelle was dressed rather professionally; a tight pant suit, which did show off a bit of cleavage, yet still gave off an air of taking this job seriously. Of course, that imaged ended when you got to her ankles. Michelle was wearing a pair of black flip flops today which would explain the slapping sound from when she walked in earlier. Those shoes were hitting her soft soles with every step she took, producing a sound that draws anyone's attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michelle!\" You hissed in a whisper. \"That kind of footwear isn't in the dress code; you're going to get into trouble!\" \"Hmm?\" She made an inquisitive sound, turning her chair to face you. Her feet were completely exposed in the flip flops, especially since the pants she wore actually ended above her ankles, showing off a bit of her calves as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry about it; I already told Kim that you explained this was good for the dress code.\" Michelle stated, holding out her right leg to tease you a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?!\" You quietly shouted. Your cheeky coworker gave a huge smile and resumed getting logged into her station; contrary to what she told you, Michelle didn't actually tell Kim you explained the dress code was like this. In fact, Kim didn't even know Michelle was wearing flip flops right now. But you didn't know this truth, and were now full of anxiety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich brings you back to the present and would probably explain your newfound speed in completing the work, in the off chance Kim came by and wanted to reprimand for what you thought Michelle told her. At least you could gain some leeway if she saw you becoming a more diligent worker today. Michelle was still having a bit of trouble today and also noticed you had finished morning workload rather early, so she took this as an opportunity since she was getting behind. It was only her second day on the job, so no one in the higher up positions would really reprimand her for falling behind; but that's not the image she wanted to promote for herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard the creak of Michelle's chair, and then the famous slapping noise coming towards you. \"Heeeey, Jamesy....\" You heard Michelle whisper, as she rested against your shoulder. \"I'm having some trouble hereeee, would you mind helping?\" She asked, mushing her rather decent sized breasts into your back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Michelle, please.\" You stutter. \"Don't you remember what I said yesterday to you? This is a job, you must learn to do things for yourself. Everything won't be handed to you on a silver platter anymore!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Jaaaames,\" she playfully whined. \"I have started my work, but I'm still new to this. Please just help me for a little bit?\" Michelle could sense you were still adamant about not helping her. 'He just needs a little push.' She thought, picking up a pencil off her desk and dropping it on the floor. \"Oh dear, I've gotta pick that up.\" She said, turning her back to you and crouching down to pick up the utensil. From your view, it was an amazing sight how her tight pantsuit pressed against her curves, showing them off. Her ass in particular right now; but what really drew your attention was the sole show she was presenting to you. Crouched down like this, Michelle balanced on her toes, meaning her soles were in view for you to see; the soft beauties flexed from standing tip toe was too much for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you looking at my tootsies again?\" Michelle quipped after giving you a minute or so of her feet. \"You're naughty, James. Do I need to tell...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I'll help you for a bit.\" You eventually relinquished control. Going over to her station, you could see Michelle actually did do a fair amount of the work all on her own, and it was nearly devoid of errors. \"Wow, y'know Michelle, you didn't do too bad over here for what you've completed solo.\" You compliment her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know that.\" She agreed, placing herself on your lap. \"Eep!?\" She quietly squealed, feeling something hard poking her rump. \"Feels like someone is happy to see me.\" Michelle jibed, wiggling her ass a bit. \"Thinking of my feet again?\" She smirked whilst looking you in the eye. \"Let's get this done, shall we? What was I supposed to do for this part?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next half hour, you slowly taught Michelle what she needed to accomplish for each part of the work. All the while, her feet were placed on top of yours while she sat in your lap. \"Aha, I see. So for here, I'd have to deduct that so it evens out.\" She said with actual understanding of the material. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes. That's correct; looks like you're getting it now.\" You cheerily state. Michelle, still in your lap, turns her whole body around, bringing her legs in front of your face, giving you a rather brief, yet worthy shot of her scrunched toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, she brings her feet toward the floor again, but now with her face looking at you, \"Well, it's only thanks to a certain foot obsessed guy that helped me. Now get out of my seat before someone gets the wrong idea.\" With a nod, you let Michelle get off you before heading back to your station. It was almost lunch time now, so you quickly started on the afternoon workload before breaking for lunch. Unfortunately, Michelle meets up with you during lunch as well. \"Got anything for me?\" She asks you as the precious lunch box of yours is opened, displaying the lunchtime sustenance. With a sigh, you hesitate answering, before feeling a certain something touch your inner thigh. \"I said, do you have anything for me?\" Michelle politely, yet dominantly teasingly, repeated. You felt her foot rub in circles around you thigh, so you split your sandwich in half and gave her money to get a drink from the nearby vending machine. 'This is going to be a long day.' You mentally bemoaned, while also feeling your body heat rise slightly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Michelle comes back and sits down across from you at the table, rest both her feet against your inner thighs. \"Uh, Michelle, about the placement of your feet....\" You try and make her notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I'm just using you for a footrest; I'd use the seat where you're sitting instead, but since your here, you know.\" She tells you, not even looking away from her cell phone she pulled out. You groan and figure to just deal with it as the half of the sandwich you'd kept was soon gone. \"That was a pretty good meal.\" Michelle complimented, finishing her half only a minute later. \"Did you make it yourself?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you took this as an insult towards your independence and food preparing skills, but from what you know of Michelle, this is probably the closest thing to a compliment she give. \"Yeah, I made it from mixing various recipes online. Took many iterations to reach a point where it didn't taste like crap.\" You chuckle. Apparently, that was even funnier than you thought. as Michelle burst out laughing. 'Is she just messing with me, or does she have terrible taste in comedy?' You ponder with a solemn look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom afar, Denise was glaring at the two of you; for some reason, the new coworker was becoming rather chummy with the man she hated the most at the office. \"I don't get it; he's subpar at everything. Anyone else in this damned office is better than him, so what makes her hang around him so much?!\" She wonders aloud. This led to her going into a state of denial, \"Of course. She's using her young look and charm to take advantage of the guy; shrewd, yet smart.\" With a smile, Denise walks over to the two of you; her wedge heels making a distinct clunk against the linoleum floor. \"Well, well, aren't you two becoming the best of friends.\" Denise says, interrupting Michelle and startling her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle's feet got into your crotch, effective grabbing your erection with them. 'Michelle!' You mouth to her when Denise isn't looking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's it going, Michelle?\" Denise inquired, sitting down next to the young woman whose feet were on your crotch. \"This big lug treating you nicely?\" Both Denise and Michelle look at your face as you attempt to hide any reflexes and emotion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes. He's been very kind; I've gotten him to seriously help me with things I was confused by.\" Michelle explained, which in Denise's comprehension of this scenario meant, 'I've gotten this bitch to do what I say, when I say.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, that's very nice!\" Denise laughs and pat's Michelle's back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how about you, James? Has Michelle shown great promise in her work yet; I know it's rather soon to ask this, but I'm just curious.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and hastily reply, \"Yep. She's shown amazing understanding of everything; even in areas where she's struggled, she's a quick learner.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise gives that a thumbs up, thinking your reply was just a cover up to preserve your masculinity. \"Good to hear. Well, I'll let you two get back to your lunchtime conversation. Bye!\" Denise gets up and leaves with a wave. Once she leaves, Michelle has a look of disgust on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, she's so fake. And I don't mean that in a way most guys would take that statement.\" Michelle says. \"I'm going to keep an eye on her.\" The whole time, Michelle has still kept her feet around your erect dick, leading to you uttering her name. \"By the way, Jamsey, did you mean what you said to her?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of course.\" You reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's only a few number of people here that are as nice (relatively) as you whilst displaying true interest in the work. I'd say you're going to be like a silver lining to this place.\" Michelle smiles and flicks the head of your erection before removing her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lunch is almost over; ready to get back to work, Casanova? Michelle asks, standing up after slipping her flip flops back on. You're still surprised how no one has noticed her foot wear yet, but chock it up to luck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah.\" You uneasily reply, and throw away both of your garbage. Michelle wraps herself around your arm again as the two of you walk back to your stations. Up til now, you were unsure of this girl, considering her a real schemer like Denise or one of her friends. But that has changed; for sure, Michelle is still making plans of what to do with you, but now you're certain they'd end up better for you than those of your enemy coworkers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to need your help, Jamsey.\" Michelle jokes, enjoying your look of annoyance at being asked for assistance again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After lunch, Michelle actually does need your help now; not just to do more or her work though. Unfortunately, Michelle was given the task of having to print out an absurd amount of documents. She was fine with that at first, as long as you were around, until the both of you learn the large printer/copier was out of paper. \"Oh god, not this again,\" You groan, and Michelle looks at you quizzically. \"In the supply closet, the replacement printer paper is always way too high up; it'll require two people to retrieve it.\" Holding onto your arm, Michelle follows you to the dread closet of supplies. Upon opening the door, you see a terrifying sight; the box of paper is even higher than usual! \"Ok, who's the one that keeps doing that?!\" You slightly rage as Michelle tries a small, futile jump; your anger leaves you as you can see Michelle's soles when she jumps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, we're definitely going to have to work together on this.\" She agrees, doing a quick turn on her heels. \"I know of one thing we can try.....\" She has a mischievous look in her eyes, even more so than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only plan Michelle had in mind here was for her to sit on your shoulders, while you lift her up. \"Yeah, alright. That could work.\" You nod and crouch down, allowing Michelle to get on you. To your surprise though, she has slipped off her flip flops  and was wiggling her bare toes on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'd be safer to take these off now, in case they fall off and trip you up.\" She explains, after catching you viewing her dainty feet again. Michelle goes around you, and gets on your shoulders, bringing her legs over them and hanging her feet just below your chest. To steady Michelle's balance, you hold onto her lower calves just above her ankles then proceed to slowly stand up. \"Haha, I'm on top of the world!\" Michelle says once you reach full standing position. 'That sounds not as innocent coming from someone like her.' You joke in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, are you able to reach the paper?\" You ask Michelle, while she is still enjoying the elevated view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just move forward a bit.\" She directs, and you immediately comply. \"Yes, that's it!\" Michelle proclaims, squeezing your head with her thighs out of reflex. \"Almost.....!\" She sounds to be struggling, so you bend forward ever so slightly in an attempt to make the job easier on her. \"Hold on. I'm going to need change position here a bit.\" Michelle informs you, to which, you were unsure of what she meant. \"Let go of my legs for a second.\" Once you do, Michelle brings her feet up and turns them sideways, only to then stick her soles in your face. Now her position looked reminiscent of someone sitting with their legs crossed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmfff. Mffer.\" You try and say her name, but it comes out as muffled with her feet covering your nose and mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, you didn't even think she heard you, so you try again. \"Mmmf. Mich--aah!\" You had opened your mouth too much that time and ended up with her feet going in. 'Oh shit.' You thought, as your tongue comes into contact with her cute feet. Thinking you could play it off as a misunderstanding, you try not to move your tongue at all, despite how much the increasingly erect dick in your pants was enjoying this. Suddenly, you feel your tongue slide in between Michelle's toes; it's not of your doing however. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle is wiggling her toes in your mouth and grabbing your tongue with them. \"How does it feel?\" You hear her whisper in your ear. \"Do you like having these feet in your mouth; do you love tasting them?\" She asks, letting your tongue glide across her arches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget, I know what you're like. I know that you jacked off last night thinking of my feet.\" Michelle keeps toying with you in a mockingly playful tone of voice. \"You want to fuck my feet? You want to hold them down and strip them of their virginity?\" She asks you; the latter question brings you to full attention. \"That's right; despite all the dominating I've done with those babies, I've never let any guy fuck them with his dick. Do you want to be the first one; do you want these feet to belong to you and you alone?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to do anything like this, you feel Michelle shove her feet in and out of your mouth; the whole time, you wished she's just hurry up and get the damned paper. But you knew that she wouldn't let you go unless you complied with her little games. \"Yes!\" You say in desperation. \"I want to do all of that!\" You reveal your lustful thoughts. 'I knew it.' Michelle thought and blushes. She reaches up and grabs the box of paper; unfortunately, it ends up being heavier than she thought. Since she put herself in a position that you can't brace her, she begins to fall backwards to the floor, which is a 7 foot drop from that height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you realized what was happening as well, since you felt her feet forcefully slip out of your mouth. With little to no time to react, you quickly throw yourself backwards onto the floor, causing large bouts of pain to shoot up your spine and the back of your skull. The point of this was to have Michelle land on you instead of the floor where she could end up seriously injured. Feeling very dizzy (you feared you might have a mild concussion) you have the sensation of Michelle landing on you. \"Oof.\" Is all she says, landing on your softer torso. \"Jamsey? Hey James!\" She cries to you, once she realizes what she landed on. Michelle puts the paper box on the floor next to you and shifts her position on top of you so that her face can look directly into yours. Now, you were still conscious this whole time, though it admittedly felt like a dream as Michelle was sitting on top of you, with her legs bent backwards so that her dainty feet can fondle the bulge in your pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat fondling is just what you needed to bring you back to full reality, \"Ugh, Michelle. Are you hurt?\" You uneasily inquire. \"What?\" Michelle is taken aback by your immediate concern being of her own safety instead of your own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm fine. But worry about yourself too; here, let me check you.\" Michelle gets of so that you can sit up, while she looks at the back of your head. \"Oh, thank god. You only got a bump back here. Are you feeling nauseous or dizzy still?\" You shake your head no. \"Ok, then you're going to be fine.\" She tells you. \"Jamsey, why'd you do that? You could've gotten yourself hurt?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, you reply, \"I'd rather myself be the one hurt than let you take the pain.\" Michelle's eyes go wide; she doesn't know what to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You....\" She's never met a guy like you her whole life; a guy who despite being obsessed with her feet, actually cares about her. A guy who's protecting her while still helping her develop as a person. \"I....I think you deserve a reward, and I get the feeling you know what it is.\" Michelle says to you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Unzip please.\" Michelle commands you, to which you comply right away. You unzip your pants, then pull them and your boxers down enough, leaving just your erection exposed. \"Oh my.\" She remarks, noting it's slightly bigger than she expected. Michelle slowly brings her feet towards your dick, wiggling her toes sensually as if to torment you. The whole time, she is smiling while you feel a sense of accomplishment here; the new, adorable coworker is going to give a footjob to you with those sexy feet of hers. The process is slow, though you're not quite sure why; it might either be Michelle just toying with you still, or she was very hesitant about all of this. Turns out the latter would happen to be the case here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instant Michelle touches the head of your penis with one toe, she immediately retracts them. \"I-I'm sorry, I've never done something like this before.\" She says, scrunching her toes. \"I'm nervous, and even a little scared.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'God damn, she is too cute!' You internally shout, looking at her shivering, tiny feet. \"M-Michelle.\" You call to get her to look at you. \"I understand; all of this is new to you, but you can do it. Remember how good you're getting at the work here? If that didn't stop you from overcoming hardships, then neither will this.\" Your nervous companion seems to take a moment to think over what you've just said to her, while she slowly (maybe even subconsciously) inches her feet towards you with full conviction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you feel her soft soles wrap around your rod, you spasm slightly from the sensations. This sight must've given Michelle a minor confidence boost, since she laughs with a smile. \"Ok, so I'm going off what I've seen online.\" She informs you, slowly moving her soles up and down. When her feet reach the the head of your erection, she rushes them back down; the quick movement made your hips buck forward. \"That seems to work....Let's try some more of it.\" Michelle tells herself out loud. She repeats the same up and down motion, pressing her feet tighter around your erection with each passing stroke. By now, your dick was flooding with precum, lubricating Michelle's soles, creating a strange combination of softness and slickness. \"Oh, that's nice. Thanks for making my feet wet.\" She tells you, shoving her feet down, so that her toes can rub your groin a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that we're doing this, I have to say it's kinda fun.\" Michelle says, while her wet soles slide up your shaft; but you think it's still too basic, wishing she would do more. Surprisingly, she does; Michelle separates her feet, one goes up and the other goes down. Her right foot gets to the head of your shaft and and she places her toes on it. \"So big.\" She comments, wiggle her dainty toes. Then she scrunches them so that she is effectively grabbing your dick with her wet toes. Unfortunately, she lets go; but that's because she's doing it again and again. Her toes scrunch so that they can grab onto you, but she also makes sure that your dick is placed between the big and second toes. Now, she can slide you dick through them while she still scrunches her toes over and over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, her left foot is getting into action, sliding her arch down your length until she reaches your testicles. At first she just pokes and prods them, bur changes it up by lightly pressing her foot into your balls and moving it up and down. \"You like having a foot in your ball sack too?\" She jeers. \"So perverted.\" This goes on a bit longer, before she gets back to running her soles up and down your shaft. Slowly, you feel a pressure building within you, and Michelle can clearly feel it too. \"Go ahead, do it!\" She urges you, placing her feet right above your dick as you finally cum; spraying her soles with your sticky, white fluid. \"Haha, that was amazing. Great job, Jamesy.\" She tells you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you were not done yet, \"Michelle.\" You say to her. \"That felt amazing, and I thank you for doing it, but there's one last thing I want to do. Before, you asked me if I wanted to take your feet's virginity; please let me do so. Let me fuck them like a wild beast in heat, I beg of you.\" You get down on the ground and lower your head to the goddess that just gave you her first footjob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle is speechless at first, but eventually comes around to it. \"Ok, yeah, I did say that. Fiiiiiine, but on one condition.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Name it, anything!\" You ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My feet will belong to you and you alone, and in return, you are all mine.\" She practically demands. You were unsure of this, you thought she had changed to become a better person, and now she's trying to take total control of you?! No wait, you knew this was different. If she had said this when you first met her, you'd have to worry; but now, there's something else. Hints of lust and love in her demand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got yourself a deal!\" You shout. Michelle smiles and sighs, before turning onto her stomach, so that her feet are soles up, facing you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there they were, those innocent, defenseless, cute feet that were just begging to be fucked ever since you first met them. You waster no time in holding her feet together, so that her arches created an opening akin to an artificial vagina for your dick. \"Ah yes!\" You groan, sliding your penis in between the wrinkled arches. \"I've taken these feet's virginity!\" Michelle just chuckles at the stupid, nonsensical lust talk you were speaking. She feels you thrust back and forth as you hold her feet around your erection. \"Ah, this is better than I ever imagined....\" You compliment, beginning to thrust your penis downwards past her soles so that you can reach her toes. Your mushroom tip gets a bit of resistance when it hits the end of her soles and gets under her toes, but that was amazing to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Jamesy.\" Michelle moans, as you continue to conquer her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Michelle, but these feet needed to be taught a lesson.\" You inform her, placing her feet on the ground soles up, so that you can rub your erection along them toward her well kept heels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoans of affirmation escape your mouth as the sexy beauties you are fucking just keep feeling better and better; it's almost enough to make you just want to do this for the rest of your life. But all good things must come to an end, especially in this office. So for a grand finale, you cup Michelle's soles around your rod and make 3 final huge thrusts. The first one moves Michelle's feet back despite her using her muscles to try and hold them in place. The second coats them with another layer of precum. And the third is the one where you unleash the most gigantic load your penis has ever concocted, all over the soft soles of the tiny feet you just dominated. \"Ah, oh god.\" You say, out of breath, falling backwards. Michelle feels the large amounts of semen on her feet and rubs it around, as if to try and coat every inch of her feet with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was amazing, Jamesy. Who would've known you'd be such an animal, especially with my poor feet.\" She jokes, slipping her flip flops back onto her cum covered tootsies. You nod and quickly clean yourself up, including putting your pants and undergarments back on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, Michelle leads you out of the closet, letting your carry the heavy box of paper for her. From behind, you can see her cum covered soles as the flip flops slap them with every step. But, with each step taken, the flip flops managed to fling some of your semen off her feet and onto the floor; yet Michelle just keeps walking nonchalantly. 'That cheeky girl.' You think, feeling warm down below again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After your escapade in the supply closet with the most beautiful feet you've ever seen, both you and Michelle have gone back to work, acting like nothing unconventional has happened today. Which honestly might be one of the smartest things to do at this time, seeing as how the surveillance of you two has increased. Not that Helena has increased security or anything; Denise has been hovering around your side of the office since lunch whenever she could make an excuse to do so. And when it's not her, Candice comes; doing whatever she feels would make Denise stay her friend. \"Wow, that's amazing. I've got to try some of that stuff next time.\" Candice obliviously says loudly. Currently, she was trying to buddy up with Michelle, who was talking about some of her favorite beauty products to keep skin looking healthy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, the aloe version's better for tropical climates; in this cooler air, it will mess up with your skin retaining moisture.\" Michelle seemed to be getting into the office talk, though you could tell she was just putting on a facade. By now, you've noticed that whenever Michelle is getting annoyed with someone, she will curl her toes for a period of time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sorry, Michelle,' You apologize in your mind. 'I can't help you with this. Candice is another person I must stay away from at all costs.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, in your peripheral vision, you are somewhat drawn to the two ladies conversing just to your right. Michelle was still wearing flip flops with her feet exposed (Candice asked about them, and Michelle came up with she spilled coffee on her actual shoes), and Candice was wearing heeled mules of sorts that only show off her ankles and heels. While you knew her feet were leagues below Michelle's, the fetishist within you could appreciate a well kept pair when you see one. It was here when you realized how much office life has changed for you now in such a short time; you have another coworker, who really likes you, and you've fucked her feet. It's changed your mental state entirely; feet were becoming more and more prevalent now, well at least Michelle's are. The memory of being the first one to fuck her soft, delicate, petite feet would serve as masturbation fuel for years to come. Although, you feared that it might have a negative impact, if all that would be on your mind is doing more debauched things with your new coworker's lower appendages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Candice realizes you're not really listening to her and Michelle, she gets in close. \"OK, enough small talk. How'd you manage to manipulate him?\" She asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle looks over at you for a split second, \"You mean James?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Denise has been trying to knock that guy down for years; how'd you make him your bitch in less than a day. I'd love to know your secret.\" Michelle hates how Candice is belittling you, but can't let Candice know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I wouldn't call him my bitch, actually. You see, he's been helping me a ton; at first he did everything for me, but eventually got me to work for myself. He believed in me and I just couldn't let him down....\" Michelle explained, with a small smile. Her feet flexed their toes, and you watched while she did so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ah, I get it now. She got him to be affectionate to her, so that he'd be more open to doing what she wants. It's brilliant!' Candice figured this was the tactic Michelle used on her friend's enemy. \"I see. Thanks Michelle!\" Candice said and walked back to her desk, her mules making a clopping sound on the carpeted floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was finally gone and you felt Denise would not be around, Michelle practically jumped out of her seat and ran right into your arms. Out of pure instinct, you wrapped them around her, holding this small woman in a hug. \"That was so scary!\" She cried, and you could feel her pain. People like Denise and Candice are bad enough for someone who's worked with them for years, but someone who literally just started? It's got to be intimidating beyond belief, even for someone who's used to being similar to that in the past like Michelle. Your teary eyed coworker plopped her perfect behind on your lap again, coming into contact with your now erect penis again. \"Those people are worse than I originally thought.\" Michelle worried, lifting her feet into the air, then kicking them up and down. \"I don't want anything to happen to me, or you! But I also don't want to have to watch my back every second!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, your penis was at full attention, and with Michelle on your lap, you could swear, even through both your clothes and Michelle's, it pushed slightly into her pussy. \"Don't worry, Michelle. While I'm here, I'll make sure they don't do anything to ruin your chances at this office. I promise you.\" You tell Michelle, hoping to help calm her down. She looks over her shoulder at you at smiles, even through her tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as long as you promise.....\" She says. \"Oh, and by the way, why do I feel your rod pushing into me?\" She cheekily says, messing with you right away again. 'Here we go again.' You think with a smirk, not being annoyed by her teasing this time, Just then, Michelle leans back and whispers to you, \"I think you've earned a night with my feet. Wanna meet me after work?\" Without any hesitation, you say yes, locking in your plans for the evening. \"Excellent,\" Michelle tells you. She  wiggles her lower body, moving around your erection and then gets back to work. \"Remember, you're all mine.\" She informs you with a friendly smile; making you feel unsure for a split second if she's really any different from Denise.</span></div></div>",

She had her bare feet propped right on the desk surface, mere inches away from your face. \"Come oooon, Jamesy.\" She whines. \"When are you going to be done?\" Michelle pushes her legs forward so that her soles poke your arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost done, Michelle. Just give me a couple more minutes.\" You tell her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another groan, Michelle pulls out her phone from sheer boredom. Pulling open the camera apps, she aims it at her feet; the screen showed her wiggling tootsies right in front of your face. \"Hey Jamesy, look over here for a sec.\" She demands you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it this-\" You get a face full of sole and Michelle takes a picture; the flash and shutter sound were off though, so you had no idea she captured that moment. \"Ok, Michelle.\" You begin to say, your voice muffled from having her feet in your face. \"I think we should chill with the feet just a tad while we are at work. Don't you agree?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Jenny happened to come by, a mere half minute after you finished relishing in Michelle's soles. \"What's up, James?\" She asks, seeing you at your desk with Michelle's feet on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey, Jenny. Just finishing some last second documents while chatting with Michelle here.\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michelle, oh, you're the new girl. How's it hanging?\" Jenny cheerfully inquires her younger colleague. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh here we go.' Michelle groans in her mind. \"Fine, I guess. Rather bored waiting for Jamesy here to finish his work.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny chuckles and turns back to you. \"Well, once you're done, James, wanna go out for some coffee? The Starbucks near my apartment just started this delicious vanilla and peach blend that I know you will enjoy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle interrupts before you can speak. \"Actually, he and I already made plans for tonight. Sorry, Jennifer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, maybe some other time then.\" Jenny says, not taking anything the wrong way, then leaves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to worry about Jenny. She's a good friend of mine.\" You inform Michelle whose eyes watched Jenny walk away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just don't want her to have you; you're mine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed at the rather immature statement that was, but found yourself not caring as much when Michelle places her feet into your lap and begins massaging your groin. \"Are you done yeeeet?\" She moans, rubbing her toes around the head of your penis through your trousers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, ok yes. I'm done now.\" You hastily reply, before Michelle's minor foreplay ends up with a mess in your pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, let's get out of here!\" Michelle lustfully moans, slipping her feet back into her flip flops.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Without saying a word, Michelle follows behind you, walking to your car. The sound of her flip flops slapping her soles kept making your mind go back to what happened in the supply closet. Stuck in an enclosed area with a female coworker and the objects of your desire, the both of your reaching the edge of sexual tension...'Or, I was at least.' You doubt again. Despite countless signals indicating Michelle having an attraction of some sort to you, the shadow of doubt took control of your feelings. 'Obviously, she enjoyed what we did to an extent.' That much was a certainty for you. 'But how much? Did Michelle receive some sexual pleasure?' Consequently, the two of you had reached your car. 'Or did Michelle just have fun, like it was a game?' She wondered why you stopped in front of the car door; jokingly, she asked if maybe you had lost your keys. No response came from you, since your attention had been withdrawn to settle this internal conflict. 'I guess there's the possibility she let me commit such an act as a means of condescension. Plenty of other people I work with seem to have a superiority complex over me.' An image of Denise flashed in your mind, eliciting a shudder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, it's debatable that shudder came about thanks to Michelle. While her boy toy was standing still and silent, mulling over his internal dialogue, she turned herself around to stand back to back. With a smirk, she took her right foot and slowly wiggled it out of the flip flop. Thanks to her fit legs, she was easily able to maintain balance while bending her right leg back, allowing for her foot to come into contact with your junk again. \"C'mon Jamesy,\" She said, wiggling her toes against the base of your shaft. \"You know I don't want to be here all night.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then your body shuddered, bringing you back to reality. \"Huh, oh hey!\" You shout, becoming aware of Michelle's actions.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be like that.\" She berates you. \"I'm not the guy who stood still doing nothing.\" Her foot gets more aggressive, proceeding to rub the outline of your bulge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, ok, sorry. Let's get in.\" You request, to which Michelle happily obliges. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting in the passenger seat, Michelle took it upon herself to place her small feet right on the dashboard, much to your chagrin. Thankfully your fear of death has no trouble overriding your fetishes, as your eyes remained glued to the road the entire time. During this drive, you took it upon yourself to converse with your guest. Apparently, she had ridden the bus to work today, which would explain her lack of hesitation in riding to your home. Finally parking the car in the driveway, Michelle was the first to open her door. \"Ooo, I can't wait to spend the night here. It's going to be so fun!\" She cheered. With a smile, you begin to go over the events leading to this situation; although, you came to a conclusion that this didn't make total sense. Michelle rode the bus today; she planned to go home with you, without actually informing you prior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So. she's really planning things through.' You thought. 'Wait, did she say spend the night?!' Michelle walked to the front door, but there was a noticeable difference. The slapping sound was gone, replaced with a slight clicking against the concrete walk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning your head, Michelle is no longer wearing flip flops; adorning her petite feet was now a pair of black, strapped heels she must've had in her purse. \"Come on, Jamesy.\" She ordered, stretching a leg to show off her toes peeking out of the heel. \"I want to go inside for a good time.\" With a shaky nod, you slowly walk past Michelle, and open the front door.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Michelle ran inside your house once the front door was opened; \"Wait,\" You mutter, sighing afterwards. \"What did you want to here anyway?\" She did not respond; just ran past all the room entrances, but stopping at the one to the kitchen. Shocked by your colleagues attitude in your home, all you could do is yell, \"Yeah, just make yourself comfortable, I guess.\" Michelle smirks and traverses the kitchen doorway. 'What have you gotten yourself into James?!' You conscience is berating you.  'How could you let her force herself upon you today; you must at least clear the air with Jenny tomorrow.' Figuring this side of your mind was correct, all that could be done was to spend the night with Michelle. 'Still, what did she mean by spending the night? Does that mean....\" Your pants have a noticeable tent forming. Shaking it off, you slip off your coat and outer shirt, followed by placing your keys on the corresponding wall hook. This whole time, Michelle was doing whatever in the kitchen, out of your sight. From your position down the hall, it was obvious the overhead kitchen light was not on; but there was a source illuminating that portion of the hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, what are you getting up to in there?\" You authoritatively ask, wondering if she's getting into mischief again. Upon reaching the kitchen entryway, mischief wouldn't be the right word to use here. Your fridge door was wide open, somewhat lighting up the rest of the room. And in front of it, was the sneaky Michelle in heels, downing a bottle of your wine. \"Are you kidding me?!\" You shout; especially since that wine wasn't exactly cheap. Although, your anger was pushed aside at seeing Michelle's back facing you. The light easily displayed her curves and youthful rump, going down her pant covered legs, ending with her sexy feet poking out at the bottom. It was now that she decided to reacknowledge her location and your presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jamesy!\" She proclaimed, unsteadily walking over to you. In her hand was the bottle of wine, but only a quarter remained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She drank that much!?\" You hissed once your inebriated companion lost her balance and rested against your chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya know, this wine ain't that bad. Though I would've preferred something with more lime in it.\" She informed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'OK, come with me.\" You request, helping your short colleague over to one of the kitchen chairs. \"After drinking so much, you're going to hurt yourself wearing those shoes.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMichelle placed her cute butt down, swinging her legs back and forth. \"This izz a very noice kitchen...\" She commented, the inebriation now affecting her speech. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes. Now hold still so I can get these off of you.\" You order trying to hold her legs still. With some trouble, no thanks to Michelle, you manage to slide her silky feet out of their heels. \"There, now you will be safer-\" Michelle immediately cut you off by lifting her feet and placing both of them in your mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah?!\" You inquisitively groan, looking up at Michelle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kn-ow what you like Jamesy. Now, en-enjoy a drink with that delectable meal.\" She tilts the wine bottle down, so that the red liquid coats her feet. Since she had them angled downward, the wine slides off her smooth skin and into your mouth. It all happens so quickly, that you were unable to stop this from happening. Or, perhaps you didn't want it to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tastes good, don't it?\" She asks you, wiggling her toes in your mouth, grabbing your tongue with them. The wine keeps pouring until the undrunk quarter is gone from the bottle. The intoxicating aspects of the wine, with the intoxicating knowledge of Michelle's soft, sweet smelling feet in your mouth quickly leads to your libido raging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. What a rush!\" You shout, still maintaining enough consciousness since you could hold your alcohol well (and you had a lot less compared to Michelle). When she was finally satisfied with this, Michelle withdrew her feet and placed the empty bottle on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutstretching her arms, and pouting her lips, she asks with a slur, \"Carry me to the couch, Jamesy. I'm very fucked up right now.\" Slightly drunk, you nod and lift up the petite woman, carrying her in your arms bridal style. She continued to swing her feet up and down, humming an unrecognizable tune in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the living room, you rest her body down on the smooth, leather couch; Michelle twists her body as if savoring the texture of the upholstery. \"Ya got any good movies, Jamesy?\" She inquires, although normally Michelle isn't a real fan of films. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few.\" You reply and look for an action/romance movie from your collection. Slipping the disc into the player, you sit down on the floor in front of the couch (since Michelle's posture made it clear she adamantly wanted the furniture for herself right now.) The movie played, and both of you enjoyed it in your drunken stupor. At some point during a scene between the protagonist and his nemesis, Michelle moves herself upright and places her legs on either side of your shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't feel or even notice this happening at first. It was only when her crotch was in contact with the back of your head did your inebriated self realize your companion was getting really close. \"Open up your pants, Jamesy.\" She demands, to which you quickly comply. With your boxers exposed, Michelle places her feet right on your groin. \"Ah, much better. I wanted a footrest, y'see.\" She drunkenly explains; scrunching her feet and soles against your underwear covered erection. Nodding, you turn back to watching the movie, leaving Michelle's feet alone for now.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Michelle's tiny toes squirmed any time she reacted to the movie; at one point, a sword wielding assassin was kicked away from a potentially fatal piece of debris. Seeing him take such a blow made Michelle flinch, causing her feet to grab your erection as if seeking security. Another rather action packed climax had Michelle verbally rooting for the good characters, pumping her fists in the air to cheer them on. Her appendages on you joined in on this cheering and wrapped their soles around your shaft. \"Uh, Michelle...\" You attempt to bring the placement of her feet to her attention. Yet alas, being way too drunk and becoming engrossed in an emotion jarring movie took the entirety of her attention span. With nothing else to say, your eyes went back to the television, deciding to just enjoy the subconscious movements of your colleague's dainty tootsies. The film continued on with not much further action from Michelle, until the very ending scene where the protagonist was in trouble. Thankfully his scantily clad love interest came in at the last second to save his life, kicking the villain into submission in a pair of high leather boots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woohoo! That's where it's at!\" Michelle applauded over your shoulder, squeezing your face with her strong thighs. Groaning, the movie eventually came to a close with a wild explosion. She jumped in her seat at this moment, making her feet around your shaft raise up, then thrust back down, thus exposing your erect penis already leaking precum. Just now noticing your wet dick touching her soles, Michelle gained the largest smug grin you have ever seen on a person. \"Is that what you were doing this whole time?\" She taunted. Clearing your throat, you want to pass this off as a misunderstanding, but Michelle doesn't care. \"You should know the living room is not the appropriate area for such activities. Maybe something like the bedroom is better suited for that.\" This was an obvious invitation if not anything else; she didn't even need to say another word as you scooped Michelle in your arms and carried the lusty young lady to your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wheee!\" She cried, jumping right onto the covers, whilst you undressed somewhat. Deciding to forgo complete nudity, at the very least you had removed your trousers and boxers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy, here we go.\" You quietly encourage yourself, having not much experience. Turning to your bedside companion, it is surprising to see that Michelle has removed her clothes as well, sans her undergarments. Holding her feet in the air, she sways them back and forth in an almost mock hypnotic fashion. \"Come closer....\" She cooed. \"Y'know you want to....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObliging her teasing foreplay, you answer back, \"Yes, my mistress.\" Smiling the whole time. Walking towards her with your penis at full attention, Michelle extends her legs, placing each of her feet on your upper thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tonight has actually been wonderful so far,\" She comments. \"The wine.\" She brushes her left foot against the head of your penis. \"You carrying me around.\" Then her right foot does the same. \"And even a movie, too.\" She glides the smooth tops of her feet underneath your ballsack. \"You really know how to treat a lady, especially this one.\" Michelle happily segregates herself with utmost egotism from other women. \"Don't ever stop doing this for me, okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why-y, yes. Of course, m'lady.\" You dizzily reply; the alcohol in your system from earlier now serving an actual use. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good answer, Jamesy.\" She exclaims, slamming her soft soles right around your shaft. Moaning loudly, your knees buckle; this almost caused you to completely collapse. Thus begins the awaited talent of this beautiful coworker; she passionately strokes your manhood back and forth, your precum and now existent sweat serving as plentiful lubrication. \"Haha, it's just like the supply room!\" She reminds you, twisting your rod in different directions to gauge your reactions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, gah!\" You utter from her mischievous toes manipulating your glans and rubbing your shaft. This is practically heaven once more, as your own hips commence thrusting so that your partner doesn't have to do all of the work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt helps that Michelle keeps on speaking sexy statements with every observation of your spasming body. \"Oh, Jamesy like that. He enjoys being touched by feet in this direction, too?\" She then grabs your cock head with the toes of her right foot and twists it around, so that you are pleasured by her toes and the wrinkles of her soles. Placing her left foot underneath your shaft, Michelle opens up and sticks it between her wet big and second toes. Stroking it up and down, you were left flabbergasted from the amazing technique of this lady. In record time, you manage to last longer than the supply room before releasing a stream of white, warm fluid. Michelle makes sure to position her soles in front of the stream to catch most of it on her feet. Trace amounts do end up on her belly and thigh, so she just uses her finger to scoop them up then licks it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the bed. Now.....please.\" She orders authoritatively at first, then relents with a bit of cute shyness and purity with her saying the word please. Complying, Michelle moves to the side and allows you to lay on your back. She stands up on the mattress right near your waist, \"How's the view down there?\" She giggles. Looking at Michelle, you were happy to see her bra and panty clad body standing proud and dominant. Gazing at her underwear, her minor camel toe is clearly moist; proof she really is turned on by messing with you. Not that it was of any concern, as she stepped on your still erect dick. \"Remember Jamesy, this night is to remain between us.\" Michelle says and rubs her soaked foot back and forth. \"If word of this gets out, we are done for; well, mostly you, but then I'd be short one Jamesy.\" Weirdly enough, Michelle is talking actual sense, a huge dissonance to her drunken ramblings earlier. Was she pretending to be extremely intoxicated this whole time? Before you could dwell on this any further, Michelle raises her foot then lightly slams it back down on your penis. \"Such a cute thing, you are.\" She notes, though whether this meant you or your little you went over your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving had enough of standing, Michelle gets down and rests her body on top of yours. \"God, you are warm!\" She exclaims, bending her legs to grab your dick with her feet once more. Twisting and turning it around like some sort of examination, Michelle can not hold back her own libido and moves her panties aside so that she can access her own pussy. Stroking the outer lips with her fingers, Michelle begins moaning while servicing your still rock hard length with her tootsies. Since she was laying on you, the lusty lass was able to start shaking her body back and forth against your broad chest; although, this made her legs bend a lot more, leading to your penis coming very close to her vagina. \"Aha! Show me more of your pleasure face, Jamesy!\" Michelle commands, while you're blushing facial expression changes with every movement. Her motion becomes more fierce, with both rubbing her soles against your penis and moving her whole body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now the breaking point, as you announced, \"I'm cumming, Michelle!\" She smiles, but since you both were covered in a lot of sweat, she loses her posture and bends her legs enough that your dick slips inside her wet pussy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait.....\" She says, while the sudden feeling of your prick being engulfed in complete warmth and wetness makes you release a tremendous load inside Michelle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just.....\" She says shakily, while you now give in to carnal desires. You both were now having sex, and as a man, there was much for you to do. Grabbing her slim waist, you thrust up and down, grinding your erect dick against the wet interior of her genitalia. \"Oh god! Yes!\" She shrieks, rubbing your balls with her cum covered soles as if to stimulate them. The two of you continued like this for a good ten minutes; the whole time your hips pounding faster and faster to please this cheeky woman atop your torso. Clearly it was enough for her as your manage to make her moans become louder with every thrust. Her toes against your gonads providing that last bit of stimulation, you finally give one last, big thrust into her pussy. Towards the end of this ramming, you cum deep inside her; the huge warm feeling making Michelle reach climax and release fluids of her own. \"Gah!\" Michelle moans, then collapses, completely exhausted on top of you. Breathing heavily, you smile and move around a bit. Out of energy as well, you can't help but fall asleep with Michelle on you; your semi-hard dick still in her cream pied pussy and her feet touching your groin.</span></div></div>",

You heard footsteps and your heart stuttered in your chest.  Oh no someone was nearby!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spot Jacinta come up and say, \"Sorry to interrupt but I need to run something by James on one of the confidential accounts.  Do you mind hanging out here for a few minutes Michele?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young brunette shrugged.  \"Take your time I'll take a break.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were thankful for the interruption but extremely nervous.  Had Jacinta overheard everything?  Did she realize you had a foot fetish?  These thoughts whirled through your head as she pulled you into one of the 'break-out' rooms.  Those rooms were designed just to discuss things and brainstorm for ideas.  She closed the door and said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James you are going to get in trouble if you do anything with the newbie!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?  I don't know what you mean!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles kindly at you and shakes her finger.  \"James I heard everything.  And I saw you drooling at her feet!  You are her mentor you can't let her wrap you around her little finger.\"  She laughs a little.  \"Or maybe I should say you can't let her wrap you around her little toe!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn this wasn't good.  This wasn't good at all.  Now two of the women in the office know about your secret!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't look worried.  I can help you.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its obvious you like feet.  So why don't you indulge your fantasies with my feet?  I'll let you do whatever you want with them and in exchange we'll go steady.  You know I like you and I think after I reveal my feet you'll love me too.  I'll even give you a 'foot job' right now so you won't be tempted by the newbie's feet.  What do you say James?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were stunned by this turn of events.  You didn't really have any sexual feelings for Jacinta but maybe you should change your mind?  If she was clearly willing to let you indulge in your fetish it would probably make you less obsessed with the new girl's feet!  On the other hand you weren't exactly thrilled to be forced into a relationship.  And getting a foot job at the office?  That might be risky.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?  </span></div></div>",

Truly a sight you wanted to see but your eyes were still locked on her confident eyes for some unknown reason. \"Well~ Our places to begin with, but that's beyond obvious. Other offices like this one would be nice to sneak in while at work, just like now\" she says as she extends her arms as if trying to sell you the building \"Or maybe places a little more risky?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp at her suggestion. More risky? doing such things are already bound to attract unwanted sights if caught!... yet... You realize that, maybe you'd like the idea of risk...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say under my desk, but that one's as obvious as it gets as well, you'll end up there anyway!\" She says giggling \"Maybe at the parking lot...\" She pauses and rises and eyebrow to you in a smug manner \"Doesn't have to be <b>inside</b> the car, of course. Oh! Or the lunch room for example! Can you imagine? Feeling my soft and smelly feet rub you under the table while nobody suspects a thing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice you started to tremble, but not because of fear or intimidation, but rather because of excitement; was this truly Jacinta? All the time while working here you noticed she would always steal glances at you but other than that she would always remain rather professional, even if she always found herself helping you out whenever you needed it in an attempt to make you notice her. But now? Now she knew your secret and here she was, right in front of you, moving seductively, making suggestions that you had only dreamed of! The dominant and confident look in her eye... The soft way in which she moved... The seductive tone in her words. This was a completely different woman, yet one and the same as Jacinta. This realizations suddenly makes you ask yourself why you never considered to actually date her before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaah~ so many possibilities!\" She mentions as she joyfully shakes her legs \"The cinema, the store, a restaurant... Oh I simply can't wait to see how many places there are where you'd have my feet all over you!\" Truly she seems just as excited as you are, except she's not trying to hide it in the slightest, which makes you to be actually really happy and flattered. The previous nervousness you felt when Jacinta locked the door behind you after entering the room had been replaced with excitement, arousal, and a surprisingly overwhelming sense of... peace? You found yourself to be at ease! For the first time in many months you actually managed to forget about everything that worried you, you didn't feel guilt or any sort of negativity, and it was all thanks to Jacinta who seemed to genuinely want the best for you. And you'd be damned if you didn't want to give her the best in return now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Jaci, you got me, I'm all yours\" You finally respond in a more confident manner than you expected.<br>\r\nHer eyes and smile widen at your response \"Really?\" She asks automatically, but before she allowed you to return even a nod she pushed you to the very back of the chair you were on and swiftly kicked her shoes off, revealing her rather big yet feminine and beautiful pantyhose covered feet and dangling them mere inches from your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's it gonna be, <i>lover boy</i>?\" She asks, shivering in arousal at the sound of her own question \"Do you want to run your tongue and lips all over my feet to get a <i><b>real</b></i> good taste of them?\" She mentions as she wriggles her nylon encased toes in front of your face to let their releasing aroma to bless your nostrils \"Or would you rather have my feet going to town on your eager friend over here first?\" She finishes as she uses the very top of her toes of one foot to circle the peak of the tent your now raging erection caused on your pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere she was, your new girlfriend, offering you her feet to satiate your desires. By this point you have completely forgotten about Michelle, for the effect Jacinta now had on you was much stronger. And so, looking at this beautiful and eager woman, her happily moving nyloned feet, and her now soaking wet crotch area, you decide...</span></div></div>",

But she had just taken her shoes off! It would be a little bit of a waste to just let that fresh pair of warm feet to cold off without a proper tasting first!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow me to get a sample of that oh so fine dish first, madame\" You say playfully as you grab one of her ankles to bring it to your mouth's reach, to which she responds giggling with \"Bon appetit, monsieur\" playing along. Right as you grab her ankle you notice immediately that the fabric of her nylons is of a very high quality, for not only did it make her already pretty looking feet a lot sexier, but it also felt incredibly smooth to your touch almost as if it merged with her very skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself very eager and impatient to cover that precious foot with your tongue as fast as possible, but you manage to stay in control knowing that there will be many more foot worship sessions with her in the future, so you take your time and consider how to approach this unforgettable first contact... So much so that you notice her foot started to move on its own after a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on darling, don't be shy!\" You hear her say as she waves her foot expectantly in front of your eyes \"I promise you will love it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Darling.</i> That word resonating in your head as it helps you decide how to first show her your appreciation. What better way to start with your new girlfriend than a kiss? And so you place your lips tightly on the top of her foot and give it a well deserved and hearable kiss. \"O-oh my\" She utters \"I... this actually feels better than I expected.\" Now this catches you by surprise, that reaction meant that she was probably sensible on her feet, which in turn meant that you both would get all the more enjoyment out of this. Facing her with a smile you simply say \"Then you will love this\" and begin with the real work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bring her heel to your mouth, extend your tongue out, and proceed to run it slowly all the way to the tip of her toes, enjoying the scent and texture every second of it... and you sense Jacinta enjoying having her sole licked. All through your licking, you hear her moan in approval as she leans back on the table and reaches in between her legs to start massaging her already wet crotch, a sight that only encouraged you to enjoy her feet as you initially wanted: With pure lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start licking her foot with a greater passion, focusing on both the smooth sensation and the salty taste of her foot which fortunately for you was still warm and a little damp from her tasty sweat, but now the dampness of her sweat had been quickly combined with that of your saliva, and you couldn't stop yourself. You lick and savor everywhere, all around her heel, through the entirety of her sole and the ball of her foot, as well as pushing as far in between her toes as her pantyhose allowed until there was no space left without a lap of your tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden you feel a familiar scent and a silky sensation on your cheek. You turn to notice Jacinta's second foot begging for attention as it tries to force its way into your mouth. \"Don't forget about this one, Jamesy\" she says still moaning and with a trembling voice. You notice that her cheeks had turned to a bright crimson shade due to arousal. Could it be that she enjoys to receive this sort of treatment just as much as you enjoy giving it? Or is this reaction because it's you the one who's doing it? Either way you realize it doesn't matter for it's clear that you are both enjoying this moment, so you simply continue sucking the set of toes of her second foot joyfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you give her foot the same treatment as you did to the first one you turn to see that Jacinta in now fully laying on the table as she continues masturbating in front of you with one hand covering her mouth to stop her moans from sounding any louder. Part of you wants to join her but you are determined to fully show your appreciation to her and her feet before release, knowing that the wait would only make things better in the end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing the equal treatment you bring both of her feet to your face letting them smother you as your tongue works its way all over them again, running it through her long soles with special care, sliding your tongue in between them as if letting them give it a footjob, and trying to fit as many toes inside your mouth as you can. Truly you are both at pure bliss... until suddenly...</span></div></div>",

She wasn't just trying to lure you into her hands! (or feet in this case) Her offer of a footjob was genuine and you didn't even need to remind her! In a blink she shoves both her feet onto your lap without warning, being blocked by your pants on their way to your throbbing cock but rubbing strongly against it anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp at the sensation and lean backwards, feeling too impatient to even try to remove your pants... luckily for you, you didn't have to. Before you even noticed, Jacinta's masterful feet took care of removing your belt, unbuttoning your pants and unzipping them as well. You return your eyes to her feet and see the strong grip they had taken over your shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm~ That wasn't so hard\" Jacinta cooes\"Removing your pants I mean, 'cause your friend over here <b>clearly</b> is very hard\" she continues with a giggle as she uses her feet to thoroughly rub your member as if it was a stick to light up a bonfire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh Jaci...\" You utter in pleasure before being quickly stopped by her. \"Shh~ You've earned this. I am already done as you can see, so it is only fair to let you spurt your love juices as well.\" The fact that she is being both kind and dominant only serves to turn you on more, for even if some of your previous girlfriends used to be more on the dominant side, none of them had indulged your fetish before, let alone this thoroughly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For now I just want you to lean back, relax, and focus entirely on how my <i>feet</i> feel on your cock as I use them to milk you 'til the very... last... drop\" She says with a very seductive tone in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice that you start moaning and panting softly as you find yourself at the mercy of your new girlfriend's feet, but even as embarrassed as that makes you feel, you don't mind because you also feel completely comfortable with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden her feet stop moving and lock your member in position, which only makes your hips move automatically in an attempt to continue the stimulation, and your erection throb begging for release, which makes Jacinta release another cute giggle. \"Tell you what, hon\" she says \"I will do this in whatever way you want me to. So, what's your favorite kind of footjob?\" Her feet finally release your erection but Jacinta rests them very near over your crotch to have them ready to strike again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...u-uh I...\" you murmur, but before any intelligible words come out of your mouth Jacinta takes initiative once again by pressing a foot on your cock strongly against your skin and slowly sliding the ball of her foot across your length. \"Do you like <i>long~ </i> firm strokes?\" she asks, removing her foot once her toes reach your tip only to hold your tip again with her arch as she uses her other foot to give you a quick rub with her toes \"Or maybe firm quickies?\" she continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can only grunt from pleasure in response, but despite your attempts to speak she keeps interrupting you \"Perhaps something more traditional?\" she comments as she holds your cock with her arches and moves her feet up and down. \"Or maybe something a bit more cruel?\" she continues with a grin on her lips while she ever so gently pokes your balls and your shaft with her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't... know...\" You finally utter between moans, to which she responds with a curious look on her face and moving her feet to your thighs to mercilessly tease your member \"Hmm? What do you mean you don't know? Surely you must have a favori...\" Jacinta suddenly pauses and both, her eyes and smile, widen in realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait.\" She says, starting to blush brightly again and sitting upright on the table \"Have you ever felt the different types of footjobs before?\" You shake your head to let her know you haven't. After this, you see her hand reaching for her crotch again, but otherwise holding still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarrowing her eyes she now asks \"Have you ever received a footjob at all?\" to which, once again, you shake your head in denial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear Jacinta let loose a slight squeal before covering her mouth. \"D-does that mean I took y-your... <i>footjob</i> virginity?\" she says as her voice starts to tremble and her hand begins to massage her wet crotch again. The fact that she is just as excited as you are for all of this only helps to turn you on even more, practically making your cock be ready to explode on contact. Finally, you nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacinta moans with her hand covering her mouth again as she leans back on the table once more, this time masturbating more furiously than before. This sight is certainly very passionate and arousing, which makes your cock practically <b>beg</b> for release now, especially since her feet were still temptingly around your crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to speak properly you decide it would be best to take action and use her feet to masturbate while she uses her hand to do the same, so you simply grab her ankles and start bringing them to your erection, but right before her silky smooth pantyhose covered feet touch you again, Jacinta extends her legs releasing her ankles and using her feet to push you further back on your chair, catching you by surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no~ no no no no, big boy! You are mine now! And since we already got this far <b>I</b> am going to makes us both cum at the same time!\" With that said, she uses her feet to hold your cock tightly again. \"And since this is your... <i>first time</i>...\" she says between moans right before starting to quickly rub you off with her tightly pressed feet without finishing her sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find this entire situation to be too much, both of you are now suppressing moans as hard as you can inside a private office. The door may be locked but if you two remain here much longer someone may come to intervene... but it is in part this risk which makes you both even more aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel Jacinta's feet slide up and down your shaft rather rapidly in perfect coordination with her masturbation movements, feeling frustrated about forcing your hands to grasp the armrests of your chair instead of her body, but none of you could deny that what you are feeling right now is pure unaltered bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, with a few more strokes from her feet you arch forward unconsciously while Jacinta, in turn, arches backward and uses her feet to stabilize your member, making sure her soles cover your shaft and her toes your tip, all while the both of you let out muffled moans as your reach your orgasms harmoniously. After that, you fall heavily on your respective pieces of furniture still panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-alright, that... that was better than I thought it would be\" Jacinta utters breaking the silence and making you chuckle lightly \"You're telling me. That felt amazing!\" you respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess... I guess all those practices did come in handy huh?\" Jacinta asks, making you raise an eyebrow \"Practices?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" she continues \"I kinda suspected you had a thing for feet so I prepared myself with any phallic-looking object I could get my hands on... or rather, my feet!\" she says chuckling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but smile at her statement. Jacinta truly was this dedicated to make you feel this good \"Ah~ so you mastered the ways of the footjob?\" You ask jokingly in a stereotypical oriental accent, to which she responds giggling \"Well I wouldn't say <i>master</i>, but looking at the results I'd dare say I'm pretty close! Besides, I have the real thing to practice on now~\" Jacinta says caressing your member lovingly with her now cum covered foot. With that, both of you lean towards one another for a very passionate kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should get going, hon\" Jacinta says breaking the kiss hesitantly \"The rookie is probably still waiting for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I forgot about her\" you say as you start getting up from the chair and buckling up your pants again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmhmm~\" Jacinta cooes in response \"And with the special perk I just granted you, you will be immune to her or any other woman's feet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodness gracious, you can say that again!\" you respond chuckling while you now clean what remained of your seed from your belly and fix your shirt, surprised at the fact that there was barely any cum on you to clean up. \"Huh, I thought I blasted way more than this\" you comment absentmindedly, to which Jacinta simply responds \"Oh you did, Jamesy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning toward her you feel your eyes try to pop out of your sockets as the sight she's granting you. Both of her soles up, covered completely in your cum while she joyfully wriggles her toes. With this, you realize that most of your load knew exactly where it wanted to go! You feel a dumbfounded smile form on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments you finally react as Jacinta continues to clean her own mess from the table \"Oh! sorry l-let me clean those for you\" you say reaching for a napkin to clean her feet as you cleaned you belly, but before you can even retrieve one, you see Jacinta jump down from the table and slowly putting her shoes back on as she pays close attention to your reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh~ I could get used to this feeling\" she comments wiggling her feet as she finally finishes putting her shoes back on... with your seed still on her soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wa...Ja-Jaci...\" You utter, feeling your erection wanting to come back to life just from this sight alone, and Jacinta takes notice of your reaction responding by simply patting your cheek and kissing you again. \"Don't worry, I'll change my pantyhose once this dries up... and I'll get ready for round two, so you better do so too while you finish with the rookie.\" With that, she quickly writes her personal number on a piece of paper, places it on one of your pockets, and leaves the room without another word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but feel completely bound to her now, and you feel deep down that you are going to be thinking of her feet for the rest of the day... or even longer, but for now, your duty was with the rookie.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You find your eyes locked on those lusty feet. As much as you wanted to taste them you simply couldn't resist the idea of those warm, soft and slightly damp beauties rubbing you off til' you were dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a pant and a dumb smile you reach down to unbutton your pants and give your member some much needed release, but as soon as you unbutton them Jacinta forcefully replaces your hands with her feet. \"Let me get those for you, big boy\" she says with a wink \"I want you to unbutton your shirt instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't really tell what has gotten into Jacinta but you quickly find that this assertive side of her is all the more attractive to you, even if that meant that your erection would stay enclosed for a little longer, so you simply do as she says and start unbuttoning your shirt from bottom to top. As you do this, you feel her nyloned toes masterfully grab your zipper and pulling it down slowly... the your pants... and then your underwear, making your erection throb both at the release and the warm ambience emitted by Jacinta's feet that, while not touching you, they were close enough for you to feel their warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get close to finishing the unbuttoning of your shirt, but Jacinta stops you just two buttons earlier, letting your neck stay guarded by the rest of your shirt and your tie. \"That'll do\" She says with a grin, and soon her feet find themselves resting on your body, one locking your erection in place... while the other started to go to town on your torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly but surely her foot rises up your body, making sure to rub everything it can on its way. Your belly button is teasingly poked with her big toe, your chest is steadily massaged with her entire foot, and your nipples get playfully pinched with her toes... all while her other foot stays mercilessly unmoving over your raging erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though you feel pure bliss from this torture and find it difficult to think about anything else, you can't help but notice how perfectly smooth her pantyhose and feet are. Her feet alone are plushy to the touch, you cannot detect any sort of roughness whatsoever which meant that she probably took thorough care of them, and that softness combined with the silky smoothness of her nylons allowed her to run her feet all over you without any sort of complications. Her foot only stops when she wants it to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally her foot reaches the upper part of your chest and rests on the very bottom on your neck. You figure that she only stopped because of the remaining buttons on your shirt and your tie. \"D-do you want me to un...\" you utter with your voice trembling from lust, but before you could finish your sentence you manage to see Jacinta in the eye again, and notice a rather evil-looking grin on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you feel her foot seductively crawling its way under your shirt's neck, being tightly pressed against your skin due to the boundaries of your clothes. You can't help but gasp at her actions, especially because your erection was still being pressed tight against you. \"Hmm~ I love the way you throb under my sole\" you hear Jacinta say in a very seductive tone as she lightly moves her lower foot only to have it freeze in position once more, making the throbbing of your member more frequent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a sensory overload. You want to jump on her and get over with this, but at the same time you don't want to stop feeling this way. This woman was right when she told you that you would fall for her because of her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself too caught up in the blissful sensation this woman was granting you when all of a sudden a familiar and alluring scent assaults your nostrils, so you look down to see her foot that had finally managed to break through your clothes barrier. Her dainty toes wriggling eagerly toward you as she slid her foot slowly from your neck through your chin. It simply kept rising toward your already open mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to pant in anticipation and you simply close your eyes expecting to taste her delicious looking toes... but suddenly she stopped. You open your eyes to look down to see that her foot had been stopped by your tie and shirt once more, but this time unable to go any further without breaking your shirt and stretching your tie too much. This proved to be a heartbreaking sight for you, especially because her toes were already laid over your lower lip warming it, and you were unable to take them into your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an uncontrolled pant you extend your tongue out in a desperate attempt to taste those beauties, and you do manage to taste the very tip of her toes, which brought a blissful salty taste to your taste-buds. Looking at you like this makes Jacinta both tremble in arousal and giggle in amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Jamesy, I teased you enough\" she says as she swiftly brings her foot down and lifts the other one to bring them both together around your begging cock. The suddenness of it all made you almost scream with pleasure, but you managed to stop yourself knowing that you were still at work, so you limit yourself to grasp the armrests tightly with all your might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear Jacinta giggle again as she starts taking her pretty peds up... and down... up... and down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, James?\" she starts \"I always suspected you had a thing for feet. Often times when I stole glances at you your eyes would be locked on the floor when they were not locked on your computer screen. In the beginning I never really made much out of it, but when the idea of you having a foot fetish hit me I started buying better pantyhose... softer ones\" This last word saying it as she held your member with one foot and ran through its length meticulously with the other one, which made your grunt slightly and made her giggle more as she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no idea how glad I am to have overheard your conversation with Michelle. That was the best confirmation I could've ever gotten about the subject.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tremble at how ruthless she starts to become with her footjob. She wraps your shaft between her soles like a sandwich, she fondles your balls with the ball of each foot lovingly, and she squishes your head carefully with her toes, and she nudges your thighs teasingly with her heels. Clearly this woman knew her ups and downs when it came to footjobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you're thinking\" she continues \"Yes, I've been practicing with... everything really\" she giggles again, a sound that you start to crave more and more \"My <i>'toys'</i>, cucumbers, controllers, bananas... All while thinking of you Jamesy.\" Her words and her footjob make you hunch forward in an attempt to not start spasming from pleasure, which allows you to see as her hand reaches for her already damp crotch and start massaging herself. The lustful sensation of her soft and slightly damp feet around you, her alluring and teasing words, and the precious sight in front of you prove to be too much. You feel the urge to cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacinta notices your pained (if slightly numbed) expression and quickly realizes what you want, so she reaches forward, grabs your chin and whispers lovingly into your ear: \"Go on lover boy. Cover my feet with your seed.\" and proceeds to kiss you as you finally blast your load all over her waiting feet. You worry for an instant about actually making a mess on her clothes or yous, or on the chair you were on, but a quick glance down and a confirming grip on your head made you realize that Jacinta was making sure to catch it all up with her toes on both feet. Once you finish pouring your liquid over her feet, Jacinta breaks the kiss and you both back off to process what just had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though you are still panting you feel definitely more relaxed and flash a thankful smile to Jacinta, which she eagerly returns as she rises her feet up in front of your face. The sight alone of your cum sliding down her gorgeous soles and in between her toes made you want to cum again. \"Won't you clean them up for me?\" She asks with a smile, breaking the silence of your dumbfounded stare. \"O-oh! S-sure\" You utter as you reach for a napkin from your pocket, but she is quick to stop you. \"Ah ah~ No cheating, darling!\" she says, but before you could ask her what she meant you see her licking the palm of her hand and pointing at her feet with the other one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted you to clean your own mess with your tongue!</span></div></div>",

Jacinta just gave you a magnificent footjob and was now asking you to remove your mess but, while you do feel like you owe her a lot, the idea simply doesn't feel right to you... not now at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh... I don't.... err another time maybe?\" you ask nervously, half-expecting Jacinta to get mad at you for refusing. Surprisingly enough, she doesn't react negatively in the slightest, in fact, she continues to face you with a loving smile!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's alright, hon\" she says \"More for me~\" a sentence that takes you by surprise. \"Wait are you going to...?\" you start, but before you manage to finish you question you see Jacinta pulling one foot to her face, grabbing her ankle with both hands, and extending her tongue out of her mouth. Jacinta pauses for a moment to stare directly at you right before she begins to slowly and steadily give her sole a long extended lap with her tongue... she was now eagerly licking your cum off her foot and making you watch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of you feels slightly jealous of her for being the one licking her foot, but knowing what was covering it made the scene all the more lustful. Without realizing it, you start to absentmindedly stroke your member, which is hardening again from the sight alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacinta quickly finishes with that foot and uses it to push you back on your chair, kindly making sure to not touch your clothes in case some of your cum remained there (which it certainly did considering she is wearing pantyhose), and joining you hands in your cock massage. Soon after, you see her bring her other foot to her mouth and repeat the process, licking it slowly while staring at you with a knowing smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly now you realize that all this made you completely hard again, and Jacinta seems to be very aware of it given the fact she just helped you masturbate while you stared at her licking her own foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my~ I see one footjob wasn't enough for you, big boy!\" she says with a wink right after finishing to lick her other foot, to which you only respond with a slight grunt and a chuckle \"Well, there is no such thing as too many footjobs!\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you can say that again, Jamesy\" she responds \"Would you like me to use my feet to drain you completely?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis question makes you shake internally \"Goodness, Jaci! I think you know the answer damn well!\" you say with an eager smile, a response that makes Jacinta giggle in a very cute way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do Jamesy, I do. And don't worry, I'll make sure to please you in every way possible now that we'll be dating... but right now we have to go\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow this was unexpected. \"Wha... go? b-but I'm...\" you stutter, making Jacinta grab your cheek lovingly \"Totally hard, I know. And that's exactly what I want\" she says simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing completely aware of your confusion she decides to continue \"I know this was to give you some release hon, but looking at you like this makes me tremble with lust like you have no idea! Besides, we still have work to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize that she's right, you two have been in here long enough, if you take longer people will start to get suspicious... but to leave you like this, practically mad with lust, will certainly make the rest of the day go by rather slowly. \"Don't worry\" she continues \"I'm sure you won't feel weak over other women's feet... and I'll make certain of it!\" she says with an evil-looking wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacinta leans back on the table to admire her handiwork for a moment before asking you to retrieve her shoes, which you happily do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about a <i>'see you later'</i> kiss?\" Jacinta says pouting her lips and bringing both of her soles together in front of you, making you kiss them automatically without thinking about the remains of your cum that still lingered within the fabric of her nylons. \"And now one for good luck!\" she says leaning toward you and kissing you deeply all of a sudden. After breaking the kiss Jacinta asks you to put her shoes back on, which again, you happily do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you start dressing up properly again and making sure that no trace of your recent lewd act remained. After triple-checking the entire room Jacinta reaches you for another kiss and places a paper with her personal number in your jacket's pocket, and right as you both are about to leave the room Jacinta turns to you \"Send me a message when you add my number. I will keep you updated on my footwear throughout the day\" and with that, she leaves you behind and starts heading for her office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf your erection had started to recede, you now felt it wanting to come back and you start resisting the urge to let it do so... this day will be tougher than you expected but at least Jaci is the only one who actually has an effect on you now... maybe you could get rid of the rookie to spend more time with Jaci? Though it would not make you look good in front of Kim and it would certainly affect your position...</span></div></div>",

Only held by her toes and ready to fall at her whim.

You were struck by cold lightning as you tried to focus your attention back towards your computer and your sexy, young trainee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her petit form it was no problem to fold her legs on her seat that even her feet rested on the cushion. \"A friend of yours?\" She asked with fake innocence and looked over to Denise.

Moreover, it woul be a great chance for Denise to prove her leadership skills and get some extra points on her way to future promotion. On the other hand, you are extremely busy today, working on the big project for the key client. Mentoring Michelle can take a few hours and if you don\u2019t make your presentation perfect, the client could choose another company. You can\u2019t afford any \u201efuck up\u201d here. It is more risky than to dissapoint Kim with mentoring Michelle. <br>\r\n\u201eI am really sorry Kim, but I really need to focus only on the pitch today.

What a bitch - you say to yourself trying to focus on the presentation again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours later Denise comes back to her desk to finish her daily work. You can\u2019t help looking at her tanned legs and feet in a sexy black flats. You hate that bitch, but have to admit she looks real good today. It is a hot summer day and there is some problem with air con, so you can see Denise dangle her shoes to get her feet some breath. You try to not look there but this is stronger than you. Thanks God she doesn\u2019t know about your twisted foot fetish, as this brat would use it in any way she could, to take an advantage of you. Your career in this company would be over if only she find out and she would step over you to get the promotion. But you can\u2019t stop thinking about how sweaty her feet get now in this leather flats. Damn! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s 6:30 pm when Denise finally left the office. You still have a lot work left and need to stay late. You go to the coffee machine and get yourself a big strong coffee. Two hours later the office is empty and you sit alone on your presentation. From time to time you look at Denise\u2019s flats, she left under her desk. They tempt you to come closer but you feel it\u2019s not good. You try to fight it and focus ob your work again. Pointless. You cant help it. Finally you take a risk. You go under Denise\u2019s desk and look closer to her shoes. They are sttill a little bit wet. You can see the footprints inside the flats and feel the smell of the long sweaty office day. You can\u2019t resist no longer. You put your nose into Denise\u2019s flat and breath deep. You feel you getting hard immediately. But feel quilty at the same time. \u201cWhat the fuck I am doing\u201d - you think. \u201cI am smelling the shoes of the bitch who hates me. What a sick pervert I am, what a loser\u201d. The time goes by and you inhale the flats and feel totaly dizzy. All of the sudden, you hear some noice behind. You get panic and drope the shoes immediately. You look around office and run to the door to look outside the room but there is nobody. \u201cThe office is empty\u201d- you try to calm yourself down. \u201cNobody could saw me. It was just an mishearing, illusion. Or maybe... what if it was Helena, the office janitor... It would be a real disaster. Than I am fucked. But no... impossible, I looked outside the door. There was nobody\u201d. You look once again at Denise\u2019s flats and decide to go home and get a drink. You feel bewildered and tired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened? </span></div></div>",

From day one, everything between you had been a competition, from making coffee for your managers to sales, from reports to presentations... You are thankful to say that on most occasions, you get the better of her and quite often find yourself gloating and teasing her for being '2nd best' to you. You know she would love nothing more than to beat you and rub it in your face for a change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring your time at the office, Denise has constantly been trying to ruin you.

Rather than competing against you, she has been trying to sabotage you, making you look bad, spreading false rumours... This has just added to your hatred of her, and proven to you that this woman will stop at NOTHING to destroy you...

You can NOT let Denise take this opportunity from you, this is exactly what Kim is looking for in a future manager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Kim, before Denise interrupted us, I was about to tell you that I would be happy to take on the responsibility of training the new girl\" you say with a level of sincere professionalism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim, he only said that because he realised how important this is to you. He wouldn't have cared otherwise!\" Denise tells Kim... Let the sabotage begin...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly Denise... I think you are right. James, you didn't answer me when I asked you at first, why should I believe that you are more motivated to step up and help that Denise here?\" Kim asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is not good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm.... Well, I was thinking of all the other tasks I had to do and if I could take on this responsibility without jeopardising my other tasks\" you say, dodging a bullet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you decided that you have today free did you?\" Kim asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a quick second to think about your answer. Saying yes will imply you had nothing to do today, but saying no would mean you can't train the new girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Kim, my day is free to train the new girl\" you reply, making up your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then James, if your day is free...\" Kim begins...</span></div></div>",

I don't know what she told you but we're at the same level here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ok, sure cool! \" Beamed Michelle. She grabbed you by the arm making you blush at the same time. She let your arm go as soon as you began walking. You were happy to see the new intern showing you some attention, you may have pleased her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later both of you were sitting next of each other working as she sat cross leged. You of course couldn't help but peek whenever she played with her shoes. At one point you heard in a clap her shoe sliding underneath you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops !\" Innocently said the young gorgeous intern. \"Hm, could you help me with my shoe?\" She asked kindly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S..Sure \"you answered, You tried to answer as a matter of factly but your thoughts began to grow wild. You looked at Michelle's shoe, you could see the print of her foot on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising your head up you are met with Michelle's cute smile. She didn't say a word as you gulped, seeing her right foot just inches away from your face. Her foot looked so smooth, so beautiful...you are left stunned by such an amazing view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know James, my ex was a foot fetish guy, at first I found it a bit weird but I learnt to enjoy all the upsides it granted me..\" she winked , wrinkling her cute nose at the same time. \"How about you give my tootsies a little kiss?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew about your secret, your hesitation just proved she was right that there was no point hiding it longer...<br>\r\nThe situation you were in right now was like a dream come true, as you slowly planted a kiss on her soft beautiful sole making you completey forget the shitty day you have been through until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle definitely had done that before as she slid her toes in a sexy way across your cheek then slowly played with your lips.You immediatly began licking her toes, one after another. The feeling was amazing,the taste wasn't as you expected. If her feet smelled like raspberry, they tasted rather salty.<br>\r\n\"It seems like you are enjoying yourself in here.\" She laughed kindly poking your private parts. Your penis was throbbing with excitement, a bit too much maybe. Michelle was maybe doing it too hard, pressing back and forth a bit too strongly. She kept doing that for half a minute and...you unfortunately creamed your pants!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops,\" She laughed again, \"I overdid myself it seems.\" You blushed, surprised to have had an orgasm so quickly and wthout even being naked. But realising your dream was just so awesome you planted a last kiss on her sole. Michelle suddenly moved away her cute foot from your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James could you ...\" Michelle beamed, pointing her foot. You slowly put her shoe back on letting another kiss at the top of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stayed silent a few seconds, you've had sex before but never experienced your fetish. It was the best sensation you had ever experienced... However now that you had climaxed, your obscure thoughts were coming back - you just did a foot session with the new intern. If anyone here was to know that, it would be the end of you for sure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh..Uh Michelle, it stays between us right ?\" You shyly asked, looking at the cute young woman's face focusing back on work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Yeah sure, as long as you're good...You should put spare pants on though.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs long as you're good? What did she mean by that?

From there, we can have all of your details on the system too. Then we can set your initial targets and goals, and assess the most effective way of achieving those. Right James?\" She gives you a challenging look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on, Denise,\" You say, feeling a little flustered. \"You're MY assistant remember.\" You give her a death stare, to which she simply shrugs. You turn your attention back to Michelle. \"Anyway....yeah...we'll get you set up with an email...\" You begin walking over to the IT area, gesturing for Michelle to follow, hoping that she doesn't see you as less decisive than Denise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise falls next to her and begins talking. \"There'll be lots of new faces, new things to remember... Honestly, you'll be fine. I felt like this on my first day too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Michelle giggles. \"There's a lot to take in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine!\" You call back at her. \"You'll be...fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle doesn't respond as she continues to chat with Denise.

Despite being younger than you, this woman seems to be rather talented at scheming and office politics, and will take you for everything you're worth if you let her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing too major.  In public, nothing will change.  In private though, you work for me; my stepladder to getting a promotion.  Any good chances to look good in front of the higher ups?  You tell me about them.  Any job I don't have time to finish?  You do it for me.  Anyone asks you how I'm doing?  You give me a <i>glowing</i> review.  I'll also want access to all your work accounts, so I can tell you're not trying to hold out on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the litany of excessive demands, Michelle just looks at you expectantly.  You stare in disbelief, unable to process what she just said for several moments.  Finally you croak out a reply.  \"...Y-you...can't possibly think I'd agree to that...right?\"  Her vouching for you with Kim will certainly help, but it's not like your boss is going to promote or fire either you or Denise on the word of someone who just got hired...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle looks puzzled at your refusal, then claps her hands in a clearly scripted show of only just remembering something.  \"Oh, that's right, I forgot.  The other reason why you'll be my stepladder is <i>this</i>.\"  Michelle points down, and once you look, she kicks one sandal off of her foot, leaving a pale white, dainty foot exposed and dangling in your line of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour pulse races as you stare at the perfect foot in front of you, and Michelle's voice seems to wash over you as her toes flex casually.  \"The other reason is that you're a horny little foot-loving pervert, and if you get down on your knees and beg to be my stepladder, I'll let you lick my foot.\"  Your cock throbs in your pants as she says it straight out, and the urge to do as she says is strong...</span></div></div>",

Getting ordered around by your sexy boss.\"  She purses her lips, then deliberately spits right in your face, leaving saliva dripping down your nose.  \"...getting humiliated?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seems to have missed your foot fetish so far, but clued in to all the signs pointing towards submissiveness and masochism...and to top it off, she seems to like the idea of bossing you around.  It's hardly a surprise; Kim's always liked telling people what to do.  The only question is what she intends to do next...</span></div></div>",

You're a masochistic little pussy, and I'm going remind you of it every day for the rest of your career.  I'm sure you'll be running home to beat your little dick every night after getting treated as the office bitch.  Alright, get out, I still need to see Denise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumiliated, you turn and leave, unable to make your erection subside despite everything.  After exiting, you take care to turn away and stomp off down the hallway before Denise can notice you're sporting a tent in your pants...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle intercepts you shortly after, pulling you into an empty room.  You glare at her angrily...She seems unfazed though, merely raising an eyebrow until you find yourself lowering your gaze submissively.  Giggling, Michelle steps in closer, grabbing your chin and raising your gaze to meet hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about throwing you under the bus...\" Michelle bites her lip.  \"...you'll forgive me, right?\"  You realize she's getting closer and closer, and soon has a leg positioned between both of yours.  Her knee is only a bit below your groin, practically brushing against it, while her foot is coiled partway around your leg seductively.  Head spinning, you nod before you can think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle beams, disentangling herself from you and pushing you back a step once she's got what she wanted.  Her face goes from contrite and seductive back to neutral in an instant.  \"So...what's Kim doing about it all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the time to explain - omitting most of the details not related to 'work' -, and see Michelle looking more and more pleased as you speak.  By the time you're finished, she's ecstatic enough to give you a quick hug.  \"<i>Great</i>, that's perfect.  You're the best, James.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently a seamless transition into your position is the best result Michelle could have hoped for from the previous events.  You're a bit taken aback by how openly she's celebrating the fact that she's basically stealing your career from you, but you can't dwell on it for long...Michelle seems intent on giving you a reward.</span></div></div>",

Why me of all people?\" You manage to retort, to which Michelle responds with an absolute ease and confidence that once more manages to take you under her evil spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well first of all because you were the one perving on my pretty little feet to begin with!\" she says, making you lower your head in shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And second of all...\" she continues as she grabs your shoulders and softly pushes you to the ground \"...because I just love to have my <i>'superiors'</i> at my <i>feet</i>.\" She says, making emphasis on the precise reason as to why you are in this position to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you find yourself sitting on the cold floor of this empty room you can't help but wonder how things would've gone if you simply denied to be the rookie's mentor... Sure, you would've been a little bit left behind on your race for superiority against Denise, but at least your secret would not have been found out by Michelle, and in that case, you would not have been so humiliated, you would not have been forced to give up your career <b>and</b> money just like that, and on top of that, Kim would still have a somewhat respectable image of you... but now... now here you are, simply giving up to this blackmailing newcomer, who has taken complete dominance over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw come on, bitch, don't be such a downer!\" Michelle says in a very inadequate friendly way. \"You did as I told you and for being such a good slave-boy it's only natural that I give you your reward!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at her again you see that she had taken a chair, placed it in front of you, and was now sitting on it with one leg on top of the other, letting her upper sandal dangle from her undeniably pretty foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right...\" You think to yourself \"All this sacrifice was for this perfect pair of feet.\" Though the sentence does come by as a desperate attempt to justify your newly earned and pathetic position... regardless of that, you continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are the feet that got me into this mess... These are the feet that I sacrificed my job and status for... And these are the feet that will make it all totally worth it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing how Michelle just kept dangling her sandal back and forth without saying a word, you assume that it's because she's waiting for you to claim your reward. Even if you feel ashamed of yourself for letting all of this happen to begin with, you try to find comfort in the fact that at least she would let you use her feet to satiate your fetish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of doubt you finally reach forward to remove her sandal, to which Michelle quickly responds by replacing her foot with the other one \"Now this one.\" You remove her second sandal and you see her toes joyfully wriggle after their release as Michelle herself starts to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her exposed bare feet again makes you forget almost completely about the fact that you essentially just gave up your entire career to her, but you start to ignore that thought more and more as you take your mouth closer and closer to her delicious-looking toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah-ah-ah~ I didn't say you could suck them.\" Michelle says as she very visibly enjoys the sad reaction her words bring upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-didn't... didn't you say I could get a reward? Please Michelle I beg you!\" You respond rather pathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck did you just call me?\" Michelle asks with a now angry expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... err... m-mistress?\" Is all you can muster to try and calm the brunette, which, luckily for you works perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's better, bitch! You may continue begging!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, you simply throw yourself at her leg and hug it tightly \"Please mistress, l-let me claim my reward! I did all of this for you! I sacrificed my everything for you, mistress! Please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour begging gets interrupted by Michelle's laughter \"Oh~ aren't you pathetic?\" And with that she kicks you back against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, bitch, I wasn't planning to take your reward away from you, I just really love to see you squirming like a worm. Now, unzip!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSay what? Did she just ask you to unzip your pants?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unzip now before I do decide to take your reward away!\" Is all she adds once she sees your clearly confused expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't even bother to think about it, all you can do is move your hands as fast as you can to remove your belt, your pant's button and your zipper as to not displease the rookie, but you do not expose your fully erect member just in case this isn't what she asked for, which quickly proves not to be the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright listen, today's a special day because of all the sweet things you did for me so I'll rub you off with the feet you love so much...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A... footjob? From... Michelle?\" The thought sounds so unrealistic in your mind that, for a moment, it feels like all of this was truly worth it after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now hold still while I run my pretty little feet all over that pathetic foot-loving dick of yours.\" And with that said, Michelle simply reaches for your underwear only to take it out of the way and start jerking you off with her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp and down, from side to side, between her toes and pressed between her arches, Michelle completely goes to town on your dick using her feet. Even if her movements are rather clumsy -if not rude at times when she felt like kicking- the fact alone that this beautiful pair of feet is rubbing you off is more than enough for you to feel completely blessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seems to enjoy it when she rubs you quickly to take you over the edge just to quickly slow down her movement or down right stop her motions just to see how you moan from several orgasm denials.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh~ I guess you do enjoy my feet! Maybe this is too much of a reward for you, bitch boy!\" She says almost threateningly, as if she was planning to stop this marvelous footjob in an instant, but you are not willing to let that happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please no, mistress! I love it, please don't stop! I am nothing but your foot bitch so please don't stop!\" The words come out automatically out of your mouth, which catches you slightly by surprise, but Michelle seems to be rather amused by them, almost as if she already knew you would say that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm~ That's right, if you continue to be a good bitch you will get many more of these! ...Well ok not many but hey, my feet are too good for you anyway so you should feel honored!\" Michelle says. Even if Michelle doesn't seem to know how to properly give a footjob -which seems weird to you given how she's been abusing you with foot fetish references- you feel like the fact of having her precious little feet rubbing you off is indeed more than you could ask for, so you start creating a mantra to completely give in and focus on serving Michelle however she pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I do, I do for my mistress...\"</span></div></div>",

Certainly not any more than getting to be up close and personal with Michelle's sandals...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking a quick departure, you barely hear your friend Jenny call you over as you head towards the main exit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James! JAMES! What, are you deaf or something?\" The pretty redhead looks a little amused as you snap out of your trance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Jenny. Hey,\" You say awkwardly, finding it hard to maintain eye contact, knowing what you'll be doing the moment you get home. Clutching your briefcase, as if the sandals could fall out at any second, you find your gaze shifting to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, no news? Anything happen today?\" She leans forwards eagerly, clearly wanting to exchange some gossip with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny, er, I gotta...\" You motion towards the door and make a hasty retreat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries...we'll catch up tomorrow I guess!\" She calls after you. Determined to get home without any more distraction, you go straight to your car and arrive back at your apartment in what seems like far too long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour place is suitably plush and spacious for a man on a comfortable salary like you. Yet you feel nothing like a man, but a pathetic creature as you rummage in your briefcase and pull out the two small sandals of your conqueror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Michelle's sandals!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping to your knees in defeat, you let out a small whimper as you bring one insole to your nose, inhaling deeply. The bitter, yet wonderful aroma dominates your thoughts as you feel your pants tighten immediately. Using the other sandal to place on the ground in front of you, you drop to the floor so that your member can thrust against the cute brunette's footwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill breathing in her foot scent, you start rubbing it all over your face, moaning uncontrollably as your hips gyrate and you begin thrusting against the other shoe, still in your work clothes. In a mere minute's time, you let out a muffled cry as your body spasms and you ejaculate into your boxers, lying with your face pressed against the insole of her shoe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few brief seconds of calm pass and your satisfaction turns into nasty sense of guilt. What the hell are you doing?! Letting out a choked sob, you sit up in frustration and hurl each shoe against the wall, smashing a piece of expensive art work in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis girl has only been in your life for one day and she's already destroyed you! The image of Kim suddenly floods into your mind....your boss thinks you are a submissive bitch and is basically going to get Michelle to take over from you. <i>She actually spat in your face earlier!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat options do you have for your career now? With Michelle stealing your job, your salary will no doubt drop - you'll no doubt have to downgrade both your car and apartment. Michelle will probably get those too, you grimly muse to yourself. Its tempting to quit the office, get out now while you can, but you know that's not an option. The reference that Kim would leave would make you unemployable. Plus, with Michelle's word against yours, she could even spin it into a sexual harassment case where you're the pervert and they're the innocent victims. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe longer you think about it, the more you realise that Kim is right. What's really stopping you from jacking it all in is that she has so much power over you. You are her bitch! You're Michelle's bitch! Gradually, your mind comes around to thinking that this is what you deserve, for giving in to your foot fetish!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeakly getting to your feet and sweeping up the glass of the ruined artwork, you carefully place Michelle's sandals on to the coffee table. You should throw them away but you can't bring yourself to do it! Getting out of your ruined boxers and pants, you change into a t-shirt and jogging bottoms and try not to think about Kim, Michelle or anything about the office! Turning on the TV, you try to focus on something else, yet your eyes keep flickering over to her shoes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you know it, you're back on the floor, rubbing one shoe all over your face while you hump all over the other one. Letting out a weak gurgling noise as you orgasm, the triumphant, sneering faces of Michelle, Kim and Denise enter your mind. Defeated and exhausted, you collapse and pass out, your nose still buried in Michelle's cute little sandal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking with a start, you realise that it is not only morning but only fifteen minutes until work starts! Peeling off Michelle's sandal, which has become stuck to your face overnight, you take a few moments to reorientate yourself. A sinking feeling takes over when you remember your predicament. Putting that aside for now, you focus on getting ready for work, somehow managing to get to the building only a few minutes late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a breath as you walk through the main doors, you see Jacinta talking to Jenny. Both smile at you as you get nearer. Considering that you're already a little late, is it a good idea to stop and talk to them now? Then again, these two women have always been kind to you. In fact, you know for a fact that Jacinta has a crush on you! This could be an opportunity to feel a bit better about yourself, after your humiliating ordeal yesterday...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you stop and chat with them?</span></div></div>",

How's anyone supposed to get any work done if the official coffee-brewer doesn't show up on time?\"  Her tone of voice makes it sound like a joke, for the benefit of the office staff in earshot, but the direct gaze Michelle is using on you lets you know she's expecting you to go make her coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, guess I'd better get to work then...\"  Playing it off like a joke, you act like you're being a good sport by going to make Michelle some coffee, but several coworkers shamelessly chime in that they wouldn't mind a cup as well.

You take your time, hoping that your 'problem' will subside before you get there, but even your nervousness fails to help.  Somehow, the thought that you're going to beg your boss to give Michelle your job is making you rock hard...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim looks up as you enter, seeming surprised to see you.  \"What's up, pervert?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer casual mockery makes your face redden, but you can't exactly refute her right now...swallowing, you decide to just get to the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I think Michelle can do my job better than I can.  You should promote her to my payband.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite what Michelle said, you figure it's at least worth a shot at just asking that Michelle be promoted first, without telling Kim to demote you...a paycut isn't ideal if you can avoid it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim looks startled by your request for a few seconds, before a contemptuous smile spreads across her face.  \"You're that eager to be Office Bitch?  Trying to throw your job to the newbie so you can get to fetching drinks and kissing ass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flush red as you hear her interpretation of your request, but nothing comes out of your mouth as you try to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it was going to happen eventually, and Michelle seems like she'll be far more competent than you are, so sure.\"'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou brighten up.  She agreed so easily to Michelle's promotion that maybe you won't even have to give up your own position...That thought is mercilessly dashed a moment later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, naturally we only have so much money allocated to paying salaries.  We need to stay competitive when it comes to paying our <i>skilled</i> employees, so you don't mind taking home a bit less, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right...so Michelle and I will swap salaries?\"  You hesitate to agree, but in the end, you kind of knew it was coming...to your surprise though, Kim shakes her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not.  Why on earth would I pay you more than minimum wage?\"  Kim laughs out loud, and you pale, wondering if you'll have enough money to pay your basic expenses after such a drastic pay cut...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, don't look so sad.  Everyone else in the office will get a small pay raise thanks to you.  Isn't that something to be glad about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling numb, you nod and turn to leave...</span></div></div>",

Literally kissing the ground that your boss walks on? You truly are a pathetic loser!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe humiliation doesn't end there however. <i>Clunk</i>.... Before you can move your head an inch to respond to the noise of something dropping next to you, your face is forced painfully into the carpet, with so much pressure that you  feel your nose crushing and mouth letting out a whimpering sound. Your senses are overwhelmed at this moment yet you realise what is happening - your boss is stepping on the back of your head!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such an office bitch!\" Kim calls down at you, continuing to use the balls of her foot to push your face into the ground. \"You're nothing but a bug to me - a bug that I can crush any time that I want to!\" She speaks with such authority and dominance that you do truly feel like a bug to this goddess of a woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I wanted to I could render you unconscious; all it would take is a bit more....\" Kim takes a breath as she spreads her toes before digging them hard against your skull, making you squeal like a pig. \"...A bit more pressure from just one of my feet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you feel your senses begin to abandon you and a swirling darkness forcing you into an unwanted sleep, your redhead boss finally relents. Lifting her foot off you, you stay facedown on the floor, merely gurgling in pain and weakly gulping in some oxygen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now remember, bitch, I can do this to you ANY time I want. Every time you come into my office and we're alone, I expect you to kiss the ground that I walk on. You should be grateful! Kiss the floor some more to show me how worthless and honoured you are!\" Her voice is dripping with glee - Kim is clearly enjoying the power she lords over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the fact that you're exhausted and have a throbbing head, you dutifully pucker your trembling lips against the carpet, kissing away like the bitch you are. Soon the fabric is wet with your own saliva; you continue to smooch it  nonetheless. You're reminded of your encounter with Michelle just yesterday - kissing the floor while humping it. Involuntarily, a hard-on begins and you're soon squirming around, unable to control your libido. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim's sharp eyes notice this in the blink of an eye. \"Well this is just too good...you really are a complete loser!\" She laughs with disdain as you feel several tears spring from your eyes. \"You are actually fucking yourself while I make you kiss the floor? This is just too good!\" She chuckles as she goes quiet for a few moments. Weakly lifting your head, you merely groan as she holds her phone directly over you, recording the whole perverted show. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please....\" You whimper, feeling yourself already not far away from an orgasm. True, you are conflicted. Being in such a mortifyingly embarrassing situation such as this makes you wish you could hump the ground until you disappeared. However, it is hot. The encounter with Michelle has made you much more pliant and easily willing to sexually surrender like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please what...?\" Kim grins down at you as you gaze up, still grinding against the floor, your hips swinging rhythmically as you feel yourself close to climax. Kim clears her throat as she puts on a mocking voice to imitate you. \"Please will you stop recording me while I fuck the floor and be even more a fucking pervert than my boss thought I was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing you have just a few seconds until you cum into your pants, you try your best to stop. It takes all of your will but you manage to do it, making Kim look slightly curious for a moment. \"Wow, some self control! We'll see how long that lasts...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving you a smug, look, she raises one foot up - the same one that she used to push against the back of your head. Staring at her sexy, sightly wrinkled sole, you immediately weaken and find yourself humping the floor again, letting out a muffled moan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought so - now let me record the most pathetic orgasm a man has ever had - in an office or any place!\" Kim smiles victoriously as you as sure enough, your body begins to spasm and your dick splurts into your pants, your eyes fixed the whole time on Kim's bare foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of this utter bliss, you drop your face back against the ground, feeling beyond shame. How the hell could you let yourself do that, in front of Kim?! Yet, with every foot-related experience, you've become more accepting of the fact that you are a foot bitch, a slave to your fetish. You can't really argue or do anything other than accept the fact that dominant women like Kim and Michelle are going to step all over you to get what they want - metaphorically and literally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can go now,\" Kim says, both amusement and disgust in her voice. \"This forty second clip I have on my phone - and that's including the <i>very</i> brief time that you tried to controlled your urges - is my insurance policy. I own you for LIFE.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you hoist yourself up, bowing your head to your conqueror, unable to look her in the eye. Keeping your eyes on the ground you decide to crawl towards the door - perfectly fitting really!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door and hurrying out of your boss's office, you head back over to Michelle. Having almost forgotten Michelle's request, it takes you a few moments to gather your thoughts as you slump down next to. With a soft giggle, the gorgeous brunette looks you up and down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you look like shit! Well, even worse than normal!\" She says tauntingly. \"Anyway, did you get our salaries swapped OK? When's it gonna happen?\" She gives you an expectant look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you tell her, you glance down at a wet patch that has started to form around your crotch. Will Michelle notice it or are you able to disguise it while you talk to her?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You finally reached the top of the mountain, and to be perfectly honest, the view was pretty damn great.<br>\r\nKing James. It has a nice ring to it. Biblical even.<br>\r\nAnd now that you finally reached the pinnacle of the mountain, nothing better to do than lean over your royal balcony and watch the legions and legions of appreciative subjects screaming their adulation and love for you. </i><br>\r\n\u201cHey buddy, I said are you gonna pay me now or am I gonna have to call the cops?\u201d<br>\r\n<i>Well, most of them anyways. </i> <br>\r\nJolted begrudgingly from your day dream, you reached into your pocket and produced your leather wallet to reward your driver. Pulling out a few dollars, you handed it to the man who greedily snatched it up and turned back towards the wheel. Not even receiving so much as a \u201cthank you,\u201d you grabbed your briefcase and exited your royal carriage, known by most peasants as a taxi cab. <br>\r\nWith your trusty brown briefcase in one hand and a foamy latte in the other, you briefly turned back to the taxi window and admired your reflection. <br>\r\nDressed in your premier apparel consisting of a brown jacket, a white buttoned shirt with black tie, khaki pants, and polished dress shoes, you were the spitting image of the \u201crags to riches\u201d success story. Now, all that\u2019s missing is a scepter. <br>\r\nBreathing in the excitement and letting your emotions breathe out, you reopened your eyes and simply marveled at your castle: the office building.<br>\r\nTowering above the urban village with its metallic glass panels and giant bold lettering, you couldn\u2019t help but break into a goofy smile as you realized that all of this now belonged to you. Figuratively speaking, of course. <br>\r\nNormally, you would flaunt your new cornucopia of wealth by showcasing your first (of many) sports car, one truly befitting that of a king. But seeing as how this was your first day as the new \u201cchief of office,\u201d a more humble and nuanced means of transportation would work more to your advantage. <br>\r\nStraightening your tie, you took a quick sip of your coffee to wet your lips for conversation before pushing open the glass doors and making your presence known. <br>\r\nInhaling deeply, the smell of fresh victory (and artificial freshener) was definitely a new yet most welcoming one. It was one that had eluded you for so very long, but now it was a smell that you hoped would greet you daily in the coming years.  <br>\r\nCarrying yourself with the professionalism and poise befitting of a king, you couldn\u2019t help but smile a bit inside as you caught the lingering glares of your passing colleagues as they saw you strut confidently past them. A platinum name tag was pinned to your left coat pocket, one that simply read: <i>Junior Manager. </i><br>\r\nIt was approximately five steps in that a new smell permeated your nostrils, one that reeked of bitterness and jealousy. It was almost refreshing to see so many of your colleagues who claimed to be the best of friends finally reveal who they really are deep down. Some gave you the cold shoulder while most didn\u2019t even have the decency to give congratulations for your promotion.<br>\r\n<i>\"Figures. They like you when you're on their level, but dare to climb up the ladder and they just want to pull you down,\"</i> you thought to yourself, brushing past a few coworkers who merely glowered at you resentfully.<br>\r\nVowing not to let their negativity take you out of your unusually uplifting mood, you decided to pay a visit to the office receptionist and rub your victory in even more. After all, nothing better than a heaping pile of public humiliation to help her eat her words, right?<br>\r\nWalking up to her natural habitat, you took another sip of the beverage before you two inevitably locked eyes and a sly smirk crossed your face.<br>\r\n<i>Candice.<br>\r\nNo doubt the co-conspirator of several smear campaigns led by the queen bitch herself to get you fired, her malevolence is matched only by her disdainful mood  She is the center of office gossip, somehow knowing about enough embarrassing incidents or humiliating nuggets from anyone\u2019s past that would put TMZ to shame.<br>\r\nThere is no doubt that you would\u2019ve been \u201cfuture-endeavored\u201d had she found out about your...secret, primarily because of who she would\u2019ve told it to: Denise. The two were determined to run you out of the office from the day you were first hired as an intern, but you stood your ground. They were practically foaming at the mouth to get some dirt on you, but you kept your record spotless. And now that the day of reckoning was finally here, well, you know what they say about payback. </i><br>\r\nIt was truly one of those rare occurrences in your career to legitimately see Candice at a loss for words, or rather trying to piece together some that won\u2019t get her suspended for professional misconduct.<br>\r\nA bitter, ugly snarl carved into her powdered face, accented only by her brown eyes staring daggers into your smug expression.<br>\r\nDespite the fact that she was a monster on the inside, she was by no means unattractive on the outside. She sported a very slender and womanly figure, with curves all in the right places. With her naturally brunette hair tied in a bun, at least two earrings clipped around each ear, and her facial features sharp enough to cut through wood, the only thing marring her face was the sheer abundance of overindulgent makeup that she had applied.<br>\r\nNeck down, she wore a white blouse complimented a light red jacket along along with a crimson pencil skirt that ended at her knees. That was the extent of her, with the receptionist table obscuring the rest of her waist-down.<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, James,\u201d she greeted curtly, without any of the trademark warmth or enthusiasm you\u2019d usually expect from a receptionist. Then again, Candice and warmth is an oxymoron in itself.<br>\r\n\u201cIt always is until I speak to you, Candice,\u201d you replied in kind, much to her visible chagrin.<br>\r\nHiding her irritation behind a few twitches in her lips, she tried resuming her work typing furiously into the computer.<br>\r\n\u201cYes well\u2026.<i>congratulations </i>on the new promotion, James,\u201d she stated with her teeth gnarling into a forced grin, barely concealing her disgust at having to utter such a blasphemous phrase. <br>\r\n\u201cActually, it\u2019s <i>Mr.</i> James now. Our clients would appreciate knowing who the man in charge is, don\u2019t you think Candice?\u201d you smiled coyly, your grin growing ever wider as her disdainful look only magnified. <br>\r\nBiting her lip for a moment, a wicked smile crossed her face as she leaned in to retort. \u201cYes but with all due respect, Mr. James I\u2019m sure that Kim will take offense to that statement. She does run the building, you know.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFor now,\u201d you shot back defensively as Candice reminded you of the natural pecking order. You were king of the castle at last, but the whole kingdom was still a work in progress.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I see you\u2019re still working hard, or hardly working. I can never tell with you,\u201d you smirked, seeking to regain control of the verbal one-upmanship while resting your elbows on the counter casually. <br>\r\n\u201cWell unlike you, Mr. James I actually take my job seriously. You won\u2019t find me trying to flaunt my new job promotion to my colleagues in some pathetic attempt to overcompensate for something that we <i>both </i>know was never there in the first place,\u201d she sneered vindictively, her lips pursed in a triumphant snicker as her last words hit you like a freight train. <br>\r\nIt definitely jolted you for a moment, but you had a rock-solid foundation that was never there in your previous encounters with Candice: job security. And now, after years of taking her crap, it was finally time to pay it forward and then some. <br>\r\n\u201cOh, you mean like how you prance around ruining other people\u2019s lives just to make yours worthwhile all while you\u2019re stuffing your pudgy little face with Weight Watchers when no one's looking because you can\u2019t handle the truth,\u201d you declared loudly, catching the attention of some passing clients and colleagues who had been eavesdropping on the conversation.<br>\r\nCandice's smile vanished off her powdered face as she felt at least a dozen eyeballs from all directions bearing down on her. Her previously smug expression was replaced with a seething scowl as she caught a few of her colleagues snickering under their breath as they passed by.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd the truth does hurt, doesn\u2019t it Candy?\u201d you smiled, taking a smug sip out of your latte as she fixed you with a downright murderous expression before regaining her composure.<br>\r\n\u201cVery\u2026.funny,\u201d she grated irritably, nearly breaking her pencil in two as her veins threatened to pop.<br>\r\n\u201cYou know I\u2019m no comedian, but you would sell out arenas if you ever picked up a mic, Candy. I mean, seeing as how your whole career here is a joke and the closest you\u2019ll ever get to real success is carrying my bags when I walk through the door you could definitely relate. Then again, I guess you and Denise finally have something in common now besides being conniving little bitches,\u201d you grinned, continuing to cut inches through her previously impenetrable skin and hurt her where it counts: her ego. <br>\r\nIn that split second, you wished you had a camera so that you could forever document the almost comical image of her passive-aggressively fuming while her face grew redder than a tomato.<br>\r\nWith her eyes bulging like eggs and her lips quivering in both anger and embarrassment, it was the ultimate comeuppance to a woman who once made you eat the same public shit and pretend to like it or else suffer the consequences.<br>\r\nAnd now, you were the consequences.<br>\r\nStraightening up your tie with a pleased and victorious smile painted all over your face, it took all of your self-control not to burst out laughing as her mascara even began to smear off.<br>\r\nWith a deep breath, you stated your actual business:</span></div></div>",

Believe me, James, you are going to do everything I want, but that will be undisputed from here on out. Am I understood?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c.....Yes,\u201d you finally forced out, speaking in a meeker voice than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, she continued on, \u201cSecondly, this stays between us. You go to anyone about this, Kim especially, and I will make you unemployed for the rest of your life. Do you understand me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to find the necessary words, you could only nod your head yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d Relaxing a little bit, she finished off her demands, \u201cLast but not least, you do whatever I say. When I say it, without question. Kapeesh?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeighing your options, you reluctantly come to a decision and uttered a meek, \u201cYes.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlowering up at her pathetically, you also sense the pure arrogance simply radiated from her gleaming expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was obvious that the shift in power from you to her was quite the overwhelming sensation, especially when juxtaposed to your last interaction together just minutes before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her, especially, it must\u2019ve been poetic to see the man who was lording his office promotion over her, now kneeling at her feet and begging to keep the same position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for you, somehow inexplicably, it was kind of a turn-on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a breath of pure triumph, Candace reached behind her head with one hand and undid her bun, allowing her raven black hair to elegantly cascade down her shoulders, as if signaling her transition from powerless secretary to powerful woman in control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her womanly locks no longer tied down by her professional bun, her usual smug smirk was even sexier!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo distracted were you by her new look that you didn\u2019t even notice her producing her iPhone from her coat jacket pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTest 1: I\u2019m going to ask you a simple question. I want you to answer it truthfully. Am I understood?\u201d she snapped at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting your lip, you reluctantly nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Question 1: Without the consent of your coworker, Denise, you went into her office and proceeded to smell her personal footwear. Am I correct?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. \u201cYes, I did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cYes, you did <i>what</i>, James?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I went inside Denise\u2019s office uninvited and smelled her shoes,\u201d you told her shamefully, an even brighter shame of crimson coloring your cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. I appreciate your honesty.\u201d Putting the phone down, the receptionist sneered down on you, \u201cI\u2019ve got to say, James, you really put yourself in quite the enviable position here. I mean, sniffing Denise\u2019s tennis shoes? What, you couldn\u2019t wait to stalk her home and jack it into one of her socks or whatever it is creeps like you indulge in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA defiant growl grew in your throat, almost begging to be unleashed, but looking up at her domineering expression, you knew that saying those very choice, four-lettered words would not bode well for your future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHell, they wouldn\u2019t even bode well for your present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI made a mistake,\u201d you admitted, eliciting an amused chuckle from the brunette woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes you did,\u201d she taunted you, now dangling her high heel with her womanly arch exposed. \u201cYou made the <i>second </i>biggest mistake of your life. Wanna guess what the first is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to your chagrin, your sexual vices once again got the best of you, causing both eyes to fixate on her quite mesmerizing balancing act with her shiny red pump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLazily yet ever so sensually bobbing her pointed shoe up and down on her toes, the secretary\u2019s narrow yet creamy arch was on full display for your oral consumption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026.Earth to dipshit? Do you copy?\u201d came Candice\u2019s slightly annoyed voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJolted back to reality, you once again cursed yourself as the receptionist scoffed at you dismissively, \u201cGod, you\u2019ve got it bad, don\u2019t you James?\u201d she scoffed at you dismissively, whipping her hair back in yet another attractive gesture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, now, with your full and undivided attention on her, she nevertheless got back on track. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, Jamesy\u2026\u201d Using the pet name that she and Denise had used mockingly to refer to you all those years, she coated her next words with a sublime layer of both spite and righteous indignation. \u201c.... the biggest mistake of your pathetic life was pissing me the hell off!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlinching inwardly as her verbal venom hit you with the force of a cobra, you instinctively averted her piercing, near incendiary gaze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd now that I have you here,\u201d she continued on, her eyes flashing at you dangerously, \u201c... on your knees like the sniveling dog you\u2019ve always been, things are gonna change! Starting of course, with how you refer to me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA clunking sound in front of you immediately demanded your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up tentatively, you instinctively honed in on her now freshly bared foot, hovering provocatively just feet away from your surprised expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same high heel that had housed such a beauty was now discarded on the carpet floor to your right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBitch or no, you had to admit it: Candice sure knew how to be a tease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBelieve it or not, I actually used to date someone with similar\u2026.let\u2019s say, proclivities as you,\u201d she revealed, smirking to herself as your completely entranced look only further confirmed her suspicions. \u201cLike you, he thought he was an alpha male. Hell, he managed to bang half the interns at my old job within the same week. Impressive, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were too busy staring at her well-proportioned, crimson painted toes to even formulate an audible response to her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll give him credit; he managed to hide his little <i>foot fetish</i> all the way to the bedroom. But, as you\u2019re about to find out, I\u2019m a pretty smart woman. I notice things in people, things that could be used against them. Denise recognized it. Even your little fangirl Jacinta knows what I\u2019m capable of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped in complete awe as she smoothly rolled her ankle, only further highlighting her well-pedicured foot from every angle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut as I was saying, I found out pretty quick why he needed to spent considerable time with my feet before his little friend could rise to the occasion. Pretty said, really. But not for me. See, James, I learned something about myself that night,\u201d she told you, forming a coy grin, \u201cI learned that if I could figure out what a man likes, what he absolutely <i>craves</i>, I could make him do whatever I want. Now I will admit to a lucky break walking in on you making an even bigger ass of yourself than normal, but I can work with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were almost too scared to ask what became of her past lover, but she quickly answered your own question aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs for Mr. Bigshot, well, let\u2019s just say he had to become quite the foot massage masseur to avoid me telling the other girls just what an utter bitch he was. Fortunately, that\u2019s just one of many roles I envision for you, Jamesy,\u201d she concluded, running her fingers up and down her shapely calf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight now, you\u2019re going to call me Mistress Candice. I <i>only </i>want to hear those two words from your mouth. If I hear anything else, I\u2019m going out that door and telling the entire office what you just told me,\u201d she smiled at you devilishly, brandishing the recording app on her phone before emphasizing, \u201cAt maximum volume.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nForced to make a choice between self-preservation and pride, you looked into her smug eyes, and somehow finding the strength inside, spoke aloud your final decision:</span></div></div>",

Give Jamesy here a chance to have a little bit of fun before he becomes my slave... <i>What the hell</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer last few words were full of even more incredulity as you snatched her phone, swiftly deleting the current and previous recording. You were somewhat an expert at this, considering you had the same phone model and been in situations before where you needed to hastily delete a video or photo...Dropping it back on the desk, jumping backwards, Candice grabbed it up, looking practically livid at what you had just done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, that's it, you ungrateful worm,\" Candice spat at you, her eyes like daggers. \"I am telling EVERYONE! <i>EVERYONE</i> about your dirty little secret!

You <i>really</i> think you have a choice in this, <i>Jamesy</i>? Ha! It doesn't matter one iota that I've got recordings or not. I <i>know</i>...I know your sick little secret. Just think - now I can end your fucking career rather than just making you my slave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are NOT telling anybody. ANYBODY about this!\" You roared at her, spittle foaming around your mouth. \"I am JUNIOR MANAGER, dammit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you are a perverted foot freak who is about to lose his job for improper conduct,\" Candice spoke more calmly, an infuriatingly smug smile on her lips. Tossing back her dark hair so that it hung sexily around her shoulders, she giggled a little. \"Ooh, there's an idea. Yes - this is even better! I'm going to end your career, THEN make you my slave anyway! Jamesy, Jamesy...\" She spoke in a mock-disappointed way. \"You <i>really</i> should have done what I told you, like the good foot bitch you are. That way you could've kept your job, your position...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoubt and indecisiveness hit you sharply around the head like a clubbing blow. The bitch was not backing down...had you just made the entire situation worse?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, you were the king. She was a mere peasant! This was just a test, a way to strengthen your inner fortitude!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing steadily and forcing a more neutral expression on your face, you shrugged your shoulders at her. She looked visibly pissed at this immediately. A small victory but a victory nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Candy, I guess it's just your word against mine. Of course, Kim is well-aware that you and Denise have had it in for me for years. This slander against my character might not....might not go down as well as you would hope,\" you spoke calmly, choosing your words carefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPractically growling at you, Candice narrowed her eyes. \"You're really threatening me?! Jamesy...just bow down...bow down at my feet and accept I've beaten you! I tell you what - just because this little act of defiance is kinda <i>cute</i> - bow down now and kiss the tops of my feet and the original deal will still be on. I won't tell Kim about your foot fetish. You'll still be my slave of course... <i>But</i>, if you don't surrender to me now, then I will make sure that I ruin your whole fucking career. I will use this against you in ways that you couldn't even imagine. Once I destroy your career, then I will force you to become my pathetic, grateful, <i>jobless</i> little slave anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more she spoke, the more confident and assured she became, as though she was sure that you would bow down before her. \"Candice I told you...\" You said slowly, your words trailing off as she put her fingers to her lips, shaking her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no more words. You choose - walk out of here and watch me ruin your career, then turn you into my slave whether you want it or not....OR, bow down now, kiss my feet...\" She spread her crimson-painted toes, causing you to gulp a little. \"THEN, you might earn yourself a bit of mercy. Come on, <i>Jamesy</i>, being a good little slave and getting in my good books is all you should be concerned about now...\"</span></div></div>",

One that was starkly different to the one that you were accustomed to! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead,\" Kim told her firmly. It dawned on you that Kim was doing exactly the right thing here, adopting the body language of a headteacher dealing with two tattle-taling children, there was no way that she was just going to punish Candice and back you fully. It also became clear to you that Candice had the wherewithal to present her case far more coherently than you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the brunette began to regale your boss with the details of you on all floors in Denise's office, you feel too stunned to even interject. She comes across as totally plausible, adding subtle details which makes it all the more convincing such as the position of your nose in the tennis shoe, the noises you were making... Wincing at the reminder of you actually kissing Candice's black heels was also cringe-worthy. Candice had twisted this part to suit her story of course - she made it out that you, in desperation for being caught, began kissing her shoes voluntarily with the intention to convince her not to tell anyone. Kim went from looking impassive to actually looking shocked by the end of Candice's account. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...well, thank you Candice...\" Kim said, her voice shaking a little as though still taken aback. \"James...James...what do you have to say for yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not true!\" You protested. \"She's...she's making it up! Honestly, you know how she and Denise want to bring me down...discredit me...they've always had it in for me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms Kim, if I may,\" Candice cut across you, still with a respectful tone of voice. \"I have never come to you with a claim about another employee being inappropriate. This is not a case of me wanting to get a colleague in trouble, not at all. Surely you can see that this man is lying? I caught him red-handed...he came to you so that he could get in his story first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't,\" you spat at the brunette, your eyes full of loathing while she tried to suppress a smirk. \"You...you've always had it in for me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see,\" Candice remarked. \"That's his only defence - that he knows we haven't been best pals before. He had his nose buried deep in Denise's tennis trainers, then he kissed my shoes as he hoped it would convince me to stay quiet. Ms Kim, like I said, this is not about vendettas - this is about this man being inappropriate AND lying to you about it now. He obviously has a problem, to be sniffing Denise's shoes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I even go into her office?\" You snapped at her. \"I didn't go near there...you can't prove...\" As soon as you uttered the words, your heart sank at Candice's triumphant expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're telling me you didn't even go into her office? Now, we all know there are no security cameras in the offices but there along the corridors...\" It must have taken the receptionist a great amount of self-control in not doing a full-on victory dance, so stupid was your mistake. <i>Dammit, this was going even worse than you imagined!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James,\" Kim said firmly, a scowl now on her face which made your heart beat faster than ever. \"James, you have one chance to 'fess up. Tell me the truth NOW. If I find out that you've been lying, then there will be serious, serious consequences. What do you have to say to me?\"</span></div></div>",

She was certainly not fond of you, in fact she hates your guts, but even you had to admit that she was kinda cute.

She hated you as well, but that's mostly from a misunderstanding due to Denise and Candice whispering lies in her ear. She'll probably give you shit at first about your offer, but maybe if you can show her a better side of you, she might warm up. Of course, you're still offering yourself up to one of your enemies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly was the queen of the bitches herself, Denise. She definitely hated you the most out of these three. But she was also certainly sexy enough to try. Plus, you feel her hatred isn't a hundred percent unjustified, given how she was fairly respectful to you when you started here, and that your were admittedly the one that started throwing punches.

Paging Mrs. Watson!\u201d<br>\r\n<i>Snap! </i>As soon as your fingers clicked together, Candice jolted out of her embarrassed stupor and re entered reality. <br>\r\nAfter waiting ever so patiently for your new office location, you decided to be a bit more direct with her.<br>\r\n\u201cW-what happened?\u201d She stammered, still at a loss of words while you still had plenty of ammunition to shoot at her.<br>\r\nDeciding not to waste your time humiliating her even more than possible, you simply repeated the question in more blunt terms.<br>\r\n\u201cMy new office. It should be logged in to the system now. The system is in that computer. You do still know how to use a computer, right?\u201d You repeated the question in an increasingly patronizing tone.<br>\r\nNarrowing her eyes at you, she bit her lip as she contemplated saying something that would not end well for her before thinking better of it.<br>\r\nTurning back to the keyboard, she entered in a rapid fire combination of keys and pulled up the employee directory on the screen.<br>\r\n\u201cRoom 45B. Second floor. Have a nice day, Mr. James,\u201d she told you curtly, before starting to turn back<br>\r\nBut you weren\u2019t done just yet.<br>\r\n\u201cYou will too, Mrs. Watson. After you do me a small little favor,\u201d you smiled, as she rolled back around begrudgingly to face you. <br>\r\n\u201cWhich is?\u201d She scowled resentfully, clearly hating where this is going. <br>\r\n\u201cThere should be about five or six clients coming in today to discuss their business with me. I need their contact information and financials on record before they leave. Also, you might\u2019ve been too busy reading <i>People </i>magazine last week to notice but I\u2019ve got a stack of reports to go just itching to be printed at the workroom and taken up to my office. Last but certainly not least, I need a new latte after this one. Whipped cream, soy milk, you know the routine. And I need all this done before noon. I got a schedule to keep. Got it?\u201d You instructed, barely concealing a smug smirk as Candice frantically scribbled her list of tasks down on the back of her hand with a Sharpie. <br>\r\n\u201cAnything else, master?\u201d She grated sarcastically, as you took another sip.<br>\r\n\u201cPut a smile on, Candy. Jeez, make people actually want to talk to you before they do and quickly regret it. But it\u2019s the thought that counts, right?\u201d You smiled, taking one last shot before pushing off the office desk and heading for the spiral staircase. <br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t honestly expect me to do all of this in three hours, do you?\u201d She called after you as you twirled around on your heel and leaned in for the punchline. <br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess you know your role now, huh?\u201d You told her simply, relishing her infuriated seething as you walked towards the spiral staircase.<br>\r\nFeeling rejuvenated with Candice finally humbled, you mentally scratched that accomplishment off your bucket list as you bounded up the stairs with a confident spring in your step. <br>\r\nReaching the second floor within seconds, you checked your watch nonchalantly as colleagues oblivious to your newfound status brushed past you without so much as an \u201cexcuse me.\u201d<br>\r\n<i>\u201cThey\u2019ll learn to respect me,\u201d</i> you thought to yourself as you squeezed past a conversation between two apparent college roommates reuniting after a life of mediocrity.<br>\r\nAs you rounded that familiar corner and reached the left wing of the floor where your new office was located, you came upon your next victim.<br>\r\n<i>Helena.<br>\r\nShe was the office janitor, and not a very good one at that. Your old office was a virtual pig\u2019s sty when she was supposedly making her rounds over there. For the longest time, you never knew why she had such a hate-on for you but in between meeting with clients one day you spotted Candice and Denise talking with her outside the ladies bathroom. Whatever lies those two idiots planted in her hollow skull must\u2019ve stayed in, because she\u2019s been shooting you daggers ever since. And today was no different. </i><br>\r\nThe brunette custodian immediately perked up from her usual sweeping duties as soon as you came around the corner. With her black hair tied in a bun and worn sneakers adorning her feet, she wore an unflattering gray janitor jumpsuit that left much, if any to be desired. Wielding a battered wooden broom with both hands, she had just finished mopping up on the floor, and to her credit it was spotless. Well, for now at least.<br>\r\n\u201cHelena! Funny seeing you up here,\u201d you exclaimed with false enthusiasm.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I do work here,\u201d she replied dryly, clearly not in the mood to be bothered.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd it hardly shows,\u201d you smiled in return, giving her a condescending thumbs-up as you surveyed her work.<br>\r\n\u201cGee thanks, James,\u201d she mumbled, before starting to return to her mopping.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it. By the way, congrats on being finally allowed to sweep the floors of the upper levels. I guess those extra sessions with Mr. Richards finally did pay off, huh? And I guess its true what they say. One small step for women, one giant leap for gold digging whores,\u201d you taunted mercilessly, watching her facial expression shrivel up in reserved fury.<br>\r\nShe was clearly contemplating wiping that arrogant grin off your face with her broom, but thought better of it. <br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you have something important to do or is \u2018sexist asshole\u2019 your new job promotion?\u201d She growled angrily. <br>\r\n\u201cLanguage Helena! Maybe you should speak a little bit more highly of your new boss,\u201d you smirked, brandishing your name tag for good measure.<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see much,\u201d she shot back, giving you a dirty look.<br>\r\nYou probably should\u2019ve let it go by this point, but your newfound power trip was a well-earned one. After years and years of taking their B.S., this was a second chance to get comeuppance on all the feminist bitches who ever tried to keep you down.<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s funny coming from you, Helen. I mean, that is some kind of irony that a janitor who probably dropped out of high school is telling the new VP in office that he doesn\u2019t amount to much, don\u2019t you think?\u201d <br>\r\nRolling her eyes visibly, she begrudgingly started to return to her usual mopping but you were having just too much fun.<br>\r\nWalking past her, you suddenly staggered forward and in a dramatic motion spilled half of your latte on the same floor tiles she had just made immaculate seconds ago.<br>\r\nFeigning surprise with the subtlety of a child actor, you gasped dramatically as the brownish liquid began seeping over the tiles while Helena was absolutely livid seething in your direction.<br>\r\nVisibly incensed at the sight of you purposelessly desecrating her life\u2019s work, she looked liable to hit you with that same broomstick. <br>\r\n\u201cOops,\u201d you shrugged nonchalantly, quickly dropping the act and sidestepping the growing brownish black puddle.<br>\r\n\u201cSo after you finish cleaning that up, I need my office spotless in about twenty minutes for my first client today. Try not to miss anything,\u201d you told her simply, before walking away as if nothing had happened.<br>\r\nIgnoring her not-so-subtle cursing behind you, you fished in your front pocket for your new key as the 45B door plate came into view.<br>\r\nLiterally at the door of opportunity, you anxiously inserted the key in and waited for the unlocking mechanism. As soon as you felt the door partially open, you pushed it open and entered your new throne room. <br>\r\nIt was everything that you hoped for and then some: a plush couch to the right, a mini-library of office textbooks and your own personal selections, a polished office desk with three chairs for clients and a manager\u2019s chair for yours truly, a water dispenser to the left, a refurbished computer, not to mention a glass window with a bird\u2019s eye view into the parking lot, not to mention plenty of walking room in between.<br>\r\nAfter years in the making, it was finally official: you had arrived.<br>\r\nCircling around the office desk, you almost openly shed a few tears as your dreams and aspirations finally materialized in the polished wood that you could now run your fingers along. For years you had been told by those feminazi bimbos that you would never reach this pedestal of higher authority, that you didn\u2019t have the testicular fortitude to even try. And now, you did what those morons said you couldn\u2019t, and it felt damn good.<br>\r\nPractically collapsing into the manager\u2019s chair, you heaved a sigh of relief as you dissolved into the hospitable cushion with not a worry in the world. <br>\r\nStaring up at the ceiling fan rotating moderately on its axis, you couldn\u2019t help but let a goofy grin escape your lips as the spinning blades send a refreshing breeze down to greet you. <br>\r\nPlacing your latte on a drink coaster, you stretched your fingers expertly before pressing the power button on the monitor and booting the computer system up.<br>\r\nAs the screen pulled up, you entered in your username and password before reaching in your pocket and producing a small flash drive, a little bit of an \u201cearly birthday present\u201d for yours truly.<br>\r\nPlugging it into the monitor as the home screen materialized, you tapped your fingers patiently on the office desk before the files on the drive commenced its downloading. <br>\r\nGlaring at the multitude of books that adorned your shelves, then at a giant framed portrait of some abstract Picasso painting, you were finally at peace with your work environment.<br>\r\nNo putrid smell emitting from the trashcan that Helena \u201cforgot\u201d to take out, no more jealous coworkers trying to leech off your success, no more bad luck.<br>\r\nNow and forever, it was smooth sailing through an ocean of well-earned rest and relaxation.<br>\r\nAnd nothing could change that.  <br>\r\n<i>Knock Knock!</i><br>\r\nJust as the files finished downloading, a set of knuckles gently banged against your door.<br>\r\n\u201cCome in,\u201d you called, checking your watch to see if the first client had arrived. Not yet that time, you shrugged as the knob turned and the door opened, revealing:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hi it's me...er I mean, it's me - Jacinta!\" The reasonably attractive woman gushed, almost tripping over her own feet as she made her way towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried not to smirk. Of course, <i>Jacinta</i>. Not the first time that she has babbled around you; it was no secret in the office that good ol' Jaci had long harboured a crush on you. The closest she had ever got to finding the courage to actually ask you out was a few months or so ago - and even that was a pathetic effort! You remembered trying not to laugh in your face as she rambled incoherently on about this new sushi bar in town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving her a flash of your pearly whites, you beckoned her over to a chair opposite you. Checking the time on your Fitbit - it was important to keep in good shape working at an office after all - you stared at her expectantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what is it?\" You tried to say without too much impatience. \"Like the new office?\" You couldn't resist adding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh James, it's...it's incredible!\" She fawned at you, boosting your ego even more. As if you needed that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she was harmless. She was beneath you - <i>well beneath you</i>. On the hotness scale, she was actually OK - at least a seven out of ten. Yet she did not interest you in the slightest; she was no challenge, had no swagger of sexiness about her. She would be a far too easy lay that would, if anything, tarnish your reputation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leaned back and let out a sigh, one you tried to mask with contentment rather than the growing exasperation you were feeling for this hopeless woman. \"Yeah, it's pretty great, right? Hey, it's not every day you become <i>Junior Manager</i>...\" Allowing those last words to permeate around the room, you noticed Jacinta blush and shyly chew her lip. \"Seriously, Jaci. What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacinta let out a nervous giggle before crossing her legs to compose herself. \"I, er. Well, Mister James, I'm your new secretary!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppreciating her deference to you without even needing the instruction - <i>Mister James</i> had a nice ring to it after all - you smirked. \"Oh, so that's why your knickers are in such a twist. I don't blame you honey - I'd be getting equally excited if I got to serve me too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing a deep scarlet, Jacinta averted her eyes from you and stared at the ground. \"Yes, well...yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Jeez the things you can get away with when you hold power over a woman AND that you know she has a crush on you!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well congratulations. I've got a LOT of work that I need to delegate to you...\" You grinned for a moment, remembering the list of tasks you set Candice, knowing that she'd be scrambling around to complete them. \"Pen and paper...\" You clicked your fingers at her before motioning in a writing fashion for her to snap to attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrambling up, breathing heavily and fetching a writing pad and a biro, Jacinta stood in front of you while you leaned back and put both feet up casually on your impressive new desk. \"Right, first thing's first. I want you to keep an eye on Denise and Candice for me - those two bitch monsters of death. Oh, you'll need to chase up that latte Candy needed to make for me. Next, you're gonna need your own desk in here. Nothing fancy and nothing in direct eyeline of me - no offence. Oh, another thing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacinta dutifully scribbled down your demands, not showing any sign of complaint whatsoever. <i>This was almost too easy, you mused. With Denise, Candice and even that idiot janitor, Helena, there was some banter, some back-and-forth. Jeez, this dork was no challenge to dominate.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything else, Mister James?\" Jacinta said, her eyes wide open and a certain eagerness to please about her that you made you feel both appreciative yet even less respectful of her at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah there was one more thing...\" You put on a faux-nervous look. \"Would you, er, would you...like to go for a drink with me later?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacinta dropped the pen and pad, letting out a couple of frustrated expletives, before jumping back to her feet, a look of bewilderment on her face. \"W-what?! A drink...with me...?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou maintained the sweet, charming expression before throwing back your head and roaring with laughter \"NO! You stupid klutz! You're my <i>secretary</i>. Why in the name of all is good and holy would I want to socialise with <i>you</i>?!\" Wiping away a tear of laughter, you sent her away with a flick of your hand, trying not to snigger with the look on her face that ranged from horrified to outraged. \"Now, go on - start with finding out where my latte from that idiot Candice has got to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jacinta ambled away, probably still in shock, you felt a pang of guilt. You had never been rude to her before, not like that. Did having this new power make you get high on making others miserable? Perhaps you had gone too far. You watched Jacinta's heels click away...it wouldn't be too late to call her back, apologise and start afresh with the blonde woman; you are going to be working with her every day in the same office after all...</span></div></div>",

Of course - your one weakness, your one <i>achilles heel...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom ever since you can remember, you've had a foot fetish. Growing up, you always found women's feet attractive, whether it was Miss Madison, your Math teacher who would sometimes accidentally drop her heels to the ground, or your high school crush, Michelle, who once in gym class actually planted both bare soles over your face, during a 'self-defence' lesson. You realised as a teenager that you were never going to get girls by being a meek, mild little footlicker. No, you started working out, joined the football team, started dating cheerleaders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had convinced yourself back a good decade or so ago, that you did not <i>need</i> feet. True, you had needed to picture Michelle's, Miss Madison or another hot woman's bare feet while fucking a woman, but that was harmless in itself. You were not indulging in your foot fetish. Was it even a foot fetish, if you had never allowed yourself to sniff, kiss and lick feet like all of those others foot losers did? You'd even made a concerted effort to avoid any foot porn online, instead jerking off to women's breasts, asses...you know, the stuff that 'real' men got turned on by...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up and pacing around the room, not only to get in some steps during your day at the office but to shake away all of these unwanted thoughts, you let out a sigh before smiling to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You were the king....the king bows down to no-one!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough a combination of relentless hard work, politicking, schmoozing with all of the right people and not allowing for a second your weakness to stray into the work zone, you have been promoted faster than any person in this office's history. You've surpassed the likes of Denise and now she will be bowing to you, as will everyone in this office! One day even Kim - the big boss - will bow down to you! Practising a breathing technique you've learned from your karate classes, you felt immediately more relaxed and at peace as you strolled back over to your desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacinta reappeared, looking cowed and avoiding eye contact. \"Mister James, I...I told Candice...she's bringing the latte in to you...in a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, good,\" you said casually. Deciding not to berate your new secretary any further, you instead talked her through some of the filing systems until Candice arrived in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, here he is the Lord Commander of the world,\" Candice snorted as she walked towards you, styrofoam beverage in hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a good girl, delivering your superior a nourishing caffeine injection,\" you retorted, grinning at her patronisingly. \"Remember the soy milk, the whipped cream?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandice shrugged before turning to Jacinta. \"You actually want to work for this guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, he's...he's a...great boss...\" the blonde replied, standing to the side of Candice, keeping her eyes fixed away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, excuse me...are you as stupid as you look?\" You spoke sharply, knowing that you had to dominate Candice quickly before she could sniff a chance at gaining the upper hand. \"I asked you a question - soy milk, the cream - you get it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanding you the cup, the brunette receptionist adjusted her glasses before shooting you a dirty look. \"Oh, of course I did...Mister James...I would never dare to question you or accidentally spit in your drink...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your blood boil as you took off the lid and inspected the contents. It was pretty much impossible to tell - with the foam from the soya and the the cream, the bubbles and froth could well have included some of Candice's disgusting saliva...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think I - a lowly, humble receptionist would DARE to do such a thing to a powerful, dominant man like you?! Oh, <i>Mister James</i>, you should really stop doubting yourself and just accept that you've put me in my place now and completely subservient to you...just like good ol' Jaci here...\" Candice gave your secretary a sickly-sweet smile before turning back at you, her nose turned up in a definite sneer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She's fucking with you but how do you deal with this?</i> Knowing that hesitating would only make you look weak, in front of both women, you fixed Candice with a sneer of your own, raising the latte up in the air....</span></div></div>",

At the last second, you dramatically lurched forward, crying out in surprise as the cup of coffee slipped from your hands - directly forward onto Candice....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck...FUCK!\" Screamed the brunette receptionist as she staggered backward, her face a picture of abject pain. Jacinta stood transfixed on the spot, giving you a look as if wandering out loud if this were on purpose...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't just stand there Jacinta, get some help! I'll take care of Candice - you get Helena to fix this mess!\" Jacinta nods hurriedly before scampering out of the room at once. You tried to disguise your grin at the thought of Helena having to clear up <i>more mess</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-James! My skirt...my top...my <i>new shoes</i>....!\" Candice wailed, wincing at the feeling of scalding hot coffee soaking through her clothes. \"Why did you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was an accident,\" you replied loudly and firmly. Walking around your desk, you grabbed her by the arm and leaned in close, making her eyes widen with fright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As far as everyone else around here is concerned, it was an accident. Got it? Only you and I will know that you deserved this, that you dared to threaten me with your disgusting spit in my drink,\" you seethed at her, tightening your grip so you actually feel some of the latte on your fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you're...sick!\" Candice blurted out, her teeth chattering now as she tried in vain to wriggle away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen to me, you little bitch. If you do ANYTHING to defy me, ever again, then I'll do a lot worse than this. A LOT worse! I could end your career, you piece of crap. I've got the power, I've got the authority to make your life hell. Is that what you really want?\" You sneered down at her, revelling in how much this woman who was once a nemesis of yours was quickly turning into an afterthought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips quivering, she blinked back a few tears. \"I, I'll t-tell...Denise...K-Kim...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell your pathetic little friend whatever you want,\" you spat at her. \"And as for Kim - if you seriously think she's gonna take the word of a slutty, cretinous receptionist over the man who she has publicly praised to high heaven...with not a single witness...! Good luck, you fucking idiot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J...Jacinta...she saw...\" Candice murmured weakly, now clearly clutching at straws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jacinta works for me!\" You scoffed. \"She is devoted to me in ways that you will never understand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing footsteps approach, you quickly changed your posture to one of a caring, solicitous person. \"So, do you think you'll be OK?\" You feigned an anxious tone. \"You should really go home, get changed and come back in an hour or so. Have a nice hot bath, that will help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the corner of your eye, you watched like a hawk the figures of Jacinta and Helena. The Hispanic janitor stood with her hands on her hips, a suspicious look on her face as she studied you and the brunette. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell happened?\" She grunted, causing you to avert your seemingly innocent gaze to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting on a puzzled expression, you turned to Jacinta. \"Jaci - didn't you tell her what happened? That I accidentally tripped and spilt my drink on Candice? It's this new shiny floor, you see. Too clean for it's own good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena raised an eyebrow and turned to the blonde woman. \"Really, that's what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacinta nodded quietly, which you subtly winked at her for in appreciation, unbeknownst to the janitor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you, you ok Miss Candice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSobbing and shaking, the brunette turned away from you, avoiding your gaze and shuffled awkwardly forward. \"Yeah...that's what...happened...\" She told no-one in particular, keeping her eyes on the ground as she left you office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart was singing a victory song like no other! Almost tempted to high-five Jacinta, you quickly resisted the urge and gave Helena a smug look. \"Ah, well. These things happen. Oopsie - twice in a day I've given you some extra work. Good job that you're such a pro, I guess! Anyway, you were supposed to be here by now anyway,\" You frowned for a moment as you studied your watch. \"Yeah, I told you to make my office spotless, didn't I janitor lady? Right, I'll leave you to it - I feel like getting my OWN coffee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Latina woman stood, her hands still on her hips, and a look of pure hatred adorning her hard yet pretty figures. \"Go to hell, gringo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" You nearly spluttered, incredulous at this lowly janitor's gall. \"Did you just a) refuse your boss's orders and b) use a racial slur against me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not my boss,\" she clicked her tongue at you. \"I only answer to boss lady Kim, not a white boy loser like you.\" Before you could even retort, the janitor turned on her heel and abruptly marched away, her crocs thudding against your shiny new wooden flooring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mister James...that was really an accident...right?\" Jacinta's voice snapped you out of your silent, furious trance. How dare that fucking janitor walk away from you....she needed to be put in her place!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to her impatiently you gave her a brief smile. \"Course it was. You saw what happened. Accidents happen - you heard it from Candice's own horsey mouth yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacinta nodded fervently; it was clear that she was so intimidated by you that it would take very little convincing to keep her as your dutiful little pet.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Funnily enough, of all the women to intimidate you in the office, Helena would not be the most obvious thought. The idea of going after her, getting into another verbal spat didn't really appeal. She was so stubborn, so proud - for a cleaner of all roles! Sighing with frustration, you settled for plan b - good ol' Jaci...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jacinta, you can clean my office,\" you told her with authority. \"I want it ship-shape, sparkly and clean. Got it?\" You fixed her with a look, which was becoming all so natural now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, you thought the cute blonde might protest. \"Yes, Mister James, no problem. No problem at all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied that you had Jacinta exactly where you wanted her, you gave her a grin before strolling out of your own office, trying your best to ignore the fact that Helena had got one over on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading straight to the coffee machine, you watched gleefully out of the window as the queen bitch herself, Denise was helping Candice into a cab, a look of both anger and concern on her admittedly attractive face. For a second, your stomach lurched. What if you hadn't sufficiently browbeaten Candice enough? What if Denise attempted to get some revenge on you. Shaking the thought away, you collected your coffee and took a leisurely stroll around the workspace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So many deadbeats, so much deadwood. </i> You blanked a guy called Jeff who had once been an equal of yours, trying to greet you. An idea popped into your mind, time to see Jenny!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny was the only person remotely close to being called a friend at work. She started after you and perhaps it was in spite of Denise and Candice that you took a liking to her. The redhead was straight-talking but totally apolitical - quite different to you in that regard! She was sweet, kind and always totally supportive of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, <i>Mister James</i>...\" She smiled at you, her blue eyes sparkling. \"Did you hear what happened to Candice?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething else that you and Jenny shared was a mutual hatred for the bitchy brunette. They worked at different desks but had plenty of opportunities to clash and bicker during the day. Initially, when she started at the office, Denise and Candice tried to make her life hell. They made fun of her dress sense and tried to boss her around. That was not the <i>only</i> reason you befriended her but it did admittedly give you a reason to bond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I heard that too...\" You grinned, checking your fitbit counter. \"Oh, nearly a thousand steps already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...!\" She giggled. \"Don't be all coy. What do you know?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second you very nearly confide in her, but this was something you wanted NO-ONE to know! \"I wish I did...I saw Denise helping her into a cab just now - I nearly died laughing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarrowing her eyes at you, she shrugged. \"Hmmm, there's something you're not telling me. I'll get it out of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooo, any word from my client - Stephanie?\" You replied, quickly changing the subject. \"First meeting in my new office...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you if you tell me...\" Jenny allowed a giggle to escape her lips again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealising that this wasn't going anywhere, you sighed but not with too much frustration. Regarding the redhead with fondness, you did appreciate her friendship - it was the only time during the day when you could interact with someone without belittling them if they were a rival or below you, or brownnose if a superior you wanted to gain favour with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny, always a pleasure,\" you smiled, doffing an imaginary cap to her as she cheerily waved you goodbye. Leaving her to her work, you strolled away, sipping on your coffee. The most you give to the worker drones is a mere nod of the head when they tried to greet you. Funny how now, the people who at one point you were on the same level as you, were so far below you; a warm, comforting thought!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on an office chair, swivelling nonchalantly from side to side is a girl you don't recognise. Very cute, brunette and...barefoot...you can't help but gaze at her, your eyes shifting downwards to one foot idly dangling off the edge of the seat, the other resting on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you?\" Her bratty voice rang across the room at you, an intrigued look on her face. FUCK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt reminded you of girls at school who were too hot to date and would regard you as someone inferior. It made you compelled to reply, rather than just casually nod at her like you did to the other worker ants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm James - <i>Junior Manager</i>,\" you added, feeling some of your pride and pomposity return as you walked towards her. \"And who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michelle,\" she replied disinterestedly, not even reacting to your title. \"I've been waiting for, like, ages here. Could you go and get the boss, or whoever for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second you thought that she could be Stephanie Beachwood, which was a ridiculous thought considering her age. This girl was in her early twenties, if that. Plus the name, <i>Michelle</i>, you immediately thought back to your crush at high school. Just a coincidence - Michelle would be older than her anyway!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, what's up with you?\" Michelle rolled her eyes. \"I asked you a question and you totally didn't react. What are you, retarded?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken aback by her brattiness and gall, you took a moment to compose yourself. \"Look, Michelle, you obviously don't know your place around here. So I'll give you a pass for that. Let me make this clear to you - you're nothing. You're <i>pond scum</i>...at the bottom of the totem pole.\" Your expression turning into a full smirk, you felt glad to be taking this newbie down a step or two. \"What are you, a new assistant? Coffee fetcher?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Intern, actually,\" she retorted, her expression not changing as though unimpressed with your banter. \"Now, Jim...John...whatever,\" she gave a casual wave of her hand. \"Either get me the boss or get the hell out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little shit! You actually allowed yourself to chuckle for a moment, staring at her. Yes she was beautiful but this intern was FAR too cocky for her own good. Who the hell did she think she was?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Earth to Jim....!\" She clicked her fingers at you, her nose turned up in a sneer. \"You're doing that thing again - y'know where you, like, have nothing interesting or clever to say....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling yourself both intrigued by and despising this smug bitch, you narrowed your eyes at her. For the first time since you could remember, a new member of the office had left you lost for words and was proving impossible to verbally spar with - even more frustrating than Helena!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWords seemed muddled and hard to access; the longer you just stood here, the more embarrassing getting owned by this intern was! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle rolled her eyes again, a victorious look on her face. \"Man, you seriously are totally retarded!\" She giggled. \"I may be at the bottom of this, like, 'totem-pole', but I'm gonna step my way up - and I don't care if that means walking all over losers like you to get there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiggling her bare toes, you gulped. She couldn't possibly know about your fetish! Yet, if you didn't react now, it woul  start getting suspicious with you just staring at this intern while she verbally berated you! Words still not forming, you started to walk away.... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Bye, Jim!\" Michelle's bratty voice was full of smugness as it rang out across the corridor you were walking down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The little bitch...how dare she...remember the breathing exercises!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen getting a little further away, you actually stopped, bending down a little and wincing with the pain you could feel in your gut. What was that - anger, fear, anxiety, <i>guilt</i>? But why would you be guilty? Calming yourself down enough to think more logically, you could not avoid accepting some simple facts. Michelle was very attractive, she was barefoot, she had beautiful feet and - worst of all - she just OWNED you in a verbal confrontation!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResuming your trudge back to your office, you were still practically seething with rage as you headed straight to your desk, ignoring Jacinta who was subtly clearing her throat to get your attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all done, Mister James...what do you th-think?\" She stood in front of you, her eyes shy yet hopeful as you looked up irritably to meet her gaze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...good job...\" You murmured, distracted and pretty much oblivious to the fact that your new secretary and actually made a herculean effort to make the entire office new and practically sparkling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...er...anything else, Mister James?\" She stood awkwardly, biting her lip, a look of slight concern on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaving your hand dismissively, you sent her away to check on where Stephanie Beachwood had got to - surely her arrival must've been imminent after all. Trying and failing to get the image of Michelle's pretty toes, wiggling out of your mind, you resumed your karate breathing exercises from before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>...I'm gonna step my way up...I don't care if that means walking over losers like you...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brat's words echoing inside your head, you suddenly thought of something. A devious smile, flashing across your face, you excitedly jumped up when Jacinta re-entered the room, babbling on about Stephanie not having arrived yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah,\" you promptly cut her off. \"Anyway, I've got a different task for you - an assignment if you will. I know that you'll ace it for me, won't you Jacinta?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, y-yes Mister James!\" Jacinta practically cried out in response, her eyes wide and eager all at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, there's this new girl - some intern called Michelle - that I want you to keep an eye on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvoiding any details about her feet or the fact that she got one over on you just now obviously, you instructed your secretary to keep an eye on her, find out anything that she could - any details that would give you some leverage on her. Jacinta seemed a bit uncertain about it but still readily agreed. She was your loyal little pet after all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling better about things, now that you had some sort out plan to deal with this annoyingly hot, barefoot brat, you nailed the meeting with Stephanie. She was clearly impressed with you and seemed set to make a much larger order than even you would have anticipated. Not having another appointment or meeting until the afternoon, you stretched out your legs, sighed contentedly as you sipped on the fresh new latte that Jacinta just bought you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh...well this has been a very successful morning, wouldn't you say Jacinta? You know, things are gonna work out well for you - just keep up this level of dedication and remember to get me some information on that stupid new intern...It'll be all good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mister James,\" Jacinta nodded and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna go and stretch my legs a little. Get some more steps in...\" Cheerily waving a goodbye, you headed out of the office and decided to head towards Jenny at the main reception to fill her in on your successful meeting with Stephanie. Again, you looked through people and barely acknowledged them as you strolled past. <i>You were the king and they were mere peasants beneath you now!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approached Jenny, you saw a familiar and, admittedly, hot figure of Denise hovering around. Denise was your absolute nemesis; you truly despised one another! Starting at the company at a similar time, you were both very highly regarded and two of the strongest performers in the entire office. She had always hated and resented how good you were at your job. Yet look at what happened - you got the promotion and she didn't! You won - she lost! A smirk on your face, you began triumphantly sauntering over to her, only to remember the incident with Candice earlier and the look on Denise's face as she was helping her friend into a cab. Was it worth stirring things up, risking Denise making accusations about you deliberately spilling coffee on the brunette in front of people?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the corner of your eye, you spotted Michelle again. Feeling so buoyed up from your meeting, did you decide that you had the nerve to take her on again in a verbal spat? Or was that asking for trouble?</span></div></div>",

Risking to go to her right now would end up detrimental for you, if you were to lose another verbal sparring, especially in public with your enemies present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs such you headed towards Jenny at reception, even though Denise was there! From what you could see they were discussing how unfortunate it was for Candice to have her new outfit and shoes soaked unexpectedly. Jenny spotted you moving to the reception and waved, as a devilish smile was starting to form as she was well aware you knew what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James! It's nice seeing you, we were just discussing how unfortunate it was for Candice to have her clothes drenched like that.\" - Jenny, of course, was playing a role, as she also harboured hatred for Candice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, poor Candice had her dress ruined, it is a shame really, hope that doesn't interfere with her entire workday.\" - You, faked out a sympathetic smile as you knew full well, that her dress was in its present state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since when did you become so considerate of other people's feelings, James? From what I recall you hate Candice's guts and are, in my book, you spilt that coffee on purpose, rather than to have just tripped. \" - Denise's words came off rather sharp, as her face was one of resentment. However, how did she dare to talk to you, the king of the place, like that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Denise! It's nice to see that you are doing well, although, could you please tell me where is your alibi that I have spilt the coffee on purpose? All I was trying to say is that I hope that Candice quickly recovers so that the accident doesn't sabotage the rest of her workday.\" - You had already predicted that you would be accused. Candice had likely spilt the beans on you or has at least said the version you agreed upon in your office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jamesy, you could fool someone else with that. I don't care, what your version of things is, when I find out the truth, you will be begging at my feet and whimper.\" - Denise answered with a smug, as she was not scared by your attempt to scare her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body felt numb for a moment, as you imagined being at Denise's feet and admiring how better she was, than you. Despite that, you quickly got back to your senses and responded with a witty remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so Deni? Well, good luck with that. In the meanwhile, I hope you don't mind going to run the errands I left for you, I want them done by the end of the shift.\" - Waving your hand dismissively and pointing to her office as it was towered with documents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, you, you don't expect me to be done by the end of the shift with all of that, right?!\" - Denise answered angrily as her hands had already formed fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I am! You are an excellent employee and you wouldn't complain to that workload, right? Or would you want a compromise on your monthly wage?\" - You took one final glance at her and refocused your attention on Kim. Denise was not satisfied. Not one bit. She quickly headed back to her office, cursing you under her breath. You had succeeded in pissing not only Candice but Denise as well, which meant two even worse enemies trying to dethrone you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it that your meeting with Stephanie went well.\" - Kim remarked after Denise was out of sight. \"Either that or you are on fire. Because you burnt Denise alive! - Kim added, to boost your already big ego further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I say, it is definitely good to finally get back at her after all of the years I had to put up with her.\" - You boast as you were amused at how well this, at first glance, bad situation seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there was something that bothered you. You enjoyed how Denise had told you that she would make you whimper at her feet, it made you feel vulnerable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it wouldn't be that bad to give it a shot, right? Maybe check on how she was doing with her work at the end of the shift?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe you should check up with Jacinta. To see what she has gotten on Michelle so that she doesn't get the upper hand on you, this time in public.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You\u2019re a very attractive woman, Demise. And maybe, just maybe, if you weren\u2019t such an unlikable person, someone might actually take pity on you and ask you out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScoffing, she replied scathingly, \u201cCute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVisibly relishing her absolutely delicious bitterness, you nonetheless got back on track. \u201cSo...did you do everything I instructed you to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled her eyes. \u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes <i>what</i>?\u201d you prompted her teasingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost forcing the next words out of her mouth, she grated at you, \u201cYes, I did everything you asked of me, James.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d Satisfied with her response for now, you brushed past her and entered into the blonde woman's office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs promised, the mountain of documents and unfinished paperwork was now neatly organized inside a cardboard box on the middle of her desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring her practically sneering at you from behind, your eyes then took a curious detour around her office space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn many ways, it reminded you of your old office, before you became the true king of the office kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe size was pretty similar, except with the addition of a few office chairs here and there. She also had a more recent desktop computer, and a vanity shelf full of her various accolades, college diploma, and many <i>Employee of the Month</i> plagues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had everything\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cExcept my job,\u201d</i> you couldn\u2019t help but smirk to yourself, walking around the desk as she continued watching you with utter disdain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn case you were daydreaming back there, I did what you asked. Now, take your shit and get the hell out of my-\u201d Before Denise could finish her sentence, you casually plopped down on her plush office chair and proceeded to put both feet up on her desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mouth briefly dropped as you reclined back, before a look of pure indignation washed over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026.excuse me?!\u201d she snarled at you, barely able to restrain herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, my apologies.\u201d Removing your shoes from the polished wood, you gestured at a nearby chair. \u201cYou can have a seat.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWords alone could not describe the anger and outrage that dominated her facial features at this moment, her raw emotions threatening to come out in a flurry of very choice words from her mouth at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as expected, the blonde reluctantly calmed herself down, and after a deep and somewhat calming breath, sat down on a chair usually reserved for customers and visitors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI gotta say, Deni, you really have a good eye for office furniture. After such a long and hard day as Junior Manager, this cushion is really doing wonders for my back,\u201d you tease her, exaggerating a yawn much to her chagrin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips curled into a venomous sneer as she forcibly formed the words, \u201cIf you say so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll kidding aside, I really appreciate you doing this for me, Denise. Shows a lot from you, that after all we\u2019ve been through here, you\u2019re still a team player,\u201d you complimented her patronizingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said nothing in response, a rarity from the usually outspoken blonde. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve been thinking all day about this...\u201d Resting your elbows on her desk, you absolutely relished the barely concealed rage on her face, her better judgment working overtime to prevent her from doing or saying anything stupid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, stupider than usual, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnclipping your platinum name tag, you told her candidly, \u201cYou and I really did go to war for this, didn\u2019t we? All those years\u2026.you and Candace did your damnedest to keep me down. You used every dirty trick in the book, took every low blow you could.

If anything, your little schemes actually backfired, because it made me want this-\u201d Brandishing your nametag proudly above the desk for emphasis, you then continued on, \u201c- even more. After everything, it just made me hungrier. More cutthroat. More ambitious. I became the best possible version of myself, really, and eventually, even the higher-ups recognized it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could almost hear her grinding her teeth together angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful for all that,\u201d you finally came around to saying, your moment of self-reflection now complete. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing full well just how much it pissed her off to no end, you then delivered the <i>coup de grace</i>, \u201cDenise, thank you for helping to make me the new Junior Manager.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClenching her fists together against her skirt, Denise\u2019s quite visible indignation was quickly offset by her shifting to a more ladylike position, crossing one shapely leg over the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Stopping yourself before you could get anymore sentimental, you then cocked a sly grin, \u201cJust because I appreciate all you\u2019ve done, doesn\u2019t mean I forgot exactly what you two did to me all those years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Time for the kill shot.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning forward, you proceeded to deliver something that would be near fatal to someone with an ego like Denise\u2019s. \u201cWe\u2019re professionals, and as such, I am more than willing to leave all that baggage in the past. But, to do so, I need you to apologize to me, right here and now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d she nearly screamed out, nearly losing her composure at this demeaning request. \u201cFirst you pull that coffee shit with Candace, now this! Oh James, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re trying to compensate for something with that little nametag of yours, but-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk to your boss like that!\u201d you cut her off sternly, no longer smiling. \u201cI\u2019m giving you one chance, <i>only </i>one, to not end up on my permanent shitlist. Look, I\u2019ll make it right with Candace\u2026.eventually, but right now, this is about us. This is about us burying the hatchet, and moving the hell on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, I want you to\u2026.\u201d Out of the corner of your eye, you couldn\u2019t help but notice her now dangling her high heel, granting a fleeting glimpse at her soft, feminine arch before it was clothed once again by the leather. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ankle rolling reflexively, she popped her heel out and began dangling yet again, the impatient bobbing up and down reflective of her equally annoyed body language. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp and down, up and-<i>snap out of it, James!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding your mental footing and steering clear of her distracting imagery, you delivered the ultimatum again with noticeably less gusto behind it, \u201c....I want you to apologize.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious,\u201d she snorted dismissively, pointing out, \u201cWhat about Candice\u2019s apology for spilling your Mocha shit all over her clothes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll apologize to Candice when you apologize to me,\u201d you told her firmly, determined to humble this woman even if you have to...even if you have to\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow losing your train of thought, your eyes once again were drawn to the sheer magnetic pull of her expert shoeplay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn, she really knows what she's doi-fuck!<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nSnapping your head up before fully losing yourself in her womanly arch, you couldn't help but notice a curious glint in Denise's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, panic flooded your own as you thought to yourself frantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Does she know? </i></span></div></div>",

Sadly, you weren't there for her, rather, you were looking for some dirt or information regarding the confident intern which brushed you off so easily earlier. Who was she? She couldn't be this confident without any reason, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't get in your position by going with irrational decisions, you knew that preparing and weighing the pros and cons of an action is what pulled you ahead of Denise, that's why you were now the King, while she, she had a pile of work waiting for her as your thoughts crossed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Jaci, did you find anything on our new intern Michelle?\" You said as you put your legs on top of your desk and smiled back at Jacinta, as to catch her off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um..y-yes Mister James!\" Jacinta's face slowly turned pinkish red as she looked down the files she managed to muster during the time you had your meeting and time it took to put Denise in her place. \"She is actually quite the prospect! It seems she had a 5.0 GPA as she took all the possible extracurricular as well as acing bot the SAT 1 and SAT 2!\" Even as she read it, Jacinta's expression was one of surprise. Not even Kim herself had gotten a GPA of 5.0 nor did she have a SAT of that calibre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jacinta, did I hear you right?!\" You lost balance for a couple of seconds on your desk as you assumed a seated figure four to regain balance. You were in awe! What was she doing here? Your firm was indeed a prestige one, but there must be something else behind her internship here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Mister James, I have good news!\" Jacinta smiled as she hovered over the other page as she had taken her time to research all of the other people in her graduation year. \"By the words of the teachers, she wasn't always present to classes and when she was, she did not listen to anything that was said to her. What is more interesting...\" - Jacinta flickered to the next page as she placed crossed her legs with her right foot wiggling at you, wearing high heels. You lost track of what she was talking about as you focused on her feet, imagining how nice it would be to have them get close to your face, maybe even lick them, your secretary wouldn't mind, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mister James?\" - Jacinta's tone changed as she started to question if you were still listening to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes! Sorry about that Jaci, I am a bit tired from today, I barely got any sleep to prepare for Stephanie.\" - Slowly coming to your senses, you realized that your eyes had wandered to somewhere they shouldn't have. The good part was that Jacinta didn't catch on to your fetish. \" Could you please repeat what you were saying?\" - You put your head below your hands, as you fixated your gaze to Jacinta's eyes and listened to her carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-as I was sa-saying...\" Jacinta blushed more than she previously had as it was her dream to have you pay her your full attention. \"What is more interesting is, the people that usually had the highest GPA in all of the subjects in her class as well as the ones that took the extracurricular she did, had a massive dip of performance when tests came. What is even more interesting is she always sat next to them when it was examination time, but, had never previously gotten to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh? Did you find the secret to it? It was not hard to realize what the possible situation was, however, you had to ponder over it a bit more before deciding on how to proceed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite that, your secretary Jacinta had done an amazing job! You should at least help her out with a raise... or maybe, take her out on the date she has wanted every since you two met eyes in your small cubicles?</span></div></div>",

That's right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jaci, please tell miss Michelle to come to see me after an hour.\" You put off your cigar and started looking at the report that Jacinta prepared for you previously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Mister James! What do I tell her you are calling her for?\" Jacinta was slowly writing into her notebook as a bit of annoyance could be tracked in her voice, as well as the constant tapping on the floor for nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell her, that Kim said it was best for her to be taught by the best man the firm has to offer so she could quickly progress ahead\" Your confidence was still there, your boasting abilities about your skills as well. Both you and Jacinta knew that Kim wouldn't tell an intern to be taught by a Junior Manager like you, she would better put someone like Denise to teach her. Jacinta didn't say a word about it, however, her reply showcased how she felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Mister James... I will..\" Sadness could be picked from Jacinta's voice as she was aware, your intentions were far more than just teaching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the time you had, you dug for all kind of information you could find about Michelle, needless to say, you found it. You weren't Junior Manager for nothing, your abilities to search what was needed were a level above the others in the firm. \"Michelle B...\" SHE WAS YOUR BIGGEST PARTNER'S DAUGHTER? For a moment you were a bit surprised, however, that would totally make sense, considering her scores from university and her SAT results. It also turned out that she had blackmailed all of the highest scorers to assist her, as you quickly compared the publicly available handwritten exams to how she had written her signing documents. It was a wild guess, but you trusted your guts, that's how you always got the best deals so far during your working career.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you re-examined the papers you slowly relaxed into your chair and continued to meditate from what you have learned from your Karate classes. If she really did blackmail the people there, it wouldn't be impossible for her to try the same here. You really wish you hadn't asked her to come, however, it was too late to call it off, there were 10 minutes remaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Jim, to what do I owe the pleasure of seeing a loser like you twice in one day?\" Those were Michelle's first words as she entered your office, slowly taking her spot opposing to you, taking off her sneakers, leaving her barefoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot looking at her feet was a difficult task, however, thanks to your exercises you were able to hold off looking at them. \"Michelle, I would like to apologise for my earlier comments. I looked into your records and I saw your results, you are a protegee that the firm is happy to have!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPathetic, pathetic, pathetic, pathetic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy were you praising a bratty teenager with no experience in the field? Sure, her dad was an important figure but did you really have to suck up to her? You even realized she wasn't addressing you correctly, yet you still didn't correct her this time, why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my, James, is that an apology for your pathetic attempt at \"banter\" earlier?\" - Michelle's bratty voice and the way her face formed a devilish smile across her lips was starting to worry you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I apologise for my previous behaviour. As such, as an apology, I propose an offer to teach you how things work around here, and help you get used to the business field.\" With a small gulp, you answered to her mocking statement and sucked it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs Michelle satisfied with your proposal? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe, she has another proposal?</span></div></div>",

That sounds like an interesting offer.\" Michelle's voice sounded a bit sarcastic, nonetheless, also a bit intrigued.  She crossed and uncrossed her legs, getting her feet to a higher, more visible position. Needless to say, it was already starting to get hard for you to focus on the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds great! We can start tomorrow...\" Your voice was one of relief at first, as she finally answered your question, despite that you were quickly and shortly after that interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it, that you aren't as stupid as I thought.\" Michelle giggled as she took a glance at the papers, which had her name and her report for her academic years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSHIT!SHIT!SHIT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had totally forgotten that the papers were all around your desk. The worst part was that she could directly see her name as the page in question was turned around for her to read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose, you are also aware who my dad is. The big Mr.B.\" Michelle continued to talk as she gathered the papers and read through them. Interestingly enough, her face also looked shocked. \"I wasn't aware that you could find all of this information about me online, considering I always covered my tracks. I was wrong about you John, you aren't a TOTAL loser.\" Michelle's words came across as sharp as a razor. The bratty brunette was continuously making fun of you, despite your efforts of digging up all of the information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is James...\" - You attempted to correct her mocking and stand up for yourself, however, you were quickly interrupted for yet another time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, whatever.\" Michelle's tone was getting more arrogant by the minute, while she was looking at her nails, completely ignoring that she was sitting in front of you. \"My dad sent me to this shit hole for experience, after all, I am his only successor and he wanted me to learn the ropes from a partnered firm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that's a great decision on his part, we have people with the great amount of experience which can help you..\" You tried to regain control of the conversation using your natural selling skills which had helped you get Stephanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPity. You forgot who you were talking to, you were already in the intern's palm. \"Your overconfidence really got the best of you, huh James?\" You thought to yourself, as you were interrupted for yet another time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jim, be a good boy and don't interrupt mommy while she is speaking, okay?\" Michelle's words stung you a bit, you started to feel weak, slowly dropping your guard, as you were staring at the beautiful intern, speechless. \"Now, where was I?\" Michelle said as she put her feet on top of your desk, while she was pondering what she could ask of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was it. Despite your rigorous and countless attempts to resist them, you were now staring at Michelle's bare soles. They were indeed beautiful, size 5 feet, as her pedicured red toes were wiggling right in front of your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you hear what I said?\" Michelle questioned you, as she slowly tilted her head, staring you directly in the eyes, as a small smugly smirk was appearing on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um..y-you said...\" A sudden blush appeared on your face, you were totally caught off guard as your once-dominant position, was now diminished to one resembling your first day at work. Anxious, reserved and self-conscious of the things around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Mr Junior Manager. I've also done my research on you, how else do you think I got other people to do exams for me? I found their weaknesses, and used them.\" Michelle stated as she continued giggling, while her right foot slowly got closer to your face, pressing to it, rubbing you for a couple of seconds and slowly pulling it away. \"I am aware of your foot fetish, a lot of my professors and colleagues had it as well, which helped me ace my assignments here and there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You son of a...\" You tried retaliating, however, it was yet another failed attempt as she got her feet closer to your face, forcing you to inhale on her scent, the smelly aroma of her feet which made you stop your sentence, without further questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From here on out, I am your boss, James.\" Michelle, for once, had addressed you properly, her tone, being more dominant and straight forward than Kim's. \"I won't destroy your reputation here in front of your colleagues, as it would indirectly impact my father's firm, having bad partners would speak ill of him. However, when we are alone or if I want anything from you, you answer to me. If Kim asks you to meet her and I call you, you come to me, you won't do anything without my approval, got it?\" Michelle ended her sentence with a fixation to the last bit of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes, Michelle, I got it.\" You had already lost. You didn't even attempt on making a witty comeback, as the aroma of her feet had already hypnotized you, rendering you unable to resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I won't take away your salary, however, you are mistaking if you think I will do all the work. From this moment onward, you will be taking my entire workload. I don't care if you or that slutty secretary of yours does it, all I want is to have it done and for it to be done right.\" Michelle's words were direct commands, she wasn't asking it of you, she was DEMANDING you to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you catch all of that, doggy?\" With that Michelle slowly rubbed her bare soles to your face as her bratty tone was like a piercing sound to your ears, to which you could just nod, empty of words at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Then how about we seal our contract, right here and now? Kiss each of my feet and tell me you want to serve your new mistress.\" Michelle really wasn't kidding. You could also spot her phone coming out of her jeans as she was waiting for your answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want Michelle to be my mistress, as well as to help her climb the ladder, as I am but an example!\" You could not believe the words you had just uttered, you even overdid it. And as by instinct, you kissed both of her bare soles, followed by you rubbing your face to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And cut! That was amazing doggy, even I couldn't have come up with a more humiliating line for you\" Michelle's smile widened as she finished recording the video, as proof of your agreement and for you to be unable to oppose her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments after she had finished recording, she got her feet off the desk and put them back into her sneakers as she looked overjoyed by how well it had panned out for her. With that she got up and was about to leave your office as she spoke in a soft tone, looking back at you with a smug face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was nice doing business with you, doggy. I guess I already know how things work around here~\" With that Michelle winked back at you, as you were left alone in your office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were done for, your whole career, your whole life's worth, for you to be domesticated by a petite intern which had exposed your fetish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could it get worse from here?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A couple of minutes had passed, as you were still wondering what you had gotten yourself into. The day started on such a high, humiliating both your arch nemesis and her closest friend, the cherry on top was that you even nailed the meeting with Stephanie Beachwood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that cute little intern Michelle had domesticated you in a days matter. That by itself pissed you to the core, as you had worked hard, your entire life and for what? An intern that had beautiful size 5 feet, which were perfectly pedicured and... \"Silly James\" - You thought to yourself as you put another Treasurer cigar in your mouth. It was true, she knew your weakness and she knew how to use it, something in you even found it interesting. How did she find it so easily, while the other colleagues, mainly the devil herself, Denise, did not?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was you being that good in covering it? \"No, it wasn't that.\" You continued thinking, as small pieces of ash fell down from your cigar. She was definitely cunning and knew where to find people's weak spot. That by itself had probably come from her father's people skills. What if you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thought process was interrupted as you heard Jacinta's voice calling you on your station. \"M-mister James, Candice wants to see you, should I let her in?\" Jacinta's voice was one of worry as she knew what had happened earlier with the spilt coffee and was almost sure what Candice wanted to talk about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell her to come on in, as a matter of fact, I told her to come and pay me a visit.\" What you said, by itself, was a lie. However, you did expect that she would be paying you a visit, especially after you forced her best friend to go through a rooftop of errands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James. I will have you know that ruining my new dress is unacceptable and I will not tolerate you, no matter what you are Junior...\" Candice's attempt to get one on you was immediately stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Candice, I am aware that what I did, when I did it was wrong. As such I have a little surprise for you.\" With that, you pulled a coupon, which would cover up to four pieces of dress from Oscar De La Renta and got it in front of Candice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-J-James... y-you... son of a...\" Candice was in awe, losing complete composure, which was visible by her stuttering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, such a coupon does not come for free.\" You looked at her with a smug face, slowly guiding her to sit on the chair, as she could only follow your movements. With that you sat opposing to her, crossing your legs to a 4 figure sitting position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want, James?\" Candice regained her composure as she realized she was still talking to the guy that spilt coffee on her and the one she hated the most since she came to work to this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite simple actually. I know that Kim asks you for any meetings she has, as well as the numbers of the agents of her clients. By tomorrow, I want you to provide me with all of her meetings for the next 6 weeks.\" You commanded as you were looking into her eyes, with an icy cold gaze that could freeze anybody's core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you insane? How do you know that your friend Jenny doesn't have that information and just doesn't want to give it to you? And even if it was in me, why would I give it up so easily\" Candice exclaimed as she knew that by doing so, it would be breaching company policies. Even more so, those were the managers' meetings, she could lose her job off of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The information is in you and I know it is.\" You said as you drew attention to your hands, folding them and leaving no trace of doubt in your actions. \"Kim is not stupid, she knows that I and Jenny are friends so it would be risky for her, considering I am second in command. Secondly, I know that Oscar De La Renta is your favourite clothing after all the clothes you wore earlier were imitations of it.\" With that, you stood up, opening another window and lighting up yet another cigar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did y-you... Why do you think I would betray Kim, you are aware that if she catches is, both of us are going to be fired, regardless of your standing as a Junior Manager.\" - Candice was both surprised and shocked at how well you knew her, which made her even more pissed she didn't know you better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, when I replace her, you will be my personal secretary, instead of Jacinta or Jenny.\" You turned around facing her, while still smoking your cigar. That by itself shocked Candice, she couldn't believe what she was hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me as your personal secretary? Is that so?\" Candice wondered, was working for the person she hated the most if she were to get double her current salary worth it? Yes, yes it was because then she would definitely be able to find his weakness and humiliate him, the way he did in the long run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright James, I accept your deal. \" Candice smirked, as she crossed and uncrossed her legs, which my itself made you take quick glimpses at them. Her high heels definitely complimented her beautiful... \"Not again James, you already have a Mistress.\" You thought to yourself, as you went back to your desk and pulled out a contract, which you had previously prepared for this very moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, James Harris, pledge to have Candice be the Manager's personal secretary, upon the change of the current representative and to have the salary doubled without any further review if the discussed below criteria are met by the agreeing party. If by any chance, the following is not kept, it will be considered a breach of contract and the one that has written it, will have to pay one-year reparations for the difference in salary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt too good, Candice was unsure of why James would write a contract like that, however, it did not hurt her in any way. Even if they were both to be fired, upon Kim's inevitable change, he would have to pay her 45000$ of salary, which she would love. Even if she did get the spot, she would be able to find his weakness and get a salary double. What a delight! With that, she signed the contract, smiling as she handed it to him, as she told him, she would have the files by tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well, guess Michelle blackmailing me definitely gave me something to think about.\" You thought as you slowly put off the rest of your cigar and threw it in the bin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe contract was indeed beneficial for her, however, you had never mentioned you would be the one sitting in the new managers' seat. After all, your mistress wanted to climb the ladder and you promised her you would help her to. However, you knew that you could also take up the opportunity and use Michelle's position as Mister  B's daughter and rise up in ranking, either here, or in that firm. You would also be able to have that cute little brunette's toes on your face for when you wanted to, two birds with one stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what will it be from here?

I live to serve.\" She rambles with a bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jacinta, you're accepting this reward and liking it.\" You order, silencing her. \"First, I... apologize for my outburst towards you earlier today. That was out of line.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacinta put a hand to her mouth in shock. \"N-no no, it's fine. I was out of line asking my new boss to go out for drinks with me.

So seeing you be so nice to her was a breath of fresh air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could try to decline your offer, you speak again. \"Lastly, I'm thinking I will take you up on that offer of drinks tonight.

Maybe it was simply the fact that she had bested you verbally before; either way, you found yourself sauntering over to her, a grin plastered all over your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if isn't the new intern! Doing really important jobs I'm sure like...fetching coffees? Shredding paper? Or has one of these losers that I don't even need to acknowledge anymore not entrusted you with that much responsibility?\" You sniggered, maintaining eye contact with the brunette, not daring to allow your eyes to wander downward like last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle stared at you, a playful smile forming on her lips. Folding her arms, she raised an eyebrow. \"Well, that's not very nice is it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's not nice, intern? Reminding you of the fact that you're nothing here - just a little bug to people like me. A bug that will be squashed in no time, don't you worry?\" You flashed her your pearly whites, feeling much more self-assured than you did before. Yet, this early twenty-something did not seem in the slightest bit concerned or cowed. In fact, she seemed rather amused! This bugged you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...nothing to say?\" You continued to grin at her, shrugging your shoulders. \"Wow, to think that you actually managed to go back and forth with me earlier this morning. We'll put that down to beginner's luck shall we? Anyway, intern loser - go and fetch me a coffee. There's a good girl...\" For a moment you thought about patting her patronisingly on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No, that would be too far...you haven't dominated her enough yet. That can come in time!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill staring at you, the same damnable smirk on her face, Michelle didn't budge an inch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helloooo? What's wrong - you not able to hear me...are your little intern brains at maximum capacity at something?\" You sniggered again but your snorts dissipated quickly away, almost engulfed by the silence that shrouded your foe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she decided to speak. \"No,\" is all the gorgeous brunette simply, a look on her face very much like a lioness would have before tearing apart a gazelle. In your peripheral vision, you noticed her left leg crossing over the other, the toes of her foot pushing slightly against the floor so her sole raised a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you understand,\" you retorted, softly and menacingly, your smile now totally vanished as you tempted to out-psych this newbie. \"<i>Go. And. Get. Me. A. Coffee.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning forward so that she literally a few centimetres from you, Michelle whispered close to your ear. \"Kiss my ass, <i>John</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping backwards, she stood right in front of you, her arms still folded and a sneer on her face. Your mouth suddenly dry and once again words failing to form as coherently as before, you tried and failed to stop your eyes from shifting downwards at her pretty toes, adorned with red nail varnish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...it's James, you...not John,\" you spluttered. \"Now, you listen...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour words trailed off completely as she suddenly put one small finger directly over your lips, catching you totally by surprise. \"Do you know who I am, John?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely failing to find any words at all now, you simply shake your head, still in shock that this brat would have the temerity to silence you like this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the daughter of Mr B - you know - the company's, like, main partner. I'm here to get a bit of experience as an intern.\" She shrugged her shoulders suddenly. \"I don't give a shit about this place, or you. Not you, not anyone can tell me what to do. If may Daddy saw you talking crap to me, he would totally get you fired. Like that.\" She pulled her finger from your lips and clicked it for emphasis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shit. Shit, shit, shit! </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr B was indeed a major partner to the organisation. He was long-term affiliate who was known to be jovial most of the time but possessed a foul temper if things did not go his way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Daddy - he told me I had to, like, work without pay first.\" She rolled her hazel eyes, talking as though you were barely even there. \"Not that I need the money of course.\" She fixed with you with a smug, content look. <i>One that has probably gotten this bratty princess anything she's ever wanted,</i> you couldn't help but think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, some words managed to form as you adopted a friendly smile. \"Now, Michelle, there's no need for you to worry about anything.\" You suddenly laughed, which made her frown a little. \"I mean, just a bit of office banter, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Office banter? You just called me a bug that needed to be squashed...you demanded that I get you a coffee...that doesn't sound like banter to me, Jeff,\" Michelle replied, a smile on her lips but her eyes as hard and cold as stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the deliberate attempt to antagonise you with another erroneous name, you merely continued to smile. \"Oh, no...no I didn't mean that. No, no...I wouldn't actually expect you to take that seriously!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you think I'm stupid? You think I'm, like, this total idiot who can't understand banter?\" She gave you another smug look, clearly enjoying seeing you squirm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not going well at all! Your attempts to dominate this intern had backfired spectacularly. Had you known who she was, you would have never, NEVER attempted to get one over on her like this! Dammit, you really should have waited for Jacinta to dig some dirt on her before confronting her again! Realising that your options were limited at this point, you knew that it would be better to make peace and swallow your pride, you quickly decided what to do...</span></div></div>",

Still staring at you, a confident smirk plastered all over her gorgeous face, she looked positively thrilled when you began to apologise to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michelle, I'm...sorry...\" You stated through clenched teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What was that, John?\" She said, a teasing look about her as she taunted you. \"I don't think EVERYONE around here heard you properly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral coworkers seemed to be fixing their gazes over at the pair of you. Wishing that the brat would just accept your apology and let you move on, you adopted the most sincere and humble expression possible. Having charmed enough clients over the past few years, this was something that you were good at - manipulating and controlling people!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said...\" You paused, trying best to ignore the stares of the onlookers around you. \"I <i>said</i>, Michelle, that I am sorry. I am sorry for speaking to you like that and for...for...not respecting you sufficiently.\" You finished, forcing an affable smile on your face. Michelle seemed to be having none of it though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe you,\" she replied cooly, shaking her head in a disappointed fashion. \"You called me a 'bug', that I needed to 'fetch me a coffee', that I was a 'good girl'...\" She emphasised these last words in a sardonic fashion. \"It's gonna take more than a bullshit apology for me to be convinced.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling your cheeks start to redden, both from embarrassment and for a rising anger swirling around you, you took a breath and nodded politely. \"Of course - all of those things I said were just part of office banter, you know....\" You looked around for support but were met with frosty, unimpressed expressions of people you had either trampled on professionally before, or had barely given a second glance in your rise to power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't banter, John...Jeff...what is your name anyway?\" Before you could answer she held a hand out in front of your face. \"Ya, ya...whatever. Anyway, prove you're useful to me - go and <i>fetch me a coffee</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRooted to the spot, you tried to ignore the snorts and giggles of those surrounding you - now a fairly decently-sized crowd. It took a certain degree of self-control not to tell this stupid little brat to go fuck herself! Instead, you shifted your gaze down to the ground, which of course was a mistake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, coffee boy, quit staring at my feet like a weirdo...go fetch my coffee already!!\" Michelle said with disdain. A few people actually cheered a little, high-fiving one another as you found yourself turning around and, in a trance-like state, heading towards the coffee machine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cappuccino...extra foam!\" The intern called out cheerily to you, her words only just registering. You had been humbled, owned, <i>destroyed</i> by this petite brunette. The fact that she was Mr B's daughter - it was just too risky to do anything than obey her. Imagine if she told her Daddy how rude you had been, how you had tried ordering her around...realising that the best thing you could possibly do right now was get her coffee and hope that the crowd dispersed, you quickened your movements and tapped the necessary buttons on the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boy,\" Michelle said, causing more derision from the coworkers around you once you returned, cappuccino in hand. \"So there is something useful you can do, after all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure...\" you muttered, wishing that this ordeal would just be over with now. Realising that people were now openly laughing at you, you attempted to regain some sort of control on the situation. \"You're welcome, Michelle. Glad to help the intern on her first day. Anyway - I've gotta get back to some important work. Being Junior Manager means there's always plenty of money to make for the company after all... OK, see ya!\" You told her brightly, staring daggers at anyone who continued to smirk at you, their eyes averting from you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying your best to keep the confident grin on your face, you turned nodding curtly at Michelle before strolling away, wishing to get as much distance between the gorgeous brunette and you as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, there's one more thing!\" She suddenly called out, making you stop dead in your tracks...what did she want now?!</span></div></div>",

When the last onlookers finally were out of earshot, Michelle lent forward, a soft giggle escaping her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you....\" she said slowly and deliberately. Despite yourself, you felt a little aroused by how seductively and closely she was talking to you. \"I want you to...put in a good word with the boss for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked and stepped back a little. \"A good word? What...what do you want me to say exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use your common sense...what are you, like, simple?\" Giving you a dismissive wave of her hand and studying her carefully manicured nails, the brat continued as though you were barely even there. \"You'll think of something, John. You'll make it clear that I'm awesome, that's the important thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's James,\" you practically growled, still finding it taking a great effort to remain calm. \"J-A-M-E-S!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" She replied, her face frowning for a moment. \"I don't give a shit about the details. Just make me seem awesome. Got it?\" Giving you a challenging look, hands on her hips, you couldn't notice one foot resting a little on the other. Her gorgeous toes spreading a little...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Earth to John....!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, er, yeah...I'll tell the boss something....\" You forced yourself to refocus, accepting the fact that this beautiful brunette was now firmly in charge of the situation. If you refused her, the intern would surely tell her father, implicating you and potentially destroying your career. Ruefully wishing that you had simply waited for the information from Michelle, you merely nodded while she gave you a patronising pat on the head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boy,\" she snickered. \"Do what I tell you, like my good little pet, and you've got nothing to worry about...\" With another giggle, she happily turned on her heel and strolled away, leaving you standing like a fool. Finding yourself staring after her, you caught a glimpse of one bare sole lifting a little off the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A perfect, silky smooth bare sole. One that you would desperately love to kiss and lick, caressing your tongue all over it...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" You didn't realise that you had actually shouted out loud. A few puzzled stares came your way, along with several smirks - from the same who witnessed Michelle's total verbal dominance over you before. Resuming your karate breathing technique, you headed straight to your office, realising that you needed a few minutes in peace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mister James! I...I found some information...about the...intern...\" Jacinta's voice trailed off as she stood awkwardly, watching you storm into your office, walking straight past her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" You snarled. \"What is it now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm, about Michelle. I...found out that she's the daughter-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, yes! I got that already. Thanks.\" Giving her a foul look, she practically cowered, stepping backwards and fixing her gaze on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Mister...James...I'll just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get the hell out of here. I need some time alone,\" you told her curtly, your heart still racing as you thought about how much that damned intern had humbled you in front of other people. Scurrying away without another word, Jacinta closed the door behind you, leaving you at last alone and with your thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>There must be a way out of this, surely! Yes Michelle is the daughter of Mr B...and is admittedly very attractive...and seems to be very comfortable barefoot...which by the way are incredibly delectable...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nForcing your mind to stop and practising your breathing techniques, you knew that this was a very dangerous train of thought! It was an impossible situation; if you didn't say anything to Kim with the intention of praising Michelle, then the brat would know, surely. So, something had to be said - that was a fact. What you said though...what could you say about her that would be logical and fair. One thought hit you - Michelle was certainly confident, very self-assured, despite her immaturity. Yes, yes you could easily tell Kim how you noticed that the new intern was confident and comfortable around people - so comfortable in fact that she was walking around barefoot...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould you mention that to Kim too, or would that possibly be a risk, depending on how Kim took that? Either way, you knew that you had to act quickly so you could refocus on your work and try your very best to forget about Michelle and forget about her, no matter how sexy she and her feet were!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a knock on the door interrupted your thoughts.

It's...all good!\" You told her, trying to fix your mind away from Michelle and the whole situation. \"Today's been <i>great</i>, so far actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that I'm sure of,\" she chuckled, sitting on one of the leather chairs around the meeting area of your office. Quickly taking a seat next to her, you felt your chest practically puff out with pride as she began relaying back to you how impressed Stephanie Beachwood was, how the company are fully vindicated in your promotion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdopting a modest but still confident tone, you continued to smile and soak up the praise. \"Well, you know, hard work does pay off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It certainly does,\" she stated, smiling warmly. \"So, anything else we need to catch up on before I leave you to it?\" The redhead started smoothing out her business suit, preparing to rise to her feet. <i>She was attractive, there was no doubt about that. Even though she was a good ten or so years older than you, she'd probably be dynamite in the bedroom...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping quickly away from that train of thought, you knew far better than to mix business with pleasure. \"No there's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim raised an eyebrow. \"Yes, James? What is it?\" She tapped her foot a little impatiently on the floor - freshly cleaned by Jacinta earlier and still practically sparkling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of Michelle's smug face was dominating your thoughts. You had to tell Kim - you had to do what the brat told you. It would be career suicide to risk the intern's wrath; with her powerful father, a hugely influential man on the entire organisation, one bad word could cause irreparable damage to you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearing your throat, you tried to ignore the now slightly irritated look on your boss's face. \"Er, the new intern...I don't know her name...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Michelle,\" Kim said curtly, her eyes widening very briefly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's very...impressive. I mean, I haven't seen her work on a professional capacity much so far but...but she's smart. I mean, <i>seriously</i> smart. She completely <i>owned</i> Bob from Human Resources. She was so confident, impressive...she's...she's one to watch. That was all - I just wanted to pass that on to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim stared at you, her expression unreadable until mercifully she broke out into a smile. \"Well, that's great to hear James! Yes, I had scoured her file earlier and was blown away by her SAT scores and GPAs. And yes - in person she is certainly smart, confident...I know she's just an intern...\" Kim coughed slightly, as though there was more to the story that she could not inform you about... \"Anyway, interns need to make a good impression. They need to grab those proverbial brass rings - they need to get noticed and make their way up the ladder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicturing Michelle's dainty, gorgeous feet stepping up a ladder, you had to visibly shake the thought away, which made Kim frown a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You OK, James?

Hey, maybe I shouldn't wear my shoes either...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead suddenly slipped out of her shoes, causing her to shrink several inches in height. Figuratively-wise, your boss seemed to appear a few feet higher! Having her barefoot made you instinctively shift your gaze to the ground, your eyes caught like a fly in a spider's web at her pretty toes, each one adorned in red nail varnish...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wonder that bothers you,\" Kim said softly, her voice snapping you out of your trance. \"What is it, you think my feet are gross, or they stink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no...n-not at all! They're...your feet...they're...th-they're nice!\" You babbled at her, feeling your cheeks go red with embarrassment. Why the hell had you mentioned Michelle being barefoot?! Of course - Kim would be well aware that Michelle was the daughter of Mr B; the fact that the bratty intern enjoyed being barefoot was no concern to Kim whatsoever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at you curiously, Kim's corners of her mouth twitched. \"Wow, you are really easy to mess with!

But I don't need foot reports on an intern or anyone else for that matter. If you wanna kick off your shoes and feel more comfortable, be my guest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelieved that she did not think your awkwardness was anything to do with actually <i>liking</i> feet, you tried your best to adopt a casual grin, giving her a cheery wave goodbye as she picked up her heels and strolled out of your office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the door behind her, you felt a little giddy and out of breath. Massaging your temples and resuming your karate breathing techniques from before, you had to tell yourself something reassuring, something empowering...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You were the king. These people were mere peasants to you! Even Kim - one day you'll be HER boss!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you took in one more deep breath, walking over to your desk, the door reopened with Jacinta standing there. Her shy smile and non-confrontational personality was a welcome sigh of relief. Not so welcome was what she was holding in her hands...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your shoes,\" you stated thickly. \"Why are you...why are you holding your...shoes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacinta let out a nervous giggle. \"Oh, Mister James...it was Kim - the boss. I saw her right now...she told me....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words were swept away by an unpleasant, sinking feeling that spread around every fibre of your being. You didn't need Jacinta - of all people - to spell it out for you! Who else would Kim tell that it was OK to be barefoot at the office?! It would begin with your doting secretary, then other co-workers, clients even...<i>Denise</i>...! That last thought made you turn a little pale - both out of fear and admitted curiosity of your ultimate nemesis's bare feet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mister James? Mister James...I'm just going to put these here....\" Your secretary moved nervously over to her desk, carefully placing her open-toed black heels under it. Again, on autopilot, you felt your eyes darting over to her peds. Jacinta was wearing nylons - not that dissimilar in colour to actual skin tone, which was relatively pale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strand of white-blonde hair falling over her sweating forehead, Jacinta continued to stare at you. \"Mister James...are you OK? W-was it what I said about that intern?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...no,\" you said, in a slightly croaky voice as you wrenched your head upwards to meet her eye contact. \"That's all...that's all fine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So there's nothing else you want to know about her?\" Jacinta continued, a slight look of irritation on her face as her cheeks reddened a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...no...it's...fine...\" you replied absently, barely registering the fact that your secretary spoke to you rather bluntly, for her at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde smiled blandly at you, a slightly odd look on her face as she sat at her desk, her feet in fall view of you - not the soles but the tops of them, including her long, slender toes, which had white nail paint on each of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said...what do you want me to do next?\" Jacinta called across at you, an expectant look on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This was your nightmare! With her being barefoot in the room around you, you could not be your usual, dominant self! Trying to focus and ignore the fact that she was barefoot was proving harder, much harder than you ever could have anticipated! For a person who actually prided himself on being dismissive, abrupt - rude, even, it was as if you had been weakened!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearing your throat, you knew that things could not continue like this. This was the first day as Junior Manager - you had to assert your authority and take back control of the situation, <i>every</i> situation! You had to either force yourself to be an asshole to Jacinta and keep her in her damned place, or find something else to do in the office....</span></div></div>",

Put my shoes...on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me, or do you need your ears tested?\" You said sardonically, buoyed by the fact that your swagger was returning. \"I don't need this office smelling like a mouldy cheese factory, and neither does my client this afternoon who's coming in an hour!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...but...Mrs Kim....she told me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what she told you!\" You snapped at her, now standing up and pointing at the shoes under her desk. \"Put. Them. ON!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacinta gulped, a sense of panic about her as she bent down, fumbling around with her shoes. \"I'm...Mister James...I didn't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up,\" you growled. \"Every second with your disgusting feet out stinks out this place even more! OK, here's what you're going to do when you've FINALLY managed to figure out the mechanism that attaches your shoes back to your stinking feet! I want you to get some air freshener in here - get rid of that funky foot smell you've caused. THEN, I want alphabetised files for each of the clients that I have scheduled for the rest of the week, including prospective ones. After that....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling adrenaline pump through your veins, it felt a relief...no, a <i>necessity</i> to resume your abrasive ways with Jacinta. She was a mere secretary - <i>nothing</i> to you. So far beneath her that she deserved...needed to be spoken to like this. Just like all of the other people below you. People who never thought you would have gotten this far. People who didn't need to be barefoot around you like Michelle, Kim and Jacinta just now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacinta scurried out of the office, returning with air freshener, including a release pod, which let out a fragrant vanilla scent every half hour or so - that's what she claimed at least. The blonde secretary could barely make eye contact with you since you put her firmly in her place. While she busied herself with the organising and filing tasks that you set her, your mind wandered over to the previous events of the day....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all started on such a high, embarrassing Candice, then that stupid cleaner Helena.  Spilling your scalding coffee on Candice was a <i>necessity</i>; had you not, that vindictive bitch would've held the upper hand on you, without a doubt. The meeting with Stephanie was beyond successful...it could not have gone better! Humbling Jacinta and making it clear to her that she will NOT be barefoot around you was the latest minor victory, especially after seeing how she changed with you being less forceful around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, there were niggling worries. Most of them were due to Michelle - that little intern (with the damned sexy feet) was going to prove troublesome, to say the least. Still, you had done as bidden and put in a good word for her with Kim. Helena, the janitor, was another one who had got one over you today, refusing to clean your office. A thought crossed your mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was unlikely you'd ever dominate Michelle - she was simply someone to avoid and hope that she would move on from the office. However, Helena - she was someone who could be cowed, be taken down a few pegs. Checking the time, you had around twenty minutes...enough time to find something to chastise and take your frustrations out on Helena with! Or was it better to avoid seeking any trouble and wait patiently for your next client?</span></div></div>",

At least it doesn't have the cheesy feet smell here anymore!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mister James,\" Jacinta nodded rapidly, blushing again and clearly regretting the fact that she ever took her shoes off in the first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Good. That's how it should be!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrolling out of your new office, you knew that the Hispanic Janitor would not be far away. Sure enough, she carrying a mop and bucket with her on the way back from cleaning the bathrooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, here she is! The world's least effective cleaning lady,\" you announced loudly. Giving Helena your best smirk, you stared daggers at her. \"Oh a mop won't do in my office, honey. You're gonna need polish, clothes...that's where you're heading next, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena glared at you, her eyes full of anger and loathing. \"You always talk so much crap to me. Screw you.\" She attempted to to brush past you but you held up your hands as if taming a wild bull that was about to charge through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoah, whoah steady there!\" Closer up, you had to admit that Helena was attractive. <i>Very</i> attractive, to be fair in terms f her face. And her body - it was a curvy, hourglass figure that you could just about make out under her work attire. Despite her hard features, she had sparkling hazel eyes, a cute nose very symmetrical features. Her long brown hair tied into a bun did not help her look anywhere near as glamorous as she could, nor did her pink, cleaning skivvies of course!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it? What?\" She practically spat at you, dropping the mop and bucket to the ground. \"You mad at me for not bowing and scraping to you, is that it, white boy? Oh, look at the king...look at him walk around like he's the fucking ruler of the world!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleased to be getting this reaction, you tutted disapprovingly. \"Dear oh dear, Helena. Cursing <i>and</i> using a racial slur. Oh the bosses won't like that at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You say what the hell you want!\" The Mexican woman seethed, narrowing her eyes and screwing up her face to show you how much she detested you. \"You wanna take me on - you got nothing on me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, technically that's not true, is it? You refused to clean my office after the accident with Candice Watson earlier. You've used racial remarks and swear words against me - both of which are breaking company protocol and policy,\" you stated calmly. \"I could go on...should I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have had it with you!\" The janitor snarled and lunged forward with her mop, aiming it at your face. Expertly ducking, then sidestepping neatly - thanks to your karate training, you felt tempted to return a blow of your own, stopping yourself just in time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helena, really!\" You smirked, your eyes blazing victoriously at the fact that she had finally lost her temper with you and was made to look like a fool. \"That's just another incident that I may have to...report...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour voice trailed off and looked down at your khaki pants...why were they dripping and covered in soap suds...?! Taking a breath, you look further down to see the bucket knocked over where you had sidestepped rapidly, the water all over the floor and - apparently - all over your pants!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up furiously at Helena, you recoiled a little at the look of pure triumph on her face. \"Report what? Report that you just kicked a bucket of water and suds on you? Ha! What a loser!\" She chuckled in disdain at you, eyes glinting malevolently at wear the water was dripping, from at least halfway up your pants down to your shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTossing the mop to you, she continued to chuckle. \"I didn't make the mess. He did, right?\" The mid-30s janitor looked around for support. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure I saw what happened...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was it who witnessed the altercation between you and the Mexican cleaner?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A malevolent smile on her gorgeous face, the brunette looked between the two of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You saw?\" You stared at her hopefully, though you could feel your heart racing already. Not Michelle - of all people! Then again, perhaps she had encountered Kim; your redhead boss could have mentioned your glowing report of her. Not the foolish mention of her being barefoot though... Your eyes flickered downwards at that thought. Yep, Michelle was of course barefoot once more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah John. I saw everything,\" the intern said softly, her voice with a mocking tone to it. \"Speak to the boss yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had mixed feelings about that! At least Kim wouldn't have mentioned your slip about Michelle being barefoot - assuming of course that Michelle was not messing with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could answer, Helena cleared her throat, causing both you and Michelle to turn to her. \"Excuse me, Miss. You seem nice, fair. This arrogant...jerk...he caused the mess, you saw, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStifling a giggle, Michelle bit her lip. \"Arrogant jerk, really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! He try to boss me around all the time. He so rude to me! He tried to make me grovel and bow down to him, si!\" The Mexican woman gave you a look of pure loathing before turning back to Michelle. \"Please, you on my side with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle frowned, looking between the two of you as though she were the judge, jury and executioner. Dammit...this newbie did hold the power! Being the daughter of an extremely, wealthy partner to the firm meant that you were truly at her mercy! Yet you could not help but speak up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michelle, please. This woman is lazy, incompetent and has been undermining me the moment I started working here. She's had it in for me for years! Since I've become Junior Manager...\" You puffed up your chest a little while Michelle yawned disinterestedly. \"Helena...she's used racial slurs, refused to do her job...and look at what she's done - she attacked me with a mop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling her eyes, the petite brunette looked distinctly unimpressed with you. \"Jim, this woman....Helena, right? Helena, has every right to totally complain about you. It's, like, racial discrimination! You really wanna see whose side the boss's take? A beautiful, hardworking woman from....Mexico?\" She smiled at the janitor after she nodded in affirmation. \"Of you, a privileged white boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mouth hung open. Man, Michelle had turned this on you so quickly. Helena had a smug, satisfied smirk plastered all over her face as she sidled up next to the intern, her arms folded to mimic your tormentor's body posture. \"She right - the bosses they won't believe you.\" Turning to Michelle, the janitor smiled warmly. \"Thank you, thank you so much miss for seeing the truth and not listening to this arrogant <i>monstruo</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now hang on a moment...!\" You spluttered out, knowing that speaking up against Michelle was potentially foolish, yet you could not let Helena win like this! \"Michelle, seriously, I've done nothing wrong! She's got it in for me...please!\" You felt yourself become increasingly desperate, your voice turning high-pitched and pleading. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyebrows raised and an amused look about her, Michelle shook her head. \"I believe Helena. Now, rather than her and I going to the boss right now, if I were you, I'd do exactly what I tell you, John...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that she remembered Helena's name after one mention and still could not get you stung, though not as much as what she next said. \"You are gonna to Helena here, then you'll clean up the rest of this floor space - until she's happy with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What the...! </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nExasperated yet well-aware of who Michelle was the daughter of, you gave yourself a few moments before responding.

Sorry for...making this mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena continued to smirk at you, her hands on her hips. For years and years she had waited for this moment to humble you, to put you in your place. Yet, she shook her head as she made a tutting noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree, Helena,\" Michelle chuckled. \"Again, John. Apologise like you mean it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I'm <i>really</i> sorry,\" you said through clenched teeth. \"For making a mess, for being rude to you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill the women were not satisfied. Biting her lip and playing with her hair seductively, Michelle had another idea. \"On your knees, John. Then we'll know you're truly sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour knees shaking, you knew that the only way out of this was to play along and suck it up. With Michelle around, you were totally at her mercy and if that meant humiliating yourself in front of the janitor, of all people, then so be it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping to your knees, both women looked satisfied. \"Please, Helena, I am so sorry for causing such a mess. I...I know I've been a jerk to you...I'm really sorry for my behaviour. I...I promise I will be nicer to you. Please, please can you forgive me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena practically shivered with pleasure as she stared down at you, a victorious air about her as she finally nodded with satisfaction. \"Si. Now you can go clean, John.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So she was going to call you the wrong name too now...of course she was!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John, fetch us both a coffee - we're gonna put our feet up and have a little break while you go do a bit of cleaning. Got that?\" Michelle grinned at you, patting your head patronisingly like earlier. Only this time she was actually taller than you, as you were still on your knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure...\" You muttered awkwardly, before hurriedly getting to your feet and heading towards the machine. The sound of the brunette clearing her throat forced you to turn round. \"Er, yeah. I mean, what is it...what can I...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing at your apparent uselessness, Michelle gestured dramatically to her Mexican companion. \"Aren't you gonna ask what Helena wants, Jeff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing your eyes for a moment, you forced yourself to pretend that this nightmare would be over soon and that you could get back to your safe, Helena-free office. \"Sure, yep. Er, Helena, what would you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Double espresso, John,\" Helena told you curtly, smirking at you once more as the two women strolled off together towards two of the comfy recliners in the lobby leaving you to fetch the coffee. You knew what Michelle wanted<i>...cappuccino, extra foam...</i>. The second one you would be making her already today! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you returned, minutes later, both women had their legs crossed, their bare feet dangling off the edge of their recliners, content looks about them. Gulping, you couldn't help but stare at the four soles as you approached them. Michelle's were soft, creamy, small and incredibly delicious looking. Helena's were darker, a bronze colour a little lighter than the rest of the skin. Longer than Michelle's and not quite as soft, they were very shapely and - admittedly - extremely attractive. Trying your best not to stare, you gulped as you handed over each coffee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good pet,\" Michelle sighed, sipping her coffee and grinning at you. The nerve of this girl...yet, you were partly entranced by her and also terrified that her powerful father could end your career in a heartbeat, should you displease her. Moving her hands in a shooing movement, Helena let out a cackle of laughter, appreciating how subservient you were to the petite brunette. \"That's it - go and clean now, John.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena gave you a cheery wave while you shuffled away, picking up the mop, moving it in awkward, circular motions around the floor. It had been a long time since you needed to pick up a mop; years and years ago, you had a brief part-time cleaning job but that seemed like a lifetime ago! In your apartment, you hired a cleaner to come by once a week for several hours. Even holding the mop in your hands was truly humbling. The fact that you could see both women drinking their coffee, their bare soles hanging off the edge of their chairs made it even more demeaning yet admittedly arousing at the same time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next ten minutes, you mopped away like a madman, desperate to get the tedious task over with. Were you able to continue uninterrupted and unseen for the duration of it, or did you encounter someone while doing so?</span></div></div>",

She eighteen now, beautiful girl,\" Helena said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...so you were only seventeen?!\" Michelle replied, not without a certain snootiness. \"Boy, you've had it tough. Single Mom at that age, working as a cleaner here with assholes like Jeff to deal with..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearing your throat, you pretended not to hear the unsubtle insult.

Helena - see what you think. Let me know if it's perfect!\" Michelle instructed her companion. Rising to her feet, Helena stalked forward, still barefoot as she inspected your work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops...\" She said, as the sound of a plastic cup hit the ground. \"How clumsy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you...\" You spluttered as you felt your insides boil with rage. \"I just...cleaned...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hispanic janitor shrugged her shoulders and sneered at you. \"Accidents happen. Guess you oughta clean it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and get her another coffee too as she lost that one. I'll have the same again!\" Michelle cheerily called out as you slipped your shoulders dejectedly. <i>A taste of your own medicine...of course Helena was going to use this opportunity to embarrass you and get some revenge!</i> Thinking back to earlier this morning when you deliberately spilt your coffee, you had no conceivable idea then that the tables would be reversed so fully!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing as you were bid, you hurriedly mopped over the spilt coffee, as well as Helena's footprints for good measure - just in case they tried to use that against you! Fetching two more drinks from the machine, you quickly headed back to where Helena had returned to her recliner, next to Michelle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding with approval at you while she sipped her cappuccino, Michelle sighed with satisfaction. \"So, Jerry. What have you learned?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding before them, trying not to steal another glance at their bare feet, you gulped. \"I...I've er, learned to be nicer, er, to Helena. And I...I will be nicer to her...from now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena clicked her tongue. \"That's the least, John. You've been a prick to me for so many years. Getting me some coffee and cleaning one bit of floor space is just the start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust the start? What did she mean?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle leaned forward eagerly as if reading your thoughts. \"I've heard all about Helena and how tough things are for her. She's a single Mom. She's on minimum wage and she needs a break. You know how many times she would have cleaned that floor you reluctantly helped her with? Seriously, John, you need to get some perspective here. You're gonna help Helena here, especially now you know how hard things've been for her, and considering what a jerk you've been to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis did not sound good at all. \"What..er...what can I do...?\" You murmured weakly, knowing that Michelle was in total control of what happened here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle and the janitor looked at one another, exchanging smiles. How much had they discussed exactly while you were cleaning?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what, John, I'm actually gonna give you a couple of options here,\" Michelle giggled as you visibly squirmed in front of her and Helena. \"In both scenarios, Helena gets an improvement in her situation, that's a fact. So, here's what you now need to decide....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>God, how had you managed to let things spiral this far out of control?! If only you had left Helena alone....if only Michelle had not been there at that particular time...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Option 1, Jeff - you grab Helena a coffee every single morning and before you go home, you will do a share of the cleaning.\" Michelle announced excitedly. Your heart sank; you were half-excepting this, considering what you'd been doing for the past quarter of an hour or so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or...\" She continued, playing with her hair, an infuriatingly cute smile on her face, \"<i>Or</i>...Helena becomes your new secretary. You can get rid of whoever you've got working for you at the moment.\" Michelle stated, a dismissive wave of her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReeling in shock from the turn of events, you felt anxiety crawl inside your gut. Whatever you chose you'd be losing. The idea of getting a coffee for Helena and cleaning for her...<i>every single day...</i> Yet, actually having her as your secretary, forcing you to get rid of Jacinta...what was the best option?</span></div></div>",

Not only could she raise hell about losing her job on day one of being your secretary, but you weren't sure just how Helena would act as your secretary in her place. She could \"accidentally\" misplace important documents, scare off clients, and who knows what else in your name to make you look bad. She could get you canned within a week if you weren't careful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, you didn't climb this far up the corporate ladder without learning how to put your own spin on an incident. People have already seen you getting her coffee, so maybe you can make yourself look like the good guy by helping a hard working staff member by doing a simple thing for her. You could even spin the cleaning thing to give the appearance that \"no job is beneath anyone\" or whatever that chick at HR was rambling about. Who knows, maybe if you play your cards right, you can walk out of this looking like a hero, a hero that even daddy dearest Mr. B couldn't object to over something petty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then you two, I've decided. I'll help out Helena with her cleaning and get her a coffee in the morning.\" The two actually looked a bit surprised. They were totally expecting you to be so disgusted by grunt work to have no issue giving her the promotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, white boy, five o'clock after work I'll be in your office with a bucket so you can get started. By the way, I think that since I need every cent I can get, any overtime pay you are offered should go to me, right Michelle?\" Helena asks, earning a nod from the brunette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell that stung a little, you were kinda hoping to get a little extra pay out of this, but you suppose it can't be helped. \"Sure, after all, I'd hate to see you and your daughter thrown to the streets.\" You say through a twitchy smile as you extend your hand in a sign of good faith, only for her to spit in her hand before taking it. Well, you were gonna need to sanitize that later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then whitey, I'll let you go now. Go do whatever it is you do here.\" She releases your hand and waves you out of the room.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Always thinking of how to maximise every situation, however unfortunate it initially seemed, you decided to see Kim. Most people would avoid the boss like a plague having been put in such a humbling position. Not you though; you remembered Kim's recent drive on promoting and giving opportunities to ethnic minorities in the workplace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, James,\" Kim frowned at you after letting you into her office. \"Not another thing about barefoot co-workers is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the sardonic tone of her voice, you gave her a cheery smile as you sat down on a leather chair opposite her. \"No, not not at all! In fact, you know that recent initiative about workers from ethnic minority origins? Well, I've just thought of a way to show how management is helping...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Kim seemed a bit taken aback by your idea - of you doing cleaning duties for an hour between 5 and 6pm, relieving the seemingly hardworking and strapped-for-cash Helena from her duties. Plus the fact that she would be getting paid the hour's overtime, even though you would be doing it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James...that's...wonderful!\" She beamed at you. \"That is <i>exactly</i> the kind of initiative I was hoping for! Yes, absolutely, by all means show that the management here is on the side of the <i>little people</i>. From what you've said, this janitor could do with some help, extra pay - she and her daughter certainly need it. Well done James!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling yourself swell with pride, you tried to ignore the fact that you would be giving up a whole hour per day - five per week - twenty per month...to help that damned Helena out, just to keep on Michelle's good side! Not to mention of course the coffee each morning, which you didn't feel necessary of informing Kim with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the boss's office on much more positive terms than when you last saw her, you marched back to your office to check in with Jacinta. The blonde secretary was, thankfully (well, positively in a professional sense) <i>not</i> barefoot and barely able to make eye contact with you. Just how it should be!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any messages, Jacinta?\" You asked her curtly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, Mister James! S-sorry...sorry again about taking off my shoes...\" She told you awkwardly, averting her gaze and turning red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave her a casual wave of the hand as you stretched back on your comfy office chair. \"Don't sweat it. Just keep those shoes on! Anyway, I've got a few more jobs for you to do...\" After instructing Jacinta to do a few - mostly pointless and menial - tasks, you caught up on a few emails. With the time ticking rapidly away, you realised that it was nearly 5pm - time for your cleaning duty to begin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, Jacinta, I've got to...run an errand...\" you announced suddenly while your secretary stared at you with surprise. Deciding it best to be straight with her, as no doubt others would see you cleaning in the office, you explained the cleaning task you had for the next hour - in line with Kim's push for helping the ethnic minority workers of the office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Mister James, that's so...so...kind!\" Jacinta said, her voice rising in pitch. She seemed both surprised and curious but did not press you further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, a knock on your office door revealed a glaring Helena, bucket and mop in hand. Without giving you even a thanks, she tossed them to you before strolling away. <i>Typical, such a bitch...</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging it off and taking on your new responsibility in a positive way, knowing that Kim fully approved, you attacked the floors with gusto, determined to get the work done efficiently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I didn't know you were so good at cleaning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat familiar voice from behind you stopped you in your tracks. Who was it?</span></div></div>",

So, that meant no choice but to have her as your secretary...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK...OK, option...two...\" you muttered through gritted teeth, much to the delight of Michelle and Helena. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh! You mean you want Helena to be your new secretary?\" Michelle beamed while Helena excitedly wiggled her toes, apparently oblivious to the fact that you could not help but admire them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that wasn't what you wanted at all, but it was the lesser of two evils. \"Yes, I want her - you, Helena - to be my...secretary.\" At least this way you could ridicule and torment the idiot. You would be HER boss, yes...the more you thought about it, the more you realised that by seemingly helping out her new-found friend, Michelle had in fact thrown her to the wolves...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent! So, you'll have some work to do, right Jeff?\" Michelle smirked at you. \"Tell, like, whoever your secretary is to pack her bags....oh and tell the boss that you want a different secretary...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike you weren't aware! Incredibly, despite your seniority to the brat, you actually found yourself seeking some advice from her. \"Er, what should I...what can I tell Kim? I mean, I've had Jacinta for less than a day...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look on Michelle's face was a mixture of smugness and scorn. \"What, are you, like, retarded? Isn't it obvious, John? Just tell her some shit about Jacin...whatever-her-name-is and show how forward thinking you are - giving a poor, hardworking single Mom an opportunity. Someone who's dedicated their life to the company finally getting a chance to prove themselves. C'mon - it's not that fucking hard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena chuckled, giving you a patronising look as though it were obvious and that you were a simpleton for having to ask Michelle to spell it out for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, sure, right,\" you babbled, feeling your cheeks redden with how effortlessly the gorgeous intern was verbally dominating you. \"I'll get to it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at you as you turned awkwardly away, shaking their heads a little with laughter, the two women stayed exactly where they were. Forcing yourself not to take a backward glance at their attractive, teasing bare feet, you decided to head to Kim's office first. Best to approach the boss rather than risk Jacinta crying foul play for an unfair dismissal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnocking on Kim's door, a curt 'come in!' was followed by a frown and an impatient sigh from the redhead. \"James...twice in one day. What is it now?\" Kim took off her spectacles and abruptly stopped typing at her keyboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in front of her, heart racing, you were at least revealed to see that she had put her pumps back on! \"Er, it's my secretary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about her?\" Kim practically growled, clearly wanting you to spit out whatever the issue was. \"Is it about her being barefoot? Another foot-related issue in the work place?\" She gave you a sardonic smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, no she's fine. It's actually that I was thinking about that 'minorities in the workplace' drive - you know, the one in the meeting last week. About opportunities for all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am aware of that initiative,\" Kim spoke slowly, eyeing you carefully and shrewdly. \"You've found someone to be your secretary, haven't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, yeah, well that's-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James, I commend you for your proactiveness with this particular issue but that's impossible. Jacinta has only been appointed today. It would take a case of gross misconduct to dismiss her during this probationary period,\" the redhead told you matter-of-factly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling stupid for forgetting something so simple, you smiled at her. \"Oh, it was just a question. No problem - I'll see you later!\" Hastily exiting your boss's office before she could further question you, you felt a nasty feeling swirl inside you. What were you to do? The only way of getting rid of Jacinta would be finding a reason to condemn her conduct - that would not be easy of course. Then again, perhaps it was better just to explain to Michelle and Helena that the janitor becoming your new secretary was not a possibility?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a breath, you quickly made your decision...</span></div></div>",

You had accepted that you were Michelle's plaything, that you were totally at her beck and call. If that meant throwing Jacinta under the bus, so you could satisfy her idea of Helena becoming your secretary, then so be it! You had stepped on people before, figuratively speaking of course. The blonde babbling before you would just be the latest in a long line... Yet, having already spoken to Kim, it would deeply suspicious if you somehow managed to set Jacinta up....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mister James...is that...OK?\" She practically gulped, staring wide-eyed at you, chewing her lip nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea popped into your head at once. It made total sense to play on Jacinta's weakness - on her feelings for you! Giving her your best charming smile and earnest eyes, you cleared your throat. \"Jacinta, I...I've been unfair to you. How I've treated you today. Truth be told, it's...it's because of the <i>feelings</i> I have for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at you, her mouth hanging open slightly, the blonde was at a loss for words. \"F-feelings?\" She replied softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Jacinta. I confess!\" You suddenly said with passion, looking at her imploringly. \"I...I honestly thought that I could do it but I can't...working with you is just too much. Jacinta, I am totally besotted with you. I - I have been for some time. The reason why I've been a jerk today is because...because I was kidding myself that I could be harsh and dismissive, trying to force away the truth - that I am so into you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking so giddy that she might faint, Jacinta stumbled toward you, holding one of your hands and breathing heavily. \"James, I...I don't know if you knew...but I - I feel totally the same way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled at her, then looked away sadly for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What is it?\" She looked agitated and squeezed your hand even harder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...well, this is the problem. I want to be with you - it's what I've wanted for a while now. But you as my secretary....I...it's just not a good idea. I suppose I'll have to...resign...stand down. But at least then we can be together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde grabbed at the bait, just as you hoped she would. Crying out incredulously, she shook her head from side to side. \"No! Mister James...you <i>can't</i>! You've waited for so long for this position...It's...it's not <i>fair</i> for you!\" Giving you a determined look, she looked you right in the eye, her pale blue eyes certainly easy to get lost in. \"No, I will resign. I'll step down as secretary - it will be my call. You won't have to take any blame...I'll go to Mrs Kim...I'll tell her that I wasn't ready for this and need to go back to my old job...it's fine...she'll understand...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd do that, for me?\" You smiled at her, squeezing her hand tight. \"Then we can talk this through properly, tonight for dinner...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it turned out that she would! Almost immediately, Jacinta made her way to Kim's office and kept completely true to her word. Kim called you on your office phone to alert you, checking of course if there was any foul play going on. Sticking to your seemingly oblivious story, you feigned disappointment, stating to Kim that Jacinta did seem a little out of her depth but was certainly a kind, hardworking colleague. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"So...what you were saying earlier - about the inclusion initiative...it got me thinking,\" </i>Kim told you over the phone. <i>\"It's your call, James, but if we could get a minority into that position then let me know who you've got in mind.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Er, actually, I was thinking the janitor - Helena. You know she's a single Mom and has been here pretty much her whole working life...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiraculously, Kim seemed to love it. What a great story it would be for the company - the Hispanic janitor getting a promotion and being given such an apprenticeship - the new Junior Manager's secretary! And all due to her hard work and loyalty to the company she had diligently served for years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was some degree of pride, initially at least, when you found the Mexican woman having a cigarette break by the side of the car park. \"There you are, been looking for you!\" You told her cheerily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena breathed smoke in your face, smirking as you spluttered and coughed. \"Gringo. You got my job?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInwardly seething at how rude and ungrateful she was, you adopted another smile. \"Yes, all sorted. The boss says that you can take the rest of the day off and start tomorrow. Before you go, you need to sign a contract in her office and go through some of the necessary formalities-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, I got it,\" your new Hispanic secretary interrupted you, blowing more smoke into your face. Giving you a smirk, she levelled you with a cold stare. \"You better be nice to me. Real nice to me. Miss Michelle - she my friend. She told me not to take any kinda crap from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGritting your teeth, you tried not to rage at the fact that this woman wasn't on her knees thanking you for the opportunity. \"Sure,\" you said in a friendly tone before turning on your heel and leaving her to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking your phone, you saw a WhatsApp from who you realised was Jacinta...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>James...I still can't believe it! It's all so fast but I know it's the right thing for us. Come over to mine tonight so we can talk properly...and get to know each other properly...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you knew that this was the price to pay. It seemed like the most painless way to rid yourself of Jacinta, yet on an out-of-work capacity, it meant having to deal with the aftermath. Looking through the rest of her message, you noticed her address was the other side of town. It would take a good twenty minutes or so cab ride over. Even though you knew it would be potentially risky not to see her, you were sorely tempted just to blow her off...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did you reply with?<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was too risky, <i>far</i> too risky to blow off Jacinta. Especially since she had literally given her career away to be with you. Sighing with defeat, you sent her a friendly but not-too-keen response, agreeing to see her at her place for dinner at 6pm, straight after work. You could practically hear the combination of anticipation and desperation in her reply!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill with a few hours or so of work left, you were alone in your brand-spanking-new office for the remainder of the day. A chance to catch up on some emails, type up a couple of forms....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door swung open and once again you were confronted with the tall, brusque frame of Helena in front of you. Before you could snap something dismissive at her, such as <i>'Don't you know how to knock?\"</i> or <i>'Get the hell out of my office!',</i> Kim surprisingly appeared next to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James! I thought it would be a good idea to meet with the two of you together. You know, talk through expectations, protocols...\" Kim talked breezily while you tried to ignore the smirk on Helena's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...So that will mean a suitable work attire - I know you're still in your..<i>.janitor apparel</i> at the moment,\" Kim explained to the Mexican woman delicately. \"James, <i>ahem</i>, James?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, sure,\" you muttered, distracted by the fact that your new secretary was so damned infuriatingly smug and had got one over you to be in this position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim frowned at you before continuing. The three of you agreed that Helena would be given some of the company's funds to buy new blouses, skirts, trousers, shoes and several other items of clothing. Whatever she bought would be refunded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" your redhead boss concluded. \"Helena has approximately three hours to purchase all of the afore-mentioned items.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour new secretary cleared her throat, garnering both yours and Kim's attention. \"That sounds like a lot of money. I don't have that sort of credit limit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim's eyes sparked. \"Ooh, James can help you out there. James, lend her your credit card. Anything that's purchased, the company will refund,\" she told you curtly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...my credit card?\" You said, a little feebly. \"I mean...it will all get refunded, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim laughed at this, which Helena chimed in with. \"Come on, James. She's your new secretary! She wants to make a good impression! Right, Helena?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, Miss Kim,\" Helena grinned, though her eyes were like daggers as they glinted towards you after taking your credit card. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Kim waved a cheery goodbye and left you two alone, you scowled at her. \"Don't take the piss. It's not like you need that much... Just get what Kim told you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mouth curling into a sneer, Helena walked slowly forward, a confident look about her. Up close, you could smell a heady combination of perfume and bleach. \"Fuck off, gringo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mouth hanging open in disbelief, she gave you a dirty look before turning away and stalking out of the office, your credit card in hand. The gall of her! To tell you to fuck off, right to your face, in your own office...! Yet, you were too surprised to even conjure up a response. Plus, the Mexican bitch was so pally with Michelle that she could say pretty much anything to you and not have to worry about the consequences...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing and trying to focus on your work, you merely hoped that Helena would be modest with her choices in her work clothes and shoes. <i>Michelle would be loving this</i>, you mused grimly. For a moment, your mind wandered to the image of both the brunette and Helena, feet propped up on the comfy office chairs while you mopped away at the floor. Both had gorgeous soles; Michelle's were so soft and well-taken care of...Helena's were coarser but still very attractive....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping out of your daydream, you finally resumed in some work tasks, the time getting closer to 4:30 pm. At long last, your office door swung open to reveal a triumphant Helena, wearing a smart, black pencil skirt and white blouse. Her curvy figure was much more evident than her cleaning skivvies could ever reveal, you had to admit. She also had new black open-toed heels, a new hairstyle so that it curved up at her shoulders a little, clearly new makeup and foundation applied...plus a few bags in her hands....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...that looks like a lot of stuff...\" you muttered darkly, as Helena handed you back her credit card. \"What was the damage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's not all of it...\" She chuckled. \"I needed some help....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Michelle strode into the office, also with a new hairstyle, although hers was more similar to before. Like Helena, she was adorned with a new dress, black with white polka dots and was still barefoot! Though her toenails were a light-pink colour and looking totally delicious. Looking her up and down, you could not help but admire how hot she looked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, Michelle...I, er, didn't know you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour voice trailed off as the petite brunette clicked her fingers at a couple of male worker drones, each one giving you an awkward grin as they deposited dozens of shopping bags - Laura Ashley, Gucci, Ted Baker, Dolce and Gabbana...the designer names became a blur as you stared uneasily at the vast amount of shopping the two women had just completed.  Michelle smiled and thanked the guys who both looked as though they had won the lottery to be talked directly to by her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya, ya, Jeff,\" Michelle gave you a dismissive wave of a dainty hand as you started to babble again. \"Helena told me that the company was paying for as many office clothes as we needed! So, like, thank you so much! You really listened earlier when I told you how hard things have been for Helena, didn't you? I mean, this is a great start at helping her! The last couple of transactions wouldn't go through, so I had to use my Daddy's credit card for those.\" She pouted at you for a moment. \"You'll reimburse me for those, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a little faint. \"Um, the...the last transactions wouldn't go through? I've got a $12,000 limit and it's only the start of the month...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle shrugged. \"So? The company will, like, give it back anyway,\" she told you with such confidence and authority that you found yourself nodding dumbly. \"Anyway, the last two things were these Gucci shoes and my new pedicure! I've got the receipts here with all the others. So give me back what you owe me in cash - $900 will cover it.\" The brunette handed you a plethora of receipts, so many that you had to quickly drop them onto your desk in case they scattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were literally lost for words. Naively, you imagined that a few hundred dollars would suffice! A couple of blouses, skirts, a new pair of shoes...yet Helena had clearly gone straight to Michelle, who had eagerly shown the Mexican woman how to spend money quickly and easily at a shopping mall on expensive clothes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPowerless to do anything other than nod and try not to think too much about the fact that you be attempting to claim this high--end fashion collection back, the two women began perusing through their various purchases, giggling at the different outfits, some of which clearly weren't even appropriate for work. Helena had several Victoria's Secret lingerie sets, which you could not help but stare at. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, now just about 5 o'clock, Helena and Michelle departed, both with a selection of the bags with them - the rest left kept neatly by your new secretary's desk - as they chatted animatedly and ignoring you as they walked away. <i>Over thirteen thousand dollars...no way would Kim sign off on that being reimbursed!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over the receipts, you accepted that this was going to be a costly situation for you. If you tried to claim any more than a thousand dollars' worth, there would be uproar in the Accounts' Department. Sorting out the paper bills into two piles, ignoring pretty much anything that was a smaller size - Michelle's obviously - you spent the next hour or so trying out various combinations, whittling it down until you had $1500 worth to claim. Plus, you had to give cash to that damned brat Michelle...what a deal she had got out of all of this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Crap! </i>You were supposed to be at Jacinta's. It was gone 6:15 pm...not a good start to your apparent courtship with her! Sending her a quick, apologetic WhatsApp to explain you were delayed, you tore out of the office building and headed straight to hers...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You made it!\" Jacinta grinned as she opened the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping, you could not help but allow your eyes to wander up and down. Jacinta looked <i>hot</i>. <i>Seriously hot!</i> Wearing a white, silky dressing gown, she allowed her ample breasts, held in a lacy black bra to peer out at you, her creamy-white skin looking smooth and soft. Of course, you could not help but notice that she had no shoes on and had bright red nail varnish on her toes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look...great!\" You returned a grin before stepping into her apartment. Once inside, it was obvious that Jacinta was on a much lower pay scale to you. Her place was modest, simple and a lot smaller than yours. Ushering you into her kitchen, which also served as a dining room, the blonde woman eagerly presented to you a steak with mashed potatoes and broccoli on the side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a little cold,\" she gave you a brief reprimanding look, which you took as a cue to apologise for your lateness. Pouring you both a glass of red wine, you found yourself staring at Jaci, your eyes wandering over to her breasts, her legs, her feet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling, she used a bare foot to brush against your leg, which took a certain amount of self-control of yours not to moan with pleasure. Maybe this was a blessing, maybe Jacinta was the one for you? She had harboured such a crush on you for years...now she wasn't your secretary this could be a really good thing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, tell me more about what you were saying earlier. You know...\" She went a little pink for a moment. \"About your...feelings for me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn between mouthfuls of your cold but still tasty dinner, you allowed yourself to blabber about how much you had lusted after her, how you never fault you stood a chance...things like this - being manipulative and deceitful came pretty easily to you. It was made you such a successful worker, now manager at the company! Jaci seemed to buy it, gushing and almost squealing with excitement as you fawned over how much you had waited for this moment with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job I'm not your secretary...can you imagine if we were still working together! Imagine the tension...the awkwardness! Who's replacing me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou informed her briefly about Kim's initiative - to have Helena basically promoted. Keeping it firmly as her idea, not yours, Jacinta winced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Mister...sorry, <i>James</i>, I know how much you hate her! God, that's gonna be an...experience for you!\" She chuckled a little, apologising straight after. \"Sorry, it's just...just the idea of you having to work with her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoying Jacinta showing this teasing, much less tense side, it was clear that now things were out in the open with the two of you (or so she thought, at least), she could be herself. Less meek and submissive. More fun! You liked it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for things to progress: from the table to the sofa where you found yourself unable to resist her any longer. Kissing her with passion, you pulled off her dressing gown so that you could feel her lacy bra...before removing that too! Topless, with only black lacy pants on, Jacinta laid fully on top of you; she didn't weigh much but it was a wonderful sensation having her smother your face with her breasts and have her groin rub against yours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of this, your shirt and trousers were off so you were only in your boxers. Jacinta was kissing your neck, still lying on top of you and breathing heavily, her face flushed with excitement. More minutes passed and she slid a hand down towards your groin, slipping it inside your underwear. Letting out a small 'oh!' of surprise, you gulped before holding her up slightly to talk to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...what is it?\" You asked, feeling your heart beat faster. Unfortunately, you knew already what it was. Your dick had not started to harden; even though you were enjoying this foreplay with Jaci, it had proved virtually impossible in the past to get a hard-on without the thought of women's bare feet. You had been with quite a few girls and your strategy of picturing ex's or other famous female celebrity feet had never failed you. In fact, it made you so rock hard that the woman you were being intimate with would be impressed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's, er...is everything OK?\" She asked, looking a little uncertain. \"Is it...me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no!\" You told her reassuringly. \"Can just take a little bit of time....\" Before you closed your eyes to begin imagining female feet, you stark thought hit you. <i>What if you confided in Jacinta? </i> She seemed to genuinely like and trust you...could this be the opportunity to have a meaningful relationship with a woman and get to indulge in your foot fetish? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be risky! What if she was repulsed or freaked out? Instead, you chose to picture bare feet...gorgeous, slightly wrinkled soft bare soles...one pair smaller and flawless...another pair longer, more bronze in colour...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInwardly sighing, you realised who the feet belonged too...Michelle and Helena! Unable to shake their sexy feet from your mind and replace them with others, you opened your eyes, already your erection building and Jacinta giggling happily. If you did close your eyes again to achieve total arousal, it would be with your nemeses' feet...! Or was it now time to trust in Jacinta...explore your fetish with <i>her</i> feet?</span></div></div>",

I'm so sorry James. I completely forgot that you found my feet disgusting. I'll go put something on them right away.\" She starts to stand up and walk away, only for you to put a hand on her shoulder and pull her back down on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's not it.

I've kept it under control, but when I saw yours, I just froze up until you put your shoes on. I'm sorry if you misunderstood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But now, here I am, about to make love with such a beautiful woman,\" she giggles a bit at you referring to her as beautiful, \"and I can't get it up without thinking about her feet.

You were almost lost in her crimson nails. You snap your attention back to her when you hear her clear her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then James, how about a little... <i>foreplay</i> before we get to the steamy parts?\" She asks with a seductive purr while licking her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay.\" You stutter. \"What do you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the floor, hands and knees. Right now.\" She orders, pointing down near her feet. You quickly scramble off the couch and sit by her feet in the position she requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, so eager, aren't we lover?\" She jokingly asks. \"Now then, how this is going to work is simple. I am your queen, your goddess, your everything, and I have granted you the honor of being my lover. Now hiw will you show me your gratitude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a second wasted, you dive at her feet and begin to kiss the tops, causing her to giggle at the feeling of your lips on her feet. \"Thank you *chic my goddess. *chic You grace me *chic with such a great *chic honor.\" You say in between kisses. You take this opportunity to memorize the look and feel of her feet for later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, January is loving this. Both at the idea of you being so enamored by her, as well as how good it felt for the roles to be switched, even if it is only for a few minutes. She then gets the sight she was hoping for as she sees that you're pitching a tent in your boxers. Perfect, now that she had you all nice and ready, what does she want to do next?</span></div></div>",

Surely she wouldn't be harsh on you, especially considering what a crush she'd had on you for years...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jacinta...It's OK, right?\" You asked her, unable to keep the nervousness out of your voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like...<i>feet</i>?\" She spoke in a disbelieving tone. \"You actually get off on...<i>feet</i>?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice becoming ever derisive, you knew that this was not a favourable reaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jacinta, please...It's...it's no big deal...\" You murmured unconvincingly, backtracking far too late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarrowing her eyes at you, her eyes now full of scorn rather than stone, she shook her head. \"You're a freak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This was exactly what you had feared...why you had never confided your secret in anyone before...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could even open your mouth to retort, she roughly shoved you off her. \"James, you are a perverted freak! Who gets off on feet. Just the thought of it...the idea of you needing my <i>feet</i> to turn you on...you're sick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was being so harsh! Feeling genuinely hurt, all bravado and confidence swept away from you, you gulped up at her from the haphazard position you were on below her on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out!\" She snarled at you, getting to her feet and pointing to the door. \"Get out, you fucking <i>foot freak</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeez, this really could not have gone any worse. Awkwardly rising to your feet, you walked slowly over to her, your hands held out placatingly. \"Please...Jacinta...I do...I really like you....I....\" Your words trailed off as Jacinta swiftly knee'd you in the balls. <br>\r\n\"What...wh-why...?!\" You gasped, dropping to your knees in sheer agony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You probably got off on that too, didn't you freak! Now crawl out of my apartment. Go on - get out! I don't want to see your stupid foot-loving-face again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPain blinding you, you had little choice but to shuffle slowly forwards on all fours towards the front door. Realising you were just in your boxers still, Jacinta hurled your other clothes roughly over to you as though reading your mind. Not even daring to mutter a thanks, you tucked them under an arm and continued to head out of the blonde's apartment. You didn't even have the nerve to get changed before you left; deciding to do that outside her apartment, when the pain had subsided a little, you were luckily were left unseen. The one - and only - bit of luck you had got today!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat an absolute shit storm! That went far, far worse than you could ever have imagined. Then again, you weren't exactly desperate to get into a relationship with Jacinta - or anyone from the office for that matter. The idea of her accepting your fetish and allowing you to...explore it...well, that did seem like a tempting, novel idea. But not now! Heading straight home, you were so physically and mentally exhausted from the day's events, you fell asleep instantly. Plagued, or perhaps blessed by dreams surrounding - at different points - Michelle's, Helena's and Jacinta's bare feet, you found yourself weakly jerking off to a particular image of Michelle wiggling her delicious toes in your face while laughing at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, you had a horrible feeling in your gut. How was Jacinta going to react? She had sacrificed her new job for you...gone to Kim with a faux-story of why she wasn't ready for being a secretary! She had committed career suicide, basically, all with the assurance that she was going to be with her supposed dream guy! Also, you remembered how much money Helena and Michelle had spent using your credit card. You needed to claim back a very small chunk of that and grudgingly accept that they had got yet another one over you! Plus giving Michelle $900 in cash for her unnecessary purchases...the nerve! Arriving at the office at your usual time, you waved off Jenny who seemed keen to chat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not today Jen - got too much to sort first thing! Catch you for a coffee later?\" You asked her briefly, she shrugged her shoulders and seemed visibly put out. <i>Great, another person to have to deal with...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately you were there before Helena arrived. Or was that a good thing? Your new secretary should be prompt, keen and easily dominated. <i>Fat chance with this aggressive, take-no-prisoners former janitor!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGathering up the receipts to take to accounts, Jacinta suddenly appeared at the doorway!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jacinta...I....what do you...\" you babbled at her while she narrowed her eyes at you - a bit like she did at her apartment last night, causing shivers to run down your spine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just be quiet and listen to me...\" She said ominously before closing the door behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Jacinta want?</span></div></div>",

Was she even doing any work? You had failed to set her any real tasks since she returned to your office...then again, showing her bare feet under her desk was the only task she needed to do! Once again, your eyes dropped down, like magnets towards them, making your pants actually start to tighten. What did you want, deep down?

But to be honest, I expected that. I've seen how you are around people - you're sharp, direct...you <i>dominate</i>.

You've gone all creepy...you've actually been...staring at my feet!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStating it out loud makes your hear beat fast, both from fear and excitement. You've always kept your fetish well-hidden at work, for all of the reasons she verbalised at why people respected you. Of course, you would never have got to the lofty heights of Junior Manager if you turned to jello a woman showed her beautiful feet to you! Perhaps if you hadn't encountered Michelle...or been chastised by Kim...maybe then, the idea of Jacinta taking off her shoes wouldn't have phased you - something you could have ridiculed her about and nipped in the bud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, she was totally right. You were being <i>weird</i>. Still, it was taking you far too long to respond to her...adding credence to her assessment of you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what is it?\" She looked at you curiously, her expression difficult to read. \"Do you...like feet or something?\"</span></div></div>",

On the inside, you were still dearly tempted to drop to your knees and indulge in your fetish with Jacinta's pale, creamy-looking feet. It would be very, <i>very</i> convenient in so many ways. However, the rational side of you had taken over and was preventing you from submitting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Now, Jacinta. I'm willing to put this all behind us.

Anyway, put it there - no hard feelings and things can go back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding out your hand to her, Jacinta looked both disappointed but contemplative at the same time.

Not the work you, but the <i>real</i> you. And what have you done this morning? You've treated me like a piece of shit! Talking to me like crap, pretending to ask me out...\" The blonde stood in front of you, quivering a little from anger, still barefoot. \"OK...I admit that was kinda hot...but had I known you were one of those perverts into <i>feet</i>...!\" She actually laughed out loud for a moment. \"So, yeah, that's it. I'm the boss now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Jacinta, please...we can...let's deal with this properly.

Do exactly what I tell you or I tell the entire office about your pervy little secret. I could even do you for sexual harassment!\" She stared at you both challengingly and contentiously as you found yourself literally shrinking into your chair. \"OK, first thing's first. Get out of MY chair. This will my desk now! You can have the piece of crap over there that you expected me to work at...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPointing disgustedly at the meagre desk the other side of the room, you knew that you were in another hopeless situation. <i>First Michelle, now Jacinta...</i> As you slowly stepped from your desk, leaving your luxurious leather office chair carefully tucked back in, you shuffled awkwardly across the room under Jacinta's intense stare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I didn't say go to your new desk yet....no. I need some leverage first - just in case you try to turn anyone against me, try some of your politicking crap, which I know all too well about...\" your 'secretary' strolled past you, settling down comfortably on her new chair, at her large, expansive, mahogany desk. Nodding with approval, she lifted her legs up, crossing her bare feet over and staring expectantly at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what do you...what is it?\" You mumbled at her, wishing that this was all a joke...some sort of first day as Junior Manager prank. Perhaps you had fallen asleep and this was all a nightmare. However, staring weakly at Jacinta's creamy, beautiful soles, you knew that this was a situation that was more than arousing, despite the humbling nature of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smug look on her face, Jacinta held out her phone. \"Leverage, you idiot. Don't you listen? Now be a good little foot boy and kneel down in front of your new boss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnees shaking, you felt compelled to do so. This Jacinta, this confident, dominant version, was totally different to the woman you had known. Gone was the meek, humble secretary eager to please you. Here she was, ordering you around, talking down to you...ultimately making you feel a little in awe of her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding out her phone directly at you, she grinned. \"OK, <i>Mister James</i>. All you have to do is kiss my feet a few times. Think you can manage that? While you do so, I'll just ask you a couple of questions...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of total defeat sweeping over you, you felt your face leaning in, allowing the slightly sharp, cheddary aroma of her bare soles flood into your nostrils. This made you light-headed and even more pliable as you licked your lips, preparing to do as your new boss told you. God, her feet were beautiful...pale but in a wonderfully creamy way....her feet were well taken care of...there was a slight peachy tinge to the heels, just below the toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, here I have Junior Manager - <i>Mister James</i> - at the feet of his secretary. Foot boy - kiss my feet like the loser you are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLips trembling, you moved even closer so you were practically brushing them against her silky smooth soles...for a second yo caught her eye; the look on her face was one of triumph. <i>She was about to destroy your career and you were just going to...accept it?!</i> Then again, did you even have the option to resist at this point - her feet were so delectable after all!</span></div></div>",

Like a puppy dog, you leaned forward and lavished her feet with your tongue, moaning in pleasure as you licked rapidly all over - from her heel to the toes, all around her delightful arches and slightly wrinkled centres...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of her triumphant laughter barely registered, yet it made you close your eyes and groan inwardly. <i>You should stop, you should stop, STOP!</i> Repeating that over and over so faded and crumbled away as you realised how much you were simply loving the flavour and feel of her delectable soles on your tongue. This was what your tongue was MADE for! It felt so right...it was sheer bliss! Letting out an even louder moan of pleasure, you just about noticed Jacinta shake her head back and laugh, her whole body convulsing with hysteria rather than pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, <i>Mister James</i>, you clearly looove my feet! I told you to kiss them, but licking is good too!\" She said in a mock-reprimanding tone. Holding the phone in front of you, you felt so weak and inferior to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S...sorry...\" You gasped, your voice quivering and high-pitched. \"I...er...your...f-feet...th-they're...too....good....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling your pants tent sporting now a giant hard-on, you instinctively felt your pelvis thrust forward, desperate to achieve some sort of climax. Jacinta noticed this too, snorts of laugher emanating from her horsey face as she continued to savour and enjoy your total surrender and humiliation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're mine...your <i>my footboy</i> now....\" She leaned in, whispering in your ear with a cold malice that made the hairs on your neck stand on end. Yet you were powerless to resist. A small, diminishing voice was telling you that this was a mistake, that it was a bad idea, however you were on a powerful steam train, approaching the tunnel of pleasure fast....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it, keep squirming around with that little worm of yours...keep shaking and trembling while you lick my bare feet....I am going to OWN you, <i>Mister James</i>, you are going to be beneath me....I am going to be your boss...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all too much for you, letting out a whining, almost strangled noise, your whole body twitched and spasmed, your tongue weakly caressing Jacinta's pale, creamy soles as you did so. Completing your orgasm weakly, you felt your pants cream and the physical exertion forced you to drop limply to the side, in a broken, quivered heap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's a cut!\" Jacinta giggled triumphantly from above you. \"Now let me email that to myself now...\" While you lay, defeated, on the floor, the realisation of what you had done began to sunk in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Jacinta owned you now, for life!</i> That video of you surrendering pathetically at her feet meant that there was no turning back now; you couldn't talk or negotiate your way out of this one. Your decline had been so, so rapid that it felt like this had to be a nightmare. Starting off the day as the new Junior Manager...being embarrassed by the intern...to licking your secretary's feet while she basically blackmailed you...it couldn't all be real!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs though you needed a stark reminder, you sensed Jacinta hop up onto her new desk, her legs dangling over the edge so that her bare feet could rest casually on the side of your face. Despite all of the abject humiliation you had just suffered, you found yourself admittedly enjoying the sensation of having her soft, freshly-licked feet stepping on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealising that this was more to wipe off your saliva, you could not find the nerve to even consider looking her in the eye. All you could let out was a weak, \"Sorry, Jacinta...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry?!\" She snorted from above you. \"Oh, no - 'sorry' is not the word for you to be using, Mister James! I've broken you - I've won! And I've given you what you ALWAYS wanted - to be under the feet of a powerful, dominant woman like me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could stop yourself, you found yourself agreeing with her. \"Th-thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! You are so pathetic! I've just made you surrender to your dirty little fetish, cum in your pants like the total sissy boy you are, and here you are - lying at my feet, thanking me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe may have mocked you for it, but deep down, you knew that she was right. Ever since you realised that you had a foot fetish, you had yearned for a woman to humiliate and demean you with her feet. All of that macho bravado you demonstrated was a front - a way of getting by and convincing yourself that you could be an alpha, a 'real' man. Now that Jacinta had witnessed your subjugation to her, there was no turning back. That front, that act had fizzled away and left this broken, pathetic heap on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK....\" Jacinta said, using her toenails to gently brush against your face. \"What shall we do first....\"</span></div></div>",

You had to do something soon, lest Jacinta get bored and blow the whistle on you right now or somebody else enter your office and see you in such a compromising position. You needed something, anything that could turn the tables in your favor, or at least put you both on neutral ground.

It's not much, but if you were ever going to get on the offensive, this was it. You rise back up to your feet and dust off your pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing <i>Mister James</i>? I never told you that you were allowed to stand up. Now you'll be going from being my little puppy to being my doormat.\" She threatens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite.\" You retort with the sound of your previous confidence returning, making Jacinta retreat back a little. \"You see, I'm not the only one here with an exploitable fetish, Jacinta. Ever since you questioned my fetish, you've been going on and on about how controlling and dominant I am and how that just made your panties damp. You're a total masochist that gets off on being ordered around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe goes a bit red in the face before snapping back. \"Yeah, so? You're a foot boy that gets off on women's feet, what's your point?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think for a second, if you did the things I made you do just because I was confident enough, how long do you think it would take for some asshole to march in here, slam his hands on your desk, and make you <i>his</i> bitch?\" You muse. Jacinta's face, meanwhile, is getting redder and redder at bith the truth of your words, and the assertiveness you're saying them with that made her want to go out with you to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what happens if some pretty lady comes in here barefoot and waves her peds all over your office? Then you'll be just as much of a mess as I am.\" She fires back, trying to regain momentum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why I propose a little agreement between us. We both keep each other's... interests quiet from the rest of the office. Meanwhile, after hours, we can go out. We'll indulge each other's fetishes and keep them from overwhelming us at work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe begins to give serious thought to your offer. Meanwhile, you continue. \"Or we can just both drop this and go back to pretending that none of this ever happened. Either way, though, I promise I will start to not treat you so cruelly.

Consider this an official warning. You have made a serious error of judgment. This little brat is only with us for six weeks.

Do everything she tells you to?! \"Kim, please...I know I've made a mistake...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James!\" She roared, standing up and looming over you menacingly, a look of utter fury about her. \"Don't you understand how serious this is?

You've been warned officially - the next time it will cost your new position...and maybe your entire career here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding wisely to stay silent, you merely nodded, knowing you had been humbled.

Taking in a deep breath, you resumed your breathing techniques from Karate, checking the pulse rate on your Fitbit - alarmed to see that it was well over 130!

Anyway, I want to know about a few people at this crappy organisation. I want to make sure that I have them, like, totally doing what I want them to - like you!\" Giggling for a moment, she wiggled her toenails. \"So, I want to know about those two receptionists. One went home earlier...\" She frowned for a moment, while you steadied your face to avoid betraying any information about what you did to Candice this morning. \"And the cleaner - I've learned from Daddy that you need to know enough even about the little people! Most of all though, I want, like, ALL of the info and goss on the boss - Kim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-Kim?

Yet, she did seem to enjoy the fact that you were averting eye contact now, almost as if in a sign of submission - of a weaker animal avoiding the gaze of a stronger predator! However, staring at her gorgeous feet meant you were missing out on key information that you probably needed to know!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did you do - continued to stare at her feet and figure out later her instructions, or wrench your head upwards so you could actually focus on what she was telling you?</span></div></div>",

Remembering your task, you groaned inwardly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Jenny...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead receptionist was not only your friend but your ally. Betraying her trust to Michelle would surely cost you that relationship but what choice did you have?!

Here he is...our new Junior Manager...\" Jenny called over to you, grinning as you approached. \"Twice in one day; what do I owe this pleasure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hi Jenny...\" You paused, searching for an idea. To be fair, you knew very little about your friend's private life. You knew that she was single, was generally effective at her job, liked Game of Thrones and rock music...but she had never given you anything that be considered 'dirt'...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up?\" Jenny frowned at you. \"Aren't you supposed to chastise me and explain how it's 'Mister James'? And shouldn't you be gloating still about the fact that poor old Candice hasn't come back to work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose personal victories and gentle ribbing of your new promotion would normally make you swell with pride and exchange some banter with the redhead. Yet, all you could feel was an uneasiness in your gut. You couldn't be the confident, cocky braggart anymore. Not now that you were Michelle's pet. Your boss, Kim, had even <i>told</i> you to do everything the arrogant newbie instructed you to. Of course, with her being barefoot around you, you felt pretty helpless anyway...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James? Seriously what is it?\" Jenny was now looking more concerned than exasperated. \"Is it Denise? I know she's been on the warpath ever since the...<i>incident</i>...with Candice earlier.\" Your friend smiled for a moment. \"But what's new, hey?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Warpath...?\" You gulped a little. Normally, the idea of Denise wanting to get one over on you was something to relish - a challenge where you knew that you could outsmart and outthink her. Since you've been humbled thoroughly by Michelle and agreed to do her bidding, for the sake of your own career, you felt overawed and full of trepidation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you know... You and Denise....there's always been a rivalry, a competition between you two. Yeah, I know you're a high-flying manager now, but...\" Jenny leans in a little closer, as though confiding in you. \"She knows, James. She knows that you spilt the coffee on purpose...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not going well at all! The whole point of coming over to Jenny's desk at reception was to get some dirt on her, not feel worried about what Denise was going to do to you! In your peripheral vision, you saw a slender figure with dark blonde hair heading towards you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, here she is...\" Jenny says, her eyes flashing excitedly, clearly ready and eager to see a verbal back-and-forth between the two of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould you have the stones to deal with Denise right now? If you were quick, you could make a very hasty exit and avoid your nemesis!</span></div></div>",

She would end up being dangerous if you let her have her way all the time, yet the initial thought of that exhilarated you more than you would hope for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were now just in front of Kim's door. You fixed your suit and put a professional smile on as you entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James! Good to see you! How has your day been, I presume the Junior Manager has had a lot to do for his first day!\" Kim quickly looked at you entering the room, shifting her gaze from the stash of documents in front of her.<br>\r\n\"Hey, Kim, yes you could say I have! I got a couple of clients in two hours and I am almost ready to close them!\" You said as you shifted to your Fitbit, realizing that your pulse is normal and you had regained your composure.<br>\r\n\"That's great, James. I suppose you have something else to tell me, or else you wouldn't be here.\" Kim nodded as she was reordering her desk to waste some time.<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, there is an intern, her name is Michelle. She is waiting for you next to my office.\" You said calmly, not making it sound awkward.<br>\r\n\"Oh my, I totally forgot! I have had a lot of paperwork to deal with recently so I totally switched off about that. I will be right there.\" Kim looked a bit stressed, that was unlike her. She was usually amazingly composed when it came to these things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs Michelle hiding something?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cUmmm..e-excuse me Mr. Harris,\u201d came a soft-spoken, almost meek voice from the doorway that you recognized instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lost count of how many conniving little cunts have tried to keep you down over the years, but you could always count on Jenny to watch your back. She was, and will always be your best friend. Through all of the workplace politics and HR bullshit Denise and her lapdog put you through she stood by you through the thick of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked out for you; you looked out for her. It was no doubt the best decision you ever made bumping into her when you were running late for a meeting. All it took was stain remover on her clothes to finally get her to open up, and everyday since you and her were damn near inseparable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two were also an odd couple in how different your personalities and goals were. She was the mild-mannered, meek and courteous receptionist who knew her place and always tried to make friends with everyone whom she worked with. You were the young and hungry novice, always trying to move up while she was satisfied remaining stationery. In the end, your ambition and drive landed you the esteemed position of Junior Manager while she\u2019s remained by her secretarial role. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019ve told her time and time again that she\u2019s better than that, that she deserves more than constantly being at her superior\u2019s beck and call. But Jenny, ever the humble one, insists that being an office assistant is where she feels more comfortable at. Her \u201ctrue calling,\u201d she calls it. But that\u2019s just the kind of woman she is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd more importantly than all that, she was the only woman in this whole damned office who you found attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, besides other woman for more...superficial reasons of course. But Jenny was genuine, definitely more likeable than those artificial bimbos in business professional. You always wanted to ask her out for a coffee, maybe see where the conversation goes and if she feels the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFraternization amongst co workers had always been frowned upon by the company, but now with this extra boost of confidence you saw no reason why not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, you\u2019re your own boss now. <br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nJenny was dressed to impress, as always. Her fashion sense has always been conservative and inoffensive and today was no different.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWearing a ruffled grey cardigan sweater with a white top and a pencil thin skirt that ended at her knees, her usually flowing red hair was tied in a secretarial bun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever one to exaggerate her height or impose her towering presence like some women you knew with high heels, her dainty bare feet were confined in a pair of noticeably tight leopard skin ballet flats with pointed toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes involuntarily wandered for a bit downward toward her petite feet almost popping out of the rather worn footwear, lingering on that for a moment before meeting her friendly gaze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJenny, I told you last week to keep calling me James,\" you scolded her playfully, \"Guess you heard the good news, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering your office with her eyes lit up with slight awe, she eventually stopped behind one of your leather chairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t think of a better guy for the job. You totally deserve it!\u201d she beamed right back at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot as much I deserve this little bundle of cuteness standing before me!\u201d you grinned coyly, smirking at just how squeamish and adorable her body language was becoming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJames, stop it! You know we\u2019re not supposed to talking like this in the office,\u201d she finally giggled in her trademark girlish delirium, before closing the door. \u201c<i>You know who</i> might be listening.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho, Denise?\u201d you scoffed, waving your hand dismissively. \u201cShe\u2019s probably crying in some cubicle and blowing her nose on Candace\u2019s blouse right now anyways.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, well speaking of\u2026\u201d Faltering slightly, she began shifting her feet nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you knew what that meant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJenny?\u201d you finally prompted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Finding solace in your eyes, she reluctantly came clean, \u201cWhen I was in the break room, earlier this morning, Denise was talking about you and how like, unfair your promotion was. She was...really, <i>really </i>mad. But before you could mad, James, I didn\u2019t mean to snoop or anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you\u2019re not that kind of person, Jenny,\u201d you assured her, before nodding, \u201cWhat else did you hear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026.\u201d Choosing her next words very carefully, she locked eyes with you, and proceeded to freeze your heart mid-beat. \u201cShe was talking about how she\u2019s going to expose your secret in front of the office.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour calming smile quickly vanished right off your face, replaced by a very worrying frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRetreating into your own mind, your paranoia instantly shot into overdrive at the mere mention of that word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Secret? That fucking bitch knows nothing about me. Nothing! But what about that one time-<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<i>\u201cNo,\u201d</i> you told yourself adamantly, quickly convincing yourself that there was no possible way Denise could know about <i>that</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even if she did, noone would believe her. Without any proof, without any tangible evidence, it\u2019s just hearsay. And the story of the jealous subordinate trying to get back at the new manager who \u2018stole\u2019 her position is one that you could masterfully spin to H.R. should it come to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at her, you scratched your chin in brief contemplation, before asking one last followup just to be sure. \u201cShe go into any specifics about what that secret might be, just out of curiosity?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny gave a halfhearted shrug. \u201cUnfortunately no James. She just kept going on and on about how it\u2019s going to utterly destroy you, and how you\u2019ll be groveling at her feet for this not to come out in public-\u201d You instinctively cringed a little at the mention of Denise\u2019s feet, but held your tongue as she finished, \u201cBut besides that, she was sounding like some kind of Saturday morning cartoon villain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, she is pretty delusional so that wouldn\u2019t surprise me,\u201d you agreed with her, still wrestling with your suspicions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasic instinct told you that Denise did know something (she certainly wouldn't be flaunting it in such a public area if she was just bluffing), but then again, she\u2019s also one of, if not the biggest liars you\u2019ve ever met in your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth ends of the argument wore away at your decision making process like a mental tug-of-war, forcing you to come to a compromise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess there\u2019s only way to find out if Denise isn\u2019t totally full of crap,\u201d you sighed, voicing your decision out loud to the redhead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm sir?\u201d she nervously stepped to the side as you cracked your knuckles eagerly, a weary yet determined king ready to publicly humiliate his greatest nemesis one last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to pay Denise a little visit down to her office, and get to the bottom of this once and for all,\u201d you told her matter-of-factly, no hesitation in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was your kingdom now, and it\u2019s time that dear ol\u2019 Denise realized that she\u2019s no longer facing off with her equal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, you were the alpha, and she\u2019s about to find out what being on the receiving end of getting royally fucked over feels like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou coming?\u201d you offered the still startled woman, walking around your desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want me to James, I will but I don\u2019t see why I need-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding up a hand, you pointed out, \u201cWhatever happens in her office, I need a third party to witness it. And if Denise tries to pull something and make me out to be the bad guy, I\u2019m gonna need your eyes and ears wide open. Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking for a moment, Jenny nodded her head in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool. Let\u2019s go put the big bad witch in her place once and for all!\u201d you smiled at Jenny confidently, leaving the office with the receptionist right on your heels. </span></div></div>",

Not to mention that she was definitely in good shape, as she was no more than 110 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer clothing consisted of a button-down shirt, brown leather jacket, black knee socks, tight shorts and sneakers. Beautiful, yet something was off, it was definitely not sticking to the dress code of the firm, which caught you off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're speaking to him. May I know your name and what did you need of me?\" You acted as politely as possible, as you were not sure, who the person opposing to you may be and ruining your chances right off the bat would definitely be a bad start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect! My name is Michelle, the new intern-in-training. The manager, Kim, told me to come to pay you a visit. Thanks for having me in the firm.\" Michelle smiled at you, as she got closer and sat on the chair opposing you and took her sneakers off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise, Michelle...\" As you were returning the greetings, you were caught off guard by her beautiful feet, which were covered in revealing nylon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyhow, she told me that I should learn the roots from her right-hand man, so it may look better on my resume, that I have trained under one of the biggest firm's Junior Manager\" She explained, having a smirk on her face based on your reaction and even slightly dangled her feet up, for her soles to be fully shown for a split second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if that's the case, then I can't decline\" You faked a cough as you regained your composure and looked her straight in the eyes. \"We can begin tomorrow, as I have a few important clients scheduled for today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh... too bad, I was expecting to start learning from the first-hand experience right away\" Michelle sighed, as her face shortly after resembled one of a puppy as she continued to dangle her feet even higher than previously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, I guess I could show you how I deal with important clients, would you want to stay and wait with me?\" Did your voice just crack and stutter? And why did you suggest such an absurd thing without even confirming the small intern's story?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, wonderful! You are the best, Mr James!\" She smiled as she rose back to her feet and took the chair next to you, as she sat close to you. \"So who is your first client and what is the plan of action to get their signature?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite you not wanting to admit it, Michelle definitely got one on you and made you agree to her query immediately. You had never let your guard down, however, you were entranced by this intern for a short conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething wasn't exactly right and you knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After taking a glimpse at it and realizing the situation, you slowed down your breathing and normalized your pulse in no time using your Karate techniques. With that, you looked straight at Michelle, which was keeping an eye on you as a few giggles escaped her mouth, which resulted in you checking if there was something on your clothes or on your hair. This girl was just an intern and she got you flustered in a matter of seconds! You are the king! You can't let someone take your spot or shake your confidence!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My first client is Stephanie Beachwood. She is a shareholder of the biggest clothing firm in the state, as such, she will be a valuable asset to have as a partner of the firm. What I have prepared for her are what I like to call the three top fundamentals of selling. Distract them with something they want, gain control over the situation and last but not least, leave them speechless and unable to refuse.\" You said, as the businessman in you spoke, with high pride and confidence, as you were THE Junior Manager, and the client was to be but a walk in the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Distract, dominate and amazed. Got it, Mr James!\" Michelle said with a smile, which was appearing more so devilish than innocent. That gave you the creeps, however, you decided to ignore her and move on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later, you heard a knock on your office and smiled as Stephanie entered. At first she was doubtful that you would be the firm for the job, however, it took you only a quarter of an hour to convince her that you were the best in town and the firm for her to sign with. You were proud of yourself, as that was a personal record, not only for you but for the firm, especially with such an important client. If you kept going like that, by the end of the month you might even be able to overtake Kim, you thought, bolstering about your upcoming success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was odd, however, was that Michelle wasn't exactly paying attention to the discussing and taking notes. Instead, she was looking both at Stephanie and you during the confrontation and evil yet, elaborate smirk could be seen on her lips from your peripheral sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was she thinking? What could she have in mind and would that end up bad for you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe you were prepared for her?</span></div></div>",

After all, after adding up everything, she had entered your office and seduced you with simple feet movement to agree on handling this case together. That by itself was an indicator that she wanted to get more out of this situation. And of course, you, the KING of this place would not allow a simple novice to trample over you, even if she had dazzling feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, you had worked for years to achieve this position and had more complex situations under control. Even your arch-rival Denise, nor her friend Candice had gotten one on you, and arguably they had as good, if not better soles to allure you with during team meetings, mainly the one that announced your promotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking all of this in consideration you got out of your trance state and got up to shake Stephanie Beachwood's hand. \"It was marvellous working with you, madam. If any questions regarding our marketing assistance to spread your brand further arise, make sure to email me to my personal email. I will answer to you personally!\" With that, you smiled at her to leave your office. What caught your attention even further was that when you walked her out you saw that your name was not written on the door, just the position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michelle is a sly fox, I should not take her lightly\". You thought to yourself as you tightened up your tie and fixed your hair, walking back to your chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was amazing Mr James! You are definitely the best closer in the city, I am glad to be learning from you. I think I got what you meant by your top 3 fundamentals of selling.\" Michelle applauded, as she smiled innocently and childlike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat, however, did not fool you, as you had seen through her act. With that, you handed her over the report for your next client, Samuel Davis, who had the city's highest quality shoes, regardless of the price and was wanting help with expanding with the eCommerce service your firm had to offer. \"Our next client is Samuel Davis, I would want you to assist me with taking him to our side, as he would be a key asset to the company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our next client? That's awesome Mr James! I am so glad to be able to work with someone like you on my very first day\" Michelle looked rejoiced, as she got even closer, kicking her right foot, which was still barefoot to your knees. That by itself made you a bit weak, however, you knew that she was playing a role and that was but a facade to humiliate you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you gave her the report, you texted your secretary, Jacinta, to get more information on Michelle, as soon as possible, while the cunning intern was going through the report. While you waited for her response, you practised your karate meditation technique to focus on your next client and to better control yourself for what was to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 minutes had passed when you heard a knock on the door, indicating that your next client had arrived. Before you could tell, whoever was at the door to come on in, you saw Michelle drop the report below the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am so so sorry Mr James! I have such butterfingers...\" Michelle looked at you innocently as she bit her nails, worried at how you might react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Michelle, please hand me over the duplicates which are in the second drawer to your left.\" You responded, with a confident smirk, knowing she had a scheme to make you lose your concentration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle's face had turned a tad pale, as she was definitely not expecting you to have other hard copies. She then handed you over the reports from the drawer. \"Here you go, Mr James. I am sorry for dropping the rest.\" She spoke, as a satirical remark could be felt in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on in, Mr Samuel Davis!\" With that the door opened, revealing a 6'2'' tall man, who was in good shape, dressed in a suit, which meant business by the very looks of it. As such you entertained the man for the next hour, presenting him with the options your business could offer, both with combined sales with Stephanie's business, alongside other ways of expanding his current business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man was impressed by your presentation and by the options you gave him, which after the time you spent pursuing him, he had finally agreed to partner with your firm. Despite the success you had had, that did not mean Michelle did not try to screw you over a couple more times. As she was rubbing her bare foot from your knees to your tights, to wherever would be possible, to not be seen by the businessman in front of her. That caused you to stutter at given times, but you quickly regained focus back to the topic at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a pleasure doing business with you, Mr Davis. If I could help you out with anything else, make sure to contact me on my personal email, I will be glad to assist you, however, I can!\" You stood up, proud and confident, smiling back at the man as you exchanged compliments, as he left your office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you could finally take your break and opened up the window behind you, as you got out the pack of Treasurer cigarettes out of your right pocket. As you were about to lit your cigar, your phone buzzed, indicating that a text from Jacinta, which had all the information you needed about Michelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled to yourself and lit up the cigar as you looked at the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now, Junior Manager?</span></div></div>",

You are definitely the best closer in the city, I am glad to be learning from you.

If we are able to get him to sign with us, we will have the biggest distributors of both clothes and shoes, which would increase the stock prices of the firm!\" You mentioned, handling the reports of the client to Michelle, for her to take a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We?\" - Michelle smiled, as she took the papers in her hands and rejoiced. She continued to look back at you and at the papers for a couple of minutes and you could see a devilish smile appear on her lips, this time, there was no mistaking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could ask her what happened and if there was an error in the papers, you saw how her hands dropped the papers on the ground, and they end up under the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops... I am such a klutz, I am sorry Junior Manager James Harris...\" Michelle looked awfully disappointed, as her face resembled one of a cute little puppy, that had just lost their favourite bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries, Michelle, it isn't a big deal. I will pick them up.\" You replied as she smiled back at you. You looked like a gentleman in your own eyes. Without further thought, you knelt down and attempted to gather the papers from the ground. The moment you were done, you felt how there was a knock on the door. As such you started to get up and were about to tell Samuel to come on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your very surprise, you felt like you couldn't get up. You could feel how there was something on your back that was stopping you from getting up. Michelle's feet were on your back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on in, Mr Samuel, I have been expecting you.\" Michelle said in a tone, which differed from the one you have heard till now. It was no longer one of a small inexperienced girl, which was both shy and gentle. It was a dominant one, a lower pitch voices, that ordered around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no sir, I can assure you, I am the Junior Manger here. What I can offer you is...\" Michelle, spoke with an assertive voice, as you could hear her offering Samuel, what you had researched about him the previous days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt totally pissed off, as she was stealing your client, impersonating your position and treating you like a footstool! You were not going to take this embarrassment any furth... And as those thoughts were going through your head, you saw the intern's right foot getting close to your face, wiggling playfully. She had very small feet, which smelled of her scent, which was both stinky and refreshing, leaving you mesmerized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had forgotten what you were previously thinking, as you ogled her dazzling feet and as if by instinct, you turned around, letting her feet take their rightful place upon your face. You could feel both her exquisite smell better from here and feel their entire weight, essentially face fucking you. That by itself led to you getting your tongue out and licking each sole at a time, staring at her well taken care of, pedicured in crimson red toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely losing track of time, you continued to lick her feminine feet, sadly being interrupted by Michelle lifting them up, as she looked at your foot marked face, which was dirty from all of the lickings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise and shine, Mr James.\" Michelle said as she giggled hysterically at your face. Crossing her legs and making you enough room to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly got back to your senses and mumbled. \"What... happened? Samuel! What happened to Samuel!\" Getting up quickly and cleaning your suit from any visible dirt on it. What surprised you more was that Michelle was sitting in your luxuries office chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samuel? Oh yes, that guy. He is long gone, in fact, all other 3 clients are already on their way home.\" Michelle smiled, as she laughed, putting her feet on your lap after you had sat on the neighbouring chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, how? I was just picking up the papers and I heard Samuel knocking on the door...\" You were interrupted by her small feet tending to your jeans, more specifically your bulge, which had formed a wet puddle, from all the time spending with Michelle's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. That's what I was waiting for actually. I saw how you were ogling me when I walked in, as well as Stephanie, more specifically how you ogled our feet.\" Michelle spoke in an authoritative tone as she took her feet off your lap and put them back into her sneakers. \"You know James, my ex was a foot-loving loser like you, that's why it didn't take me much to break you. Before coming to the firm, my Dad, Mr B, handed me a couple of employee pictures, as well as mutual ones. I saw that you were ogling your co-workers' feet, which made me curious. And from how well, you pampered my feet, I'd say I was right\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle's smug expression was wide and clear as day, as she got up and started walking to the door and before leaving turned around to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, let me give you a tip. The selling tips are four, not three, Mr Junior Manager. Distract, Dominate, Befuddle and let them ask for more. See you tomorrow, foot boy.\" Michelle gave you one final devilish smile, as she exited your office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This girl really got me, what the...\" Even at your current state you stood up and placed your hands on your lap to hide any visible traces of the puddle of cum on your jeans to confirm something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDAMN IT! DAMN IT! DAMN IT! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was your first day in your office, of course, it wouldn't have your name on it, only the position. That's how Michelle was able to confuse people that she was the Junior Manger. You were devastated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat are you going to do from here?</span></div></div>",

No wonder you did so well in college.\u201d Cocking a smirk at her visibly fuming expression, you feigned a look of realization, \u201cOh, wait a minute\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinding her teeth together, you could tell she was itching, just craving one chance to let loose, to tell you exactly what she thinks of you in a mixture of four-letter words and rude hand gestures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, you could also tell that she enjoys still having a job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalming herself somewhat, she chose her next words very carefully. \u201cAre you done, sir?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, I\u2019m just getting started messing with you, Candice. But, knowing how anal Kim can be with tardiness, I\u2019ll leave you alone,\u201d you smiled at her, watching her type furiously into her computer as a way of poorly containing her anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking around her desk, you flashed her one last playful wink before heading up the spiral staircase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling rejuvenated with Candice finally humbled, you mentally scratched that accomplishment off your bucket list as you bounded up the steps with a confident spring in your step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSauntering down a hallway, you finally reached the left wing, aka where all the important people took up space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, at least for now, the Queen of the kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping at the office door, you patiently tapped your knuckles on the glassy surface and took a few steps back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, the sound of female voices from inside died down to that of a hushed whimper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCocking a smirk, you couldn\u2019t help but think that they were talking about you, and just how great of a worker- no, how great of a <i>human being</i>, you were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow you singlehandedly rose to the top of the corporate ladder, stepping in anyone who dared oppose you. How you, against all odds, managed to score the second most powerful position in the whole damn office, with Number 1 still to come in the not so distant future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving yourself a mental pat on the back, you were absolutely beaming with joy as the sounds of clicking heels approached from the other side. <i>\u201cHail to the King, baby! Hail to the freaking\u2019-\u201d<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nAs if on cue, the door opened, bringing you came face-to-face with the Devil herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Denise. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat same smug face that you had hated for years was now staring you down, naturally followed by one of the best bodies neck down you\u2019ve ever laid eyes on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blonde bombshell with curves in all the right spots, Denise wore her usual white blouse and pencil-thin skirt, followed by a pair of expensive-looking pumps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping your cool, you crossed your arms as the blonde woman stepped out of the doorway while still maintaining eye contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJames,\u201d she finally said curtly, the tension between you two almost palpable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you forgot to add the \u2018Mr.\u2019 in there,\u201d you replied with a slight smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor now,\u201d she said in response, before turning on her heel and strutting down the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnter,\u201d came the mature yet sharp voice of Kim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShooting your nemesis one last scrutinizing glare as she rounded the corner, you put the swagger back in your smile and went inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim\u2019s office space was extremely clean and tidy, much like the woman herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlopping down on a rolling chair, you looked on as the redhead swiveled around on her own chair to face you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWearing an all-black business suit that perfectly showed off her mature yet very attractive figure, she minimized a spreadsheet document on her desktop computer before giving you her undivided attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wanted to see me, boss?\u201d you smiled brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I did. Firstly, how have you been enjoying your new position, James?\u201d she spoke, her tone strictly professional as always. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning like a goof, you could hardly contain your excitement. \u201cI am loving my promotion, Ms.-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can call me Kim now, James. I figured that since we\u2019ll be operating at around the same managerial level, there really is no need for such formalities,\u201d she informed you with the slightest hint of a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging nonetheless, you continued on, \u201cI am thrilled beyond belief to be given this opportunity to become an even bigger asset to the firm. And I am especially grateful that you saw true potential in me, with credit obviously due to my equally as capable colleagues.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t reward potential, James; I reward effort <i>and </i>results. Both of which you have given me time and time again. I only figured it would be more beneficial to the company to give you a more authoritative position to continue doing what you do and eventually, teaching other members of our office how to become more efficient in this line of work,\u201d she told you somewhat glowingly, though you could never tell with her slightly impassive voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding in appreciation, you reluctantly decided to cut to the chase. \u201cNot that I\u2019m not appreciating your very kind words, but I believe you sent me an email about my first official assignment as the Junior Manager.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, of course.\u201d Reaching down into her desk, she pulled out a folder and slid them over to you. \u201cIn about two hours, I was scheduled to have an appointment with a client: Sara Steele. Just a simple consultation about our services, really. Unfortunately, I will not be able to make that meeting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d You raised an intrigued eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say, I have personal matters to attend to at noontime today, and its very nature requires that I attend to it in person. So, as my now right-hand man, I believe that obligation would fall to you,\u201d she explained to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour smile only grew wider. <i>Hell yes. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would be happy to do this for you, Kim. Just tell me where, and I\u2019ll be there,\u201d you grinned, a surge of confidence flowing through you like adrenaline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew you were the right man for the job,\u201d she smiled, gesturing at the folder. \u201cIf you would, take a quick peek.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up the folder, you quickly looked inside and scanned the contents: mainly just info packets about what the firm does that you\u2019ve practically committed to memory by this point as well as some notes on Sara Steele\u2019s financial troubles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgain, this is just a consultation. I want you to tell her exactly what this firm is about, and why it would be most advantageous for her current situation. She doesn\u2019t have to make a decision today, but it should at least be on her mind going forwards.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill do, boss,\u201d you chirped at her happily, playing the noble knight all too willing to carry out his queen\u2019s commands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the moment, at least.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer warm smile, at least for a second, seemed to break her stoic exterior. \u201cGood. Now, there\u2019s just one last thing I need to tell you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Knock Knock! </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight on time,\u201d she grinned, calling out to the unknown visitor, \u201cCome in, please!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pair of slapping sounds from the ground pricked your usually sharp ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, you saw a petite, college-age girl strut in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA natural brunette, she couldn\u2019t have been a few inches above five feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWearing a floral sundress that perfectly captured her youthful curves, her hair cascaded down her slim shoulders in wavy curls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick flicker up her chest confirmed she definitely had some good genes, especially on her mother\u2019s side, but naturally your eyes drifted downwards\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrailing down her slender legs, your eyes feasted upon her quite dainty bare feet, accentuated by a rather cute pair of brown thong sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContrasting the silver strap on each shoe, her toes absolutely sparkled with bright pink nail polish on each digit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you didn\u2019t have much time to fully admire her pedicure as Kim rather loudly cleared her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJames, this is Michelle, our new intern. She\u2019s just starting out with us today,\u201d the redhead beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOffering your hand, you switched on Mr. Benevolent King, at least for now. \u201cPleased to meet you, Michelle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking it with an almost dismissive smugness, she replied back very snobbishly, \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was hoping that, as you were giving Ms. Steele the consultation, Michelle could sit in with you. Strictly to watch and observe,\u201d Kim told you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d be okay with it,\u201d you smiled, before adding with a sly smirk, \u201cAs long as Michelle can take notes the whole time. Just to make sure she gets the full benefit from my performance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could almost sense Michelle\u2019s irritable glare burning a hole in the back of your head, but quite frankly you didn\u2019t care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent suggestion, James. You\u2019re thinking like a manager already,\u201d Kim complimented you, before turning back to the computer. \u201cFor the moment, why don\u2019t you give Michelle a tour around the office? Maybe even show her your brand new office?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking for a moment, you looked up at her somewhat bratty expression before saying:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>(Note: Feel free to continue on where I left off.)</b></span></div></div>",

It took you 10 long hard years but you have managed to successfully climb the corporate ladder in your office and now you're the junior manager at the Office. You had an amazing pay packet, a group of girls that you managed and controlled and your bank account looked so good that you honestly believed that you were set for life. Nothing could go wrong from here! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge part of your success was due to the senior manager at the Office, the one man who out ranked you! Jim Richards was his name, and despite the fact that you thought he was a bit of a dickhead you had spent your last 10 years kissing his ass and becoming his friend... And it had paid off well. However, today was the day that all of your hard work would REALLY pay off. Jim announced last month that he was retiring and that somebody would be taking his place as the senior manager. You knew that he had lined you up for the position, it was a certainty! And everybody believed it... Everybody except Denise...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise is the bitch of the office in your eyes, and she really has it in for you... In fact, you actually started at the office at the same time as her and had a massive war over the position of junior manager, a war that needless to say, you won. If Denise had her way, your only job in the office would be as her foot stool, and she would make you pay her to have that position! Which would suck because the one thing you hate more than Denise is feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was intent on scoring the senior manager position, and this is your biggest fear. God knows what she would do if she had power over you... But it seems God won't be the only one who knows what she would do, as you hop out of your car and see Denise in the parking lot of the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well good morning my minion,\" you say, rubbing in the fact that you are her boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get used to being above me Rob, soon you will be dethroned by me and you will be kissing my feet, begging me to keep your job!\" She says to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold your ground for a second, unsure of what to say... She mentioned kissing her feet, she can't possibly know your secret fear... Could she? You suddenly realise that you've been pausing for about 5 seconds now, you need to speak before she realises that she had said something that has stumped you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... You may think you have the senior management position... That you want... But you're wrong... The day I kiss your feet, I will give you my monthly pay check!\" You stutter out poorly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh is that so? Well, Rob, Mark my words... You WILL kiss my feet. It is now my top priority, I will have you under my feet, I will have your paycheck and you will be my slave!\" She says with a scary confidence. You are paralysed with fear as you see her foot move... She has removed a shoe and is lifting her foot to you... \"Of course, if your scared to fight me, you can always get down on your knees and crawl under my feet now and start kissing Rob..... What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour frozen with fear and you don't know what to say... You've just started something you really didn't want to start... You've dug a whole, and your afraid of digging deeper, so you turn and walk away quickly. Denise just starts to laugh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha, oh my God, you have a weakness for feet don't you?? Hahahaha!\" She tells to you... You speed off to the Office, you have to get away from her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you get into the office, you sit at your desk for 10 minutes and collect yourself... It's ok, it will be fine... You're junior manager, remember? She can't get you! But what if she wins? No, she can't win, and she won't... But if she does? This is bad... There's no other way of looking at it... What the hell did you say that for??<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou check your watch and realise you're going to be late for Jim Richard's big meeting... You get up and quickly walk over to the conference room for Jim's big announcement, this is it!! Senior management, here you come!</span></div></div>",

At the door a grinning Candice looks at you smugly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh the look on your face is priceless Rob.  I wonder how long you'll last with Denise as your boss?  Think I should already start helping you pack your desk up?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clench your fists with impotent anger.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When your done moping Denise wants you in her office better run along now - if you make her wait she'll probably just fire your ass.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a nightmare!

Her footwear was already off and you could see her red painted toes glisten.  You felt sick to your stomach. You hated feet.  It was the lowest part of the body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to keep your job Rob?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow thickly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's 'Yes ma'am' to you Rob.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing your pride you respond as she wants you to.  \"Yes ma'am.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you remember our earlier conversation Rob.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do your best not to whimper.  \"Yes ma'am.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah lets see how did it go again?  I believe I said: Mark my words... You WILL kiss my feet. It is now my top priority, I will have you under my feet, I will have your paycheck and you will be my slave!\"  She grinned viciously at you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let her words hang in the air.  Was she really going to do this?  She couldn't could she?  Wasn't this sexual harassment?  Even as you thought of it you dismissed it out of hand.  No one would ever believe in this era that a woman would sexually harass a man!  No one would believe it if you tried to report her.  You can't help it, you let out an involuntary whimper that causes her to start laughing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my this is just too wonderful.  Every word I said will come true Rob.  Now if you want to keep your job get down on your knees and crawl, yes CRAWL over here.  When you get here I want you to kiss my feet and beg me not to fire you.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt sick to your stomach.  The thought of kissing anyone's feet was disgusting but kissing your arch rival's feet?  The humiliation was on a whole different playing field.  But what choice did you have?  The bitch could probably fire you.  Yes you could appeal it but with the new power structure centered around Denise the rest of the office would see the writing on the wall and back her side of any story.  If you valued your career you had to do it.  But could you?  Could you really force yourself to kiss <i>feet</i>?</span></div></div>",

I mean no disrespect: you've won fair and square. I'll even take a pay cut... I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pay cut? That's the first sensible thing I've ever heard come out of your stupid mouth. Yeah, I'll cut your pay alright. How does half of your current salary sound - better than the act of crawling over and kissing my feet?\"  After she has interruptted, you instantly regret your hasty words!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Half pay...you must be...\" You manage to collect yourself just in time before uttering any profanities, which you would be sure to regret. \"Please, ma'am - not half pay...I need that money...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your problem - not mine, Rob! Now what's it gonna be: crawling over like the loser you are so you can kiss my feet and become my official bitch, or accept working at half the wage that your level of experience you would normally get?\" She tosses her hair back casually, her arms folded with a smirk planted on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMan this woman is evil! The resentment you feel for her burns stronger than ever. With such a difficult choice to make, you look down at the office floor, wishing you could turn back time and have not been such an asshole to Denise. What is the best course of action to take...? </span></div></div>",

You had expected a promotion so you had lived a little high on the hog lately.  Left with absolutely no choice you begin to slowly crawl over to Denise.  Denise still had her arms folded as she crossed one leg and let her bare foot dangle.  If you were to look at it objectively, you would have to agree that it was a pretty foot.  Her smooth ivory skin contrasted sharply and powerfully with her blood red painted toenails.  However you weren't objective, this was the feet of the woman who was debasing you and had taken your dream job!  Furthermore unlike most people who didn't care about feet, or the few people who had a foot fetish, you found feet rather revolting.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had crawled all the way to Denise and then stopped right in front of her feet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it.\"  She barked at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the lowest you've ever felt in your life, you force yourself to push your head forward and plant the first kiss on her foot.  You kissed the tops of her toes once then grimaced and backed away.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rob your are such an idiot.  I'm not going to let you get away with just kissing my feet once!  Put your head down and kiss both of my feet over and over.  I'll tell you when you can stop.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a whimper much to Denise's sick amusement as you begin to kiss your rival's feet.  Her feet were lightly damp probably from being in her heels all day.  The thought of actually kissing a sweaty body part like a foot sent a shudder of revulsion through your body.  This wasn't fair!  How could it have come to this!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were bemoaning the unfairness of it all while you were completely lost in the disgust you felt for yourself and her feet that you didn't realize the door to the blonde's office had opened.  You had no clue someone was in there until you heard the snap of a photo from someone's phone several times in quick succession.  You look up in horror and see a grinning Candice finish snapping pictures of you kneeling and kissing Denise's feet!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No delete those photos now!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise sharply slapped your face with her bare foot.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not be disrespectful Rob.  This is just further insurance.  If you aren't a good worker and slave for me those photos will go out to everyone.  Your friends, your family, your coworkers and everyone in our industry.  You'll be branded a perverted foot freak and never work in this field again!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour entire world was crashing down around you.  You desperately looked for an out, some way to avoid this horrific fate.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait - you're in the photos too, you'll be screwed as well!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandice shook her head, \"Nope I didn't get her head in the shot so she'll be anonymous while I got good clear pictures of your face right on top of her feet!\"  The catty receptionist was loving your ordeal.  You hated both of these vindictive bitches.  You were so frustrated, angry and horrified that tears threatened to burst out of you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise tapped your face lightly with her foot and you recoiled in disgust.  \"Aww there there Rob.  It won't be so bad you'll just have to work hard and keep me and Candice satisfied.  That won't be so hard will it?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down in utter defeat.  They had beaten you.  You were now going to be forced to be at their feet and there was no way out for you.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not in a million years! You can cut my pay if that makes you feel like a real manager - I don't give a shit. I'm going to find an office, which can utilise my not inconsiderable skill set...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause for breath, some pride returning to you at the surprised expression on your nemesis' face. \"But until I do, I'd rather work for half the money than go near your disgusting feet! I'm telling you now, you will never, ever see me degrade and debase myself by kissing yours or anyone at this office's feet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing heavily, adrenaline pumping through you, you feel like the Rob of old: before this morning's shocking announcement took place. However, you feel a little alarmed by the condescending sneer now planted on Denise's admittedly pretty face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really? We'll see about that, loser. In the mean time, your pay is cut by half. Ha - I have an extra few thousand dollars a month, just because you're too proud to suck it up and kiss my feet. Your choice! Now get the hell out of my office!\" She says venomously, her manicured nail pointing at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing better than to risk antagonising her further, you make do with the hand you've been dealt. Half the pay is an absolute slap in the face, a complete insult. But you can get a promotion elsewhere: you've networked enough to know people in various places. You consider telling someone from the board of directors about Denise's outrageous decision, but you brush it aside immediately. You know how this works: she'll plead ignorance and find a way of making your life even more miserable if she knows you've ratted on her. Plus, any actual, concrete evidence is needed for you to get a generous severance package, should you have to leave sooner than your notice period runs out! Maybe you can stick this out longer, get some real dirt on her, then really screw up her career leaving you to take over as the Senior Manager!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying your best to focus your mind away from your evil new boss, you head over to reception, relieved to see that your friend Jenny is there, without that catty Candice anywhere in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Rob,\" she smiles sympathetically at you. \"How did it go in there with Denise? Candice told me you were meeting with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snort. \"Yeah - great meeting!\" You're about to continue to relay what happened in hushed tones, when a <i>bing</i> emits from the redhead's computer. You pause, knowing she's hopeless at multi-tasking. No point in even trying to talk to her while she reads that email!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sorry Rob, Denise wants to have a meeting. I'll be back in a few minutes. Do you mind keeping an eye on reception?\" For anyone else you wouldn't bother, but Jenny has been a kind, loyal friend and ally to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" you smile as she hurriedly makes her way towards the office that you stormed angrily out of just a minute or two ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom your position at reception, you see the female staff flocking over to Denise's meeting room. Yet none of the men are. This strikes you as odd, but you don't dwell on it. Several minutes pass uneventfully until you see the door open and the women of the office exit, a mixture of different expressions on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny walks towards you, a troubled look about her. \"What was it? You're not fired are you?\" You laugh, trying to break the tension. \"No, I mean, you're not really fired are you?\" Surely Denise wouldn't be <i>that</i> much of a bitch on her first day!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the redhead swaps positions with you, her eyes seem to be avoiding contact with yours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, what is it? You can tell me,\" you press her gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny looks up, her pretty hazel eyes full of concern. She opens her mouth to speak but closes it again, checking to see who else might be nearby to listen in. What does she tell you?</span></div></div>",

You're not too worried, I mean, you've just had your pay cut in half, it can't really get worse from here... Can it?? Jenny let's out a sigh as she spills the beans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Denise told us about your 50% pay cut.... \" Jenny begins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I know, it sucks right?

She said it is $63,500 a year... And....  And she is offering it to one of the office women\" Jenny says. You smirk...

She said the first female employee that can make you kiss their bare feet and show her photo or video proof that you have kissed their feet will get your salary cut added onto their pay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W... What???\" you reply, stuttering...  This is bad... Really bad...  If any girl makes you kiss their feet AND had photographic evidence of it happening,  Denise could blackmail you into making sure you never get another job...  You'd be stuck here forever, probably kissing HER feet. Silence grabs a hold of you as you begin playing scenarios in your head...  All the women that would want that pay rise...  All the women that would want to make you kiss their feet...  Candice, Helena... Even the new girl Michelle would probably want a crack at you! The silence is broken by Jenny... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...

Like Candice...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mention of that vicious harpy's name makes you shiver involuntarily. Jenny does have a point, but you simply cannot believe that she is not being more supportive than this. The mention of Denise always getting her way does not help matters either!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny,\" you begin, keeping your voice as deliberately low and calm as possible. \"I'm not kissing anyone's feet: not Denise's, not Candice's, not yours. Did your new bitch of a boss tell you that I could keep full pay if I kissed her feet? No way was I kissing her feet! So I'm sorry, it's not even an option!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gather your breath, aware that your voice has risen to a slight crescendo. In the corner of your eye, you see a couple of ladies looking over suspiciously in your direction. A slight giggle in the background does not alleviate your paranoia one bit! Leaning forward urgently so that only Jenny could possibly hear you, you continue...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, if I had to choose someone here to get the sixty-odd thousand of my salary, of course it would be you. But I'm fully intending of leaving here as soon as I can: once I've served out my notice period-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, good luck with that,\" Jenny tells you apologetically. \"Apparently, the first thing Denise did when becoming boss was to make sure to tweak the get-out clauses of all staff's contracts: they need a VERY good reason to leave without serving at least three months' notice...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a bitch! Seething, you manage to regain your composure: it wouldn't be fair to take it out on your friend after all. \"Let's just say that my holiday and sick days may all be happening within the next couple of months...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shake of Jenny's head, her curly red hair flicking from side to side, makes you trail off. \"There will be no holiday period or sick days for anyone, unless they can commit to at LEAST another year's contract from now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to grudgingly hand it to Denise: she really had thought of everything. Three months of every woman in this office doing their utmost to make you kiss their feet; if it had been their breasts or pussy, this wouldn't be such a bad deal! But their <i>feet</i>...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny uses your silence to continue talking. \"So, like I said - better me than anyone else, right? Look, we can do it right now: under the reception desk - get it over with and all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at her, unsure of what to say. A small, but burgeoning amount of self-doubt is creeping in: the odds of surviving three long months without Denise succeeding are not great. Jenny getting your money would certainly be better than anyone else getting it - maybe you could split it between you! Or you could ask for it all back - she was your friend after all!

So Jenny's offer to simply kiss her feet and be done with it is extremely tempting... Too tempting in fact. Especially considering you won't lose half of your pay, you'll only lose a quarter of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK Jenny, I'll take your offer and kiss your feet\" you say with a sad and disgusted look on your face. Jenny smiles and looks you in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rob, trust me, this is a great decision. I know you think you could simply keep fighting and never kiss anybody's feet, but do you seriously think Denise would let you win? We do this quickly and it will all be over, ok?\" Jenny says in an attempt to comfort you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way Jenny speaks, it's as if she is the one doing YOU a favour by making you kiss her feet and taking half of your money. It's almost as if she is expecting you to thank her or something! But you swallow your pride and nod your head. After all, she is right. Denise will never allow you to avoid doing this eventually. This is by far the easiest and cheapest way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK Rob, get down and crawl under my desk\" Jenny says, motioning you toward the opening of her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh... What? Why under there?\" You ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you want everybody else to see this too?\" Jenny says with a serious look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing she's right you walk over to her desk and quickly drop to your knees and go under her desk. You can now only see her feet in her high heel shoes. If it weren't for the fact that you absolutely hated feet, hers would certainly be attractive. She had very smooth creamy skin and an obvious arch that was accentuated by her heels. You shake your head, what the hell are you doing?? You sigh, thinking of what's to come...</span></div></div>",

Wiggling her high heels, which are just in front of you on the ground, one of Jenny's bare feet becomes fully revealed. Staring at it in resignation, you still can't believe you're agreeing to this. Still, like Jenny reasoned with you before, it is a better outcome than someone like Candice forcing you to do this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny crouches down a little as she slides her bare foot forwards, so that it is directly on the carpet in front of you. Smiling apologetically, she reaches for her phone and aims the camera lens at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Rob,\" she whispers gently, almost soothingly. \"It will be over soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of you wants to get the hell out of here. A slightly damp, leathery aroma begins to meet your nostrils; Jenny evidently takes good care of her feet, but there's no denying that there's a funky smell in the air. Plus, it's <i>feet</i>. Are you really gonna go through with this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny flexes her toes slightly, the red varnish glimmering slightly in the restricted light, such is your position under her desk. She taps her foot, this time a tad impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rob, just kneel down and kiss my foot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is it: the moment you've been dreading ever since you agreed to her deal. Feeling like a complete loser, you bow downwards, so that your face is just a few centimetres from the top of Jenny's smooth, creamy foot. Slowly, gradually you move further downwards until your lips are virtually pressed against her foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will that do?\" You murmur, clear enough for her to hear you, but still in hushed tones. Hopefully, she won't make you have your lips actually touching her foot...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best to do it properly, just to be safe,\" she mutters back. \"Come on - just kiss my foot - you're nearly there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that you simply can't avoid it, you sigh in resignation as you reluctantly press your mouth against her foot, droplets of moisture immediately tracing over your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on...just hold it there,\" Jenny says while you wait in the most awkward position you can ever remember being in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mmm omm!\" You breathe your voice muffled by the top of her foot. Even saying just this forces you to taste a definite salty flavour in your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems like an eternity until you sense a flashing light blink above you. Finally! Moving your head up, you nearly bang it against the underside of her desk, such is your desperation to extricate yourself from this position!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wait a sec...\" Jenny murmurs down to you, her voice doubtful and uncertain. What could be taking so long?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The quality's not great,\" she says, keeping her voice low but sounding clearly frustrated. \"Don't know if that will do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe extends her phone under the desk to you so that you can get a clear view of her screen. To be fair, the image is so dark and blurry that it wouldn't be crystal clear that it is you kissing a foot...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Jenny. Please - not again!\" You plead up at her, fearing that she is about to ask you to do it again...!</span></div></div>",

You knew she would say something like that... It seems like a small part of her actually enjoyed making her friend kiss her bare feet! But luckily for you, you had an idea to avoid this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll come with you to Denise and I'll confirm that it is actually me\" you say, as the smile fades slightly from Jenny's lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continues looking down at you, as if trying to think of another excuse to make you kiss her feet again.

After you\" you say, allowing Jenny to walk ahead of you. Jenny starts walking without even bothering to put her shoes on. It seems strange to you at first, but you shrug it off and follow Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk to Denise's office seems to take forever. Thoughts of the degrading act you just performed full your mind, and watching Jenny's bare feet walking in front of you only serve as a reminder of the fact that you didn't just kiss her feet... You tested you lips on them for a good 5 seconds so she could get her photo! Yet still the picture was blurred. Did Jenny do it on purpose so she could make you kiss her feet again?? Before you can give this theory any more thought, you and Jenny arrive at Denise's office. Jenny knocks on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enter\" Denise calls out. Jenny leads the way in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh Jenny and Rob. To what do I owe this visit? Come to beg that I reconsider the little offer I have given the women of the office?\" Denise says with an evil smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually...\" Jenny begins, as she places her phone on the table. \"I've come to claim my reward!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What??\" Denise says with shock. She snatches up the phone and looks carefully at the photo... \"This isn't exactly a clear photo...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Which is why I am here\" you interrupt her. \"I am here to confirm that it is me, I kissed Jenny's feet, so she wins and this little game is over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Admitting it? Well well, if I didn't know any better, I would say you two were working together on this one. Cut a little deal perhaps?? You know, that's cheating...\" Denise says... This isn't good... \"Plus I wanted that photo for more than just proof, I wanted that picture framed and hung up all over the office!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cringe at the thought... She really does want to break you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can only think of one option here...\" Denise begins...</span></div></div>",

What are you supposed to do? You clear your throat to reason with Denise - immediately a smirk is etched back on to her admittedly pretty face when you begin speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Denise. This isn't fair. You can't fire someone for this. It'll never go through with the board,\" you say confidently, hoping that your boss will back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt has the opposite effect however. \"Ooh, and here's the little bitch's knight in shining armour....so brave, so strong!\" She says her words dripping with scorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just saying...\" Your voice trails off as she laughs at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think that anything you say is going to help your little friend? The board won't give a shit if I fire this idiot.  Shut the hell up before I make things worse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorse? How can they be any worse?! You can't help but think grimly to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...\" Jenny says, doing her best to refrain from crying as she gives you a warning glare as if to say 'don't make things worse!'. \"Please, Denise - I'm sorry. Please just don't fire me....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise watches you both with satisfaction: she clearly loves holding so much power over you.

The last time you were in Denise's office, you negotiated so poorly that you actually had to accept half of your salary, just so you could avoid kissing her feet. Her nasty, evil <i>feet</i>! As if on cue, Denise points down to one of her open toed high heels, making you glance down warily and reluctantly at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what's going to happen Rob. Let's just get this over with so every party is satisfied: Jenny keeps her job, I get the proper respect from you that you've owed me for years, and you get to play the hero. Well, maybe not a hero: maybe more like a worm who has managed to avoid getting stomped on and instead just gets lightly crushed.\" Denise laughs gently, as she looks smugly at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat damn smug expression nearly causes you to go into autopilot and call her every name under the sun. Yet you manage to keep your composure, for Jenny's sake as well as yours...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Rob.

Again, like Jenny's, you have to admit that her foot is by no means unattractive. However it's a bare, nasty foot. And not just anyone's: it's that of your worst enemy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, come on, Rob,\" Denise says in a mock-dramatic tone, a smirk plastered all over her face. \"Help your friend: do the right thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking between Jenny and Denise, then down to the bare foot on the ground, you know that this is a situation you could never have envisaged being in, not until today at least! Kissing Denise's foot....the very thought of it nearly makes you throw up in your mouth! But if this is the only chance of saving Jenny's job, will you suck it up and do it?</span></div></div>",

You've put an even bigger target on yoir back then you had when it was just half your sales on the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get your printing and walk back to your desk, passing all the taunters once again. When you return to your desk, you find a folded paper with your name on it. You open it and it reads:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeet me in break room 310 in 10 minutes for a surprise. <br>\r\n-J<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J\"? You can only guess that this is Jenny wanting to thank you some more for saving her job and apologize for all she put you through with her failed deal. It's time for your lunch break anyway, so you grab your sandwich and head to room 310. Room 310 hasn't been used in years, it was an odd place for a meet up.

Jenny looked calmly and said \"Rob, it will not happen in the first day or the second or even the first week, so don't worry.... by the time Denise will need to see such actions, you will be so used to my feet\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah whatever!\" you said hopelessly. then you looked at the paper and read \" The Owner wishes to highlight that the level of the foot slave will be LOWER than her other foot properties\" , you looked at her and she cut the way on you saying \"this is the selling point to Denise to buy the idea, Denise needs to see you humiliated, so I added this point and the point where you sleep at my place. I don't think we need to do that in reality but we need to admit that she won till this stage and we need to get moving, any other comments Rob?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Don't worry, you will learn to love my feet.\" She giggles but you are still not sure about that. \"Now...sign it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bossy tone makes you a bit uncomfortable, but still you  pick up the pen and sigh this miserable paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good boy...or should I say slave? Jenny said, jokingly. \"Seriously, though you really need to change now. Remember, Denise<br>\r\nmust see you broken, so act as humble as you possibly can...and from now on you will call me Mistress, do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready regretting your decision, you decide to comply and help your friend. \"Yes, Mistress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see? It wasn't so bad.\" your \"owner\" comforts you. \"As you read in contract, from now you can speak only with my permission<br>\r\nand if you want to communicate, you must kiss my feet until I allow you to speak. Now follow me to Denise's office to make it official.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe change in Jenny's behaviour makes you nervous. As you walk into your enemy's office you start to thin that maybe it was not the<br>\r\nbest idea after all. You stand at the door and Jenny knocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in!\" you can hear Denise's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you enter, but you notice that the new manager doesn't even look at you. She seems to ignore your existance and immediately <br>\r\napproach Jenny. \" What is it? Did you make him your slave?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we signed the contract.\" Jenny answers and hands the paper to Denise<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, let's see that\" Denise starts to read the contract attentively, Some time passes as you stand in front of her ashamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow I am really surprised!\" She finally speaks \"Some of these points are really wicked, did he really agree on that? Or maybe<br>\r\nthis is another trick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it is real!\" Jenny assures her \"he really is my slave!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just watch these women talk about you like you are an ordinary object, you feel so low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need more than words.\" Denise says \"Prove to me that he is totally broken or I will fire you.\" she threatens the redhead receptionist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny turned pale...she really doesn't want to lose her job. She looks at you with hope and orders:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slave, bow down and kiss my feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is so humiliating, but you can't make your friend lose her job. You get down on your hands and knees and start kissing the tops<br>\r\nof her high heeled feet.  Good thing that she has her shoes on so you won't have to put your lips on her sweaty soles. Still, you have never <br>\r\nbeen humbled more. You said to Denise that you will never kiss anyone's feet, and the same day you are on the floor smothering<br>\r\nreceptionist's feet with kisses in front of her. Your defeat is unconditional and your self-esteem dropped really hard. You feel<br>\r\ntoo emberrassed to raise your head, so you just keep your eyes on Jenny's feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time passes, after you hear Denise's voice:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta say...I am impressed, he seems really broken, but I want to try one more thing. You see...my feet really hurts today<br>\r\nand I could really use someone massage them. What do you think, Jenny?' Denise grins deviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slave, you know what to do\" Jenny turns to you with bossy tone. \"Rub Miss Denise's tired feet and better do a good job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDealing with Jenny is one thing, but having to rub your biggest enemy's feet is beyond your imagination. On the other hand,<br>\r\nyou know that you have already lost so massaging Denise's feet won't change much and will definitely help Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now take off my heels and start rubbing.\" Denise orders you with satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Ma'am.\" you answer meekly . You slowly pull down the shoes and notice that her feet are kind of sweaty.<br>\r\nYou can even see the wet spots on the insoles. Slightly foul aroma hits your nose. You don't want your face to be closer to her soles.<br>\r\nYou grab her right foot, it is clearly moist from sweat, but despite your revulsion you suck it up and start massaging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratz Jenny...you have won the contest...the money is yours.

Don't worry.. <br>\r\nI will send your slave back to you in an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing.\"  Jenny answers and leaves as you continue with your work.

You notice that contact with their feet had made you<br>\r\nmore submissive...you feel like you are losing all your self-esteem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will help Jenny train you.\" Denise continues \"When we are done...you will worship the ground I walk on\" your biggest enemy keeps degrading you<br>\r\n\"You will beg me to let you lick my sweaty feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't believe your ears...this woman must be mental. You are really upset that Jenny has left you alone with that monster. You will<br>\r\nnever willinglly serve Denise's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter full hour of massaging her sweaty feet she finally lets you go. The smell has totally overwhelmed you as you rubbed every inch of her feet like <br>\r\na mindless servant. You feel betrayed and decide to face Jenny...but on your way you bump into Candice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look who we have here...it is Jenny's footslave!\" She laughs loudly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit...everyone already knows what happened...your reputation is all gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" you ask.

You lay down on your back under her chair...and watch as she<br>\r\ntakes off her shoes and her bare feet invade your face. Your vision went almost totally black. You realise that her feet are much better than Denise's.<br>\r\nThey are not as sweaty and the smell is more bearable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think, Rob...just obey and become more accustomed to my feet.

You hear her typing on the keyboard and answering the phone while she rubs her feet on your nose sometimes or cross her legs and keeping you under the pressure for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter two hours, she removed her feet and looked down at you. your eyes were blurry as they've just seen the light. \"WOW, I've almost forgot about you down there\" Jenny said. \"How do you feel so far?\" Jenny asked. you looked to her and answered \"Do you really care?\". \"Yes, I do! As I promised you, I will not be harsh on you from the beginning, but you need to be introduced to the life of a foot slave.

You already feel degraded so just complied and kissed her feet. You put her shoes on. Jenny instructed you to stand up and then you both took a taxi to her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you reached her house, you've noticed that her apartment is quite small but cozy and warm for a young lady like Jenny. She show you the house introducing you to the living room, the kitchen, the bathroom and the bed room. When you reached the bed room, you've noticed the small shoes cupboard that she has. She guided you towards the cupboard and opened it for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rob! Meet your new family!\" Jenny calmly said, you were shocked and you can't believe that your new family is her shoes. \"there are four shelves. The lower shelf is my work old shoes, those are my favorite as they're very comfy. greet them by kissing their tips\"... \"why are you still doing this? no body is here, so why are you doing this?\" you asked angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Robb! This is part of your life as a property of my feet to be introduced to the other shoes, I will try my best not to be the cruel owner as I want you to naturally converge to my feet and shoes.\" she calmly spoken and continued \" Look at my shoes! look how beautiful they are, look how they wait in the darkness of the cupboard silently for me to pick one of them to wear. Look at the one I wore for work today. None of them complains, and everyone of them is happy to serve my feet, by time you need to grow similar attitude as this is a lifetime of being my foot slave\" she continued, \"look at the other shelves, here is my party heels, look carefully and see the memories they engrave from the good time I had with them\" she show you the marks of her toes on the insole of the party shoes. \"These are my flats, I use them when I go shopping or when I go to the park, my favorite is this ballerina shoes, see how passionate they are in serving me\" She also show you the worn part of the ballerina. \"Those are my sneakers, I used them in my jogging routine, they're almost worn out and I think I will buy new ones\" she show you a very worn out sneakers with a tip that begins to torn. \"And these are my boots, I usually wear them in winter but sometimes I wear them in summer too\" she then continued. \"I want you to greet them all by kissing each one of them on the tip and I want to look carefully in the cupboard if you notice something strange\" she instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny put her hand on your head pushing it gently to her shoes, she feels the hesitation of your head when it moves towards her shoes and she whispers \"easy, easy, just a little kiss and look carefully in the cupboard\" . You kissed the first shoe, then the other, till you finished the four shelves. you noticed that there is an opening from the other side of the cupboard that is a square with (1'x1') and you wondered \"why there is an opening from the other side?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This opening is for your head to go through when you want to sleep at night. your head should be with the other work shoes, I know it's a little bit crowdy and smelly, but you need to learn and adopt\" she informed. \"As part of your duty is to keep them all clean and smell freshly, so you'll be licking the dirt and smell the scent till it becomes fresh'. she continued as you feel afraid of the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regarding your shower time, make sure that you only wash your body without your hair and face\" Jenny said! \"Why not?\" you shrugged. \"You'll know later\" Jenny answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would Jenny do with you next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Could you lick those up for me Rob?\" Jenny asks, wiggling her toes at you tauntingly. While you had started getting used to the taste of her feet, you still weren't sure if you were ready to lick her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny, I know I said your feet didn't taste as bad as I thought, but that doesn't mean it wasn't still bad. Can't I just use a washcloth?\" You ask, trying your best to get out of this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Rob, but we have to get you used to licking my feet. The way I see it, right now is the best way to start. The butter will dull the taste of my feet. You know what they say, everything is better with enough butter.\" She explains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her argument was shaky, you can see where she's coming from. You're going to need to make a convincing show at work tomorrow. If you can stomach the idea of licking feet better, then you can put on a better performance. Seeing no other choice, you hesitantly stick out your tongue and drag it along her arch, causing a giggle to come from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teehee, that tickles more than I thought.\" You're happy she's at least enjoying it. While it is true that the butter was making this experience better, it still doesn't mask the fact that you're licking feet. But you did have to admit, this was nowhere near as gross or disgusting as you had feared, even as the taste of butter started to fade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been licking away at her feet for about an hour now. You had lciked every inch of them until they shined with your saliva. Unfortunately, your mouth was left dry from the experience. \"Well done Rob. I think that's enough for tonight. Time for bed.\" She stands up and begins to head to her bedroom, only to stop when she notices you are not following her. \"Rob? You okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Water.\" Is all you can say. Jenny was concerned, the contract stated that he was not allowed fresh water, but he didn't have enough time to clean her feet to justify it. Acting fast, she rushed to the kitchen and filled a bowl with water. Once full, she dipped her foot in for half a second before pulling it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, it counts as foot cleaning water now.\" She grabs the bowl and brings it in front of you setting it down right in front of your face. \"Here Rob, drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you did. You stuck your head in the bowl and lapped away like God himself offered it to you. \"Thanks Jenny.\" You say in between slurps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce finished, you feel yourself able to stand again. \"Now then, I believe it was bed time before that little ordeal.\" She walks back to her bedroom again, this time with you in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on Jenny. Don't stick me in that shoe closet. Isn't there any other way?\" You practically beg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. The contract states that you are to be treated like my footwear.\" You see a light bulb go off in her head. \"Unleeess... You don't mind sleeping on my feet like a pair of socks. Those are your choices, shoes or socks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich do you choose?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"....Those are your choices, shoes or socks.\" Jenny gave two uncomfortable choices for you. The shoes closet option looks very frightening as you'll be in darkness with accumulated scent and moist of all shoes all over the time. Being her socks was reasonable compared to the closet option, but you don't understand how can you become a sock attached to her feet while she's sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything would be better than the shoes closet... But.... How can I be your socks and stick to your feet all night?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, let me think about it\" Jenny said. She stood in silence for a while thinking . Then she went to the kitchen. She came back with a roll of Plastic Cling Wrap in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that for?\" you asked. \"Well, with the cling wrap I will wrap your face with one of my feet so you be stuck on it all night\" Jenny explained with a smart tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But.. I will suffocate inside\" you said in fear. \"Don't worry, I'll keep a tiny gap for air to get inside, it will not be as usual, but you need to coop with it\" Jenny comforted you with her palm on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she started wrapping your face, she handled you a cream that is called (Sweat Glands Blocker). \"Put that on your face, and be generous\" Jenny ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that for?\" you asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your face produces sweat through its sweat glands, when you use this cream, the sweat glands are blocked and the sweat won't be produced... by time your face skin will not produce sweat at all as the glands will parish\" Jenny explained to you. You become nervous, knowing that sweat is important to keep your skin healthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But my skin needs to sweat in order to get cooler and stay healthy\" you explained to Jenny about your cautions of using this cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ofcourse your skin needs sweat, but you don't need to produce it... You will get sweat from other resources like my feet *giggles*\" Jenny laughed when she saw your jaws going down from her explanation.  You knew you have no choice. You put some cream on your hand and spread on your face. You waited for 10 minutes and your face became dry. Jenny called you to her bed and pointed to you towards her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, left or right?\" Jenny asked you pointing her feet towards your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you answered, she stuck the sole of her right foot on your face and she started wrapping around both your face and her foot. One round, two rounds , three rounds... the light faded a little and you cannot see well from the wrapping. You then heard some tearing sound like a scissor in the wrap. Jenny made a tiny gap for air to come to your face. You could breath, but you realized that the air will always have her foot scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, Rob! Sleep well\" Jenny said that with her innocent voice. The lights are off. your head is on Jenny's bed, but your knees were on the floor. You couldn't sleep for the lack of air. you've noticed that the heat starts to increase by time, and with heat, Jenny's foot starts to sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dry skin was like a sponge for Jenny's foot sweat, and you started to feel that your face skin is hydrated again. Even it made you feel a little comfortable to hydrate your skin, but you're filled with disgust that your skin is hydrated by Jenny's foot sweat. You realized that you're experiencing the same experience of a sock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy time, you are becoming sleepy, and Jenny's foot sweat is filling the area between your face and her foot. your lips are washed by her sweat, you started to taste the saltiness of her sweat pouring into your mouth. The scent of her foot is now dominating your senses. You've managed to fall asleep in this sauna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, Jenny waked up and torn the wrap. She giggled when she saw your reddish face that was totally washed by foot sweat. She came closer to your face and took a whiff, \" WOW, you do smell like my club heels\" Jenny giggled, \"Maybe you're made from the same material , hahahaha, leather\" Jenny continued laughing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cool breeze of fresh air waked you up and Jenny's laughter made you aware how pathetic you are. Your mouth is very salty and you were a little bit thirsty. you ran to your bowl of water to drink. you wanted so bad to wash your face but you remembered you're not allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you heard Jenny calling you... what does she want? </span></div></div>",

After the tough night you feel too resigned and weak to stand up to her. Besides, you need to look after your nutrition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least I get something to eat.\" You think to yourself. Obediently, you move under the table and start licking the food from her feet. You hear your owner's giggling but despite the humiliation you continue on with your abasing task. The taste doesn't really bother you...it feels different, but not uncomfortable. It takes some time before you manage to eat everything. You definitely feel better, you were practically starving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Jenny.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You' re welcome, boy. Now show me your gratitude and clean the feet that fed you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout protesting you begin licking. You start with the tops of her feet, then slowly moving to her toes. Without being told to, you suck each toe separately. After you are done, you redirect your attention to the soles. You start with heel and then slowly drag your tongue all over her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must say I am really pleased. Keep up the good work! Worship and adore me to make yourself a fine slave.\" Jenny compliments you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know it is weird but you actually feel proud of yourself. You wonder if it is possible to become more accustomed to her stinky and sweaty feet. In a couple of minutes you manage to clean both of her feet.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Dark brown Jacket with white shirt and knee high skirt and nylons. She picked a chocolate brown pumps from the shoe closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rob\" Jenny called you and you came to her room. \"You've done great job in the kitchen and you deserve a treat..\" Jenny said while sitting on her chair. She grabbed a jar of chocolate paste and dipped her finger and spread some on her heels tips and sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While I do my make up, make sure you clean my shoes with your tongue. As this is your first time, I added chocolate to ease it up for you.\" Jenny instructed and started applying make up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crawled down at her feet looking nervously at her chocolate covered heels. You slowly approached her feet. You began to smell a mix of chocolate and leather scents . \"Focus on the chocolate...\" you told yourself while you extended your tongue out. You licked the tip of her pumps and you tasted chocolate mainly with a hint of dust and leather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued licking her pumps moving from tips to side and back. Jenny was not giving you any attention as she was putting on her make up. She moves a little bit, accidentally hitting your face gently but you continued licking. You took 10 minutes to finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you done?\" Jenny asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes, all set\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny checked her shoes and how spotless they are. She clapped and told you \"Well done, I am proud of you\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether you went back to work. Reaching Jenny's office you both noticed that the reciptionists offices (Jenny and Candice) are higher than usual. you have also noticed a small opening under Jenny's desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Jenny's desk there is a paper. Jenny read it and looked at you<br>\r\n\"That bitch Denise.\" Jenny said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She changed my office so now you have a place under the floor and only your face appears on the level of the floor under my desk. The place under the floor is prepared for you with everything you need. So you will not leave the place till the end of day\" Jenny explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That bitch\" you replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for that Rob but you have to comply\" Jenny asked nicely.<br>\r\nYou opened the hood and went under the floor. You found toiletries and cleaning tools. you understood that those are here if you need a toilet. They were well built to keep everything clean and fresh. You lay down on your back and Jenny closed the hood so only your face appears on the level of the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat on her desk and started working. She did not take off her shoes neither did she put her feet on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while ... what happened?</span></div></div>",

Are my feet too heavy for you? Ehhh...Oh right since it's your first day I'll give you a head start. This time I will take off my shoes, but as you well know it's unprofessional and you are gonna have to get much tougher than that, Rob. We will work on that topic later.\" Jenny acts like she is doing you a great favour. She takes of her shoes and plants her bare feet on your trapped face. You wouldn't believe it earlier but after the sharp heels her soft soles give you a relief. Your whole view gets covered and light smell invades your nose, but you don't dare to protest. Still...it's not like you have a vote. You close your eyes and try to rest a little to make up for last night. Jenny occasionally moves her feet a bit, sometimes putting her toes straight in your nose, which makes the scent stronger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time you can hear Candice's voice, she sits next to Jenny and chats her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...how is your new slave doing, hun?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ain't so bad, but he needs a lot more training.\" Jenny answers casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind if we change our seats for a while? I would happily try him out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart sinks...you don't want to be humiliated by this brat, but all you can do is listen and hope for Jenny to save you. In so far as you kind of got used to being at Jenny's feet, this is another low blow. You realise that you are not allowed to say anything, so you decide to play it out another way. <br>\r\nIn order to imply to your mistress that you don't want to confront Candice, you start kissing the receptionist's feet, which are still planted on your face. You delicately peck the ball of her foot, you try to make way to her toes but they are too far and you can't move. It's hard to tell if Jenny guesed your true intentions, you hope she gets the idea. After a couple kisses Jenny finally makes her decision.</span></div></div>",

With that she planted her toes on your nose and said, \"Deep breaths to keep them dry, Rob!\" ... you remembered that she pretends to be cruel to avoid more humiliation from the other ladies.

How did you make him like that in no time Jenny?\" Jacinta asked with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you're taking deep breaths, you're wishing that Jacinta will go away. Jacinta asked Jenny a question \"Do you think he's accustomed to your feet scent particularly or is it anyone's feet he'll like?\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis question aroused the curiosity inside Jenny. She looked at you and told you \"Can you recognize my scent from other women's?\" ... This filled you with fear.. what's on Jenny's mind... Jenny removed her feet totally from your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to test you Rob, and I think Jacinta is our friend so she's the best to ask to help this test!\" Jenny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, what can I do?\" Jacinta answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rob, you've experienced my feet for the last 24 hours.

Let's do it\" Jacinta said with excitement.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, Rob! close your eyes tightly and no looking\" Jenny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no choice, so you closed your eyes. \"Come and sit in my place Jacinta,\" Jenny said.

The scent of her feet attacked you. They smelled similar to Jenny's but a little bit stinkier. \"Do you like them? You better say yes....\" Jacinta said that while she wiggled her nylon-covered toes on your nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacinta is your friend, and you don't want to increase your enemies in the company, So you decide to be friendly, \"Well, even I am loyal to my owner's feet, your feet smell much better than I expected.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, that's sweet to say\" Jacinta said. \"I always liked you Rob, and wished that you're mine. but I am happy that you're loyal to Jenny.\" she continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny looked proudly at you  \"That's a gentleman's answer, Rob! Hey Jacinta, as you're friends of me and Rob, feel free to come to use him... he already liked your feet so it's even better!\" Jenny told you and Jacinta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacinta was thrilled with happiness, she said \"Actually, I will come back during my lunch break in around 3 hours, see you!\" She waved and went to her office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny put her right foot in her shoe while the other is still on your face. She started to dangle her shoe over your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

Jenny continues doing her work, occasionally changing her position and moving her nylon covered feet all over your face. You try to get some sleep, but you keep waking up. During this period you contemplate the course of events that have totally changed your life. You think about Candice...is she going to get her revenge on you and Jenny? You hope she doesn't complain to Denise, that could get both of you into trouble. Jacinta is another thing...you should keep the alliance with her. After all these hours your nose becomes slightly acclimated to the scent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right...it's time for a break.\" You finally hear Jenny's voice from above. You're relieved...maybe now she will pay you some attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I leave for awhile, Jenny? I could really stretch my bones.\" You ask hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Rob...you don't have permission to leave, you will just have to get through this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Jenny! Everyone has a break, so why can't I rest too?!\" You insist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't argue with me. You're my slave and you must do as I say. Be quiet now...our friend is coming.\" She cuts you off. You hear high heels clicking down and feel the floor wibration. You assume it must be Jacinta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you guys doing?!\" Your hunch was right, it's her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for asking. We're doing great, right Rob?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, mistress.\" You answer respectfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am glad you enjoy your new position.\" Jacinta leans down and makes a friendly eye contact with you. \"I've come up with an idea...and since it's the lunch time, I've prepared a special meal for you. I hope you don't mind, Jenny?\" She approaches your owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not. I am really curious what's your idea.\" Jenny answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Rob...look what I have here.\" Jacinta takes her shoe off and smiles flirtly. She sticks her black high heel to your face and you notice that in the insole there is a mushed up bread. You twist your face with disgust...she can't be serious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why you grimace? I thought you like my feet.\" Jacinta gives you an evil eye. \"I dedicate my time to add a flavour to this bread and I expected some gratitude from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologise.\" You quickly correct yourself. It is not worth wasting relationship with her, so you decide to play along. \"I didn't want to offend you and I am really thankful for your gift.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's much better!\" Jacinta's expression changed...\"I think you deserve your reward.\" She applies the shoe directly to your face. \"Eat up boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stick your tongue out to collect the food as the blonde holds her shoe in your face. The taste is absolutely disgusting, but you try to hide your reaction and pretend to be pleased. Besides, you realise that no matter what you have to eat something and it's always better than nothing. You face the fact that you need more food to stay strong even if you are forced to eat from woman's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good boy!\" Jacinta cheers you on. \"I expect the insole to be perfectly clean.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bread was not much so you lick vividly to make sure you consume everything. To your disappointment, you still feel hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I please have more?\" You beg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry, Rob! Unfortunatelly I didn't prepare more for you. So...do you admit that I was right and you enjoyed something that was practically my insole?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't want her to be upset, you have an impression that Jacinta really cares about you. Despite the fact of how humiliating eating from her sweaty shoes was you are thankful to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I admit...you were right. I loved the food you gave me, it is an honor to eat from your lovely feet. I am sorry for doubting in your generosity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacinta gleams with delight. Even Jenny glanced at you in disbelief.<br>\r\nIt looks like your speech has positively surprised both of the women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am glad you are so eager, Rob. Don' worry, next time i will cook your meal in both of my shoes.\" Jacinta smiles. \"See you guys later...and you Rob may kiss my foot goodbye.\" She holds her sole right above your face so you plant a kiss right between the toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she leaves... you hear Jenny's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am proud of you, Rob. You acted so humble and obedient, exactly like I want you to be. Maybe being my foot slave is your real calling.\" She smiles and plants both of her feet right on your face.</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, Jenny had placed her feet back over your face, leaving you completely clueless as to who it was.  \"Excuse me Jenny, may I have a word with you?\" You hear spoken from outside your hole. The voice sounds familiar, but you can't put a finger on a name or even a face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure Kim. What's up?\" Then you remember Kim. Your fellow manager now turned superior. The two of you have spoken during lunch now and then back when you still had your manager position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard that you recently got Rob as a foot slave in the office. Is this true?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard right Kim.\" She lifts her feet off your face once again. \"Say hi Rob.\" Kim kneels down under the desk and looks you in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hi Kim.\" You mutter in shame. Jenny grabs your nose with her toes and pulls your head out of the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not like that. Say hi the way a foot slave like you should.\" She points down to Kim's open-toed pumps. You grimace a little at the realization of what she intended you to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crane your neck further out of the hole and plant a kiss on her big toe, causing her to blush slightly at the unexpected gesture. \"Hello miss Kim.\" You say before slinking back into your hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better.\" Jenny says as she puts her feet back on your face once again. \"So is that it Kim, you just wanted to see him?\" Kim shakes her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, actually, I was curious about what it felt like to have a foot slave under me. Would you mind if I... borrowed him over to my office for a while? I promise I'll bring him right back.\" Just how many women in this building wanted a foot slave, anyway? Perhaps you should have looked into that in all your years of working here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that's neither here nor there, what does Jenny decide?</span></div></div>",

Rob is under training these days, and I am not sure if he will provide the proper service that fits someone like you and your level,\" Jenny said in a shaky voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so kind to say that Jenny! I am aware that Rob is still new in this, so I will bear that in mind.\" Kim told Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny could evade Kim's request, so she planned to buy some time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really want him to do great job, he still needs to learn how to clean feet and shoes properly. I will work on that during the day while I am doing my job, and tomorrow evening I am inviting you to my house for a snack and some foot pampering, How about that?\" Jenny said with pleading eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile appeared on Kim's face. \"Thank you for your invitation Jenny! I will definitely come.  We will have our snack, and you Rob.... you will have a special snack..! I hope you'll like it!\" Kim said while she raised her high heel over your face and wiggled it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, Miss Kim, I will enjoy the snack you'll bring to me,\" You said keeping the humble tone. \"Thank you Rob, I am flattered.\" Kim replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Jenny, see you tomorrow,\" Kim said while leaving the receptionist desk.

I want to get Kim on my side ... or our side,\" Jenny continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know... you know me, I hate feet and I hate their scent and taste and licking Jacinta's heels from inside was not easy on me,\" you replied in a sad tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny eyebrows went up when you mentioned Jacinta... Jenny got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, mentioning Jacinta,\" Jenny said... \"I think I need to invite her this evening so she can help me to train you!\" Jenny continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour memory of Jacinta's shoes made you feel how much horrible would her feet taste like. But you know that Jenny is right. You did not speak a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny called Jacinta on the phone:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Jacinta\" Jenny said \" I liked the idea of feeding Rob the insoles of our heels specially if its bread\" .... \"aha...\" ...\"so they're very comfy and absorbing\" ... \"aha...

Your face is totally soaked with Jenny's sweat as you feel like an insole under those nylon-covered feet. Your face is also numb from the pressure of her feet. You remember that your face is absorbing her sweat as you stopped sweating from your face due to the cream you rubbed on your face earlier.  You think to yourself \"At least she is my friend, and she has been very good to me and very nice even as an owner .. Even her feet are stinky but I need to be good... she will always help me against that bitch Denise... maybe she will manage to create a good alliance against Denise and her minions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart felt blessed by having Jenny as your friend and owner. This feeling has pushed you to start kissing her feet. Jenny thought you need to talk. She raised one foot and looked to you \"What's up Rob?\" she asked. \"Nothing, I just wanted to thank you for being a great friend and a nice owner,\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, that's so sweet... I am so happy you're doing good at my feet... keep kissing if you wan!t\" Jenny beamed. You kept kissing her feet for an hour!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime to go home....

You can get a cab back later if that works for you?\" The redhead scrunches her toes a little against your forehead while you merely grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seems to be the plan! Jacinta grins with her hands on her hips, staring down at you after Jenny lifts her feet up and orders you to crawl out from under her desk. It's no easy task; being under Jenny's feet for literally the whole day makes you painfully shuffle along on your numb legs, before rolling over and sliding along the carpet on your belly, like a worm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm soooo glad that you changed your mind about you giving me some time with him!\" The blonde chuckles, her eyes not leaving you for a moment. \"Rob...I mean <i>Jenny's slave</i>...you're in for the quite the evening!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny stands up, giving her friend a look. \"Hey, remember that I'm inviting you over so you can train him WITH me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not totally sure but you think you see Jacinta roll her eyes, or at least give away some indication that she's not too impressed with that. Anyway, she continues grinning before turning on her heel and leading the way out of the office, Jenny right behind her and you crawling along behind, now able to use your aching arms to force yourself along the ground. Fortunately no one else seems to be at the office at this time - that would be just what you needed!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you get into Jenny's car, the redhead clicks her fingers at the floor of the backseat, indicating that you need to lie down there. You glower as she yanks her heels off and throws them casually at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slave - you can smell my work shoes - I want the sweat sniffed out of them! I've got some sneakers for driving,\" Jenny tells you with authority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving been beneath her - metaphorically and literally - for so long now, obeying Jenny is becoming perfectly natural. Even the smell of her insoles is not <i>too</i> disgusting. Whether you like or not, you really are becoming Jenny's devoted foot slave!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the apartment, Jenny and Jacinta talk excitedly for several minutes in the living room, while you are left lying on your back, now with four heels positioned over your nose and mouth. The heady, cheddar stench of FOUR heels - Jenny's and Jacninta's - is a stinky cocktail that is much sharper than you'd like! After what seems like forever, you are ordered to remove the heels and crawl over to where the ladies are sat on the couch, their legs crossed, one foot from each of them dangling suggestively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, slave,\" Jenny finally says as you kneel down in front of the devious pair. \"In order to train you so that you become a total, obedient slave, who adores and lives for my feet, this is what we have decided to do...\"</span></div></div>",

Look, let's take this step by step. First off, slave, I want you to unzip your pants and let your cock out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with your current level of conditioning, you still hesitate to follow her orders at the shameful idea of letting your dick out in front of two women. But you still couldn't refuse her orders, unless you wanted Jacinta to hold any leverage over you both. Fighting through the hesitation, you sit back and begin to slowly unzip your jeans and pull out your flaccid cock, letting it flop to the side. Your eyes were focused back on Jenny, but out of the corner of your eye, you see Jacinta eying your dick and licking her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now, if we want this done right, you need to get excited, so jerk yourself off until you're nice and hard.\" Jenny orders. You are about to protest, but Jenny sees it coming and puts her big toe on your lips. \"That wasn't a request, slave, that was an order.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacinta giggles both at how easy you are to order around, and at the thought of watching her crush rub one out in front of her. You can feel your face turn red in shame as you start to stroke your shaft, imaging the most sexy things you can think of to get it up as fast as possible. Much to your confusion, your mind kept coming back to the two women before you, yet your body was still getting excited. What was happening to you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, it didn't take long for your second head to come to full attention. Jacinta felt her mouth water at the sight of it. \"Perfect, now for the final part. One of us is going to finish you off with her feet, while the other places her feet on your face while you kiss, lick, and sniff away. Your mind should associate the pleasure of orgasm with the sight, taste, feel, and scent of feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou understood her logic, ut that didn't make this any less humiliating.

You could never, NEVER imagine really loving the flavour, yet when that stench and taste is being paired with such sexual excitement from Jacinta's relentless foot rubbing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realise that you're not far from climaxing. You've always prided yourself on your sexual stamina and performance; it's usually been women wanting more of you than the other way round in the past. Yet now, here you are - licking Jenny's bare foot while a girl who crushed on you for for years is jerking you off with her feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N...no...please...s-stop...\" You groan weakly, desperately hoping that the women take pity on you. The words spill out from you as you have an image of actually WANTING to lick Jenny's feet, being turned on by them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacinta pauses for a moment, breathing heavily, her soles and toes still clamped around your shaft but ceasing to move. \"Jenny....\" The blonde woman looks down uncertainly, biting her lip as she brushes her hair away from her sweaty forehead. \"He did stay stop....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Jenny decide they should do?</span></div></div>",

That's why I want to train him to like feet as fast as possible to cut down on his torment at work.\" Jenny explains. \"Speaking of which... Rob, are you any more comfortable with feet then you were before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel your face go red in shame. \"I can't deny, I am starting to find your feet kind of sexy, both of you.\" You correct, looking back at Jacinta. \"Although I have to admit, you saying you had no interest in my cock and referring to it as my 'little friend' was a bit of an ego killer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny's face starts to go red with yours. \"Well it's true, I have no interest in it. I see you as a friend, not a lover.\" Jacinta cuts her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't try and play coy Jenny, I saw you eying his dick while I was jerking him. You want it, and him inside you too don't you?\" Both you and Jenny turn full red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that true Jenny?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah... it's true.\" Jenny admits with a stutter. The three of you sit in awkward silence before Jacinta speaks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't mind sharing as long as you let me borrow him every once and a while. Deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal.\" You both answer in sync.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

Beside all of that, you're still surprised that you got on Jenny's feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still sitting on the couch beside your two friends... Jenny remembered that you're still need more training for Kim's visit tomorrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey, we need to continue the training\" Jenny said.<br>\r\n\"What do you have in mind?\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you need to get trained for shoes cleaning services\" Jacinta said while pointing to their shoes at the door of the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes.. I believe Kim will request a thorough cleaning of her work heels as a first thing tomorrow... so you need to clean our shoes but this time without chocolate\" Jenny said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you feel disgusted. The idea of licking shoes directly without chocolate or anything that will kill the taste of shoes strikes shivers of disgust in you. but you don't want to argue with Jenny again so you just nodded. But you cannot hide the look of disgust from your face which both ladies had noticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Rob!\" Jacinta said...\"it will not be that bad, the inside of the shoes will taste similar to our feet but with a little bit more intensity due to the years of usage... while from outside it will taste more like dust and dirt... but the soles ... I don't know... I don't even want to imagine\" Jacinta stopped as she felt disgusted as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, we will skip licking the soles of shoes... who actually cleans the soles of shoes for real ??... unless we step on a chewing gum, or some mud there is nothing to clean there... so if there is nothing stuck on the soles .. you don't need to clean it\" Jenny comforted you... or at least relieved you a little bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go and get our shoes here\" Jacinta ordered you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went there and you brought the shoes and put them on the floor infront of their feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you see the toes marks and heels marks inside our shoes?\" Jacinta asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I do!\" you answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to keep licking the inside of our shoes till you cannot see these marks\" Jacinta <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held the shoes in your hand and raise it up to your face... before you put your face inside Jenny stopped you. \"The shoes should stay on the floor, you go down to them\" Jenny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leaned down... your face is now buried inside Jenny's right shoe... the scent of her feet rushed to your nose... the scent you're accustomed to by now. You started licking for 5 minutes... you raised your head to check whether the marks are gone or not... but you still can see them... you decided that you need to scrub them with your teeth... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyour teeth scrubbed the surface of the insole, you feel something peeling off the insole and your realize it's the toe jam that had created these marks. you kept scrubbing and licking for 15 minutes. The insole looked like brand new shoe. You then moved to the outside, licking the leather front, side and then the heel. then you moved to the left shoe and you've spent another 15 minutes doing the same thing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring that time, Jenny and Jacinta brought a bowl of water where they've put their feet in. After 30 minutes of licking Jenny's shoes only you felt very thirsty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you feel thirsty you may come and lap from this bowl, our feet have been there for 30 minutes but we did not start scrubbing our feet so it's still relatively clean\" Jenny said. \"Yeah, but after a while it won't be clean at all and you still have to drink from it\" Jacinta said as both ladies giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou crawled to the bowl and lapped some water. The water tasted like feet, but your tongue has been inside a shoe for 30 minutes so it doesn't really matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that you spent another 30 minutes in cleaning Jacinta's heels, which was a little more harder but you managed it. During that time Jenny and Jacinta were chatting normally as it's a normal thing to see you licking shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you've finished, you came to lap some water again, this time you've noticed that their feet skin began to float in the water... you took a fast sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Then Jenny asked you to do.............<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Once your lungs refilled with (admittedly stale) air, she then pinched your nose again, cutting off your air once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you like that Rob?\" Candice taunts. \"Because I think I'm not going to let go this time. I've got you for another twenty minutes. Think you can hold your breath that long? If not, then I recommend that you start kissing my feet, then I might just let you breathe again and you can kiss them for the rest of your time with me. Keep in mind though, if you pass out, you <b>will</b> be punished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel your lungs start to scream again for air. What do you do?</span></div></div>",

You summoned all of your strength, but her toes is closing any gap to breath from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end, you needed to take a breath, so you planted a kiss on Candice foot. \"That's a good start\" Candice said .. \"Now keep kissing\" she ordered while pinching your nose again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't want to pass out, so you kept on kissing. you feel defeated more and more by every kiss that you plant. She started to move her feet over your face so you can kiss her nyloned toes, soles and heels. during that, Candice felt relaxed by the pressure of your nose on the soles of her nyloned feet. \"You know that your nose can provide a great foot massage\" Candice commented. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n20 minutes has passed and only 10 minutes left for this one hour in Candice Hell. Suddenly, she stopped typing on her computer. She pushed herself backwords and looked down at you \"So, you have been 50 minutes under your feet. Are you enjoying your time? How does they smell like? Tell me, Rob!\" Candice asked you while pinching her toes on your nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have been smelling her rancid feet for 50 minutes, your face is bruised by her pumps... you really want to tell her that she has the worst feet you've ever been under. But you were afraid of her reaction. So, you looked to her and said \"It is my pleasure to serve your feet, Miss Candice. They smell delicious\" You cannot believe you came up with such a big lie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delicious you say, Well well! .... if they're that Delicious, I won't mind that you taste them\" Candice said. <br>\r\nInside of you, you're screaming \"No no no no no\"..... but before you say anything  she said: \"I think I have a great idea. I will not only grant you a taste of my feet, I want to see how deep you can take my feet down in your mouth\" she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked very scared and you tried to object by your words just murmured from your mouth as you don't want to open it for her feet. \"Open wide and say Aaaaagh\" Candice talked to you smoothly.  She leaned down and pinched your nose with her fingers while putting her toes on your mouth... you cannot breath from you nose and you need to open your mouth but you don't want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end, you knew she will win... you slightly opened your lips to grasp some air. But her toes pushed down your jaw and went deep into your mouth. The taste is horrible, even more than the scent. She kept on pushing, you felt that your show will dislocated but her foot kept going down... the whole toes are inside your mouth... \"Wow, go deeper\" She said excited. You've tried to move your head away but her foot kept you almost pined. Her toes reached the top of your throat, you gagged... its your first time to have such a feeling of humiliation and disgust. You couldn't hold it any more, and you vomited on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew ew... bad slave\" Candice felt disgusted... \"I don't need you anymore, go back to your owner you filthy dog\" she continued. She then looked to Jenny and said \"Your slave indeed needs more training, get him well-trained and make him ready for me next time... As next time I want to shove my whole foot in his mouth from toes to heel\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny was furious, but she could not do anything but nodding. Candice stormed out to clean her feet. While you crawled under the floor to under Jenny's desk. She was waiting for you. You could see the sympathy towards you in her eyes.. she took a handkerchief and cleaned your face. \"thanks Jenny\" you whispered...\"Sorry Rob, I couldn't do anything to help you... you know why..\" she said in a sad tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way Rob, after what I've seen, I think you will face a lot of challenges under women feet and you need to get well trained for that...\" Jenny told you... \"What do you have in mind?\" you said... she started thinking and then she came up with an idea....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhat is it?   </span></div></div>",

We need to have you train your gag reflex so you can handle more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so how do we do that?\" You whisper up to her before she re-covers your face with her feet.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Jenny started sliding her nyloned foot in your mouth. The taste of the sweaty foot struck you again. However, you still prefer Jenny's feet more than any other lady. Her toes are now fully in your mouth. You pushed down your jaw and tongue to give more space for the foot to slide. Jenny pushed her put further. The upper part of her foot slides slowly in your mouth. the soft fabric of the nylon helped in a smoother slide. The tip of her toes hit the top of your throat. A gag reflex rushed out but you manged to tap on Jenny's foot. Jenny retreated her foot out of your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that was closed\" You whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny looked at the saliva-wet part of her nyloned foot. She noticed that only one third of her foot slid in your mouth. \"It seems we will have a hard night tonight, only this much went down and we need to get the rest by tonight\" Jenny said while showing you how much of her foot you need to slide. You were worried thus you swallowed your saliva with all of the sweaty taste of Jenny's feet. \"Okey, how do you think I can get a size 6 foot in my mouth?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me see what can we do\" Jenny answered<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then covered your face with her feet and started typing on her computer. An hour went by and you've lost track of time under her feet. She was so immersed in working and you've started questioning whether she forgot about you.. you've started imagining what would be the situation after a year from now, would it still be the same ? would your brain be accustomed to women feet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've heard her talking on the phone. She was talking to Jacinta. you've heard them discussing what should they do to you but you did not get the whole story.. \"so see you at the end of the day\" Jenny ended the call. You were curious what they're up to.. as her feet is covering your feet you know you're not allowed to speak unless she allows you. You kissed her feet to request a permission to speak but she did not respond. You stopped kissing realizing that its not the right time to speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny tapped your face and told you \"we'll talk later, but could you please keep kissing my feet till then... it really relaxes me when do that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your mind you were saying \"Seriously, even you Jenny?\" but then you said to yourself its better than doing nothing, and its better to do it for Jenny than anyone else.. so you started kissing.. \"Thanks Rob , keep kissing\" Jenny told you as she resumed working on her computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours went while you're kissing Jenny's feet. You've heard the clicks of heels approaching. By the clicks pattern you knew she was Jacinta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Jenny\" Jacinta said... \"Hey Jacinta\" Jenny answered. Then they chatted for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how is Rob?\" Jacinta asked.. \"He's doing great job, want to say Hi?\" Jenny answered.. \"Sure\" Jacinta answered.<br>\r\nJenny removed her feet from your face, the light and cold air hit your face but you noticed Jacinta towering you. She leaned towards you and removed one shoe and pushed her foot on your face. You kissed her foot as a greeting while she greeted you \"Hello Rob, its nice of you to kiss my foot, how was your day? I've heard you had hard time with Candice this morning\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it was a hard day indeed. But thanks to Jenny we will manage to overcome any problem... today we will find a way to get her foot in my mouth from toes to heels but we don't know how ... or at least I don't know how\" you said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it will be a very hard time tonight but I will help you guys\" Jacinta said. \"How?\" Jenny asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny! what do you do when you buy a new heels and you found it very tight?\" Jacinta asked .. \"I break it in gradually\" Jenny answered<br>\r\n\"Well, in simple words, Rob is the new heels that you need to break it in\" Jacinta said that while giggling. Jenny giggled as well... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacinta's words were harsh but true.. you're a property for feet, being treated like heels should be a normal thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are two ways to get this done\" Jacinta started to explain<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The first method is to fully sedate Rob, and then we will do it the hard way... we might dislocate his jaw but he won't feel anything, then he'll wake up while your foot is fully wearing him and then he will take the shocked.. but you need to stay wearing him for 6 hours to settle down but there will be no pain\" Jacinta explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the other method?\" Jenny asked in worried sound<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The other way is keeping Rob awake, but he will take anti reflex and muscles relaxing medicine. He will feel alot of pain through the process but he won't be shocked for the new situation and he can sleep the night free from your feet\" Jacinta finished explaining<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what would you prefer Rob? A long night worn as shoe with no pain, or 4 hours of pain and then you're free for the rest of the night?\" Jenny asked you<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would you choose?</span></div></div>",

Through this time I will train Rob to take my whole foot in his mouth... it will be at slower pace, it will not dislocate any jaw and you will not be fully sedated... but you need to get the gag reflex pills and the muscle relaxing shots in your jaw muscles\" Jenny explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on! two days are not enough!\" you objected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I cannot gamble what would be the reaction if you puked on Denise's foot or even Candice foot again.... I don't want to be fired.. this is the reason why me and you are in this place... remember!\" Jenny responded <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... but\" you murmured ..... \"Man up, Rob!! sooner or later you'll have to do it... it's better to start with Jenny, then me as our feet are quite small... and two days is more than enough... I will come every evening to help you Jenny\" Jacinta commented. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great, so what do you think, Rob?\" Jenny asked while looking at you with authoritarian gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, okey... but I am worried.\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, but I cannot promise that there will be no pain... but what is better than Tequila to wash all the pain away\" Jenny said <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really miss the taste of Tequila... and you remembered those nights when you drank too much and was knocked out by alcohol. waking up on the sidewalk nearby the bar or club. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring that time Jenny applied for the two day off. and then you went home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached home, Jenny prepared  1 pill and 1 shot. She called you and told you to drink the pill. Then she administrated the shot in your jaw. 5 minutes later your jaws felt very relaxed that you need to push them to close your mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny came and checked your jaw, \"I think you're ready, come and lay down\" Jenny said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny had prepared the room for you, She spread plastic sheets over the floor in case you puked. She brought a big head gear that looked like a metal cast. You asked her \"what's that over there?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a head restrainer, it will prevent your head from moving right and left while I push my foot deep in your mouth\" Jenny replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou panic! \"Don't worry, drink as much Tequila as you want\" Jenny said. You gulped 5 shots in a raw. Usually your stomach cannot handle 5 shots in a raw but the gag reflex pill prevented you from puking. You started to loose your soberness. Jenny held your hand and guided you in the head restrainer and locked you in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen Rob, when I usually want to brake a new tight heels I wear nylons as this will soften the friction between my skin and the leather of the shoes\" Jenny said while putting her nyloned foot over your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okey, please try to be gentle.. I will try my best to handle the pain... I will give you this sign when I cannot take it any more\" you said while raising your hands and tapping on Jenny's knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal, whenevr you cannot take it anymore, I will remove my foot, give you 15 minutes break, and you will drink 5 shots of Tiquila in every break.... Deal?\" Jenny asked .... \"Deal\" you answered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open wide\" Jenny said as her toes started going down your mouth... The 5 toes went down, now the foot started going down... the pain is growing more and more.. you feel her toes reaching the tip of your throat... you thought you will puke but you didn't... she kept pushing further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer toes reached your throat... however the pain in the jaws become unbearbale... you tapped on her knees rapidly.. Jenny got her foot out..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive, Rob... I have inserted two thirds of my foot inside your mouth\" Jenny complemented...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in extreme pain, you felt your jaws almost broken but you checked it and it's still intact... the pain in the jaws muscles was too much you begged for 2 shots of muscle relaxer.. Jenny adminstered the shots for you.<br>\r\nthe pain is reduced and you lost the control on your jaw. Jenny offered you the Tiquila shot.. you moved and grabed the whole bottle and started pouring in your mouth... you drank an amount of 10 shots at once...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou layed down on the floor... Jenny let you relax for a while... the amount of alcohol was too much and you feel you'll knock out soon... you crowled on the floor and managed to put your head back in the head restrainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am ready for another round, Jenny\" you said.. \"if I pass out, please make sure not to brake my jaw nor my teeth\" you continued... \"I promise you I won't do that\" Jenny replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your mouth, Jenny slided her foot in your mouth.. this time it was much faster... the foot has reached the maximum limit of last time.. the pain was much less... she continued pushing.. you tried your best to stay awake<br>\r\nBut you passed out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what it felt like ages... you woke up... you noticed that Jenny's foot is totally in your mouth... you could feel the toes deeply in your throat and her heel is on your tongue. You'd opened your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou saw Jenny's leg raising up from your mouth and you've seen Jacinta's legs.. you've heard them talking... you moved your head and you realized you're out of the restainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny and Jacinta looked down at you with wide smiles at their faces \"Rob, you're finally up.... Congratualtion, you're not only my foot slave, you're my foot wear now\" Jenny congradulated you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have knocked out for 16 hours now\" Jacinta said, \"Jenny called me to tell me the good news, and I came quickly to check on you.. so how do you feel? if you feel good blink once, if you feel bad blink twice\" Jacinta continued..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked twice as you were suffering from severe headache from the alcohol... also your mouth is unusually dry... you pointed at your head and at your mouth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The headache is natural for the amount Tequila you drank... and regarding your mouth, I brought a jell that will dry your mouth for 24 hours so you won't produce saliva during the time you're worn... eventually Jenny's foot will provide your mouth the humidty it needs\" Jacinta said while giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does he look cute on my foot?\" Jenny asked... \"Lucky you, Jenny! I cannot wait to try him on\" Jacinta replied...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an idea\" Jenny said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will they do to you?</span></div></div>",

Jenny joint her by rubbing it and tapping on your balls...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince you've become a foot slave, you have never had a release with someone... usually you get your release through wet dreams which faded by time as your dreams become only nightmares from the life surrounded by feet....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were overwhelmed with excitement, you bite your lips and you tried to approach their legs to kiss them....when you tried to sit and kiss Jacinta's leg.. Jacinta pushed you down on the floor and stepped on your face... \"Kiss my foot... you are  foot property and you only have access to feet and foot wear\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is right, Robby!! you only belong to feet now, and we are superior beings to you... \" Jenny commented...You were shocked.... its like you woke up from a nice dream to reality.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Rob! Just enjoy it... who knows when will be the next time\" Jenny said... she now added oil on her feet and on your cock... the sensation is too much now,The frequency of rubbing becomes faster and faster.....with Jacinta's foot on your face... you started kissing them insanely like there is no tomorrow... you could not control yourself anymore.... finally you come<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny brought some tissues and cleaned her feet, and gave you some to clean yourself.... \"Thank you ladies for everything\" you said... you still look sad for what they said to you earlier.. you looked at them with disappointment..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rob! my dear.... deeply inside me and Jacinta ... you are still Rob, our dear friend... but since you become a foot property, .... ummm.. you're still our friend deeply but actually you're a foot slave... we won't do anything without your consent despite the fact that we can do that. ... you need to know that no matter how dear you're to us... your place will always be under our feet..clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shocked your head in agreement... but you looked heart broken...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember, I still need to try you as a foot wear....

So what so you suggest we do next then?\" Jacinta asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's a few things we can do now. First off, with Rob's training almost complete, we can start to get a lot more lax in private and not have him act like a servant while it's just us. So maybe tonight we can just relax and watch a movie. Maybe giving him some slack like that will teach him that we do, in fact, care for him.\" Jenny suggests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. But he still has things he will need to adjust to soon before someone with less patience tries them on him. For example, what happens if Helena wants to use him as a floor mat. We should train his body to handle trampling before that happens.\" Jacinta beings up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Jenny had to admit that she was right on that. If that did happen down the road, you'd be bruised like a banana. \"Yeah, I suppose you're right. There's also the possibility that Denise could have him service the women at board meetings. He could end up crawled around cleaning feet for far longer than he's done so far. Maybe it would be best to work on his stamina.\" Jenny muses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it would suck for you two if he collapsed in the middle of something like that and embarrassed Denise. Hmmm, so many choices, so little time.\" Jacinta ponders. \"Rob, you get the final call here. What should we do tonight?\"</span></div></div>",

What made it even worse was that Jacinta who once had a crush on you saw you as nothing more then a foot bitch now. You tried ignore the pain and pull through the rapid stomps on your stomach that Jacinta repeated over and over. You bit down harder on Jenny's worn ballerina shoe, tasting the filth and dirt caking it as your eyes watered from both the pain and humiliation as your former lover used you like a rug. Jacinta seemed to show less and less concern with your well being as her stomps became more aggressive, truly seeing him more as a rug. At one point, Jacinta's nylon sole came into view just above your face, giving you a good view of her perfectly smooth sweaty arch and toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now be a good rug and don't resist, you'll accept your place beneath our feet soon enough little rug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could say another word, Jacinta's sole came crashing down on your face, bruising it as your senses were flooded with both pain and the intense sweaty odor of her soles. You weakly try to squirm around but Jenny was having none of it, kicking your crotch so a wild muffled cry vibrated against her shoe. The reaction made a heartless giggle come from the two girls as Jenny stepped onto your crotch, letting her weight and toes sink down against it. When it stiffened, she scrunch her toes up against it's, gripping your shaft lightly through your pants. Your hips buckle of their own violation as you yelp weakly, making Jacinta double her efforts, her sweaty musky nylon soles completely encasing you in a sweaty musky tomb that filled your nose with it's leathery intense powerful stench. Your eyes bulge both from the pressure and suffocating odor that permeated the air as Jacinta marked your face with more reddish sweaty imprints, asserting her control over you while Jenny continued to toy with your crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never imagined Rob would be such a fun toy to air our feet on! It truly makes such a thrilling toy to play with!\" Remarked Jenny as she shifted her soles on your crotch, grinding against it a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because he belongs beneath woman like us. I was chasing after a worthless rug all this time and only now I see just how befitting it is having him serving our feet.\" Jacinta firmly wedges her heel roughly against your lips, forcing it open inch by inch, causing Jenny's ballerina shoe to ease it's way deeply into your bulging mouth. Jacinta's toes firmly press against your nose, encasing it so there wasn't an inch of freedom for you to breath in fresh air. Your mind becomes hazy as your lids begin to droop, seeing that there was no way of getting these two to budge. You slowly were scumming to their feet and accepting your place as a worthless rug to be abused and mistreated by other women.</span></div></div>",

Soon, Jenny returned. \"Okay, doc says that we should see how much blood comes out. If there's a puddle that's bigger than a foot around, then he's punctured a lung and needs to go to a hospital. Anything less and he should be okay with some bed rest.\" She tells her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more blood's come out, and the puddle that's there doesn't even look big enough to put my hand in.\" Jacinta says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, then he's fine.\" Jenny sighs in relief. \"Now what the hell are you doing putting your foot in his face like this?\" She scolds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He asked for feet, so I gave him one.\" Jacinta defends as they turn to see you almost mindlessly kissing her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just work on getting him back to thinking he's human.\" Jenny sighs as she pinches her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

I didn't say I love feet\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't want you to love feet\" Jenny said, \"we want you to accept involving feet in most of your life activities.. eating, sleeping, drinking, \" Jenny continued ..... \"even dating *giggle\" Jacinta laughed and so did Jenny<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou left an eyebrow with a questioning stare .... \"Yes, Rob... you are our friend... but your life will always be focused about serving our feet and shoes\" Jenny <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth ladies sat on their chairs, they took out one slice of pizza and threw it on the floor... they started smashing and crushing the slice under their feet.... after mushing the slice totally under their toes.. Jenny pointed to you to kneel down..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your dinner is ready, Rob! bon apetite\" Jenny said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou approached Jenny's foot, you can see the cheese and bread mushed around her toes... the closer you are, the more the the mixed scent of cheese and Jenny's feet you can feel... you hesitated from two seconds... then you licked some pizza mush... The tasted is as expected... bread, cheese marinara sauce, and ofcourse significant hint of the taste of Jenny's feet... nothing unusual for you... recently you have tasted her feet many times.... even you swallowed her whole foot in your throat...you kept licking until you finished her feet and with no hesitation you started licking Jacinta's feet<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls looked at each other with amusement.... they'd never throught you'll do such a thing ... \"Well done, Rob!... good job.. you really cleaned our feet very well... no crumbs left... amazing...  let me catch the rest of that slice form the floor\" Jenny said ... she started to collect the rest of crumbs from the floor by her toes.... you put your face on the floor near her toes and continued licked her toes and even the floor....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Wow Rob... you're awesome... from now on, you're snack at work will always be from our shoes... remember that piece of toast you ate... from now on... you will get four toast from both me and Jenny... they will be extra flavored\" Jacinta said<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor you, you're still in surprise of you new self... however you still don't like feet but you don't hate them neither... \"it won't be in my top 10 dishes.. but I can survive' you said agreeing.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well ... well... there are other three slices of pizza ... what should we do with the next slice? or should we do something else Jacinta?\" Jenny asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happen next<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You were complying as you started to feel her control over you. you looked in the opening and you see that there is no enough space for your head. you pushed your head inside, pushing her shoes to both sides of your head. Jenny came from the closet door side and looked at you and smiled. \"Let's make it more comfortable to you!\" she said. She pushed her work heels a little bit away from your head (2 inches) and flipped the heels she wore today at work so the inside of the shoe will be against your face if you slept on your right or left side. You looked up and you say the soles of her ballerina and the soles of party shoes. The scent of her heels reached your nose. they were still humid. \"And now I'm going bed, good night Rob! Sweet dream!\" Jenny said that normally like she has just tucked you in bed and then she closed the closet door. Sending you in the darkness, the air of the closet is filled with the aroma of leather, humidity, the dirt and Jenny's feet. You can't believe that you ended up sleeping in a shoe closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you felt something moving on your neck. You realized that Jenny is up to something. you tried to move but Jenny calmed you down. \"This is just to make sure that you don't sneak out during the night\" Jenny informed. You realized there is no way out till the morning as you heard Jenny's step moving away from the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't sleep, you are suffering from a headache caused by the intoxication from the scents of the closet. At last you managed to sleep and you had nightmares about your future. It was a very long night for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could not figure whether morning had come or not, as you're still in the darkness of the closet. You heard Jenny's steps as she woke up, going to the bathroom and took her morning shower. She then started to dress for work. Finally you heard her approaching to the closet. She opened the door, the light almost blinded you. You were happy to see her face. \"Good morning, Rob! How was your first night?\" she asked you with her normal smiley face. \"Good morning, Jenny!, it was a very long night but I managed to sleep a couple of hours\", \"That's good, I promise it will be better day by day\" Jenny comforted you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny looked into her shoes and picked one of her shoes for work. But before she picked it she put her foot beside your face, \"The good morning kiss for my feet\" Jenny ordered. You complied and kissed her foot. She unlocked your neck and you could get out of the closet. \"You may use the toilet, but remember you're not allowed to wash your face\" Jenny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still feel that she is your friend, and this is why you comply to her without feeling much degradation. As soon as you got out of the bathroom. You found Jenny having breakfast. You saw a bowl of cereals between her feet under the table. She pointed at the bowl and told you \"your breakfast is ready\". You wanted to object but you remembered the whole discussions so you crawled down the table and started to lick and suck the food from the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went together to work. You've noticed some changes in the receptionists desk on the front door. The desk are higher than before.   Candice was waiting at the front desk, \"Rob!\" Candice called you, \"you crawl from here\" she pointed at a small opening under the new floor of the receptionist desk. \"As you're now a foot slave, Denise decide to give you a proper place to work from rather than occupying our floors, you should operate under the floors, just follow the guidelines on your way\" Candice said. Jenny and you were surprised to see that, you looked to each other's eyes and then she told you \"work time, to your place\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groveled inside the tunnel, you find an opening that barely allows your face to look up from. You've realized that your face is on the level of the floors under Jenny's desk. Jenny was sitting on her seat looking down at you with Candice standing beside also looking at you.You felt yourself very small under them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See Rob, now you're below the floors, beneath the level of the soles of our heels. You look pathetic. But it's your destiny to live under our feet forever.\" Candice said. you couldn't speak a word as you're not allowed to speak . you were waiting Jenny to defend you but she kept looking at you with a fake sad face. \"Don't worry, Rob! It will fine\" Jenny comforted you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Jenny did not take off her shoes. But she did not put them on your face neither. you watched her heels coming very near to your face but she did not step on you. Jenny was focusing on finishing some paper work, with no intention she put her right foot with her heels on over your forehead and crossed her legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure was enormous, and the soles of the heels are very hard compared to Jenny soft soles. You were not able to speak nor able to kiss her shoes. So you just hoped that she removes her feet. Suddenly, you heard Candice calling Jenny for the morning coffee brake. What a relief!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you heard some heels approaching you! Who is she??<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Nerves fill your body with a horrifying tingle as you think about what you're about to do... But that feeling is replaced with fear as before Jenny can sit down, you hear a different voice speak, accompanied by foot steps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh shit! Somebody else has come over to Jenny's desk! Did somebody see you crawl under?? As you look back at Jenny's now bare feet, a new pair of heels come into view... Unfortunately for you, you don't check out women's feet ask day, so you have absolutely no idea who they belong to! You strain your ears trying to listen to who it could be, but they are talking quite softly and the voices are somewhat muffled to you being under the desk. You hope to God this person leaves soon, whoever they are!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you listen carefully, every now and then you can make out some of the words that are being said...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"............ That document to be sent....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank god, it seems like they are talking about something work related. At least nobody saw you and nobody knows where you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Well it was supposed to go yesterday......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Busy, I just didn't get to it..... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounds like whoever this person is, they aren't too happy with Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Doing nothing all day? I mean, look, your heels are off, you're bare foot!...\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nOh shit, whoever she is, she's looking at Jenny's feet! You curl into a tight ball hoping that none of your limbs are sticking out from under Jenny's desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Why are you bare foot anyway? Are you going to get Rob to kiss your feet and take his pay?.... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh god... Why did the conversation have to go to that topic?!? You try to hear Jenny's response, but her voice is even more muffled than it was before. It sounds like she is struggling to respond to this person's question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Pathetic, get out of here, go send that for now before I go and see Denise!...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny doesn't even put her heels back on, as you see her bare feet start walking off towards the copying room. This is quite possibly the worst thing that could have happened right now! You watch the unknown woman's feet, hoping to God that she leaves Jenny's desk...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathe a sigh of relief as suddenly the feet turn and walk away! Bullet dodged!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... All of a sudden, she stops..... She turns and starts heading back to Jenny's desk! Your heart stops as you wait to see what she does...</span></div></div>",

The fact that she sounds so triumphant at finding you only exacerbates the fear that is enveloping you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been looking for you....and here you are, hiding under your loser-friend's desk!\" Candice says cattily, a smirk on her annoying face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurled up in such an uncomfortable position, you attempt to salvage some pride by attempting to appear casual. \"Er, hi. I'm just...looking for something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha!\" Candice snorts. \"Yeah right: you decide to look for something the same day that Denise announces the best news ever! This is just perfect!\" She hops down on to Jenny's chair and places both heels firmly onto your back. As they dig into your ribs and your lower back, you can't help but let out a cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop....you bitch!\" You grunt up at her, hating the fact that you can still see her horribly smug, powdered face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch it, loser. You're under me: literally and metaphorically. Be a good boy or I'll just...press a little harder...\" She says in an ominous tone as the end of one heel prods with such force that the shoe itself comes halfway off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owwww! Please...!\" You gasp, wishing that you could manoeuvre yourself out of this. No such luck: you are well and truly trapped in this awkward position!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, douchebag. Denise is gonna walk all over you now she's the Senior Manager. And as her best friend,\" She pauses here as if you should be impressed. \"That means I can walk all over you too! We've waited for years to put you in your fucking place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dangling heel drops off so that her bare foot is now pressed against your back. As soon as her shoe drops off, a musty stench spreads around you, making you gag. Writhing in agony, you roll to your side but find only the hard wood of Jenny's desk. Having no real choice, you allow Candice's feet to push you firmly onto your back. Ruing your bad luck, you find that one arm is trapped under the base of the office chair, while the other is squashed painfully under your back somehow, as it becomes increasingly numb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! That's better - now you can get a good look at what you're about to kiss! My FOOT!\" Candice laughs at you, making you feel entirely hopeless. Wishing Jenny would come back to get you out of this, you suffer under this bitch of a receptionist!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm maybe you weren't hiding....maybe you were about to kiss that loser-friend-of-yours foot instead...?\" Candice says curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start denying it, wary of avoiding any trouble for Jenny if you can help it, but the heeled foot plants squarely over your mouth, muffling your voice. <i>At least she didn't use her bare foot</i>, is the only thing you can be thankful for right now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save it, foot boy. That little bitch won't be back for a while, believe me after the stuff I've given her to do! Now let's get to why I'm here. You are going to kiss my foot; I am going to get half of your salary,\" she says matter-of-factly. \"You are going to kiss the foot of the woman who has beaten you! Now, take my heel off with my mouth so I can put my feet on your face. Do it quickly, then I will let you kiss my feet just once, maybe twice. Decide not to and I will completely humiliate you!\" She giggles nastily. \"So, what's it gonna be, loser?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandice places the sharp part of her heel over your mouth and taps her front teeth with it, as if to indicate that you can use them to pull it off her foot, therefore sealing your fate... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre you going to submit, to Candice of all people?!</span></div></div>",

You struggle harder as a grin comes over Candice's face. She holds her phone to her face and presses record, starting off with what is obviously some kind of introduction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello everybody, my name is Candice Watson, and this morning I was given a fantastic opportunity...\" She begins. \"Our amazing new boss has offered a substantial pay increase to the first woman in the office that can force the office pig Rob to kiss her feet and produce evidence to her. Well, I am proud to say that I have this very pig under my feet as we speak, stuck under a desk, unable to move, completely at my mercy. Let's have some fun shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandice then maneuvers the phone so that the camera is now on you. Humiliated and scared, you begin to struggle again, grunting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell our viewers pig... What's your name?\" Candice asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off me bitch!\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... Wrong answer\" Candice says to you. All of a sudden, she pushes her high heel into your ribs hard! You cry out in agony as you hear Candice start to laugh at your cries of pain. \"I'll try again, and let's see what comes first... The correct answer, or a broken rib! What is your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh, ok, ok please, it's Rob! My name is Rob\" you cry out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go... Now let's get this show started shall we?\" Candice says with a smile as she kicks the remaining shoe off, revealing both bare feet. Unable to stop her, you're forced to watch as she lifts one bare foot up and places it over your face. \"Now Rob, tell everybody what my foot smells like. Take a deep whiff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou refuse in take a deep smell, but with her foot on your face you have no choice but to inhale her foot odour. You cringe in disgust as the smell of foot seat overcomes your senses and you begin struggling with a renewed energy, but the struggling is no use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They... They smell like shit!\" You cry out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really? Another wrong answer, you know what that means people!\" Candice says. She then pushes her sweaty smelly bare feet right into your face, crushing you like a bug under her. You struggle and cry out again, but this time your cries are muffled by the soles of her feet. As you attempt to shout, her foot sweaty involuntarily makes its way into your mouth. The taste is disgusting, even else than the smell, but no where near as bad as the psychological torture this is taking on you. Just when your mind breaks and you decide you can't take any more, Candice lifts her feet up... You waste no time at all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh, ok fine Candice, they smell good!\" You shout out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh my, have my feet broken you already? This is too good!

This is it: this is Denise's evil plan coming to complete fruition. In a way, you have to grudgingly hand it to her - she knew full well that it was only a matter of time that you would be forced to kiss disgusting feet against your own will. And for it to be Candice of all people...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very thought of that gives you a jolt of adrenaline. Biting on the end of her left heel, the brunette receptionist lets out a cry of pain and automatically jerks her foot up. The right one however is pushed firmly down onto your face, causing the back of your head to sink into the carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh! You piece of shit!\" Candice shouts down at you in fury. Using a hand to clasp the end of her foot where your bite marks are, she puts her phone down temporarily. \"Now I'll have to edit that. Man you're such a pain in the fucking ass! Well, a pain on the end of my foot!\" She smirks at you malevolently, despite her pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is a small victory, you realise. Candice has you completely trapped and the putrid smell of her bare foot is making you nauseous to the point that you're going to hurl. Your vision obscured by her increasingly sweaty sole, you let out a groan of frustration, wishing you could free your arms and force her off you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, am I gonna enjoy it when you're kissing my feet like the loser you are,\" Candice states confidently, resuming the position of her other bare foot over your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pmmease....!\" Is all you can gurgle up at her, now that your face is completely covered by her god-awful smelling soles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do they smell?\" She says with mock-innocence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-a-amazing...!\" You gasp up at her, desperately hoping that she will let off you, yet she doesn't!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you before: you said my feet smelled amazing! You need to kiss them! Unless you want more of this...\" She laughs as she exerts more pressure with her feet, sliding them along your face, pinching your cheeks with her toes. Just when you consider suddenly biting at them again, Candice pushes the centre of one sole over your mouth so firmly that it is sealed tightly shut. Her sweaty toes tap against your forehead while you squirm to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiss my foot, kiss it!\" You can just make out her phone pointed squarely at you, just above the tops of her toes. \"Kiss it now and accept that I've beaten you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lets off you only very slightly, but just enough so that her feet are placed over your mouth and nose. There's enough pressure forced on you from her soles that you can't use your teeth at all, but you do have some movement with your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is it - it's either kiss her foot or just hope that you are saved, or pass out from the nausea!</span></div></div>",

You should be aware I am no philanthropist, especially when it comes to my property.\" Michelle's expression did not change. For her, all of this was just a game, and you were just prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped at the mention of property, not believing what had happened for just one day. \"Let's say I do everything as you wish. Will Jenny be able to keep her job?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle burst into laughter as she heard your request. That, terrified you even further, being in the situation you were. \"Here you are, Rob, the top sells performer of the firm, who is about to lose his dignity and humanity to a mere intern he met only a week ago and all you can think of is Jenny's well-being? Aren't you just wonderful?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle moved her right foot to your head and started petting you with it. \"Since you asked so nicely.\" Michelle took a phone out of the bag she was carrying. \"Jenny will keep her job. I will make sure she gets a promotion. Of course, as we know in this field, nothing comes for free. We may tell it does, but does it ever really?\" Michelle was visibly searching for something on her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe your ears. Here you were, below your best-friend and cousin's desk, lectured by a mere intern. As much as it pained you, you had to comply. \"Of course it doesn't Michelle. What do I have to do for your generosity?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you asked! So that nothing goes south when we are in Denise's office, I need to feel secure that you won't back off from our deal. That's why I have a proposal. I will make a video of you telling everyone how much you adore my feet, as well as how you would like to be my servant during work hours.</span></div></div>",

Find some other loser to get some money out of,\" you say harshly, shaking your head at her in disdain as you stroll off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear an agitated sigh behind you as you head your way back to your desk but ignore it: Jenny's dead to you, as far as you're concerned!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to focus on some work that's been hanging over you for a while, you begin typing away, your mind still troubled by Denise's declaration to the female staff. What a bitch! She is seriously hell bent on making your life a misery. In the past, you wouldn't be that bothered about such a situation, but things are different now. Noticeably different! Now Denise holds a tangible authority over you, others have less reason to flock to your side, to support you. Jenny is living proof of that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continue your email, you become increasingly aware that there are several pairs of eyes on you. Better than several pairs of feet on you, you grimly muse to yourself. Surely, you are a target now: nothing but prey to any woman who would eagerly take half of your pay check away! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Rob!\" Jacinta, the blonde who you suspect has a crush on you, appears behind you, startling you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey,\" you reply warily. \"What do you...want?\" You don't want to sound rude, but you have every right to be suspicious!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just...\" Jacinta pulls up a nearby office chair so she is sitting right beside you, so close that you can smell her strong, vanilla scented perfume.

All I was gonna say was that I'm here for you. If you wanna talk, I'm here for you.\" She leans forwards to squeeze your knee gently before leaning back to a more comfortable position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching her closely, you have to admit that she is by no means unattractive. Sure she has a rather large nose and an usually wide mouth (especially when she smiles!), yet she's well-dressed: with her smart yet stylish purple dress, and expensive-looking shoes. It's strange how you've never found her attractive - maybe the fact that you've always thought of her as having amorous feelings for you has been off-putting, somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" you mutter uncertainly, still trying to suss out if she's for real.

Wearing a white summer dress and a seemingly innocent expression, your eyes meet but only temporarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this young, petite brunette walks on, you realise it must be the new girl, Michelle. With all the tumultuous events of the day so far, you had practically forgotten about the office having a newbie.

You still can't believe what happened today.<br>\r\nHow could you let this arrogant receptionist dominate you like that? If you hadn't offended  Jenny and Jacinta,<br>\r\nmaybe you could ask them for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is too late now.\" You say to yourself: \"Candice already has the proof of me kissing her feet and she will show this do Denise\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach the door with \"Senior Manager\" plate. A day ago you were convinced that this office will be yours, but things have changed.<br>\r\nYou knock and after \"Come in\" command you go in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise looks at you and smiles: \"I knew you will be back. Candice has sent me a really interesting video. Looks like we have a winner! <br>\r\nNow half of your pay belongs to her. I have no idea how she managed to break you so easly, but it doesn't matter.

I would like to recompensate for my disbehaviour<br>\r\nby being your personal footrest.

It is like my dreams come true! - she exclaimed exticedly.<br>\r\nI agree.. You may be my footstool if you want so much.\" - she smiles - \"Get under my desk now and lay on your back\" - Denise order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay on the carpet floor under the desk that you thought will belong to you. Denise starts to take her shoes off and put them near your head.<br>\r\nThe bad smell from heels hits your nostrills but you are too afraid to say something. Then she plants both of her nylon feet on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now stay still, footstool.\" - you hear from above - \"I have a job to do\" - the blonde says and starts to write on her computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were told, you lay on the floor with Denise's feet on your face. The smell is really strong and the more you time you stay there,<br>\r\nsuffering, the more you appreciate Candice's feet. In comparsion to Denise they are heavenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter something about 30 minutes your boss says:<br>\r\n\"Do you remember what I have told you? That you will kiss my feet? That you will be my slave? You said you will never do this,<br>\r\nand you said my feet are disgusting. So let me ask you, do you really find them disgusting?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou absolutely hate that, but you have no choice but to play her game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Ma'am you feet are perfect, they are beautiful and divine\" You stutter and start kissing her nylon soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 10 minutes of kissing, Denise tests you again:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really believe you, loser. You have to convince me that you really love my feet. I want you to lick my shoes, inside and out.<br>\r\nIf you do a good job i might actually believe you\" The blonde smirks and you and waits for your reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What cruel fate will they prepare for you?<br>\r\nYou can feel your knees are starting to hurt from all that kneeling before your former rival. Denise is busy on her computer, giving you an angry look once in a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you hear knocking on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in!\" Denise yells and you look behind you. It is Candice, the same receptionist who outsmarted you and made you kiss her feet on the camera. However, she did even more than that. Not only does this arrogant brunette take half of your pay now, but you also agreed to be her slave and Denise knows that. \"Maybe there was a way to avoid all of this...\" you think, but it is too late now. You are screwed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how is my slave doing?\" Candice asked with obvious satisfaction on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl, how did you do that? You broke him so fast, it is fascinating. I wanted to do that by myself, but you did a great job sweetheart.\" Denise smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep rubbing, bitch!\" you can hear from above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel worthless with how these friends just ignore you and treat you like an object, but you can't really do anything. Candice sits on the chair in front of Denise's desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was really easy, I just explained to him that he already lost... and offered him a quick way down at out feet instead of trying to defy us. Let's be honest, we all know this had to end like this... and you Rob, will soon realise it too.\" Candice for the first time here actually looked at you. You notice that maybe there is less hate in her eyes than before. You hope that as long as you know your place she will go easier on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Candice, I called you here because I want to talk about this situation. You see, I want Rob to be my slave too. I hope we can come to an agreement here.\" Denise states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure we can both use him. We destroyed him together right?\" both girls giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now slave, get under the desk and worship your conqueror, or how you call her...Goddess Candice right? Also, since you are now my slave too you will call me the same,\"  Denise orders you, still laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Goddess Denise.\" It is all you can respond, completely defeated. You get down under the desk, and start kissing the receptionist's feet. This time she is not barefoot. She wears black pumps on her pale feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take off my shoes, worm,\" the bratty brunette demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Goddess Candice,\" you answer respectfully. You take off her heels and start kissing her soles. You realise, that of two evils, you prefer to serve the receptionist. Her feet are a little bit wet from sweat, but also very soft and delicate. After a while, you hear another order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now lick my feet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is a new low for you, but you are too afraid to defy her. You slowly stick out your tongue and hesitantly start to lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't disappoint me slave, show me more enthusiasm or you WILL regret it!\" Candice raises her voice on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith new motivation, you get down to work and start licking. First you move your tongue from the heel, all the way up to her toes. The taste is a little salty, but definitely bearable. You expected much worse actually. When you are done with the soles, you start licking in between the toes, where the taste is the most intense. The thing that really amaze you is that her feet are actually softer than your tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you are worshipping, you inspect every detail of her feet, They must be size 8 or something like that, you think.<br>\r\nYou are too absorbed on your job to hear what your owners are talking about. You don't want to make them angry, so it is better to just do your best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are absolutelly lost in time, but you must have worshipped Candice's feet for a while. Finally you can hear from above:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get up on your knees slave and listen, we have reached an agreement about you...\"</span></div></div>",

Since I am empty-handed, because you rejected my offer and Denise gets your money, you should compensate me for that. Therefore, you will give me 20 % of your old pay. Don't worry, the rest 30 % should be enough for you to make a living. Accept that...or good luck with looking for a new job.

You will  just have to lower your living standards a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Ma'am, I accept.\" You say, completely defeated and you go back to kissing her feet. In your worst nightmares you wouldn't suspect Jenny to be so savage. If only you had kissed her feet in the first place when you had the chance! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I forgive you, Rob. We are now even.\" The cute redhead smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Jenny\" Denise finally speaks. \"You really handled him well...I am proud of you girl. And you know what, I don't really need his money you can take the 50%.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, so I am now going to get 70% of his pay?\" Jenny's eyes widen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, why not? Denise chuckles. \"You have really earned it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, thank you so much Denise!\" The cute receptionist is euphoric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pleasure is all mine. believe me...and I have a surprise for you too, Rob.\" The senior manager approaches you. \"Mrs Jenny is your boss now. You will do everything she tells you too, let's say you will be her assistant. Now excuse me, I have work to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just can't believe what happened. These two women completely outmaneuvered you. You basically work for Jenny know, and you pay her 70% of your salary for that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny looks at you triumphantly, as you two are about to leave the office. Being demoted from manager to receptionist's subordinate is extremely humiliating, but at least Denise leaves you alone, right? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Since I am your superior now,<br>\r\nI expect complete obedience from you. Your first task is to make me a coffee...two teaspoons of coffee, some milk<br>\r\nand no sugar. Remember this, because I don't want to repeat myself.

You speed up to make it on time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive at the office kitchen, luckily it is empty so no one will bother you. While making a coffee you contemplate your <br>\r\nnear future. You wonder what Jenny has in store for you. How will the rest of the office react to your demotion? That redhead bitch - your former friend - is probably chattering about it right now. This public shame is definitely the worst thing to endure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn your way back you meet...oh crap...Candice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was looking for you, errand boy.\" The brunette smirks. \"Yes, I know everything, Denise told me that you are basically<br>\r\nJenny's bitch. I gotta say, this is interesting, totally didn't expect that. BUT... I AM NOT DONE WITH YOU YET! You owe me something too. I will let you go off now...don't make your new boss wait, but after the work...5 PM sharp...I want you at my desk, we need to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Candice, I will be there.\" You answer, trying to just brush her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I warn you, If you won't... I have a really photos from Denise, and I am not afraid to use them.\" Candice smirks at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn, that bitch Denise had to send the pictures to her. Looks like you will have to come talk to her...and this conversation<br>\r\nsure won't be easy. Also, if Candice knows you are Jenny's lackey, surely everyone in the office already knows that.<br>\r\nYou will think about that later, your boss is still waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here is your coffee, Ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are late! Exactly one minute late! What do you have to say for yourself? Mrs Jenny is clearly angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am so sorry! I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't even do such a simple task? I am disappointed...Good that you are no longer a manager. Maybe I should<br>\r\nconvince Denise to cut your pay even more, huh? What about another 10%, would you like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must be joking. This would make you bankrupt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Mrs Jenny, I will make it up to you...I am sorry.\" You whimper pathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an idea...you have one day to think of a good punishment for yourself. Amuse me, and I will forgive you...<br>\r\nDisappoint me, and you know what happens.\" How can Jenny be so cruel to you? She was your best friend at the office up until today! This is just mind-boggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I want you to rub my feet, since you are not capable of doing a more important job. This shouldn't be a problem for you.<br>\r\nAfter all, you begged me to let you kiss them earlier, remember?\" Jenny giggles. Denise really seems to have unleashed a ruthless streak in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to do that here? I mean someone can see me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't bother.\" she smiles \"Everyone knows already that you are my sla...i mean my subordinate. I know this must be humiliating for you, but you will have to get used to it. Maybe you will learn to like it, for your own good.\" She must be kidding, how the hell could you enjoy it?! \"Now stop talking, get on your knees and get to work, my feet are tired.\" She states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bow down on your hands and knees, and start taking off her shoes. The previous unpleasant aroma hits you again,<br>\r\nnow with even more force. For the first time you can see her bare feet in all glory. They are quite pretty, with bright red toenails. You grab her right foot and slowly start rubbing the sole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This feels really good.\" Jenny moans. \"I could get used to this...Oh wait...I actually will get used to this.\" She laughs at her own joke, \"Nevermind, just keep rubbing like a good boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kneel there beneath her desk, praying that no one will see you. You can feel in your hands, that she has a little dry skin on her heels.Even though Jenny treats you so badly, you don't hate her. You only blame Denise for ruining your career, and also you blame yourself for ruining friendship with Jenny. If you only had played it well, you would just kiss the redhead's feet and share the prize with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you are forced to rub her sweaty feet, and also you give her 70% of your paycheck. Life sucks for you.</span></div></div>",

The appartement is a mess...looks like <br>\r\nthis bitch is as lazy at home as she is in the office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to your new home, slave. As you can see, there are a lot of work to do here. I will go shower now...and you can <br>\r\nwash the dishes and make me a dinner. I want a roasted parmesan chicken and some tomatoes. It should be ready in 30 minutes.<br>\r\nDon't disappoint me slave.\" She orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Goddess.\" You answer rescpectfully as she leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a half hour later Candice returns dressed in a pink sleepwear and slippers. She sits on the couch as you serve her meal on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks good...slave, maybe you are not as useless as I thought. Now turn on the TV for me and lay on the ground beneath the table.\"<br>\r\nYou do as you are told...you lay on your back when Candice puts her feet right on your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now rub my feet, bitch...but keep them on your face I like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Goddess Candice.\" You reply and start rubbing her soft soles while her heels are pressed into your nose.  Luckily, she just showered <br>\r\nso her feet smell delectable, something like coconut. You gently knead the arches with your thumbs, then rub every toe and move to the other foot.<br>\r\nYou try not to think about how your life has been destroyed, you prefer to stay focused on a task. You are tired and hungry, but you don't dare to defy<br>\r\nCandice. Even though she is just a receptionist, she is too powerful for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a full hour or rubbing the brunette's feet, she finally says:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did pretty well, the meal was good and you didn't complain even once. Now I want you to go to your apartament, take your clothes and most important<br>\r\nbelongings and bring them here. Then I will rent it to someone and make some money...you can use MY car.\" she giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter emptying your old appartament you come back to Candice, you didn't take a lot... only clothes, some hygiene products and your laptop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put the clothes in the wardrobe, and the PC will be mine.Now do some cleaning.\" She states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please let me save my laptop i need him.\" You utter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!  Have you already forgotten who you are? How dare you to defy me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry, Goddess...I won't do that again.\" You say weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandice leaves the room and soon comes back with white socks and turns them inside-out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open your mouth!\" You obey her and she puts her socks in your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a punishment for disobeying me you will do the cleaning with my stinky running socks. Luckily i haven't wash them yet.<br>\r\nMaybe this will teach you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend next hour on cleaning, vacuuming the floors...the taste in your mouth is disgusting, but that's what you get for being stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is it slave, i am going to sleep. You will now remove the socks from your mouth and handwash them. Then you will clean my working heels...<br>\r\nuse baking soda and your toothbrush. After doing that you can sleep on the floor beneath my bed...with your face buried in my slippers. Is that clear slave?\" Candice asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod yes and get to work. You go to the bathroom and finally spit off these damned socks and handwash them in sink. Then you rush for her black heels. <br>\r\nYou put some soda on them and clean all the dirt and debris with your toothbrush. You notice that the smell from her shoesis pr etty bad. After you make sure <br>\r\nher heels are shining, you go shower. When you get back, Candice is already sleeping, so you just lay on the floor<br>\r\nand put your nose into her pink slippers. At least they smell nice, not like the shoes. Your first day as a slave is over. You are too tired to even <br>\r\nthink about all that humiliation you experienced today, so you just go straight to sleep.</span></div></div>",

You're gonna kiss my bare feet and admit that I'm better than you. Do it!\" She raises her voice, causing you to oblige almost immediately, despite how much you absolutely loathe your present situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning down so that your mouth is mere centimetres from the top of one of her dangling feet, you feel a nasty, bitter stench begin to envelop you. You hate feet and here you are - about to kiss not only the feet your worst enemy, but of the woman who has beaten and eclipsed you completely at work. With more reluctance than you can bear, you place your lips on her bare skin, feeling droplets of sweat swirl around your tongue.

You are lower than me, inferior to me - this is what you deserve after all those years of disrespecting me. You have no idea what it feels like to become a manager and get my revenge on you in the space of half an hour!\" She says with glee and triumph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to stay nothing, just place a couple more kisses on her foot, hoping that she will be satisfied and let you get the hell out of here, with what little pride you have left...</span></div></div>",

Looking up to me.  Now kiss my soles, bitch.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hated her so much at that moment but you had no choice.  You began slowly kissing her bare soles.  Her ivory feet were all over your face.  The foot that wasn't being kissed was playing with your cheeks, nose and hair.  You shuddered several times as the lowest part of her body was rubbed all over your face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kissed her feet over and over again.  It felt like forever but was probably only a few minutes before she turned up the abuse.

You tried to protest but she raised a finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obey or it will be worse.  Suck my toes.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were quivering with a combination of rage, disgust and fear.  How could she make you do this?  It was one thing to put your lips on her evil feet but another to actually have it enter your mouth!  You allow her to stuff her toes into your mouth and you begin to suck on the first few.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise pushed forward and squeezed in all five toes.  Her feet were small enough for your mouth to take though it was difficult to actually suck as your lips couldn't quite close around them.  But that was fine with her since she had a new game in mind.  She pushed her foot in further and further until her toes tickled the back of your throat.  You gagged and she laughed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah darn I guess I lose the bet with Candice.  I had bet her that you were secretly gay and would have no gag reflex.  Guess I was wrong!  That just makes it all the more pathetic that you haven't had a girlfriend for four years!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cringe with shame at her words.  You did like girls but you had made work a priority.   Boy was that a mistake considering how things turned out!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shoved her toes back down your throat and you gag some more.  Your hands come up to remove her foot but she snaps her finger in warning.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't even think about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou forced your hands back down to your sides as her toes gagged you again.  Her foot was rhythmically moving in and out of your mouth, literally fucking it.   Drool escaped the sides of your mouth as she face fucked you with her foot.  The back of your throat hurt and you had to focus on not heaving chunks as her foot continued to rape you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like that Rob?  Do you like how you're literally getting fucked by me?  I'm screwing you over figuratively and literally!  Yeah gag on my foot loser.  Gag on my perfect foot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears of shame and humiliation start rolling down your face.  This was the lowest point of your entire life.

And to think, you had been considered equals for so many years!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, that's better. Next time, you better show some damn respect and gratitude to me, or I will fire your ass. Now go!\" She shouted at you, looking at you as though you were a piece of dirt on her shoe. To be fair, after allowing her to humiliate you so utterly, you truly were inferior to your new boss. Shuffling meekly away, you didn't allow Denise to remonstrate you any further. As you reach the door, you leap up to your feet to exit the room, trying to adopt a casual expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very first person you see is - of all people - Candice...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice meeting huh?\" She smirks at you, her eyes quickly lighting up as they flickered over your face. \"It's about time Denise put you in her place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, whatever,\" you mutter, walking briskly pass her so you can just get your mind back to work: anything to take it away from the thought of Denise and her gross feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... I don't think so, Rob,\" she says in a tone full of such smugness that you stop dead in your tracks and turn around to meet her eye. \"From now on, you need to show me some respect. Otherwise, I'll be having a little chat with your favourite new boss...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sinking sensation spreads to your stomach. So the abuse and humiliation will not only come from Denise but by her best friend and fellow gossip queen. Such an unpleasant thought forces you to gulp, your eyes focusing away from the brown haired receptionist, who is pretty much sneering at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apologise to me quickly and I won't need to say anything,\" she states calmly at you, a triumphant look on her admittedly pretty face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow much more of this crap can you take? Realistically, it's better just to apologise and get it over with. But you're out in the open floor plan of the office now...what if someone sees? Plus, can you allow yourself to be bossed around by your other nemesis of the office?</span></div></div>",

Staring at them, with a mixture of disgust and hesitation swirling around your gut, you feel the stale, cheesy aroma waft towards your nostrils. Not wasting any more time, keen to get the ordeal over with, you begin to rub your fingers against the sole of her foot, feeling the damp sweat moisten your hands. One of the worst things about the experience is Candice's infuriatingly triumphant expression that she wears. This pretty much forces you to keep your eyes focused on the floor and on your target: her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so good to have you in your proper place, Rob. As my foot-rubbing bitch!\" She giggles, spreading her toes so that a  fresh assault of mustiness fills your nose. Ignoring her, hoping that she'll be satisfied soon, you continue to press your fingers against her soft skin. Having never given a foot massage before, you don't even know if you're doing it properly. Trying your best to cover as much of her skin as possible, you use your thumbs to start kneading away at the centre of her sole, which causes her to actually sigh in apparent approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow long does this go on for; will the malevolent Candice allow you to finally get back to work and leave you in peace?</span></div></div>",

Wait a second...she might help you out here, there\u2019s no way she\u2019d approve of Candice using you like this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh nothing Kim, Bobby here just offered to give me a foot rub instead of taking his lunch break.\u201d Her lie flows forth so easily, she must\u2019ve had that one saved up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that so?

She told me her shoes were bothering her and I thought it would be a nice thing to do.\u201d You mumble dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that is a nice thing. And great for office morale I\u2019d reckon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh it is Kim! I can already tell I\u2019ll be much more productive for the rest of the day. Especially not having to worry about my feet aching in these shoes.\u201d Candice replies smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, next time I\u2019m breaking in a new pair of heels I trust you\u2019ll offer me the same services Rob?\u201d Kim asks with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019d love to!\u201d Candice interjects. \u201cHe practically begged to rub mine, especially when he saw my new pedicure. I think he might be one of those foot guys, if you catch my drift.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bitch! But she\u2019s got your cornered, any attempt to talk your way out of this will just end up with you looking like an idiot and Denise getting pissed off at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s fine by me! Anytime you want to beg me to rub my feet I\u2019d be happy to oblige! Just don\u2019t go over your lunch break Rob.\u201d She adds before walking away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make eye contact with Candice, your eyes burning with hatred. You knew it was only a matter of time before Kim called in her foot rub and you\u2019d be stuck at yet another coworkers feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh don\u2019t look at me like that.

My dogs are barking!\u201d She says with a smile as she kicks off her heels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou assume a seated position in front of her, fully aware of how submissive this makes you look, and grab her left foot first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mind if I get some work done do you Rob?\u201d You open your mouth to reply, but what can you really say? \u201cPerfect! That\u2019ll help you focus on your task a little better!\u201d She says with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s not lost on you that you are basically being used the way she would one of those Homedics electric foot massagers, essentially pushing the start button and ignoring you. It does give you a chance to focus on what you\u2019re doing, your inner work ethic motivates you to actually do a good job so you try to pay attention to her little moans or when her body relaxes. Then you make sure to pay more attention to those areas.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter maybe ten minutes Kim\u2019s desk phone rings and she answers it. Not paying you any mind, she swaps her feet out in your lap and begins a conversation with whoever is on the other line. Eventually she hangs up and without saying a word to you, continues responding to emails or doing whatever task needed to be accomplished. Another ten minutes passes before your boss acknowledges you while you sit on the floor in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was very nice of you Rob. I would suggest you go home and watch a YouTube video or two on proper massage techniques if you desire to do this again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nerve of her...critiquing a free foot massage! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo on then, why don\u2019t you go to...\u201d</span></div></div>",

Like it was normal to rub all these feet at work! You take a deep breath outside Denise\u2019s door to calm yourself before knocking on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome in.\u201d Her voice calls from behind the door...the door that should\u2019ve been yours! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the door slightly and slide in, immediately dropping to your hands and knees as you close it and crawling across the open space and around the side of the desk. You wait pathetically next to your once rival, now conqueror while she works and ignores you. A full five minutes goes by, which from your subservient position feels like an hour before Denise acknowledges you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d She turns to face you, her black pumps filling your vision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKim wanted me to check in with you ma\u2019am.\u201d You reply meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that so? Well I could certainly use your help while I go over these reports.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally! You can actually do your job and escape this foot hell! If you really put your nose to the grindstone you know you could make Denise realize that you are too valuable a resource to be wasted on foot rubs and other humiliations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure! I\u2019d be happy to help you go over those!\u201d You reply eagerly. You are met with a loud burst of cackling from Denise. It takes her a full minute to wind down and when she does she has to wipe a tear from the corner of her eye. What was so funny? You wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou stupid bitch, you think I\u2019m going to let someone like you go over executive level reports?\u201d Her words hit you like a punch to the stomach. \u201cNo, no, no little Bobby. You\u2019re going to help me relax while I do my job, the same job I beat you for!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely crushed, you reach for Denise\u2019s heeled foot. Attempting to anticipate her needs and offering a foot rub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, not that. Under my desk, face up, head towards the bottom of my chair.\u201d She snaps her fingers twice to emphasize her point and you begin to position yourself. You cram your legs under her desk so just your head is sticking out and look up at Denise. She is staring down at you, a level of smugness present on her face that is so palpable it\u2019s almost transcendent. She wiggles her feet out of her heels and they hover above your face. What\u2019s more shocking is that this isn\u2019t shocking! You gave an inch and she\u2019s fully taken the mile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLick.\u201d Is the simple command. Torn between fear of Denise and your hatred of feet your hesitate but only briefly. The reality of your financial situation grips you and you extend your tongue, running it along the soles of her feet. You feel Denise shudder and gasp slightly above you, why shouldn\u2019t she? The feet are a well known erogenous zone, and she has reduced her biggest rival to worshipping them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fresh layer of sweat and grime has built up on them while your were tending to Candice and Kim, but you keep focused on your task. You run your tongue in long, flat strokes up and down her soles and eventually the smell and taste goes away. Talk about a silver lining amidst an incredible shitty situation! Above you, you can hear Denise eating her lunch and your stomach rumbles. You haven\u2019t eaten since this morning, oh well...just one more hardship to endure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn between the toes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe commands from above you, and you instantly obey. You use your tongue to poke through the space between her toes and feel her squirm above you. She seems to really be enjoying herself. Your tongue collects little pieces of debris from between her toes, but you simply swallow it, not having anywhere to spit it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn half of a day Denise has reduced you to literally eating her toe jam! You repeat the process on her other foot, wincing at the fresh assault on your taste buds. You find yourself licking with increased vigor, wanting to get them clean as soon as possible. You hoped Denise didn\u2019t mistake this for passion! After what feels like a lifetime, Denise pulls her feet away from your face and shifts forward in her chair to look down at you. You instinctively avert your eyes from hers, it feels odd to look at your dominator in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHope you get used to that, because that feels incredible! I bet that\u2019s the best you\u2019ve ever made a woman feel with your tongue! But I have something else planned for you now...\u201d</span></div></div>",

Don't worry, foot licker - you'll be in this same position many, many more times,\" Denise says with a gloating smirk. \"I've won, loser. There's two things you can do about it: nothing, and love it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of defeat spreading over you, you merely nod which makes her cheshire cat-like smile widen. \"You're my pet, my own personal little foot licker. Ha! To think you were actually my rival up until today...!\" She sniggers at the thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you're allowed to crawl out of her desk and out of her office, awkwardly getting up to your feet to open the door. You don't even get a moment respite; the moment you're out of there, Candice suddenly appears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, been paying your new boss Denise a visit?\" The brunette receptionist gives you a smug look. \"How did it go? Did you offer a foot massage like you promised me you'd give to Kim? You DID massage Kim's feet, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I did massage Kim's feet,\" you state thickly, wishing you didn't have to deal with Candice right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandice sighs impatiently. \"Well?

Kissing Denise's ass earlier was one thing but actually licking her bare feet...tasting and eating her toe jam...you truly have been put in your place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegarding you with amusement, Candice continues to shake with laughter. \"Wow, Denise and I have broken you pretty quickly, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even answering, you stare at the floor and hope that the bitchy receptionist leaves you alone.

Candice on the other hand has had enough fun at your expense.

I'm Denise's best friend, and she has you by the balls. If you think it's beneath you to lick my feet, think again. The fact is you're beneath me. Me and every person in this office who is on good terms with Denise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try not to look fazed as you gulp a little.

Fully prepared to leave this place forever and start over somewhere...anywhere else!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you make it to the door, you\u2019re spun around by Denise. You open your mouth to curse her but she stuns you with a right hook to the jaw that sends you crashing to the ground. You shake the stars out of your vision and look up at her, she\u2019s bouncing on the balls of her (freshly licked) feet in a legitimate looking boxing stance. She waves you up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go bitch. You think you can disobey me?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis fucking cunt, you think. I\u2019m going to put her in her place, then she\u2019ll be licking my feet! All logic goes out the window and you spring to your feet, still slightly dazed from the lunch. But you soldier on and dive towards her legs, fully intending on taking her to the ground and making her beg for mercy. Diana shoots her legs back and drops her full weight onto your back as you dive, driving you face first into the ground, dazing you again. Before you can react she spins behind you and pulls one of your hands behind your back. The other arm is pinned underneath your body weight and hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing both her hands she begins to wrench your arm up your back and towards your head, putting a tremendous amount of strain on your shoulder. You can feel small pops coming from inside the joint and you hope nothing is being permanently destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw ow ow stop please!\u201d You call out and Denise stops the ascent of your arm, but keeps it in its already compromised position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you going to do what I told you?\u201d She asks calmly above you. You hesitate and she wrenches the shoulder further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! I\u2019ll do it!\u201d You cry out and she eases the pressure a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo what? I want you to say it.\u201d You can hear the smile in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll sit down and let you fart in my face.\u201d You say as a tear rolls down your face. It was one thing to have her promoted over you, that wasn\u2019t your direct decision anyway. But she had just physically bested you, leaving absolutely no doubt who the superior being between you two is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood bitch. Now get in position.\u201d She releases you, you don\u2019t even consider a second round with her after how easily she dispatched you already. Instead you crawl to her executive chair and sit at its base, craning your neck back so the back of your head rests on the cushion with your face turned up. Denise fills your vision again, this time it\u2019s her backside. She lifts her skirt up and you have to marvel at how perfect her ass is. If only it wasn\u2019t about to release gas all over you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is going to be awesome!\u201d She remarks before sitting on your face. Her warm cheeks envelop your entire head, you again notice how firm her ass is. And now, as you are about you be as humiliated as you can be by another person, you really wish you\u2019d been nicer to Denise, maybe even tried to date her. That certainly had to have worked out better than this! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning Denise\u2019s ass erupts around you, her cheeks on either side of your head cause an echo effect and her fart reverberates for several seconds. Then the smell hits you, eggy and thick. You writhe underneath her but there\u2019s no escape. She has you completely pinned into the seat. Eventually the smell dissipates but the damage is done. Your biggest rival just farted in your nose, there\u2019s no coming back from this!</span></div></div>",

As disgusting as it would be, at least the worship would be over and done with at once as opposed to the months of gossip and slander you would face if you got caught.\"Okay Candice, I'll worship your feet if we go to the break room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandice's eyes beamed as a wicked smile grew on her face. \"Okay then Rob, lets go.\" She gets up and motions for you to follow her and you reluctantly comply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you enter the break room Candice closes the door behind you and locks it. This makes you step back. \"Wait, how can you lock a break room?\" Candice replies by pulling a key out of her cleavage. \"There's plenty of perks that come with having the janitor as a friend, like as many copies of a key as you like.\" With that, she stuffs the key back into her chest and saunters over to a chair and taking a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now come over here and take off my shoes.\" As you begin to walk over she stops you right there. \"Ah ah ah, crawl on your hands and knees, likes the bitch you are. Unless you want me to tell Denise that I saw you slacking off.\" You have no other choice at this point, so you get down on your knees and crawl over to her. You look up and see her smug grun looking back down at you. \"Well, are you going to take my shoes off or not?\" You grab her first shoe and begin to pull, them being high heels makes you job easy at least. After yanking off both shoes, you look up at what were about to be the instruments of your torture. At least she took care of her feet, they seemed fairly clean and she even had her nails painted light blue. Not that either of those improved your situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, before we get to the massage, I want you to kiss the tops of each of my feet and thank them for the privilege of letting you touch them, and I don't want small pecks either. They both have to be at least a second long and I wanna hear the smooch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is getting ridiculous. How much do you have to humiliate yourself before she's satisfied? You can't say no to her or she'll blow the whistle to Denise. You lean in and give the top of her right foot a kiss. \"Thank you for letting me touch you.\" Now the left. \"Thank you for letting me touch you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Candice was laughing at your expense the whole time. \"Good work bitch, now you may begin the massage.\" With that, you got to work. \"So bitch, how does it feel to know that this is what your life now?\" Still rubbing, you give her a confused look. \"Oh come on, you didn't really think me and Denise were just going to stop at a couple of massages and some worshipping right? We're going to be expecting multiple massages a day, with some worship when we feel like it. If you keep us happy we won't dock your pay, make us extra happy and we might go easy on you once or twice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe what you were hearing, your job and your very livelihood now rest in the hands of these two women that want nothing more than to torture you, and with their feet no less. You look down in shame for the next 10 minutes as you rub her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, much better.\" She lifts her feet in front of your face. \"Now then, a deal's a deal, now start _______.\"</span></div></div>",

Ever since I started working here, I have....\" Jim continues on his boring speech. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you wait in anticipation of the announcement, your eyes can't help but to wander the room and eventually they find Denise. She is staring at you with a sly smile on her face as she slowly kicks off her high heel, exposing her bare feet. She lifts her foot up so that you have a slight view of her sole and you cannot help but to stare with a look of horror on your face... She has you right where she wants you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... And that is why I have chosen to hire a new Senior Manager rather than to choose somebody internally. So I'd like you all to meet Kim, your new Senior Manager!\" Jim announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What??\" You say out loud, snapping out of your daze. You notice Denise has a look of superiority on her face now, but her surprise seems to be mixed with delight... She is clearly loving this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't believe you meant to shout out 'what' out loud, but you weren't exactly paying attention and now with your little outburst you have the attention of the entire room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm... I just said that Kim here will be our new Senior Manager\" Jim repeats to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is now that you notice a new face sitting next to Jim. She is a bit older, but certainly attractive. But that's not the point, the point is that this bitch has taken your Senior Management position... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jim, that was my position, you had been planning on giving me the Senior Management position for months! What the fuck are you doing giving it to this bitch???\" You say in an outburst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody in the room looks at you in shock... Denise no longer has a look of surprise on her face, now it is just a look of pure delight...As if she was watching your own self destruction. And let's face it, she may well be! And as for Kim, she has a look of utter disbelief as she watches you abuse the former Senior Manager and insult her simultaneously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rob, this isn't really the time to be discussing this, and I th-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-I don't care what you think anymore... Just... I just... You know, whatever, I am still Junior Manager, so whatever...\" You interrupt Jim, your anger getting the best of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up and walk out, unable to believe what has just happened. You walk briskly to your office and you slam the door shut. You sit down and take a deep breath. Ok, this is a pretty bad situation. You lost the Senior Management position to some middle aged red headed bimbo, you sweared at and abused that same bimbo, Denise is hell bent on making you kiss her feet and become her slave and on top of all of this, you abused the one man who could have possibly helped your situation a bit... The only plus side is you're still Junior Manager, you still out rank everybody in the office except for Kim... Right???<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts are interrupted by a knock on your office door....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And you can't help but feel like the two of you have probably got off on the wrong foot after this morning, so you want to already look like a hard worker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever it wasn't Kim who opened the door and came into your office, it was Denise. As she came in, she closed the door behind her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, excuse me, but can you please leave that door open?\" You ask of her, confused as to why she was closing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rob, given the circumstances, I think it would be a better idea to have the door closed. Or would you rather Kim saw you in here and came in to talk?\" She said, with a sly grin. The bitch had you there, you had no other option. You gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, whatever. What the hell do you want anyway, why are you here?\" You ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I wanted to make you an offer Rob, seeing as things are changing here in the office,\" she said with confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think things will be changing that much, I mean, I'm still ma-\" you begin, but Denise interrupts you... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"- still manager, yes, I know, but how long do you imagine that will last? You just called your new boss a bitch, and I was talking to her and she is actually a strong feminist. Not to mention, she told me I was 'management material'. So I think you should hear me out.\" You stare at her in silence, nothing more to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boy\" Denise continues. \"So, I think we both know that your downfall is inevitable after today, I mean, you practically sealed your own fate. I won't lie to you Rob, I loved every second of it\" Denise says smiling. You stare at her with anger but you can't say anything because you know she is right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But then I started thinking about our little confrontation in the car park this morning, and I realised something... I want you under my feet Rob. I want you under them permanently, kissing them, licking them, sucking my toes... It would be the most humiliating fate for you and you would finally be in your rightful place in this world. You would be mine forever!\" She says with an evil look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continues... \"So I've been thinking that after today you will lose, you are falling to the floor and you will have your face stepped on VERY soon, but from the looks of it, it may not be my feet that get to destroy you... It may not be me that gets to enslave you... It looks like this new manager Kim will get that pleasure all to herself\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally see where this is going... Denise wants to be the one who brings you down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Rob, the question is how would you like to be defeated... Slowly and painfully by Kim as she systematically fucks your career and has you begging at her feminist feet? Or would you like to end it now?\" Denise asks you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you predicted, Denise wants you for herself... She wants to be the one to put you in your place... But the crazy thing is, you're actually considering it. She is right, you're screwed after your outburst this morning... A long and drawn out defeat to a woman you just met would be extremely humiliating... But submitting to Denise? Really? It's there anything worse than that?? As you think about it, Denise removes her high heel for the third time today, revealing her bare foot. She lifts it up, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know this is your destiny... It has been ever since you met me. Your fate is to crawl under my foot and let me crush your face whilst you kiss it and accept defeat. So what are you waiting for Rob, get on your knees and crawl to my feet... Or do I have to make you??\"</span></div></div>",

What the??<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh Rob, I have been waiting for years for you to decide to use your physical male dominance to take me on... Just to see the look on your face when you discover that I am a black belt in karate\" Denise says with an evil smile. \"I'm sure you would enjoyed beating up a woman like a pathetic scum bag, but rest assured, the pleasure will be all mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a seconds notice, Denise tanks your arm to the left side of your body, causing your body to stumble as she spins to her left, away from you. Your confusion at her action vanishes as you suddenly see her bare foot flying through the air from behind her. She is about to kick you right in the face with what you can only assume is a spinning roundhouse kick or something. Whatever it is, because Denise yanked your arm and through your body off balance, you cannot dodge her attack. The sole of her bare foot connecting with your face is inevitable...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only have time to half turn your face away from her foot so that the impact doesn't hit you square on the nose, but your actions don't help the devastating impact of her foot connecting with your face. You drop to the floor hard, the world spinning around you as you discover why people say if you get hit hard enough, you see stars... You can feel the pain resisting through your face where Denise's foot hit you, but even worse is the dirty feeling that her foot was in your face... You feel like her foot grime, toe jam and foot sweat have been in contact with your face, and it makes you cringe in disgust and humiliation... But if you think that's bad, things are about to get much worse for you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour vision begins to clear and the stars start to fade, but as they do you wish that they hadn't... Denise's smug look of victory stares at you as she stands over your beaten body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh Rob, you pathetic piece of shit. I'm going to enjoy doing this\" she says, as she lifts her foot and hovers it above your face. \"Just like a bug, or a cigarette butt, it's time for me to put you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are forced to stare up at the sole of her milky bare foot... You see faint hints of sweat and dirt which seems to have accumulated from your confrontation, gathered up in between the subtle wrinkles of her sole, and an odor assaults your nose that you know isn't exactly a strong foot smell, but due to your passionate hate toward feet, seems somewhat amplified... This is hell, and if her foot comes down on your face, it is all over!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise begins to lower her foot, your fate crushing down to put you in your place... You don't have time to think, it's now or never...</span></div></div>",

Does it feel good to have my foot in your ugly face?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder with revulsion as her bare foot crushes your face and deposits her sweat onto it.  You weren't sure what was worse the horrible pain, the disgusting presence of her foot or the sheer humiliation of the situation.  You feel like vomiting, this was a fucking foot on your face!  And not just any food either the foot of your most hated rival.  You whimper a bit which causes her to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think this is bad Rob?  I haven't even gotten my feet really smelly yet.  This isn't anywhere near as bad as they can be.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe concept of her foot being even worse was nauseating but you soon stopped caring about that as she lifted her foot off of your face and than slammed it down hard.  The heel of her foot slammed right into your mouth and split your lip.  She didn't care about that thought as she proceeded to grind her foot painfully into your face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven then she wasn't satisfied.  She pushed up with her other foot and then balanced on your face like a ballerina.  While she wasn't fat by any means the fact that all of her weight was concentrated on your face made it very painful.  You let out another pathetic cry which causes her to laugh which then makes her wobble.  That causes her to slide off your face most painfully to you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid jerk you made me trip.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made you pay for it with a vicious stomp to your solar plexus that knocked the wind out of you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love how helpless you are right now.  I've wanted to do this to you for four years Rob.  You have no idea the amount of pent up anger I have for you.  But I think you're going to learn...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone had to come by soon... she couldn't just beat you up in the workplace!

Her assault is so rapid that you can\u2019t even spare a breath to beg for mercy, as if she had any for you! You\u2019d never been beaten like this, not even in a schoolboy fight or a drunken tussle at the bar. Amidst the chaos you hear an amazing sound, the click of the doorknob and the creak of the hinges as it swings inward. The assault instantly stops and you look up through tear streaked eyes to see your savior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s Helena! The attractive in her own way, hard working, probably illegal immigrant janitor who certainly wasn\u2019t fond of you. That didn\u2019t matter though, she had walked in on a serious crime! Not only was she your messiah, she was your witness and key to getting out of this! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh thank God!\u201d You wail and throw yourself towards her, landing on the carpet at her feet as she recoils from your battered and bloody visage. You reach a hand towards her calf \u201cPlease...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Denise what is going on here?\u201d Helena asks, clearly in shock about what she saw. You turn to look at Denise who actually looks slightly nervous. Perhaps she understood the optics, she could claim self defense but your clumsy attacks hadn\u2019t even grazed her, and you most likely needed to go to the hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis...bastard tried to assault me. He was in such a rage over the promotion situation that he lost it! Luckily I\u2019ve been training in martial arts for decades and he was no match for me!\u201d She finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut...it looked like you were just beating him. Like a perro...\u201d she trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was Helena, I wanted to teach him a lesson. To never try that shit again. I think he\u2019s learned it now, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d She practically spits at you. You cower away, attempting to put Helena in between you two. You look up at her, prepared to plead for her to save you from this hell but are dealt a crushing slap to the side of the head that knocks you to the ground and leaves your head aching almost instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPuta de madre! My ex husband used to be just like you.\u201d You can barely move, your body has been brutalized and you almost certainly have a concussion from Helena\u2019s powerful strike.

He threw a tantrum in my office and came after me so I put my skills to use on him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery impressive. Well...bitch, you heard her. Better get to begging!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me know if he\u2019s any trouble Kim. For now he\u2019s all yours.\u201d The call disconnects and you\u2019re left standing there dumbfounded. How did these women constantly outmaneuver you? Why did they always seem so hell bent on humiliating you? You would\u2019ve gladly played by Denise\u2019s rules just to get out of this spot, but now she had made it even more difficult for you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing no other option you walked around the side of Kim\u2019s desk and dropped to your knees. She smirked at your torn and untucked dress shirt, a souvenir from your beating. You had to admit, she was very attractive...maybe that\u2019s why she had gotten the job over you! Unwilling...and unable to look in her eyes, you stared at her ankle high, heeled boots and began your plea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease Kim, I know my behavior has been atrocious and I\u2019m really sorry for that. I\u2019d really appreciate the opportunity to move on from my mistakes here and start fresh somewhere else. I know you don\u2019t care for me so I would be out of your hair too. Pretty please Kim? Just let me go?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an agonizing wait on your knees while Kim twirled her foot in front of you. After what felt like forever she finally acknowledged you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShow me.\u201d Was all she responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d You were genuinely confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShow me how badly you want to leave here...without me calling Denise in here to handle you again.\u201d She raised her foot higher this time, twirling the suede boot practically at your eye level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderstanding what she wanted, and hating her for it...you shelve your pride (more in fear of Denise than anything) and lower your head to her boot. You place a firm kiss on the top of the suede and then pull your lips back, waiting for her approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have two you know.\u201d She says sternly. She refused to move her other boot from the carpeted floor, forcing you to completely prostrate yourself before her as you placed an even longer kiss on that boot. You decided a show of submission was best in this case and remained face down in the carpet at her feet while she contemplated your behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Or was she referring to you kissing her boots earlier? Either way you had to comply, so you gently slid the boots off her feet and studied her feet for a minute, you had a feeling you were going to become very familiar with them.

You place your lips on the tops of her warm feet, noticing the slight odor coming off of them and feeling the thin film of buildup from being inside her shoes. \u201cThis is the life.\u201d She says as she slides her other foot in front of your face and you greet that one with a kiss. \u201cUp now, time to re-introduce you to your former co-workers.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rise to your feet dejectedly, not looking forward to this fresh humiliation but following Kim out into the bullpen of cubicles where the all-female office spends their days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAttention everyone, I have an announcement to make!\u201d You stand with your head bowed in shame, like a child awaiting punishment as Denise exits her office with a curious look on her face.

He will now be the office gopher, anything that any of you require he will do immediately. Consider him the lowest member of our totem pole. If there are any issues with his behavior or willingness to comply with tasks, please let myself or Denise know. She is particularly adept at putting him in his place. He has also agreed to take a 75% pay cut as befits his new role, so if you have any odd jobs that need to be done on the weekends I suggest you take advantage.

However, little did you know that everything was about to change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had originally been working under a different manager. When you were hired, Jacinta already worked in the office. Unfortunately, the woman hired alongside you (Denise) hated you upon first sight, and you hated her too. You immediately made friends with Jacinta, to avoid Denise turning her against you too, since the she had already convinced Candice the receptionist and  Helena the janitor that you were the scum of the earth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Jacinta had developed a bit of a crush on you, and while you did not feel the same, you were still friendly with her. Jacinta and the other receptionist, Jenny, we're your only female friends in the office. Most people working there were men anyway. That was until your new manager came in a week ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim - she had been transferred from another branch of the company, and when she arrived, she had fired half of the office, and you were the only man that remained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim had hired several more people, all women, and you had befriended some of them, but you hadn't really got to know any of them. It didn't help that most of them were friends with Denise, but a few of them knew that she hated you, and we're a little sympathetic to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrived at work on Monday morning, and we're greeted by Jenny at the reception at her desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Rob!\" Jenny chirped, smiling at you sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Jenny.\" You smiled back at her. You didn't have a crush on her or anything, but you couldn't deny that she was rather cute, and had a nice smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made your way to your desk, where you ran into Kim. You internally rolled your eyes, as she looked up at you from the tablet in he hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Rob. I'd like to talk to you about some rearrangements I've made to the office.\" Kim told you, placing her tablet in her bag, and pushing her glasses up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" You ask her, trying to hide the annoyance in your voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The old office layout wasn't productive, so I've decided to rearrange where everyone's desk is.\" Kim explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, so who's sat near me?\" You ask her.</span></div></div>",

The friendly competition you two have with each other keeps you both super productive and I'm sure the proximity will stoke those fires even more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've gotta be kidding me! You think. You and Denise might hate each other but at least you got to stay a comfortable distance apart before. Now you'd have to see her all day long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay sounds good Kim. I'm sure it'll keep things more productive.\" You've got to count on Denise acting out and you appearing to be the more rational out of the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you see it that way. Remember, friendly competition is good for business. And what's good for business is good for your career.\" She winks at you and walks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friendly competition my ass.\" You mutter as you walk to find your new desk. You notice Denise first and then surmise your desk is the empty one to the right of it. It's hard not to notice Denise, personal feelings aside she is a knock out and you've rubbed one out fantasizing about grudge fucking her over her desk more than once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe notices you walking over and you see her eyes roll. Deciding against a friendly greeting you place your company issued laptop on the desk and sit down in your chair. You're shocked when the back of the chair breaks off and you topple backwards. Denise let's out an intentionally loud \"Ha!\" as you crash to the ground and several other people snicker as you scramble back to your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is this? Where's my old chair?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know Bobby, must've gotten lost in the shuffle during the move.\" Denise replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't call me Bobby. Hey! Isn't that my old chair!\" You point at the one Denise is sitting in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This one? No I'm certain it's not.\" You can tell by her tone that she's lying. She must've switched chairs before you got to the office. But you can't prove it and don't want to seem like a whiner to Kim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's your turn to roll your eyes and you turn to your desk. The chair is ruined, there's no way you'll be able to sit in it but you've got several reports that need to be done immediately. You decide to work standing up and power up your laptop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately you decided to break in some new shoes today and they are killing your feet after a few hours. You drop to both knees to give your feet a rest and continue typing away. After a few minutes Denise's voice enters your ears. \"Kneeling eh? That's a good spot for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ignore her remark and return your attention to your work. You are determined to turn this situation to your advantage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later \"Hey Bobby, how do you like my Jimmy Choo's? Bought them with last months bonus check. $1,000.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to look at them. You have to admit they look well crafted but that's about it. You never notice what a woman has on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well mine was twice that. Maybe because I don't spend my day making wise cracks and worrying about whatever you've got on your stinky, gross feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Bobby that's not nice. I've got nice feet. How about a foot massage? You're at the perfect height. Make it a good one and I'll let you keep giving them to me when I get promoted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely not. I'm not sure what you're confused about here but feet are absolutely disgusting. I wouldn't touch a super models feet, let alone your hooves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that you get up to go to the bathroom and get away from your rival for a few minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Denise will get the last laugh. Due to the sensitive nature of some of the clients your office deals with it is policy that you either close your laptop completely or lock it to the password screen to keep data secure. Denise's pestering caused you to lose focus and you forgot to do this. She wastes little time and quickly jumps behind your desk. She opens your e-mail application which is linked uniquely to your login credentials and begins typing away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise,<br>\r\nI know there's been tension between us for some time. But I think I know how we could alleviate it. Let's go out for a drink after work tonight and then head back to my place. I eat pussy like a lesbian and I can fuck for hours. I think once we get some of this aggression out of the way it'll be better for everyone.<br>\r\nRob<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise sends it to her own email account from yours and then leaves the sent message open on your desktop. Just as you leave the bathroom she sits back at her desk with a big smile on her face. You sit down and read with horror as you realize that you've made a potentially monumental mistake.</span></div></div>",

No one in the industry would hire you if they thought you were stupid enough to send an email like that! You decide to tackle to issue head on and appeal to Denise's sensibilities. You turn around and she is wearing an absolute Cheshire Cat smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting email you sent Bobby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Denise, I don't know what you have planned but you don't need to do this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you're talking about Bobby. As a matter of fact I'm having a hard time hearing you. Why don't you come closer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shuffle your feet around the side of her desk so you're standing right next to her. She swims your old computer desk so she is fully facing you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No that won't do. You're too tall for me to hear up there. Best if you kneel down like you were over at your desk.\" She smiles wickedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or I could just print this email and see who pulls it off the communal printer first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheckmate.

A few odd looks are cast in your direction as your office mates notice you kneeling in front of your biggest rival but you try not to pay attention to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want Denise?\" You figure being direct is your best approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I want is your obedience. We both know what I could do to you with this email. You'd be fired and ruined in the industry, I'd make sure it got as public as possible. But now that I've got this at my disposal, I'll settle for having you as a loyal servant. Someone to watch my back and be at my beck and call as I move up the ladder. The only promotions you'll be getting from now on are ones that I give you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kneel there in stunned silence. She was so evil! So conniving! But she was also so...RIGHT! With just a few clicks of a mouse she had placed you fully at her mercy. The promotion you were certain you'd get over her was a dream now. You were shaken out of your stupor by a jab from her heel to your knee. You glared up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But for now, I'll settle for a soy bean latte with a double shot of espresso. I'm going to start timing you, if you aren't back in ten minutes I bring this email to Kim and you're out of work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kneel there with your jaw open, the Starbucks was down five flights of stairs and across the lobby. You'd have to sprint the whole way and hope there wasn't a line. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clocks ticking.\" She said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump to your feet and begin sprinting across the office floor, narrowly missing several collisions with your coworkers. You barge down the stairs and across the lobby figuring you're making good time. You get to the Starbucks and notice there is one person  in line in front of you. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She'll probably be disappointed in you for failing to lock your workstation but you have an exemplary record at the company and you doubt she'd fire you for your first offense. Six months from now this will be a thing of the past. You don't even turn to look at Denise, instead you quickly lock your computer and walk straight to Kim's office. Just as you open the door Denise rushes in past you with a piece of paper in her hand. Your jaw drops as the door slams fractions of an inch from your nose and you hear the click of the lock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment you consider grabbing the door but realize that would just leave you looking foolish. Instead you straighten your tie, turn around, and walk back to your desk. You begin the process of returning to your work but you can't focus, the thought of what's being said in that office is killing you. And what is on that piece of paper? Surely she printed out the email to show Kim. You're done!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat feels like ten years was probably only ten minutes but your heart jumps into your throat when you see Kim's door open and your boss step out of it. \"Robert, my office.\" She says sternly.

Finally after what feels like an eternity she looks up at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm disappointed in you Robert. Things like this are why I replaced most of the males with female employees when I came on. We can't have so many people running around thinking with the wrong head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remain silent, taking your dressing down like a man while Denise practically radiates next to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is very serious, thankfully Denise hasn't pushed this to HR yet. She said she'd prefer to handle it in house. For that I'm grateful, I don't need my bosses asking why my employees think this is appropriate behavior. I think you owe her a word of thanks for that kindness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Kim...I know how bad this looks but I didn't send that email. I went to the bathroom and forgot to lock my computer. I've never done it before and I'll never do it again. But Denise sent that to herself to make me look bad!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh for fucks sake Robert! Listen to yourself! That sounds ridiculous! Who in their right mind would do something like that? You're digging a deeper hole for yourself here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand there in stunned silence. It did sound ridiculous when you actually verbalized it. No matter how true it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To think you were the front runner for the supervisor spot. You haven't left me with many options here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just don't fire me, look I can make this right!\" You don't like the begging tone in your voice but now is not the time for your ego to get in the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I'm going to fire you. I'm going to give you two options.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you Kim!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise giggles slightly at how pathetic you sound but Kim either didn't hear it or chose to ignore it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Denise is getting the supervisor spot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Denise exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But she's also going to continue working some clients, namely your highest grossing ones. You will keep a skeleton load of clients,  take a 20% pay cut, and work directly under Denise as her personal assistant. If after six months Denise feels like you have performed well and you deserve it, you'll regain your old position and pay but Denise will obviously still be your boss. If she gives you a negative review I will fire you personally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand in stunned silence. Denise isn't even bothering to hide the unbridled joy on her face anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Option two, you keep your same pay and client list but you will work an additional two hours after shift. You will report directly to Helena, our head custodian. If after three months she gives you a positive review you will cease your janitorial duties. Again, if she gives you a negative review you will be fired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind is spinning...either way you'll be reporting directly to someone who despises you and who will do everything they can to humiliate you.

You secure all your paperwork and laptop and take a deep breath. You're about to start a three month journey into hell but there's nothing you can do but face it head on and hope Helena takes pity on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk past Candice's desk she calls out to you \"Hey Bobby, make sure I can see my reflection in the surface of my desk tomorrow.

He says he got lost coming here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA silence as she listens to whatever Kim is saying on the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For sure Miss Kim, I'll keep him on a tight leash and make sure his properly humbles him. Have a good night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe presses the screen to end the call and then points the phone towards your grovelling form. Before you can react you realize she has already taken several pictures of you kneeling at her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you see who is in charge, si gringo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Helena.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, from now on you call me Senora Helena as a sign of respect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's another humiliation today? \"Yes Senora Helena\" you respond dejectedly. You attempt to rise from your knees but a firm hand from Helena keeps you in your submissive position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I like you better down there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolls her hand me down office chair over in front of you and sits down in it. One Croc-clad foot crossed over the other one dangling at about your nipple level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I think we will set a routine. I usually work a few hours later than you fancy pants in the offices do and then I get on the bus to go home. I work 12 hours a day, every day and it is hard. So you will make my life easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer strong accent clouds some of her words and you wonder if this woman is even in the country legally, let alone a high school graduate. But here she was, lecturing you while you knelt in front of her like an obedient dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To start, I think you will rub my feet at the start of your shift everyday. I am on them all day and I've never had a foot rub before. Mexican men are too macho for that, but not you bitch white boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she peels her the Croc on her top foot off using your shirt and wiggles her visibly sweaty foot in your face.</span></div></div>",

At this time yesterday you were driving home after another successful days work, day dreaming about your inevitable promotion. To most people at the office it felt more like a coronation, after all...you\u2019d been the top dog there for years. Now here you were, just 24 hours later. Kneeling on a basement floor with an uneducated Hispanic janitor wiggling her feet in your face. Remembering that this women held your entire future in her hands you took a deep breath and tried to find your happy place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to cackle as soon as you grabbed her foot and started kneading at her slightly slick soles. You\u2019d never given anyone a foot massage before so you just guess at it and whenever she seems to enjoy something, you do more of it. She lounges back with a huge smile plastered on her face and her eyes half closed. You can\u2019t help but notice that she is actually kindle attractive, in an \u201cevery woman\u201d type of way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome 20 minutes later, you\u2019re pulled away from your thoughts as she retracts the first foot and thrusts the other one into your hands. She didn\u2019t even bother to take her Croc off this time, deciding that\u2019s a task you\u2019re better suited to. Begrudgingly you pull the footwear off and place it on the ground. You begin working on her foot in the same way you did the previous one when suddenly she plops the already massaged foot down on your shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelena what the fu...\u201d she cuts you off with a few taps on the lips with the sole of her stinky foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShhhhh...gringo. Don\u2019t make me call Miss Kim.\u201d She purrs at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has you dead to rights and you know it so you just focus on the task at hand and try to block the smell of her foot right next to your face out of your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood gringo bitch.\u201d She says and strokes your cheek with her big toe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cheeks burn with shame and anger but you just keep massaging her calloused and ill maintained feet. After another twenty minutes she pulls that foot from your hands and rests it on your opposite shoulder. Your knees are really starting to ache now and you find yourself actually hoping she\u2019ll have you do some cleaning now so you can stretch your legs!</span></div></div>",

Put my Crocs back on and get to work.\u201d You quickly comply. \u201cI already got most of the floor done but I HATE cleaning the bathrooms. So that\u2019s what I have a gringo bitch for now.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore anger runs through you. Now you\u2019ve been demoted to toilet cleaner!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe mop bucket and cleaning supplies are in the closet in between the bathrooms. I\u2019ll be up in a few minutes to supervise your work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupervised...by a janitor! The indignity of it all! You quickly rise to your feet and turn to walk away when you suddenly come crashing back down to the floor. Helena tripped you! You wheel around on your knees prepared to say fuck it all and say what\u2019s on your mind. As you turn, she kicks you sharply in the face, sending you flying onto your back. In a flash she is standing over you, pinning you to the ground with her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said call me Senora Helena didn\u2019t I?\u201d She growls at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit! You had forgotten! Too stunned (and a little afraid) to say something back you merely nod your head and mumble \u201cYes, Senora Helena.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn right gringo bitch! Now get to work!\u201d She steps off you roughly and you drag all the necessary supplies to the elevator shaft.<br>\r\n\u201cNo no no gringo bitch, elevators are for masters...slaves use the stairs.\u201d She points down the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt shocks you that you don\u2019t even feel that angry at the trivial condition she set, you simply feel resigned to it. Another half hour later and you\u2019re in the women\u2019s bathroom of the office your formally ruled over. Realizing that you\u2019re getting close to your two hour window you rush through the job, having already finished the men\u2019s room. You can\u2019t believe the stains and trash all over the multiple stalls. But you sweep and mop the floors and use the brush to clean the inside of each toilet. Just as the clock signals your two hours are up Helena walks in through the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe does a brief walk through of the bathroom and then walks up to you, she grabs you roughly by the ear and begins pulling you around the bathroom by it where she points out the five things you missed. Eventually she stops berating you and releases your ear. You immediately begin rubbing the side of your head...she was strong! You suppose years of manual labor would do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow I have to sit here and watch you! Get moving stupid gringo!\u201d She punctuates that with a sharp slap to the back of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother slip further down the ladder, not only has she insulted you non stop and made you massage her feet, now she\u2019s physically abusing you! You shake off yet another blow to your ego and set upon your tasks with renewed vigor. There\u2019s a light at the end of the tunnel to this hellish day now. Twenty minutes (and way over your allotted two hours) later and you are done. The last task was to restock the toilet paper in two of the stalls. You turn towards your tormentor from your knees and notice that she\u2019s watching you intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSenora Helena...\u201d you mutter weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I see your done gringo bitch. Do I look dumb to you? I don\u2019t think so. You\u2019re done for today. Bring these supplies downstairs, I\u2019m taking the elevator, I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d She turns quickly and exits. You clumsily carry all the supplies down the many flights of stairs and see her waiting outside her \u201coffice\u201d with her purse and a lunch bag. She\u2019s staring a hole in you, and you start to worry. </span></div></div>",

She looks to be nearly orgasmic. \u201cDo all of them.\u201d She commands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one you take her toes into your mouth treating each one like a lollipop. They taste like dirt and sweat and all to often you collect something from in between her toes that\u2019s of a cheesy consistency.

Eventually she pulls her feet away and just says \u201cKneel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly scramble to your knees and don\u2019t even dare look her in her face.

She's actually impressed by the time you're through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Si! You're natural cleaner! Your hands for cleaning the office, your tongue for cleaning my feet!\" She cackles while you keep your eyes on the ground. Realising you're at Candice's desk, you remember the receptionist teasing you about how clean she wanted her desk to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Helena dismisses you, not before forcing you to kiss the tops of her feet before departing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you have to say?\" She says down ominously at you. \"Don't I get a thank you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning internally and hating the fact that you have to go along with this, you suck it up. \"Th-thank you, Senora Helena for letting me lick your feet.

Knowing how easily she overpowered you yesterday, do you get it over with and lick her feet clean - like she instructed you - or do you decide to put her back in her place. She is only a janitor after all...!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, you're generally afraid of this formidable woman. Slowly making your way toward her, she doesn't even notice you until you kneel down in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bitch!\" She cries out, taking out her headphones and looking down at you. Smirking at the sight of you kneeling before her, she wiggles her toes. \"You know what to do, gringo...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even speaking, you place your outstretched tongue on the hard, flaky skin of her heel and lift it upwards, immediately wincing at the sour, bitter taste of her bare sole. You've never been remotely into feet and this confirms your thoughts: feet are gross! Helena sighs contentedly as you dutifully lick up and down her sole, feeling worthless and pathetic for doing so. What else can you do though? The Latina has overawed you; the idea of disobeying her seems virtually impossible with every lick of her foot. Plus, one step out of line and she will make a phone call to Kim - and that would be your career over with!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know your place, huh? Your place is at my feet, right gringo?\" She sneers down at you, tapping her sweaty toes against your forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Si...Senora Helena,\" you tell her meekly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your tongue is made for licking my feet and for saying 'Si Senora Helena', correct?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Si, Senora Helena.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckles. \"Good bitch. When my feet are fresh and clean, then you can go and clean the office...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a good twenty minutes to lick the Latina's nasty, grimy bare sole. Your tongue feels like it's full of dirt, cheese and other foulness. As she places her feet down, you slide your tongue around to get rid of the horrible flavour. Fetching the cleaning utensils while she continues to relax is maddening, but you have to accept it. While gathering up the broom, mop, bucket and various sprays, you see the silhouette of someone standing at the top of the steps...crap! They must have seen you licking Helena's feet!

It was the advice you were hoping not to hear but you know deep down is the most realistic. \"You're right...\" You sigh.

I've helped you out this time but tomorrow you're on your own. I don't wanna be dragged into this and risk my career too!\" It's a fair point, so you thank Jenny again and say your goodbyes before you check the time. You're actually slightly early - deciding that this will please Helena, you head back down to the basement and see her in the same position as before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gringo! You're done? And there's time to spare...? Let me see...\" She gives you a suspicious look as she hops to her feet and storms past you, inspecting the office for herself. Several minutes later, she gives you an approving look. \"Good job - for a white boy bitch anyway. As you finish early, you can lick my feet for a little longer...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying not to show her how dejected you are by this turn of events, you merely nod and utter 'Si, Senora Helena,' before following her to Kim's office - of all places. The Latina plops her bare feet on Kim's sparking clean desk, pointing at her feet, as if you needed any more instructions. Closing your eyes and hoping to get the ordeal over with, you do what you've become accustomed to when around the janitor: lick her feet. This time, they're a little softer and nowhere near as dirty. So the experience is still gross, but a lot less disgusting than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am the boss!\" Helena chuckles, looking through some of the things in Kim's desk and tapping her toes appreciatively. \"Well, I'm your boss, right bitch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Si...Senora....Helena,\" You mumble in between mouthfuls of feet. Another quarter of an hour later, and Helena is satisfied. Allowing you to go home, you try but fail to get rid of the taste of her stinky feet from your mouth. Making a mental note of bringing some chewing gum and mouthwash to work, you head home and pretty much as before, collapse into bed and fall asleep within moments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day at work is a little trickier than the previous one. Denise has let slip to pretty much everyone that you've had to get an extra job after hours as the janitor's assistant. Rumours begin circling that you're funding a drug habit, or have an illegitimate child that you're having to pay support for. Jenny tries futilely to defend you, but it doesn't help much. Denise, your nemesis, is insufferably smug and gleeful when people make comments about your cleaning, like 'Missed a spot, Rob!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim summons you into her office, looking rather displeased with you. \"Rob, there's something we need to talk about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does the boss want with you?</span></div></div>",

Well, that's a u-turn from yesterday. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealising that she wouldn't believe the truth about Helena - that she forced you to lick her feet clean, slapped you and kicked you in the face - you decide that you take a different tact. \"Well, cleaning the office and working under Helena taught me some humility. I realise that my email was...wrong. It was out of order.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on,\" you boss replies, observing you shrewdly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, er, I want to make it up to Denise.

I'm sorry, Robert, but you made your choice and that's what you will need to fulfil for the next three months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling desperate, you decide to go all out and throw yourself at her mercy. \"Please, Kim, please! I really want to be Denise's assistant - please just let me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expression is hard to read. The corners of her mouth twitch as she stands up from behind her desk and walks up to you, her arms folded. \"I didn't know you had it in you - to beg and plead like that. But you know...\" She taps her chin thoughtfully. \"It's not me who you should be begging. Tell you what, if you beg Denise to take you and she accepts then fine - you can be her assistant. BUT, you also need to apologise to Helena - she was expecting your help for three entire months! So, I think another 10% of your pay should be cut to compensate for her troubles. Sound fair to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel numb. 30% salary down for 6 months, and that's if Denise agrees to you being her assistant! Knowing that you don't have a choice, you nod weakly, while Kim makes a couple of calls. A minute later, Denise arrives, looking smug. Moments later, Helena comes in, looking triumphant as she gives you a gleeful smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies, thank you for coming in. Now, Helena first I'd like to thank you. However you had Robert working yesterday, it's certainly worked wonders! He seems to genuinely have learned a lesson in humility - the different is startling!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Si, Miss Kim,\" Helena says affirmatively, her arms folded and nodding. \"I will make sure he knows respect in the three months that he helps me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's the thing... there will be a change in plan,\" Kim tells her, causing the janitor to look confused. So does Denise as your boss turns to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Denise, thank you again for alerting me to Robert's disgusting email, and for coming in today. He has something to say to you...\" Your redhead boss turns to you and nods, signalling your cue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow mortifying is it to actually <i>beg</i> your nemesis - the woman who has screwed you over and put you in this terrible position?! Yet, it's preferable to being Helena's bitch for another three months...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Denise, I am so sorry for what I did. It was wrong - I see that now. Yesterday when I was given the choice, I went for Helena because I still felt hostile towards you about the situation, but I was wrong. I should have chosen to be your assistant. Please, please give me the chance to work under you and prove that I'm not a jerk-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You can't just change now!\" Helena shouts angrily at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Helena,\" Kim says soothingly. \"There's more to come. Robert, I think it would be better if you got on your knees to address Denise - if you are truly sorry you'll do it, and I'm sure it will help Denise to accept it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that it's a necessary evil, you grimace as you get on your knees and stare up at Denise.

She turns to you. \"Robert, the only way of settling this amicably is if we negotiate.

I can't believe you office guys can put up with this crap! I'm doing all these module thingies...such a waste of time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin, remembering how you were similarly frustrated when you started at the office. \"It'll get better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or, you could do my work for me? I mean, I could let you take me out for a drink if you do...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken aback, it takes you a couple of seconds to respond. \"Oh, er, thanks but...maybe another time.\" Tempting as it is to take this beautiful brunette for a drink, you decide you have enough on your plate as it is!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new girl shrugs. \"Suit yourself...I'll find some other schmuck to do it for me. Maybe I'll even let him fuck me tonight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpressed and a little shocked by her gall, you say goodbye before moving swiftly on. Michelle is certainly sexy and gorgeous but she's a distraction you can do without. The most grateful for the coffee order is Jacinta, the blonde who apparently has a crush on you. Jenny has gossiped with you over some of the things she's said, how the blonde basically wants to ravish you.

Jacinta looks a little disappointed, but again, you can't afford distractions! After taking Kim's order, to which she seems pleased about, you have over ten names on your pad. This is gonna be expensive! Just before heading out to the Starbucks down at the lobby, you remember Helena.

I want you to get down on your knees and kiss my feet like the loser you are,\" she says with a sneer, clearly enjoying the fact that you referred to her has 'Senora Helena' again. \"Kiss my feet, then you can fetch me a coffee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour knees wobble for a moment but you find a small amount of pride left in you. \"Senora Helena,\" you say through gritted teeth. \"I don't work for you any more. I do respect you though,\" you add quickly as a look of fury appears on her hard yet pretty face. \"That's why I'm offering to get you a coffee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stares at you, her bright eyes burning through you so much that you find your gaze shifts downwards, at her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My feet are sore, gringo. I've been working for two hours already - since before you even got here. Get down on your knees and kiss my feet. Actually, no...I want you to lick the bottoms of them again. Si...that's what I want you to do, bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel your nerve shaking...is it wise to refuse this Hispanic thirty something? The way that you degraded yourself in front of her yesterday has left an indelible mark on you...some sort of reverence that makes you feel somehow inferior to her, even though she's beneath you, financially and socially speaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting tired waiting, white boy. Get down on your knees and lick my feet already. I'm not gonna ask you again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you surrender yourself to Helena or cling on to the pride you have left and get out of there? You're not her assistant anymore after all...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's a mixture of fear and genuine inferiority that makes you sink weakly to your knees. Helena's expression morphs from one of anger to pure pleasure as you humbly bow down so that you can place your tongue on the bottoms of one bare foot, starting at the heel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boy,\" she purrs. \"You know where your place is - at the bottom of my feet! It doesn't matter who you work for, does it? Miss Kim, Miss Denise...whoever your boss is, I'M your real boss. Aren't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...Si...Senora...Helena...\" You murmur while sliding your tongue slowly up the janitor's bare sole, grimacing as you absorb the familiar taste of her cheddary, sour feet. Part of you can't believe you're doing this - the whole point of being Denise's assistant was to avoid situations like this ever again! Yet here you are, licking Helena's feet like a dog, while she makes fun of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You white boys are all the same. Mexican men - they're too macho, too tough to do this. Every white guy - he knows his place. White men I've been with - they're like putty in my hands. I usually get bored of them....but not you. I don't think I could EVER get bored of this!\" She cackles, tapping her toes against your forehead, while you lick up and down her sole, absorbing all of the grime, sweat and dirt from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, my daughter - she's now eighteen - her father is a white boy. Not that sees him - bastard fucked off years ago. She'll be happy that I'm taking fifteen percent of your earnings. AND I can still make you lick my feet! You are such a loser, gringo!\" Helena is attractive, there's no doubt about that. The fact that she has a daughter actually makes you feel a pang of sympathy towards her; it can't be easy being a single mother on a janitor's wage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My daughter, she gonna have a good life. She won't need losers like you licking her feet. No, she gonna go to college, so that fifteen percent of your wages, that gonna help, si.\" She leans back slightly on her chair, forcing you to arch forwards with your neck so that you wince a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter licking one of her feet thoroughly, she clicks at the other so you can do the same. Dutifully, you service her other sole, getting so used to the flavour that it doesn't seem like such an ordeal. In fact, maybe it's your imagination but Helena's soles seem softer and less calloused than yesterday. The Latina janitor seems to be thinking the same thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My feet feel so good...so refreshed! You're a pro, foot licker! Si, this feels so goooood!\" She sighs, almost orgasmically. \"Let's make a deal...I tell no one in the office that you've come down here to lick my feet, and you agree to do it every day. Same time every day, while I'm having my break. Twenty minutes a day. You got that, gringo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod weakly, knowing you can't deny her. Helena has done a number on you - even though you're technically Denise's assistant, you're going to be spending twenty minutes a day licking the bare feet of the janitor who clearly despises you. What a win-win situation for Helena...taking a cut of your pay AND the sensation of having you lick her feet every day - the latter obviously separate to Kim's arrangement!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, now you can get me coffee. Double espresso. Now get out before you piss anyone else off!\" She pushes her feet forward, knocking you back so you lose your balance and fall flat on your back. Helena chuckles at this, shaking her head at what a loser you are before getting some cleaning equipment to resume her duties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling humbled and disgusted with yourself,  you keep your head down as you quickly depart, knowing also now that you're way behind schedule. It takes a good fifteen minutes to queue, order then wait for the coffee to be made - fifteen orders in total! One of the girls from Starbucks, a cute girl with short, pink hair, kindly offers to help you up with a coffee. Between the two of you, you just about manage to carry the drinks up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst of all, you rush to Denise...she's your priority after all. Will she be pissed with how long you've taken for your first job as her assistant?</span></div></div>",

Maybe I should just tell Kim now that you're a hopeless case and should be fired now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...no, please Denise!\" You gulp, feeling panic swirl inside you. \"It-it's a one-off. Just give me a chance to make it up to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe considers you. \"We'll see. First of all, drop off these coffees - the other women must be annoyed with you too. Now get out of my sight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou murmur a quiet 'yes Denise' to yourself. Not impressed with this, Denise stops you and smirks. \"No, no, no. From now on, you'll address me properly. 'Yes boss' is what you'll say to me - that's the least you can do for being a useless assistant! You got that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, boss,\" you say quietly, hating the fact that Denise has free reign to say and do anything she wants as your superior. Had this been a day ago, it would be unthinkable to imagine you calling Denise 'boss'! She knows it to, as she continues to smirk before allowing you to scurry away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reactions you get from the other women are mixed. Candice is delighted, partly because you are delivering her coffee and also as she had no idea how long it took you. She fixes you with a grin before inspecting the frappaccino. Making you wait an age until she smells it, tastes a bit, checks the contents thoroughly before leaning back on her chair, sipping with satisfaction, then dismissing you. Your friend, Jenny, is concerned why it took you so long, and is shocked by how much coffee you are delivering, but you don't have time to chat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim barely acknowledges you as you place her coffee on a coaster, while she talks on the phone. On the other hand, Jacinta practically licks her lips as you hand her the coffee, her fingers brushing against yours as she receives it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, Rob.... I could get used to this...!\" She winks and chews her lips as she stares at you. Hurrying away, you don't even stop to talk to Michelle, the gorgeous new girl, who seems disappointed that she doesn't have the opportunity to flirt with you. After doing all of the other rounds, with reactions ranging from annoyance that you took so long to gratitude that you made them a coffee, you are left with one. Helena's double espresso, which is now cold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading down to the basement, you feel relieved to see she's not there. Leaving the coffee on a makeshift table, you quickly depart, pleased at last to have some good luck. You can now prove to Denise that you're going to do a good job as her assistant and earn your job back...eventually!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you make your way back upstairs, you see Helena in the corner of your eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...where's my coffee?\" She calls over to you, unabashed that she's causing a few coworkers to look over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's down in your...room,\" you reply, not sure of what else you can all the basement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring it up here,\" she orders you, hands on hips and giving you an expectant look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling your cheeks redden, you ignore the sniggers from your colleagues as you head back down to get Helena her double espresso. When you hand it to her she pulls a face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is this? It's cold!\" She tsks at you after spitting out the coffee on the floor. \"Get me another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't believe she is speaking to you in front of other colleagues like this! Clenching your teeth, you walk towards her so that your conversation is more private. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Senora Helena,\" you whisper. \"Please don't make me...I have to get back to Denise...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Double espresso. Now!\" She gives you a firm, resolute look. Clearly not going back down, you think about who it's better to keep in the good graces of - Helena or Denise...</span></div></div>",

Ignoring the sniggers from other coworkers, you head back down to the Starbucks and do as you're bid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena is simply too formidable, too strong to refuse. Every act of submission to her makes you feel more and more inferior that the idea of refusing her becomes increasingly unlikely. She smirks as you dutifully bring up her double espresso, still waiting in the same spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring it back down to my office, gringo,\" she tells you with authority, strolling away while you follow her meekly. Again 'office' is an overstatement for a basement with some boxes and cleaning equipment. Once again, you kneel before your conqueror, holding out her coffee to her as though she's a queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am your boss,\" she states down to you, a satisfied expression on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Si, Senora Helena...I am your bitch,\" you say humbly, as she takes the coffee off you and finishes it in one gulp, smacking her lips appreciatively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will lick my feet again, then you will beg Miss Denise to forgive you for being such a late, gringo bitch!\" She chuckles as she kicks off her crocs, resting them on a box in front of you. \"Lick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp as you stick your tongue out and begin to race it along the Latina's cheddary-flavoured soles, a taste that's becoming all too familiar for you. As you lap up and down, like a puppy dog you realise that Helena has broken you. The fact that you are not even thinking of putting up a fight means that she truly owns you. You've never been attracted by feet but there is something strangely comforting and alluring in serving this Latina woman. She is hot, despite her social standing and aggressiveness. Maybe in the past you teased her because you actually had lustful feelings for her. While you continue to lick up and down, you feel your pants begin to tighten a little, causing a small whimper of defeat to escape your lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Helena is too occupied on the phone to notice this. \"Hahaha, si! This gringo is now my bitch! He's licking my feet clean - again! He's such a loser that he's too scared to say no! He knows that I own his ass!\" She says, chuckling to whoever she's talking to. \"Yeah, no problem!\" She puts her phone on speaker and holds it over to you. \"Hey gringo, tell my daughter, Gabriella, that you're my bitch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...your mother's...bitch, Gabriella,\" you say weakly, finding that the humiliation makes your pants tighten even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh my God! You are such a loser! Licking my Mom's feet and admitting that you're her bitch!\" </i> Giggles Helena's teenage daughter down the phone to you. \"Say it again, say it again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm your Mom's bitch, Gabriella...\" You whimper, blushing with the sounds of raucous laughter from both the janitor and her eighteen year old daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena looks down at you with disdain, still with her daughter on speaker. \"You foot licking gringo bitch! You don't talk to her no more. You are a piece of dirt compared to my Gabriella. She's going to college, gonna get a good education and get a good job to make me proud, aren't you baby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yes, Mom,\"</i> says the teenager respectfully. The women says their goodbyes and Helena puts the phone down, staring at you with a mixture of contempt and triumph. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" she says kicking you away so you fall flat on your back. Quickly you roll to your side to disguise the slight boner you have. \"Now, you can crawl back to Miss Denise and apologise for being late like the bitch you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do so, thanking her and scurrying away. As you race towards Denise's workstation, your heart sinks when you see Kim is standing there next to your nemesis, now boss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Rob, what do you have to say for yourself?\" Kim says, raising her eyebrows while Denise continues to stand next to her and smirk...</span></div></div>",

Honestly, I thought that you had learned a lesson in humility and wanted to prove that you <i>do</i> respect women. Obviously, you've been taking us for a ride.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no!\" You blurt out, desperate to avoid where the conversation is heading. \"I'll be better, I won't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more excuses, Robert,\" Kim tells you sternly, silencing you. \"Denise, what was it you told me earlier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise's eyes sparkle as she tries to suppress a smirk. \"He took an hour to get coffee. A <i>whole</i> hour...\" She gives you a challenging look, as if daring you to retort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot having the nerve to argue with her, and knowing that even if you did it would only confirm Kim's assumptions that you're disrespectful, you stay silent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim clears her throat. \"Robert, consider this your FINAL warning. If you so put a foot wrong, displease Denise for even a moment...then you're out of here. Not only will you be fired, but I'll make sure that you get a lousy reference and ensure that no self-respecting company gets to see your CV. From now on, you basically need to be Denise's willing slave...no more of this wasting time and playing your little games. Now go and do some work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep your head hung in disgrace while Kim storms away. Denise looks practically gleeful as she giggles softly. \"My <i>willing slave</i>...that's right Rob, from now on that's what I'll call you - my <i>slave</i>! So, you really need to get in my good books - one bad word from me and you're fired! Being that Mexican's cleaning assistant is gonna seem like a luxury holiday compared to what I'm gonna do with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, boss,\" you mumble, knowing that you are completely at her mercy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was gonna draw up a timetable, have a whole load of jobs for you to do - filing, shredding, tax forms...but I think that's way too above your station. No, I've got a better idea. In fact, I'll give you a choice: you can get down on your knees and rub my feet while I work, or you can make everyone a coffee again - but this time in no more than fifteen minutes!\" You look up to meet her bright stare, her eyes brimming with confidence. Clearly, holding power over you has made Denise even more insufferable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you answer, you remember that fetching coffee would mean you encountering Helena again...then again, actually rubbing Denise's feet would be mortifying and certainly something you'd never imagine lowering yourself to do...</span></div></div>",

After a good fifteen minutes of being their human footrest, Candice mercifully slides her feet away, relieving the pressure on you by a considerable degree at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks foot bitch!\" Candice ducks her head under the desk to smirk at you. \"I'll look forward to resting my feet on you during my next break!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, you consider retorting but you quickly remember your new position at work - literally under Denise's feet! So you stay silent and grunt, which makes Denise dig her heels sharply into your lower back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slave! That's not how you address your superior! Thank Candice for resting her feet on you!\" Denise chides you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlowering but knowing you have no choice, you do so. \"Thank you...Candice. Thank you for resting your...feet on me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome,\" she says in her bratty voice. \"Anytime!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day passes more quickly, you mostly swap between rubbing Denise's bare feet to having them rest on you. It's broken up with you fetching coffee - which you do without seeing Helena. By the end of the day, Denise has only positive words to say about you in front of Kim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's really stepped up. Honestly - he's done everything I've told him,\" Denise smiles at the boss while you stand in front of them both, avoiding eye contact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad to hear that, Robert. Now, keep that up and in half a year's time you'll be back to your normal job, with full pay restored. The next six months will fly by I'm sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding meekly, you mumble a thanks as Kim bids you both farewell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, slave. I'm heading off now too. You can clean my desk - I want it as gleaming new as you made it yesterday! Don't worry, I'm sure Helena won't mind lending you some cleaning stuff. Now, when I get in tomorrow I expect my soya bean latte with a double shot of espresso, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, boss,\" you reply humbly, feeling more and more beneath this woman who was genuinely once a rival to you. It's maddening to see her talk down to you and slink away, knowing you're basically her slave. An uneasy feeling hits you in the pit of your stomach...Helena...you need to go to the basement to get the cleaning materials!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, maybe you can get away with not using the wood polish and just use some tissue from the bathroom....Denise may not be able to tell the difference!

Get down on your knees...you know your place, bitch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart fluttering both out of excitement and fear, you'd almost forgotten that you started to feel a little turned on, the last time you were licking Helena's feet. Trying to shake that thought away, you do as you're told and immediately feel a slight twitch in your cock as you kneel before you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe considers you for a moment before shrugging and smirking as you start licking the bottoms of her feet. As you drag your tongue carefully along her damp soles, you have to wonder why you allow yourself to keep doing this. You're not at her mercy like you were when she could call Kim and have you fired for one step out of line...surely it's curious how you keep licking this Latina's feet when you don't <i>actually have to...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, you start grudgingly admitting to yourself that Helena's feet are not as rough, not as calloused nor as stinky as before. In fact, they are fairly soft and smooth on your tongue, and nowhere near as dirty or sour-tasting as before. Could it be, could it be that you're actually <i>enjoying</i> licking Helena's feet?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were rubbing Denise's feet, you had to admit that they were pretty and nicely well-cared for. Objectively speaking, they were better than Helena's. However, you've become used to the taste of Helena's bare feet...it's only taken handful of hours and minutes but you can't help but realise that you <i>like</i> this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"White boys are better as foot lickers than lovers!\" Helena states matter-of-factly. \"My daughter - Gabriella - her Dad was a white boy. Fucking useless lover! Shoulda made him my foot boy like I've made you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Si, Senora Helena,\" you murmur, in between slow, increasingly-eager licks to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gabriella, she gonna meet a nice Mexican boy. She don't need no white boy. She clever and smart - she gonna get a good career.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Si, Senora Helena,\" you reply. It's becoming increasingly clear that Helena thinks the world of her daughter and does this job to provide for her. She also obviously harbours a grudge against white guys in general for being left and forced to become a single parent by one. She continues chatting, more at you than with you, explaining how she didn't want any dates or meet anyone else after Gabriella's father left her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gabriella, she my world. She gonna make me so proud,\" Helena tells you, smirking for a moment. \"Maybe I should bring her here, so she can see stupid white boy licking my feet. What do you say, gringo? You wanna meet my daughter, Gabriella?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can answer, she pinches your nose between two toes and shoves her toes in your mouth. \"I don't need your opinion, bitch!\" She grins at you, enjoying toying with you as she shoves her toes in a little further, causing you to gag. \"I've decided...\"</span></div></div>",

Two minutes go by and her foot steps are slapping down the stairs and you catch a sight of her. She is STUNNINNG. She reminds you of a young Jennifer Lopez. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my God!

She uses your forehead to pry her flip flop off and plants her foot in the middle of your face. You immediately go to town, pleased to have a nice smelling and fairly well maintained foot to worship. Gabrielle shudders as she feels your tongue hit her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit Mom! This feels incredible!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSi, mija.

Perhaps the ability to enchant you with bare feet runs in the family, as you find yourself enjoying yourself more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But you hate feet...!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrection - you <i>did</i> hate feet. Not anymore! Certainly not Helena's or Gabriella's! The eighteen year old Latina's soles are simply divine; you can't deny that you enjoy this more than licking pussy or, hell, getting laid! Helena's daughter spreads her toes and giggles at you while you lap your tongue adoringly along her flawless arches and gloriously soft soles. Helena's feet caused a spark of arousal in you, since then that has built to a lust for her feet. It's fair to say that Gabriella's have sent you over the edge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Mom....I could totally get used to this!\" Gabriella sighs, pushing her long black hair behind her and grinning at her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou barely even notice that Helena is observing you carefully, screwing her face up as she begins to slowly shake her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on, mija...move your feet back for a moment...\" The Hispanic janitor says. The moment the achingly beautiful soles are pulled away from your face, you cannot help letting out an involuntary whine. Both women look shocked by this; Helena's expression changes to one of anger as her eyes shift downwards and see that you are sporting a full-on erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gringo!\" She hisses at you, lifting back a bare foot and slamming it hard in your face, making you yelp in pain and drop to the floor, face down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom! What is...?\" Gabriella seems genuinely confused while your worst fears seem to be confirmed...Helena knows that you are getting turned on by her, and her daughter's feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You getting off on my daughter's feet, you pervert white boy bitch?\" She roars down at you, stepping on the back of your head and grinding your already sore face into the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabriella gasps with shock before letting out a 'Ewww...that's so gross!' You can't retort...all you can do is groan futilely under the Latina janitor's powerful foot. Lifting up her foot, she pulls you roughly up by the hair, removing several clumps of it and forces you back into a kneeling position in front of her and Gabriella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You a foot freak? One of those white boy creeps who like feet?\" She glares at you, her eye brows raising as she steadies one hand as though preparing to strike you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No... Se\u00f1ora, Helena...I've never had a foot...fetish! You cry up, your face already aching. \"Never!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe studies you carefully. \"Bullshit! You like feet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...! No, Senora Helena! It's not feet...it's just...\" You breathe heavily, looking between the two women. Helena has a formidable look about her while Gabriella still seems to be rather taken aback. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what, gringo?\" Helena growls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you tell her the truth - that it's her feet too, or do you pretend that it's only Gabriella's feet that turn you on?</span></div></div>",

How are you, baby?\" She speaks into the receiver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Mom! I'm good thanks - been studying since school finished. How are you?\"</i> Gabriella replies, her voice tinny from the speaker of Helena's phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got my white boy bitch here, he's got my toes in my mouth and he's gagging like the loser he is!\" Helena giggles, strangely proud to be telling this to her own daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hahaha! Oh, Mom! You're so cool to have an actual foot bitch! How's my Mom, foot bitch?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmmmfff!\" Is all you can make out at them, which makes both women giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, baby, I just told my bitch here that you could come over. Then I decided not to - he don't deserve to see a beauty like you! All he deserves is my bare feet!\" Helena says with such authority, that you feel your pants begin to tighten....<i>not again</i>, you muse to yourself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena hangs up her phone and smirks at you. \"Gabriella, she too beautiful for you to even look at, bitch! No, all you need is my feet!\" She pulls out her toes at last, allowing you to breathe in some fresh air before clicking her fingers at you to resume your foot licking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLapping your tongue against her soles like a dog, you can't help but become more enamoured with Helena - and her feet. Unable to hold it any longer, you let a small moan escape your lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, gringo?\" The janitor sneers at you. \"My feet too smelly for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't even respond as you continue to dance your tongue all along her wrinkled soles, savouring the cheddary flavour, which is now something you can't help but enjoy. Actually, that's an understatement - it actually tastes good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more minutes later, and fortunately without your sight hard-on from being seen, Helena pulls her feet away, allowing you to drop weakly to the floor. \"Anyway, gringo, some of us got work to do...\" Suddenly she turns to you. \"Of course! You will clean for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA day ago, you would have at least attempted to fight this. But not now - you are hers, her property. A combination of fear and lust makes you agree at once, causing her to laugh in your face before tossing you the keys. \"You can lock up too, bitch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt should be mortifying, but it feels like a way to serve Helena, which is what you seem to be naturally drawn to doing anyway. As with the previous evening, you clean the entire office - this time alone - taking extra care to make Denise's desk look totally pristine. You should be angry at Helena for escaping over two more hours of work and adding to your load, yet you accept it. Your newfound, lustful feelings for the Latina and her bare feet are ones that you'd never, not in a million years, ever expect to feel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you get home, it's nearly 9pm. As the previous night, you collapse on your bed and have dreams about Helena's feet. Except this time, you're loving them and wake up with a mess in your pants. <i>A wet dream, man it's been a few years!</i> Worse still, Denise and Candice appear in the dream too, you licking their bare feet up and down and finding that you like it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up, you can't shake away the thought of it - do you actually have a foot fetish? Or is it just familiarity with Helena's feet and her dominant nature that's forced you to become devoted to her? Either way, you rush to work early to get Denise's coffee ready on time. Realising that you have about ten minutes, you have the urge to see Helena, to get to be at her feet again. Then again, it's risky being late for Denise's arrival...</span></div></div>",

My boss - Miss Denise - she will not allow me to leave her side during the day! So I can't lick your feet during the day, I'm sorry!

She continues to stare at you with the same, vaguely interested expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You come here after work, gringo bitch. You lick my feet when I tell you to - and I tell you to after your work at 5:30,\" she says this so commandingly that you don't dare protest, even if it means not getting to taste her feet. Murmuring a grateful thank you and goodbye, you hurry back upstairs and fortunately are there before Denise arrives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInspecting the coffee, Denise nods. \"Good job, slave! You're getting better each time! Now I need a gooooood looooong foot rub. I didn't have time to take a full shower - only my hair, so they're probably a bit stinky. That's fine with you, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill with your mind on Helena, you nod numbly before wincing at the assault to your nostrils as the vinegar-like stench causes you to gag, as your boss takes off each of her shoes. Giggling at your reaction, you dutifully kneel down, as you did yesterday and begin to press your thumbs firmly into the centre of one bare sole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaahhh, this is the life!\" Denise sighs contentedly. \"My chief rival reduced to rubbing my feet and fetching me coffee. You know that in 6 months of this you'll be so deskilled that you'll be unfit to have your old job back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had never occurred to you before; what if you become so used to being Denise's slave that you're not able to maintain your skill set? Still, there's nothing you can do about it while you meekly massage the blonde's bare feet, while she makes calls and works at her computer. While you rub away, you again admit that they are prettier than Helena's - the shape and arches are just objectively a bit better. So why are you so enamoured with the Latina and her feet? Another factor is the fact that Denise's feet absolutely reek; the foul, putrid stench makes it impossible for you to enjoy the experience at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does your day go?

So, this is the situation...\" She glares at you, clearly pissed that you've complicated things for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are about to speak, but a look from the Latina silences you. \"The only way I see this working is making you hate licking my feet, but still having to! So, today, I went for a jog in my crocs, I walked around barefoot EVERYWHERE! My feet - they are dirtier than ever. You will lick them clean, and you will NOT enjoy them. Si, gringo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Si, Senora Helena,\" You reply instantly, dropping to you knees the moment she slips off her crocs. A horrendously foul, acrid aroma assaults your nose at once. Spluttering and gagging, you automatically cover your nostrils with your hand and moan in disgust.

The brief time that you were attracted to Helena's feet is a very distant memory now as you feel the desperate need to get the hell out of there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she can utter an other word, you suddenly jump to your feet, taking her by surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gringo...! Lick my feet, you pathetic little bitch!\" She roars at you as you sprint away from her and out of the basement. Her cries becoming fainter, you're out of the building in record time. On the drive home, you keep picturing Helena's slimy, filthy bare soles and can't help but shudder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What the hell were you thinking? How could you ever be attracted to feet?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about Helena's forceful personality, along with the fact that her feet were genuinely getting cleaner and softer every time you licked them are the most logical explanations. Having never been remotely interested in feet - quite the contrary - you feel actually relieved that you're not even slightly attracted to them anymore!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, you have feet-less dreams, thank God! However, you can't avoid the fact that you've undoubtedly pissed off a strong, vengeful Hispanic janitor... In the morning, the first thing on your mind is how are you going to deal with this problem? On the one hand, you owe Helena nothing; on Kim's orders, you work for Denise, not the Latina. Still, Helena has become accustomed to your submissive behaviour towards her...it's unlikely that she would accept you quietly slipping away from what she expects from you. <i>And what she expects is you kneeling before her and licking her feet!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuddering again at the thought, disgusted with yourself that you ever enjoyed her nasty feet, you arrive at work - a little earlier than usual. Knowing that you'll be forced to rub Denise's stinky feet, act as her footrest, along with anything she else she decides to subject you to, this is surely the best time to deal with the Helena problem. See her now before your assistant duties to Denise start? Or is it best to avoid the forceful Latina altogether?</span></div></div>",

Well maybe Candice's too to be fair!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continues to stare at you, eyes narrowed with a scowl on her tough face. \"White boy, you listen to me,\" she says through gritted teeth. \"You are my <i>bitch</i>.

Then there's the tax forms, and the new contract reports...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise reels off a huge list of jobs, which seem to be endless. You shudder when she mentions things like walking her dog, polishing her shoes - as well as Candice's, taking her clothes to the dry cleaners, collecting them, booking her nail and salon appointments...by the time she's finished, you have over twenty jobs on your list!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of the day, you try your best to carry out the various tasks she's set you, while avoiding Helena at the same time. By 3pm, you've knocked off a few items from the list - some will be ongoing for weeks anyway. After Denise tells you to fetch her another coffee - the usual soya bean latte with a double shot of espresso, you think about the Latina cleaner. Maybe you should make it up to her by getting her coffee now...it may not be too late to make amends! If you don't, she could exact out some nasty form of revenge on you.

Even Denise cannot find much fault in your work, which doesn't stop her in ordering you around and taking great pleasure in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally it's the end of a long day.

Helena gives you her order and sits in a back booth, luckily the place isn\u2019t too packed. The barista is a chubby (but somewhat pretty) 20 year old who doesn\u2019t speak a lick of English. You manage to get Helena\u2019s fairly simple order off and shake your head in embarrassment when the girl indicates that she would like to know what you want. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou return to Helena with the coffee and stand there, unsure of how to proceed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you waiting for gringo? Twenty minutes.\u201d She stares a hole in you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around in a panic, there\u2019s only a few other customers in the shop and they are all at the front of the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo it, or I\u2019ll beat you again and make you do it anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing what she says is true you cram yourself under the booth, praying that you are hidden enough so as not to draw attention. Your face wrinkles as you remove her work sneakers and the smell of her wet socks hit you. You quickly peel those off and begin the now familiar task of cleaning Helena\u2019s sweaty, dirty, janitor feet. You begin at her heels, swirling your tongue around the rough skin surrounding them until the taste of sweat is gone.

Tears springing to your eyes with the intense, acrid taste, you do as you're told and lick all the way up to her toes.

The fact that you've just got down on your knees and begged your nemesis to be her assistant of all things...surely she'd just accept! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me - I said no,\" she says simply, regarding you with disdain before turning to Kim. \"Sorry, Kim, but the fact that this misogynistic pervert had the nerve to choose being Helena's assistant over me in the first place tells me everything I need to know. He had the chance to make it up to me and he blew it. That's how it is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour redhead boss looks between the two of you then shrugs her shoulders. \"Fair enough, Denise. Robert has behaved despicably and he did make his choice. So that's that - I apologise Helena for wasting your time but there will be no need to make any changes in our, <i>ahem</i>, arrangement after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You're gonna regret that, gringo</i>...\" Helena mouths directly at you. The other two women either can't tell or choose to ignore her words. The Latina cleaner addresses Kim. \"I see this man - he really has no respect. I will teach him to respect women...to make amends for what he's done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise smirks at you before leaving the office, leaving you alone with the other two. Kim studies you. \"Robert, I have to say...I am impressed! Actually getting on your knees and being prepared to beg and grovel - that's a quality I like in people! However, you have to make it up to Helena her - she'd understandably upset that you would renege on your deal. So, do a good job over the next three months and, assuming there are no problems, you'll come out of this a better employee, and person - I'm sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wave of her hand, both you and the Mexican janitor depart. Sensing her staring daggers at you as you exit Kim's office, Helena is clearly pissed. \"I'm gonna make you pay, bitch...\" She whispers in your ear before skulking away from you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to your desk, you try to ignore the smug, superior expression on Denise's face. \"Did you really think I would let you be my assistant, considering you chose being the janitor's skivvy instead? Ha, even making you my office bitch isn't a patch on knowing that you're scrubbing every desk, toilet and floor clean here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can retort, she pulls a sympathetic face. \"Aw, you did such a good job getting on your knees and begging me like a little doggy!\" She pouts at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go to Hell,\" you snarl at her. \"I bet you're loving every moment of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stares at you confidently. \"Anything else to say, janitor boy? Anything that I can pass on to Kim...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealising that you have to suck it up, keep calm and ignore her, you focus instead on your work. The day passes fairly quietly at first, but by the afternoon - thanks to Denise - everyone has heard about your new 'extra job'. Taking all of the barbs, smart remarks and insults, you know it's best not to react and give Denise any satisfaction in knowing that it's got to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping yourself to yourself, you avoid your friend, Jenny along anyone else at the office. Finally, 5:30 comes around, which makes a sense of dread reside in the pit of your belly. Helena is not going to go easy on you... When you arrive at the basement in her 'office', you see that she's not there. Do you go ahead with the cleaning or wait for her to arrive, in case she has any specific instructions for you?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She hits you again in the groin, forcing you to wretch around on the floor in agony, whimpering like a wounded animal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...Senora...Helena...\" You gasp, trying your best to ignore the pain that you are in. It feels as though your balls have swelled to balloons, then been squashed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you...you're gonna pay for trying to get rid of me. You're stuck with me now, gringo. You're gonna wish you'd never tried to swap bosses. I'M your boss!

Ordering you to remove each of her crocs, she stands over you, resting one bare sole over your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lick the bottom of my foot clean! You did such a good job yesterday, bitch! You're tongue's gonna know the bottom of my feet real well for the next three months! HA!\" She orders you, smiling evilly as you reluctantly stick out your tongue and proceed licking her bare sole, tasting all the dirt and grime and whatever else she's stepped on today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to be barefoot when cleaning the women's bathrooms today...I bet you've got all sorts of crap on your tongue now! Imagine tasting the dirt that Miss Denise, Miss Kim and all those other women have walked on! You're a pathetic gringo bitch. MY pathetic bitch!\" Helena thunders down at you while you meekly lick her cheddary-tasting foot. It's so salty that you wish you could chug down some water, or anything to get rid of the taste!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwapping over her feet, Helena watches you with satisfaction as you humbly lick up and down her other sole, not even daring to look her in the eye. Any chance of changing your arrangement, or reestablishing yourself as someone who isn't a pushover is totally gone. She knows, and you know that you're her bitch, for as long as you're her assistant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, you ready to clean the office like the bitch you are?\" She asks you, cackling at how pathetic you must look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Si, Senora Helena,\" you murmur, swallowing uncomfortably all of her foot sweat and grime after she steps away. You want to splutter and spit it all out, but you know that would only displease her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs yesterday, you clean the entire office - this time without any help from Helena. It takes over two hours and by the time you're done, you feel like collapsing at Helena's feet. She's decided to stay, just to make sure you've done a good job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies' bathroom's not clean,\" she tells you, after her inspection is complete. \"Rest is OK.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Senora Helena...the woman's bathroom is completely clean...OW!\" You wince as Helena smacks you around the back of the head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tell you if it's clean...!\" You yelp in pain as she grabs you by the ear and takes you over to the WC. Opening the door she points to the dirty footprints all over the floor. \"See - not clean!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Those are Helena's footsteps!</i> She must have deliberately made her feet dirty and walked all around the women's bathroom, just to make you clean it again! Not falling into her trap, you merely nod and clear you're throat. \"Sorry, Senora Helena. I will clean the floor again.\" Before you head back to get a cloth and disinfectant, Helena stops you with another tug on your ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a better idea, bitch. Clean the dirty footprints with your tongue. That's all it's good for anyway! Get on your hands and knees and lick up every dirty footprint you can see!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirks at you, clearly enjoying the power that she holds over you. Just before you drop to your hands and knees, you feel a small burning resentment build. Licking her feet is one thing, but licking dirty footprints off the bathroom floor...can you bring yourself to do this?!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maintaining her hold on your hair she grabs your face and shoves it roughly towards the toilet, you try to brace yourself against the seat but she is too strong! Your arms collapse and you face smacks into the cold water of the porcelain bowl. You thrash about but it\u2019s too no avail, your flabby office body is no match for her years of manual labor!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute goes by and you can feel your vision start to blur and you begin to think she might actually drown you in here! Involuntarily your mouth opens and you suck in a mouthful of water! A few seconds later you feel her grip release on your hair and you fly out of the water and collapse to the floor, gasping for air. As your senses return you realize Helena is laughing hysterically at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh weak little gringo bitch. You are so pathetic! Now you finish the floor!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you regain your faculties and slink back to your knees, a mixture of your tears and the toilet water drips off of your face as you lick the remaining prints from the floor. Amazed that your situation always seems to get worse no matter what you do, you continue to weep as you clean the bathroom floor with your tongue while Helena taunts you.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You stumbled away and tried to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ain't going anywhere you ugly git!\"  She jammed the the mob handle in between your legs so that on your next step you tripped over it completely and landed face first onto the ground.  You moaned in pain as she began to beat you savagely with the the mop.  It probably wasn't the best weapon in the world but it was doing the trick.  You screamed for help as she slammed it down onto you over and over again.  Your forearms were taking the burnt of the blows and hot tears began to trickle down your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww are you crying?  Crying that the 'ugly un-educated peon' is putting you in your place?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had never in your life called someone a 'peon' who the hell did that in this day and age?  Her wrath was unswayed by your protests and pleas of innocence as she continued her ruthless assault.  You felt something crack in one of your arms and you cradled it as she switched tactics and stomped on your ribs.  It was followed by another viciously hard whack to your head and you lost consciousness.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You saw that she was barefoot and had taken off her jeans.  She had on a pair of white panties, not particularly sexual but not granny panties either.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You finally up yet ya' tosser?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let another groan.  \"Why are you doing this?  Untie me... you just assaulted me!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moves the chair closer and slaps you across the face with her bare foot.  Her feet bore no toenail polish but they weren't ugly by any means.  They were sweaty from working long hours doing menial janitorial work.  You flinch, not really from the pain because it wasn't that hard of a slap, but from the wet residue left on your face.  It was sweat.  You felt sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop this.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slaps you again and laughs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah you stupid git.  You're gonna pay for your high 'an mighty talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I didn't...\"  You try to say but she cuts you off by pushing her foot onto your neck, cutting off your words and your oxygen.  Her legs were strong!  Your face slowly turns red as she watches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more o' of your lies pig.  Apologize or you'll regret it.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaced with the unwelcome reality of being completely at her mercy you don't see any choice.  But what if she was just looking for confirmation that you had said those things?  If that was the case by you admitting it she would feel justified in doing even worse things to you.  Her cold uncompromising gaze gave you chills.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat were you going to do?  </span></div></div>",

Seeing how brutal she had been earlier and how quickly she was to cut off your life giving oxygen made you realize it was best to appease her.  She clearly believed whoever had spread the lies about you (and you were pretty sure you knew who) and getting her to believe otherwise seemed an impossible task.  Instead you decided to lie in the hope she would show some mercy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, all right!  I admit it.  I'm sorry.  I was rude and I'll never do it again, just please let me go.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena scowled at you.  \"I knew it!

I can't believe you have nothin' better to do with your day than to tell lies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her get angrier you start to rethink your plan but it would just infuriate her more if you went back on what you had just said.

You've knocked me around quite a bit, please enough is enough, yeah?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena glared at you.  \"Its enough when I say its enough bastard.

Get your tongue out and do service to someone who had to put up with all your arrogance.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer damp sweaty feet nauseated you.  You still had a trail of sweat on your cheek from where she had slapped you.  To put your actual tongue on it?  The thought was vile.  What kind of monster was she?

All her life she has been given everything; now that she is working in a proper job, she believes everything should still be handed to her... God forbid she should discover a weakness about you or blackmail you, as she would literally step on you to climb the corporate ladder and would happily have you hand over opportunities to her, as you kneel at her feet and serve her like a Queen! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cgrape\"><a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ibb.co/hmjxh5\">Kim</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"https://ibb.co/hmjxh5\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a></span></b><br>\r\n42 year old red head - A new manager who is incredibly sexy and has been placed in a position that most people would take most of their working lives to attain,  so you're naturally jealous and a little fearful of her.
