And this might spoil the story a little!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story takes place in the present day. A normal every day high school, and involves the social life around it. In 2 days time the school formal takes place (this is like a prom in the states) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon, he is a 17 year old boy. Studying for his A-levels, in English Lit, Art and cookery. He hates physical education, and is in his eyes cursed with a very masculine body. He is five foot eleven and quite well built. He shaves his face every day, a chore in his eyes. His hair is styled long indie fashion thought not too long. Resembles Owen Wilson if he had black hair!<br>\r\nHe is not gay, in fact he is not yet sexually awakened! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky, she is also 17 studying A-levels, in Physical Education, Chemistry and Physics. She is a total tom boy more likely to be playing sport than shopping. She is around five foot Three inches, and a size 12, and she looks like a young Natalie Imbruglia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey are both best friends and have been for many years they live next door to each other, and know everything there is to know about each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question is who will you be?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His father left a few years ago and a thankfull Simon doesn\u2019t see him that often.<br>\r\nHe read a bit of the book he was reading but found that he was too tired for it. So he went to his journal, and started to read through it. He found the day when he and Becks became a couple, well for the eyes of the school. Of course their parents were delighted! But this wasn\u2019t a real couple, just a convenience! <br>\r\n\u201cThe great idea.<br>\r\nToday Becks and I had a fantastic idea that we should pretend to be boyfriend and girlfriend, this would prove to those wankers that I\u2019m not a fag!\u201d<br>\r\nFor that is all it was a farce. Simon wasn\u2019t into girls. In fact he wasn\u2019t into boys either, at least then he would have a place in the world. It seemed that her was destined to be a-sexual.<br>\r\nHe opened up his laptop, disrobing and looking at his flaccid penis. He was aware that he was fairly well hung. He had never measured it nor had no need to, but in PE class he noticed that the rest of the guys where considerably smaller dicks than him.<br>\r\nHe logged onto the porn website he had been told about 89.com he looked at pornography of all kinds, normal ~ nothing, girl on girl ~ nothing, guy on guy ~ nothing! Girls with dicks ~ nothing. He sat tugging away at his soft member, feeling disgusted with himself, he subconsciously wondered about the Kitchen knives he was bidding for on eBay. So mid wank he started to look at kitchen gadgets. He stopped and began to cry. <br>\r\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t I be normal?\u201d he got up and walked to the mirror. Looking at himself, he smiled but the tears kept rolling down his chin! He walked to the bathroom and shaved. A choir he loathed. Half of the guys in his classes where jealous of his features. Not that they would ever tell him!<br>\r\nHe put his uniform on and headed down stairs. He made his mother her breakfast and left it on the table for her.<br>\r\nHe left the house, and crossed the garden to Becky\u2019s house. He knocked the window, and walked in.<br>\r\nAs he got to the dinning room Becky ran past him shouting <br>\r\n\u201cDam it Sie\u201d he chuckled to himself<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning Mrs Rainey.\u201d She smiled at him and said<br>\r\n\u201cSame to you Simon, please you know by now its Nicola, you may as well have her breakfast we both know she wont eat it.\u201d Simon smiled, he had already had breakfast but it would be rude to leave it. <br>\r\n\u201cTake your time.\u201d And other than this they sat in silence eating there breakfast, and a few minutes later Becky came down the stairs. At the bottom of the stairs she slipped her feet into her black kitten heeled shoes, and they where leaving. As they left the house she smiled at him. He knew that she had an idea. He smiled back and reached for her hand!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShall we skip school Sie and go for coffee?\u201d she said. Simon thought about it and said<br>\r\n\u201cErm, yea whatever you want!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They walk toward 2 girls and a guy. Peter they guy leans forward and kisses each of Becky\u2019s cheeks she hates this attention, but within seconds it\u2019s a French greeting free for all. With Simon kissing the cheeks of the girls, then Becky kissing the girls cheeks. Peter and Simon just shook hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus pulls up and they all get on. The two girls sit next to each other talking about the celebrity TV thing. Becky Didn\u2019t know anything about it but Simon was vaguely interested he had watched it. They sat in front of the girls. And peter sat in front of Simon and Becky, and peter and Becky began talking about the Manchester United game on the night before. Peter being a big Man u fan was boasting about how great they where, but Becky being a total Liverpool fan, was slagging off their performance!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the bus pulled up in front of the school, Becky and Simon got off and went into the school. They both had different classes this morning they pretended to kiss at the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon was left with a choice <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He thought to himself, they where in the same history class and waiting outside for their teacher, Simon had been getting some abuse from some of the other boys about his sexuality. Becky had seen enough and she strode over to Simon and winked at him and planted a kiss right on his lips, slipping her tongue into his mouth.<br>\r\nHe hated the fact that he never got sexually aroused by this! But that was that most of the abuse stopped there and then. <br>\r\nHe rounded the corner past the old science block, and walked into the new building. Before he got to Miss Doyle\u2019s room he stumbled slightly. Though not physically!<br>\r\nHe steadied himself, and knocked the door.<br>\r\n\u201cSimon you\u2019re the only person who knocks that bloody door!\u201d<br>\r\nHe walked into the room. Miss Doyle was a tall skinny woman; well the rumour was that she wasn\u2019t always a woman. And indeed she did have a slightly masculine appearance to her, but she was good to Simon so he didn\u2019t care!<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ok?\u201d she asked looking at the pale Simon. <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m ok just felt a little funny.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOk, so have you decided on what your going to do for the examiners next month?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cYes Miss Doyle, I am going to do a vegetarian lasagne with home made garlic bread!\u201d he announced<br>\r\n\u201cBrilliant!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cThank you! I was wondering if I could use the kitchen this morning to go over it?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOf course you can. Why don\u2019t you skip your afternoon class and do it then?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYea I\u2019ll do that.\u201d He turned and left.

And they are only scheduled for 12 hours a week, the rest is supposed to be \u201cindependent learning\u201d. So they can skip school as neither have been timetabled until 12, and Simon at 1.<br>\r\nThey walk hand in hand up the drive of the school. And onto the main road and walk to book finders, a little coffee shop facing the university, that they often go to. Its half back street second hand book shop half caf\u00e9! With a really relaxed atmosphere!<br>\r\nAs they enter the shop the smell of fresh coffee hits them, and instantly relaxes them both! They walk through the book shop to the caf\u00e9 section and bell the owner leans round the corner and greets them<br>\r\n\u201cYea hi Bell\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCoffee?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes please\u201d says Simon<br>\r\n\u201cYou got it. Bell you must be a mind reader\u201d says Becky <br>\r\n\u201cNow Rebecca, you know that I\u2019m a witch!\u201d Simon and Becky both laughed an uneasy laugh! For Bell had always professed that she was at one with witch craft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing tonight Beck\u2019s\u201d asked Simon hoping that she would invite him to watch dvds or something. <br>\r\n\u201cemmm\u201d she said thinking<br>\r\n\u201cOh shit I have to go and look at dresses with Mary, why the hell did you invite me to this stupid formal anyway?\u201d he laughed and shook his head, his tux was ordered he had to pick it up tomorrow!<br>\r\n\u201cYou bloody well wanted to go!\u201d he said<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway shopping with Mary might be fun, you\u2019ll look amazing in a dress!\u201d he said knowing that she would but that she would hate this compliment. <br>\r\n\u201coh fuck off. I can\u2019t believe that the school won\u2019t let me wear a tux like you, I wish you had to wear the stupid dress, and I could wear the poxy tux.\u201d He smiled he had dreamt that they would be a couple but she the husband, how strange.<br>\r\n\u201cCareful you might get what you wish for\u201d he laughed as he said it. But she never answered, what the hell was she thinking?<br>\r\n\u201chuh wha?\u201d she said.<br>\r\n\u201cI said careful you might get what you wish for\u201d he said laughing.<br>\r\n\u201cWishes, then. My speciality!\u201d said bell bringing the coffees. The two laughed again and said thank you.<br>\r\nShe got up and fetched a book on astrophysics, and got him a glossy magazine. As she passed it to him he skipped to the agony page and was engrossed. Im in love with my sister\u2019s husband, he smiled reading it, and it only got better. A couple of hours later and a few coffees later they paid Bell and said their farewells. <br>\r\nAs they left Bell shouted<br>\r\n\u201cOh Simon\u201d he stopped and looked at his change, he had paid her, he turned and walked back in, he went up the counter, Bell stood there, and handed him a book called \u201cDealing with you\u2019re womanhood\u201d Simon looked puzzled, he shook his head thinking this was an insult.<br>\r\n\u201cyou will need this tomorrow night sweety\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cyou will see!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201ceer ok\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cyou\u2019re welcome!\u201d he put the book in his bag and faced the door he heard becky shouting <br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll end up in jail pervert!\u201d he smiled and pushed the door open as he walked out she was pulling her skirt down to it normal level<br>\r\n\u201cWhat she want?\u201d asked Becky<br>\r\n\u201cOh nothing\u201d Simon replied coyly<br>\r\n\u201cReally you little dweeb, what did she want\u201d she said smiling, and pretending to punch him.<br>\r\n\u201cNo she just said, you\u2019re welcome.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cI have no idea.\u201d With that they walked on. When they got to school they separated. Simon went to the student kitchen and began to cook his dish for the exam later that day. After an hour or so he felt himself sweat under the collar. The heating must be on; he thought to himself, he decided to go for a breath of air, out the back. He also needed the toilet. He stood up and it must have been a little too quickly cause his head began to sway but he soldiered on and went to the toilet down the corridor. He pushed the door open and was greeted by the foulest smell. God boys are disgusting he thought. As he passed the mirror he realised that he was wearing his piny. Oh he will get the death if anyone sees him. He walked into a cubical; he wiped the seat with toilet roll. Once satisfied that it was clean he dropped his trousers and his shorts, and sat down.<br>\r\nMoments later he heard a couple of boys enter the toilets, they were joking. He heard them enter separate cubical, and unbuckle themselves then one of the boys said <br>\r\n\u201cOh page 13\u201d the other said<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit yea!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDude page 30\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHoly fuck it\u2019s that Simon fag! From upper sixth\u201d Simon sharpened <br>\r\n\u201cYea but look at his titties\u201d he was feeling uncomfortable, had they glued his head to a porno mag?<br>\r\n\u201cNo way man, I\u2019m going back to page 13\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDude if he where here id fill his ass\u201d Simon went red, and he felt something new. His penis was growing, he took a sharp breath.<br>\r\n\u201cSick\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYea but I bet your hard!\u201d wait a minute they where masturbating, and one of them is thinking of me? Simon\u2019s penis was now rock hard he reached down and began to caress it sent a shudder up his spine.<br>\r\nHe gripped it and began to stroke it in ernest, this was his first sexual hard on. One of the boys said <br>\r\n\u201cAh man I\u2019m shooting\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWait for me\u201d the other said probably not knowing just how homoerotic this all was to a virgin masturbator like Simon.<br>\r\n\u201cYea Simon take it you fag, take it in your fag ass baby!\u201d shouted one of the boys as he did another bolt of energy worked from Simons testicles through his body and he shouted <br>\r\n\u201cNO!!\u201d Simon was almost unconscious as the other two boys, panicked thinking that a teacher had caught them. They ran out of the cubicles, one of them caught his penis on his zip as he did and screamed in pain. The other was still shooting in his pants as he left the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon sat for several minutes in his first post orgasmic bliss! He had managed to direct the semen into the toilet and not over his cloths.<br>\r\nBut he had no energy; he had a cookery presentation in half an hour. But he probably should go home!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up his legs still wobbling, he fixed himself. And went to the wash hand basins, and washed his hands. He noticed that the boys had left their reading material, he went over and lifted one of the magazines, \u201cMayfair\u201d was the title, and he flicked through, until page 30. He was amazed at what he saw. A young woman was undressing, she started off in a cheerleaders uniform, complete with pom poms. In one photo she had cupped her breast and was licking one of her hard nipples. in the next photo she was on her knees, spreading the cheeks of her ass, and looking into the camera, with a wiked smile. That wasnt overly amazing. What was truely amazing however was that she looked identical to Simon! he felt another twings in his shorts, cuppled with a sharp buzz in his belly, he felt dizzy again.<br>\r\nHe heard a bell, and he put the magazine into his bag. His head truly spinning now.<br>\r\nHe left the toilet, and walked down the corridor<br>\r\nSimon found his cookery teacher and she asked him if he was ready for the presentation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When they got to school they separated. Simon went to the student kitchen and began to cook his dish for the exam later that day. After an hour or so he felt himself sweat under the collar. The heating must be on; he thought to himself, he decided to go for a breath of air, out the back. He also needed the toilet. He stood up and it must have been a little too quickly cause his head began to sway but he soldiered on and went to the toilet down the corridor. He pushed the door open and was greeted by the foulest smell. God boys are disgusting he thought. As he passed the mirror he realised that he was wearing his piny. Oh he will get the death if anyone sees him. He walked into a cubical; he wiped the seat with toilet roll. Once satisfied that it was clean he dropped his trousers and his shorts, and sat down.<br>\r\nMoments later he heard a couple of boys enter the toilets, they were joking. He heard them enter separate cubical, and unbuckle themselves then one of the boys said <br>\r\n\u201cOh page 13\u201d the other said<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit yea!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDude page 30\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHoly fuck it\u2019s that Simon fag! From upper sixth\u201d Simon sharpened <br>\r\n\u201cYea but look at his titties\u201d he was feeling uncomfortable, had they glued his head to a porno mag?<br>\r\n\u201cNo way man, I\u2019m going back to page 13\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDude if he where here id fill his ass\u201d Simon went red, and he felt something new. His penis was growing, he took a sharp breath.<br>\r\n\u201cSick\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYea but I bet your hard!\u201d wait a minute they where masturbating, and one of them is thinking of me? Simon\u2019s penis was now rock hard he reached down and began to caress it sent a shudder up his spine.<br>\r\nHe gripped it and began to stroke it in ernest, this was his first sexual hard on. One of the boys said <br>\r\n\u201cAh man I\u2019m shooting\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWait for me\u201d the other said probably not knowing just how homoerotic this all was to a virgin masturbator like Simon.<br>\r\n\u201cYea Simon take it you fag, take it in your fag ass baby!\u201d shouted one of the boys as he did another bolt of energy worked from Simons testicles through his body and he shouted <br>\r\n\u201cNO!!\u201d Simon was almost unconscious as the other two boys, panicked thinking that a teacher had caught them. They ran out of the cubicles, one of them caught his penis on his zip as he did and screamed in pain. The other was still shooting in his pants as he left the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon sat for several minutes in his first post orgasmic bliss! He had managed to direct the semen into the toilet and not over his cloths.<br>\r\nBut he had no energy; he had a cookery presentation in half an hour. But he probably should go home!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up his legs still wobbling, he fixed himself. And went to the wash hand basins, and washed his hands. He noticed that the boys had left their reading material, he went over and lifted one of the magazines, \u201cMayfair\u201d was the title, and he flicked through, until page 30. He was amazed at what he saw. A young woman was undressing, she started off in a cheerleaders uniform, complete with pom poms. In one photo she had cupped her breast and was licking one of her hard nipples. in the next photo she was on her knees, spreading the cheeks of her ass, and looking into the camera, with a wiked smile. That wasnt overly amazing. What was truely amazing however was that she looked identical to Simon! he felt another twings in his shorts, cuppled with a sharp buzz in his belly, he felt dizzy again.<br>\r\nHe heard a bell, and he put the magazine into his bag. His head truly spinning now.<br>\r\nHe left the toilet, and walked down the corridor<br>\r\nSimon found his cookery teacher and she asked him if he was ready for the presentation.

She hated it at the minute. She rolled out of bed, she scratched her crotch and put both of her feet on the floor, and stepped into her Mr T slippers and walked naked to the hanger scratching her bare ass. She Grabbed her white dressing gown and wrapped it around her.<br>\r\nStill half asleep Becky looked into the mirror and yawned. She ran her fingers through her light brown hair. She lifted the hatch of her loft bedroom, and descended the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she got to the ground floor her elder sister Mary greeted her with a <br>\r\n\u201cMorning dyke!\u201d Becky showed her, her index finger. And walked to the table.<br>\r\nShe passed her mother and kissed her cheek. And slid out the chair and poured herself some tea. She buttered a piece of toast, and began chewing.<br>\r\nA few mouthfuls later her father came to the table <br>\r\n\u201cHey there Becky, I hope you\u2019re ready for the test today?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYea dad!\u201d said Becky. <br>\r\n\u201cHey Becky your girlfriend is here\u201d said Mary pointing to the back door where simon was casually walking in.<br>\r\n\u201cDam it Sie\u201d Becky said jumping to her feet, and charging upstairs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe climbed her steps and disrobed!<br>\r\n\u201cTake your time\u201d came a shout from downstairs from Simon<br>\r\n\u201cYea, yea, yea\u201d she responded! Becky reached into the shower cubical and switched on the water she grabbed her tooth brush and took it into the shower with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later Rebecca stepped out of the shower refreshed rather than cleaned! She reached into her drawer and pulled out a pair of black boxer shorts, and pulled the up her long slender legs, then she grabbed her black opaque tights and rolled them up her legs. She pulled out a white bra, and put her arms through the straps and buckled it behind her. She pulled her white school shirt over her head, and fastened the top 2 buttons, and drew the tie up a little. Her grey school skirt was still in a bundle on the floor, she stepped into it and straightened it up, then buttoned and zipped it. She hated the fact it was so short, and she knew that there perverts all over who thought about it while pleasuring themselves! She smiled at that thought!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Becky was downstairs Simon had drank her tea and eaten her toast. They got up and left together, and by the time they reached the end of the garden Simon had reached for Becky\u2019s hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShall we skip school Sie and go for coffee?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cErm yea whatever you want!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They walk toward 2 girls and a guy. Peter they guy leans forward and kisses each of Becky\u2019s cheeks she hates this attention, but within seconds it\u2019s a French greeting free for all. With Simon kissing the cheeks of the girls, then Becky kissing the girls cheeks. Peter and Simon just shook hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus pulls up and they all get on. The two girls sit next to each other talking about the celebrity TV thing. Becky Didn\u2019t know anything about it but Simon was vaguely interested he had watched it. They sat in front of the girls. And peter sat in front of Simon and Becky, and peter and Becky began talking about the Manchester United game on the night before. Peter being a big Man u fan was boasting about how great they where, but Becky being a total Liverpool fan, was slagging off their performance!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the bus pulled up in front of the school, Becky and Simon got off and went into the school.

She was her Form teacher and looked after any of Becky\u2019s problems. She was the one who helped Becky through her first period in first year. And Becky had an enormous respect and trust, in her.<br>\r\nShe knocked the door, and waited for the <br>\r\n\u201cCome in.\u201d Becky walked in, and was stunned to see her teacher not in her usual tracksuit, but in a smart looking White skirt suit, with a bustier top. She had make-up on which made her look 20 something rather than 40 something. Although Mrs McClain never looked 40 something! She was beautiful. Her blonde hair held a natural wave, and she was very fit. She played international Hockey for Ireland until a few years ago. She was about the same height as Becky but had a perfect 10 figure. <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Miss, what\u2019s the charges.\u201d Said Becky referring to the old joke about people in suits being in court!<br>\r\n\u201cOh very funny Beck\u2019s!\u201d she said holding back her laughter. The two had become friends, over the past 2 years. Becky was not the type of girl who wanted to look good; she did Physical education because she loved sport. <br>\r\nShe also had matured beyond her years over the last couple of years, and they played in the same amateur Hockey team together. As the result they knew each other socially, but they had an agreement that in school, they had to treat each other as pupil and teacher in school, to stop any un-wanted attention. <br>\r\nVictoria McClain or Vicky as she was known to her friends, has recently separated from her husband, and the school rumour mill was in full swing, and had paired Vicky off with every other teacher and quite a few students. <br>\r\n\u201cSorry Beck\u2019s I have the review hearing today! It\u2019s in 20 minutes.\u201d She said referring to the committee hearing about a student she was supposed to have slept with. He was just a fourth year that tried to look good in front of his mates. But the rumour had spread so far that the school despite knowing it was false, had to be seen to act!<br>\r\n\u201cWell you look amazing you\u2019ll have them eating out of your hand!\u201d truly disappointed, she hope that the two of them could go for a swim and a work out, before classes. Vicky looked amazing in her swimsuit, and Becky loved to watch her work out.<br>\r\n\u201cTanks Beck\u2019s you going for a work out?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYea I was hoping that you could join me.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh that\u2019s a pity, I had a swim earlier, don\u2019t push yourself too hard.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou know me miss. Good luck.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThank you and I\u2019ll see you at training tonight?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, I have to go and get my dress tonight!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOk not too worry.\u201d Becky left slightly downtrodden, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got her gym gear out of her locker and walked to the changing room. Thinking a quick swim and a half an hour work out before chemistry.<br>\r\nShe pushed herself, really hard, she was on the tread mill and she started to feel weak. She stepped off, thinking that her period was due, so it might be that. She changed and got into the shower, and washed herself.<br>\r\nWhen she walked back into the changing room, Amanda was there, this was the type of girl Becky hated. She was sporty in that she did dancing, if this was the States she would be head of the Cheer leading Squad. She was Tall, Blonde had amazing tits, and despite Becky\u2019s hatred of Amanda she had been subject one or two of Becky\u2019s masturbation fantasies! Which sickened Becky!<br>\r\nShe watched as Amanda rolled up her tights in just her black thong, her breasts rubbed against her leg as she bent over fixing the toe of her tights! Becky felt her crotch tingle with mild excitement! \u201cOh fuck no\u201d she thought in a real anger with herself! She quickly dressed and rushed out. <br>\r\nIn the corridor, her head was swaying, like she stood up too quick. She walked to the reception at the top of the corridor, and sat down her eyes blurring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould she go to class or go home?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
