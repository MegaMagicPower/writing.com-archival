It doesn't take long before a party of five Bloodscalp hunters make their way to the bodies exiting the tress only 40 feet from your current position, upon closer inspection only one of them appears to be an actual hunter the rest are young bloods in training. you prepare to attack but how do you intend to do it</span></div></div>",

The shock of your assault scatters the young bloods, their panic allows you to cut them down with ease save for one whom you intend to interrogate, were these people anything other than Gurubashi trolls you might have felt bad, after all they are your peoples most hated enemies excluding the Naga, they would have shown you no mercy were the roles reversed, in fact they would have likely drawn it out longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin preparations for your interrogation, your captive is unconscious, but she won't remain that way for long, you bind her arms and legs. In truth this was no interrogation, you intended to use your power to invade her mind and extract all the knowledge of the Bloodscalp that you could manage so that you can use it in your campaign against her tribe. It doesn't take long for her to come round, as soon as she is fully awake you begin the process, it was a savage ritual, very few could survive with their minds intact after it had been performed on them, not that it mattered you had no intention of leaving her alive. Soon it was over, the knowledge of her tribes hunting grounds, settlements and their water sources was all yours, all that's left is for you to dispose of the evidence, though how you intended to do this hadn't quite been figured out....</span></div></div>",

You have a few options, you can create potions to poison the Bloodscalp water supplies, this would allow you to either kill them off reducing the tribe to a shadow of it's current power, or you can use mind altering elixirs to bring them under your thrall bolstering the Horde's presence in the vale. Your abdomen contracts crushing your meal and causing some of the bones within to audibly snap, forcing a thunderous belch up your throat. You begin to map out he territories of the Bloodscalp, noting that hey share many hunting grounds with the Skullsplitters, it wouldn't be hard to stir up a large conflict between the two, it would certainly take the pressure of the Grom'gol garrison. Finally you have one more option, you could stir up the local raptors in order to draw the Bloodscalps attention allowing you to lead a small raid to assassinate their leadership.

To that end you decide to make the journey alone bizzarely there are no trolls stationed at Grom'gol and as a result bringing soldiers will only slow you down. The journey takes a good many hours, your time mainly being spent dodging hostile patrols, and navigating the difficult terrain, by the time you arrive the moon had begun to rise in the sky , this will only make your job harder than it already was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you were to complete your potions you would need to delve into a hidden ruin close to Fort Livingston, it was once an ancient Gurubashi temple dedicated to Hakkar, the Blood god. these catacombs were home to many sacrifices and dark rituals conducted to appease Hakkar, and as a result the dark Loa's corruption had managed to survive there for millennia. Few would dare risk an expedition into the depths, but the Blood gods corruption had created a plethora of new herbs and fungi with potent mind altering properties, properties that you could put to use against the Bloodscalp tribe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou light a torch and begin your descent, praying to the pantheon of Loa worshiped by the Darkspear trolls, partly to prepare yourself for any threats lurking in the dark, and partly to calm your nerves. to say the tunnels reeked was an understatement, for centuries this temple had been left to rot, and it showed, not one surace was free from some form of plant growing there, and rather disturbingly you could recognise none of them, you make a note in your mind to notify the apothecaries society in Undercity of this location once your done in Stranglethorn. You stop dead in your tracks, something was wrong here, very wrong, centuries of festering mould and stagnating water withstanding, there was one more thing you could smell. Blood. Fresh blood. It begins to dawn on you that you aren't alone down here, someone lives here, someone you don't want to run into when your exploring an old ruin. Your life is now in more danger than you could ever have predicted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carry on further into the ruins,whether you are being watched is uncertain, the shadows are playing tricks on your mind, the sound of your footsteps echo around you, your sanity has begun to falter as the dark energies of the temple and your own fears ravage your mind. Despite every instinct you possess screaming for you to turn back, you find what you need, more than enough of the fungi you need. But that wasn't the only thing you found. If there was any doubt as to what was going on here left in your head before, it has been all but eradicated now, scattered across the room there are about twelve bodies as far as you can see, all of them have been disemboweled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou can hear the soft padding of foot steps in the tunnels behind you, and the voice of a troll singing some form of song to himself. Your portals can't teleport you back to Grom'gol, what do you do?</span></div></div>",
