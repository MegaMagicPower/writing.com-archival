Until \"it\" happened. The Avian race was severely discriminated against prior to the incident. They were labelled as the lesser race. Their court systems were very biased against them, someone could simply accuse an avian of a crime, and they would be arrested, even if they weren't involved. The poverty rate of avians was 99%. None of them could hold a job, and if they could even get a job, they wouldn't keep it for more than a week. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing discarded from society, most Avians turned to religion. Praying to their god Faravahar, for salvation. Their prayers fell mostly on deaf ears. But one fatefull night. A little, 12 year old girl named Amarylys, gave sacrifice of blood on their gods makeshift shrine. Which was hidden away from their prersecutive society, deep underground. \"Please Faravahar, give us the power to rise above the hatred and discrimination against our race. Give us the power to, finally, be treated better, if not as well as our discrimiators. Please, do not let this prayer fall upon deaf ears once more. Amine.\" The little girl prayed. Little did she know that her prayers would actually be heard. Though, her prayers would not be answered by way of, the other people just magically wanted to treat them better. Instead they were answered by way of power. Such power that would be feared by all those not wielding it. And in this case, the ones wielding it were the Avians.</span></div></div>",

The leaders of the avian race has demanded reparations for their harsh treatment throughout history. And so a yearly tribute was organized, but not without some. \"Encouragement\" from the avians. At first, the smaller anthros defied them, denying them their reparations and even fighting them. This was swiftly ended by the Avians with their superior size and strength. After that, a large amount of food would be placed on a big, flat rock at the top of a hill and, this year, would be retrieved by the girl that started it all: Amarylys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmarylys wasn't that same little girl anymore though. If the growth of her species would not have happened, she would currently be standing at a slightly taller than average, six foot stature. But, now she stands in a menacing 40 foot tall frame. Those six years were good to her, development wise, gaining some soft bouncy D cup breasts that, at normal size, would have been compared to the size of volleyballs. And a rotund pair of buttocks that could be compared to the size of her breasts. Being a crow, she kept her feathers dark but slightly grey, smooth, and slightly reflective. She keeps the feathers on the top of her head, which would be her hair if she was human, short. She may resent the smaller anthros for their harsh treatment towards her species and herself for the first 12 years of her life, but she does not wish them any harm<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Man, Benji is gonna kill me if I don't get this in time.\" Amarylys was late. She was supposed to get the tribute two hours ago, but she woke up 20 minutes late. Even with her expert flying skills, she wasn't going to make it in time. Eventually, she made it to the tribute site, and there were a lot of tiny anthros waiting for her there. \"Uhh, hi. I was told that there wasn't going to be this many of you.\" Amarylys said nervously. An older looking man came forward. \"We are here to take back what is rightfully ours. And to be free from your tyranny. Quickly, restrain her!\" The older man shouted. Immediately, a catapult from behind a building launched a large boulder and it successfully made contact with Amarylyss cranium. Disoriented, she began to stumble and was tripped by a long rope at her feet. She fell like a mighty oak, and whilst still on the ground, she was being tied to the soil. She lost her consciousness there, still unsure about what they wanted with her. </span></div></div>",

Most females went to involuntary prostitution to make any money at all. They didn't want this life, they were just born into it. One of these women is recently turned 18 year old Amarylys. She knew that she would have to do it, but she never wanted to. What she wanted to do was study to become a mage, enchanchress, or alchemist, but thanks to the fact that avians are outcasted and looked down upon, she could never accomplish those dreams. Well, until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=Bio=<br>\r\nAmarylys was a naturally gifted little girl, being able to read by age 1, it was obvious what she was destined for. But fate had other things in mind. Being born an avian, she was unable to properly nurture her gift with school education. But she did find a rudimentary, and illegal way to learn on her own. She often stole books from the library and the unorganized, forgetful court wizard, teaching herself spells and how to make potions at a young age. Making healing potions and using healing spells on the sick and injured, and making energizing potions for the weak were some of her favorite things to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for her appearance, she has a body that makes her look like she has a lot of money. Having grown natural breasts the size of basketballs and a butt comparable in size really help her get the money she needs for potion ingredients and a roof to sleep under. Standing at a slightly above average height of 6' 1\" help her keep away guys who want to get intimate with out paying the fee. Her feathers are grey but shiny, shiny almost to a point where they are reflective. Her head feathers, or what humans call them, \"Hair\" is kept short and spiked backward. In the end,  Amarylys is just a really smart anthropomorphic crow woman with big dreams. But the question is. How will she achieve those dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Those last two sentences are asking,: how will she grow, and I, the writer, am going to put the answers to that question as choices below.)<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
