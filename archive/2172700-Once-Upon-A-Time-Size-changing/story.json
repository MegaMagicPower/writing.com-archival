People walk by her and into her not caring that she\u2019s there and others not even seeing her. Regina was used to some sort of attention good or bad but not no attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina had recently been kicked out of Storybrooke due to her actions with the curse, while everyone wanted to kill her for what she had done Emma had convinced them to kick her out of town instead. Luckily for Regina, Mr Gold had suggested that she moved to the city and gave her a place to stay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was one week ago and now Regina is bored out of her mind and frustrated as ever. She has no one around her like Henry to love her or someone around her to let things out on. She has never felt more alone in her life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina sighs as she wanders into her apartment, she drops her handbag as she had just gotten back form her boring day job and plonks herself on the couch with a loud sigh. Her apartment was very small, a bedroom, kitchen, lounge and a bathroom. Noting out of the ordinary to a standard apartment. Regina just sits there inn silence like she would do after every day at work just letting everything sink in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina sighs when she hears people yelling down the hallway, this happens every afternoon. A older couple having a screaming match at about the same time every single afternoon. Regina groans as she is sick of it. It\u2019s normally about the same thing, money or how they don\u2019t spend enough time with each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shut up.\u201d Regina groans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heads towards the door and pokes her head out trying to see the couple but they have ducked into their apartment. Regina rolls her eyes, she was going to give them a piece of her mind but since they are out of sight there\u2019s no point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfternoon Ms Mills.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina turns to see a women in her late thirties return home form work, she thinks her name is Andrea. She has seen her family around as well, her teenaged son and her older daughter who she doesn\u2019t quite remember the names of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfternoon.\u201d Regina says before heading back inside her place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina sighs and plonks herself back on the couch. She can\u2019t stand this, she needs something to do. Gripping the side of the couch her feels her body fuming as the couple next door continues to scream and argue. She feels her hands tremble before the couch beneath her vanishes. Regina hits the floor with a hard thud. She looks beside her only to find that she had just shrunk the couch. Reginas lip curl, she thought she had all her powers taken but they must have missed some. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWonderful.\u201d Regina purrs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulls herself up and heads towards the door wanting to give her new powers a try. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Regina heads down the hallway and shrinks the screaming couple next door <br>\r\n2. Regina shrinks Andrea <br>\r\n3. Regina shrinks Andrea and her family <br>\r\n4.

It\u2019s pretty much ready now as I spent all afternoon on it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We would love that.\u201d Andrea smiles. \u201cWe\u2019ll be over in ten minutes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll see you then.\u201d\" Regina smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina heads back to her apartment with a wide grin, she is ready for this and is beyond excited. She's known about the size changing spell for a while but she had never gotten around to using it, until now that is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome in.\u201d Regina calls out hearing a knock at the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina smirks standing to the side a bit getting ready, as soon as the family stepped inside Regina casts her spell blasting them shrinking them almost instantly. Regina laughs as she sees the tiny family squealing at her feet and fives inches tall. She bends down and picks them up with ease. Andrea in one hand, and her two kids in the other. Regina walks over to the table and sets them down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do to us Regina!\u201d Andrea squeaks holding her son and daughter close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI turned you into frogs, what do you think I did?\u201d Regina grins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t hurt us,\u201d Andrea whimpers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would I hurt my pets?\u201d Regina purrs running her finger through Andrea\u2019s long blonde hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe're not your pets!\u201d She squeaks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s either my pets or dog food, it\u2019s up to you.\u201d Regina smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine.\u201d Andrea whimpers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet go of your kids Andrea,\u201d Regina smirks. \u201cYou\u2019re crushing the life out of them. What\u2019s your name sweetheart?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSarah.\u201d She says a little nervously, she has long blonde hair like her mother large breasts and a small ass, green eyes. Regina loves the look of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice to meet you Sarah,\u201d Regina purrs patting her. \u201cYou look older than i expected, I thought you\u2019d be sixteen.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy brother is sixteen mam, I\u2019m twenty\u201d Sarah says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuch manners.\u201d Regina purrs. \u201cI like you already Sarah, so young and beautiful.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Sarah blushes hard and smiles sightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina smiles as her eyes trailed up and down the tiny woman\u2019s form, she knew that it wouldn\u2019t be hard to break her in. Regina licks her lips thinking about the fun she could have with little Sarah as her large breasts would be wonderful to taste. Regina's eyes then dart over to the other teen with his short blonde hair and green eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow who might you be handsome?\u201d Regina asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Kyle.\u201d He blushes and couldn\u2019t help but smile at her compliment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuch a cute smile.\u201d Regina grins. \u201cI hope you are more than just good looks.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop flirting with my son you bitch!\u201d Andrea squeaks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Regina turns her attention to Andrea with a raised eye brow, she can tell that Andrea had already regretted what she had said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn't say anything.\u201d Andrea whimpers backing up slowly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you should be.\u201d Regina smirks. \u201cListen up my pets, you three belong to me now. You will refer to me as My Queen or Goddess, I\u2019m okay with both. Everything I say goes and if you disobey me you will be punished. Understood?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes My Queen.\u201d They say in unison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d Regina purrs. \u201cNow that we have gotten the introduction out of the way how about we play.\u201d </span></div></div>",

There weren't even pictures of her with a man of any kind, with the exception of her father, a man who was small by their standards, coming up only to Regina's shoulder, and a tall bony man Regina explained that while a sly, manipulative bastard he was the closest thing she ever had to a grandfather. So clearly she hadn't been with a man in the correct time frame to have him, and while there were ways around it, Regina never left town, NEVER and there wasn't the necessary equipment in Storybrooke to go the AI way. Leaving adoption as the only other option. Henry didn't feel less loved by this fact, in fact he felt more because it meant Regina chose him to bring into her life, When he finally did speak to him mom about it, Regina held him to her chest and told him what she knew, not the specifics just the important part in her eyes, that his birth mother specifically gave him up so he could have a better life than she could provide, just about able to keep herself going never mind 2 of them at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as the now 10 year old boy leafs through the storybook his teacher gave him (he noticed the characters looked like some of the people in town, but couldn't get the image of his mom, who he could see loved him with all her soul and the Evil Queen to synch up in his head) he wondered about the woman, wanting to meet the woman who made him, and gave him to his mom. Assuming stubbornness was something she passed down to him Henry grins as he begins to plan out his operation, grinning like a madman as he does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>A week later</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma sighs deeply, looking down at the sad little cupcake in front of her, wishing like every year prior that she didn't have to spend it alone. As she blows out the candle she hears a knock at the door. Pulling herself to her feet Emma opens the door and finds a young boy looking up at her, barely catching 'Well there does my future' mumbled under his breath \"What do you want kid?\" she asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're Emma Swan right?\" Henry asks, already knowing the answer as she was the woman from the photo Regina had<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" Emma replies slowly, feeling very confused<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. My name's Henry Mills, I'm your son. You did give a boy up for adoption 10 years ago, right?\" Emma's nod was all he got as her brain processes the new information.. that her son was standing in her doorway \"Excellent. I've wanted to meet you for a long time, and while Mom may not be happy about this, I decided to come see you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma stops leading the boy to her table and turns \"When you say your mom might not be happy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got a bus here from Maine\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Without leaving a note or anything?\" nod \"Fuck, I'm bringing you home, now way am I getting charged with kidnapping an overenthusiastic preteen\" Emma mutters, spinning Henry on his heels before locking her apartment and heading downstairs to her Bug, smiling when Henry said the car felt homey, before giving navigational control over to her kid so he could get them to this mysterious 'Storybrooke' she'd never heard off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time they got there it was nightfall and Henry was having her go through desolate wilderness followed by a large field, only the promise that his house was on the other side made her drive through it. Due to the dark Emma couldn't see anything resembling a house, making her worry if not for Henry's content smile, which also told her something was up and he had neglected to tell his other parent what it was also.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Henry, where the Hell are we?\" she finally asks as she pulls to a stop, a little annoyed by his smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Home\" he grins and pressed a fob from his jacket, at which point it felt like he's turned on the sun, the blond temporality blinded as Henry got out of the car and began waving skyward, the rumbling making her very very worried, though hopefully his happy cry of \"MOM\" meant someone could explain. He vision was just beginning to clear up when he fell against her as he jumped back into the bug, which shook like it was caught in a hurricane stopping online with something that filled Emma with equal parts fear and arousal: the serious face of a very sexy giantess, who was currently holding the bug in her hand<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I presume this is a story which will need to be explained inside?\" she asks rhetorically, turning on her heel and entering what Emma now sees is a giant mansion, bringing the car into the kitchen before setting it down, as Regina sits he blond gets a nice view of a canyon she could lose the bug in, never mind herself, Regina's breasts barely held in by her sleep shirt. \"So, what did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found my birth mom, and she brought us back to Storybrooke\" Henry chirps happily, while Regina internally grimaces, just because this was always going to happen doesn't mean she had to like it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting, and you are ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emma Swan Miss Mills, sorry but Henry didn't give a first name\" Emma stumbles over her words in a panic as she exits the car, Regina smiles when she see's the blond looks nice in the red dress, very sexy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regina darling, now if only I knew why our son brought you all the way here\" she sighs and was surprised by the answer<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) 'I wanted you to not be alone anymore' Regina was surprised by the answer, as was Emma, but the blond reminded Henry (in physical appearance as well as the fire in her eyes) of Regina's friend Malory, who would flirt, tease and kiss her neck playfully before her wives drag her away to help them with the twins. Regina's smile after those interactions are almost the same as the smiles she gives him, and he wants to see her smile like that more often.<br>\r\n2) 'You said how you'd kill for an actual helper my size, well here she is' Given Emma's lack of stable work Regina gets her to agree to be her assistant, finding some ways to amuse herself as well as use Emma's size to her advantage in the workplace<br>\r\n3) 'She's the saviour, and I want you to get a happy ending' Henry believes some of the book, there are too many similarities not to be true, but he doesn't think Regina is the Evil Queen, or at least not any more. Both Emma and Regina are unsure how to understand or process the answer, but they sure can try.</span></div></div>",

Emma didn't know, but at least she had time to think about everything that changed her life these last two years ( this story will be around season 2 or 3, can't say exactly). What a crazy situation anyway, Emma would never have expected to find out that her parents were the characters of some fairy tales, which meant that magic does exist, etc. It was too much for her at first to accept, but now she was happier than she ever was. And this was thanks to her son, Henry who came to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry was the personn she cared the most in this world, and she had to be honest : even thought she accepted to share him with Regina, a part of her wanted Henry for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is why today she had a talk with Jefferson, the only one beside Henry that tried to convince her that everything was true (somehow he tried, thought this was not his focus)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Sooo are you really going back to Wonderland ? \" She asked as Jefferson was preparing his hat for the trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" As soon as my daughter comes back from the school, yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I'm surprised, i mean...she has friends now at Storybrook, is she ok for coming with you ? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" She's the one who asked me to go back. You know, it's not easy to have the memories of two lives. A part of her will always stick to Wonderland, and another part to Storybrook. It was her choice, i will be happy anywhere with her anyway \" Jefferson replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I see...have a nice trip then \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Emma...Wait. I got something for you. I know it's not really my business, but as i hate Regina, i want to help somehow so you can get Henry with you everytime. \" Jefferson said while pulling out something from his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" A mushroom ?\" The blonde asked, uncertain to understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" it's a shrinking one. It's not supposed to be permanent in my world, but as the magic works weirdly in there, i made some experimentations and it seemed that it is...permanent for this town. Make a good use of it \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma took the mushroom and left Jefferson's room, lost in her thoughts. What did he mean ? He wanted her to shrink Regina so she can get Henry ? Or maybe...Emma started to think that the two possibilities were insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" this is my son, not hers \" a voice in her head said. But Regina was doing her best to be a better personn, Emma didn't want to be the evil one by shrinking her. On the other hand, there's nothing evil by shrinking Henry and hide him from Regina...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Emma went back home, Henry was there.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Hey Mom \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Hey Kid.

Giving him it would require explanation, and not only would putting mushroom into his food be weird but she couldn't cook anything that involved mushrooms well enough to feed Henry without it looking suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then an interesting idea formed in her head, making herself and Henry some sandwiches and cocoa, she takes the mushroom out of her pocket and drops it in, the liquid bubbles and sparkles before returning to normal.

Henry knows Regina is a sorceress, and suspects her to be the Evil Queen. Emma has magic, she's just never been good at controlling it]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry rolls the vial of potion around in his pocket as he contemplates the plan: he knew his mom HAD to be the Evil Queen, it made sense with everything he learnt in the Book. So he wanted to get the Hell out of that house as quickly as possible. the problem was Regina was the strongest independent mage in town, what with the fairies being limited by their dust and Gold being... well Gold as well as swearing off the magic while trying to court his beloved Lacey. This meant Henry had to get creative if he was going to get around his mother's attempts to find and retrieve him, which was where the potion came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry had found out while he was growing up that he had a relatively small magical core, he guessed his father was magically weak as even Regina admits Emma has a large, though wild and chaotic core. This meant he would never be as powerful as his Mom or Ma, but he could still do magic and more importantly brew potions. He found a shrining potion in Regina's library, it was a fairly minor bit of magic (Regina having used variations of it many times in the other world for carnal reasons, both on others and herself) so Henry was able to take the book and then brew a small amount of the potion without Regina becoming aware of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich lead to right now: him once more ditching school and heading to the sheriff's office, where his ma works alone, but given how quiet Storybrooke was he found it rather expected. He had already decided the best place to be when an angry Regina was looking for him was with the saviour, and to save his legs he decided to wait until he was actually in the building to shrink himself to 3 inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world at this size was mindboggling to say the least, but it was surreal like being in a movie until he reaches Emma, the woman frowning in a way that told Henry she had a lot of paperwork to do and hand over to Regina. At his current size she was like some kind of divine being, every bit the saviour he knew her to be, now if only she could see herself from the view he currently did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Emma spots him out the corner of her eye, and after taking a moment to calm herself, picks him up and asks what the Hell he was doing/thinking<br>\r\n2) Emma see's Henry, but not long after hears the clicking of Regina's heels and has to quickly hide her shrunken son from his other mother<br>\r\n3) Emma is hard at work so doesn't notice him, meaning Henry has to get her attention himself. He starts at her feet and begins to climb, as her body was a safer option than the basically vertical legs of the chair</span></div></div>",

Given how shitty her life had been right until she crossed the town line into Storybrooke it was no wonder she practically bloomed at any kind of praise or positive comments directed at her. At some point it had actually become something that she got off on and still did, Regina telling her she wasn't fucking up as a parent actually gave her a warm tingle between her legs, much to her embarrassment. As for the other, well it seemed to stem or at least pair very well within her brain the desire to have little insignificant beings worship her as a goddess after so long being treated like nothing. Their adulation and adoration feeding her ego and setting a fire in her core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond swallows before lifting Henry to her face\"You sure about this kiddo, if we play this game I'm not going to treat you like my son, you'll be a little bug before a goddess\" she explains,  a part of her hoping he'll see sense and back out, but a darker part wants him to know exactly what he's getting into while offering to be her new sex toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry grins \"Don't worry Ma, I know you won't hurt me\" he says and Emma wonders if he knows what spell he used, as she was pretty sure the one on him could keep him alive even if the spike of one of Regina's heels came crashing down on him. This gave her a possibly very bad idea of playfully crushing him, not to harm but to remind him she had all the power and that he should do as he was commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma sighs \"Okay Henry, but don't try make me stop till I'm done with you, because I won't and will probably just get mad at you\" she explains before brining Henry to her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Feet, symbolism was something Emma always found fun, and putting the little person somewhere they could be crushed and feel extra small like under her feet give her a rush of pleasure. Feeling Henry under there or between her toes should make the day go by much faster and be a lot more fun.<br>\r\n2) Breasts, while not as big or impressive as Regina's gravity defying melons Emma felt she had a reasonably big and sexy bosom, which she intends to make Henry prove as he rubs himself against them and tell her how lovely they are<br>\r\n3) Ass, by far her best feature in her own opinion, even catching Regina and Ruby staring on occasion, she wants her ass to be worshiped like art, and Henry will be the one to do it</span></div></div>",

Then there was her breasts, which were about the size of bowling balls and as Emma squeezed the heavy orbs, began to gently leak milk form her engorged nipples, dapping a little she licked her finger and found it to be quite sweet and rather delicious. Lastly there was her belly, not as much of a transformation as her assets, but she had gone from a smooth, flat stomach to a noticeably potbelly, which bounced almost as much as her ass and tits did when she moved around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would probably still be playing with her new belly fat when she felt a wiggle within her planetary rear, reaching back Emma roots around before finally finding Henry and pulls him out so she could see him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!

Regina felt Henry plop into her stomach and she patted it, secretly enjoying the feeling of Henry in her stomach. Thankfully the potion she gave Henry also made him invincible. However the reason she kept Henry in her stomach was because the only way people would  discover Henry would be if they managed to cut her open, or make her throw up. And if anyone discovered him there would be problems, Cora reversing the potion and then killing Henry. For Snow and Charming they would get all hissy thinking that shrinking Henry would be <i>pointless and selfish</i>.

The rumble and shaking that happen a little later at least make him feel like it may have been worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma sighs as she takes the package from the doorman, at least he wasn't a dick like the last place, nor one trying to get into her pants. Shifting the box under her arm as she opens her door, Emma wonders what was in the box, she hadn't ordered anything recently and gifts from clients are usually just a little extra money, never actual items. Still she wasn't going to look a gift horse in the mouth so she finds a sharp object and opens the box, then nearly falls when she see's the content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, you're Emma Swan right?\" a male minizora, 10 at the oldest but their size makes specific ages difficult for most people, asks from the box as he stands up \"I'm Henry, I'm you're son\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma hyperventilates, this shit shouldn't be happening \"That's not possible\" she wheezes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry raises an eyebrow in a way Emma will later note is quite similar to Regina \"Really? You didn't have a minizora 10 years ago? I'm not exactly common place, it's what, 1%? 0.1%? I could have possibly tracked you down with that fact alone\" at this Emma cringes, not just at the truth, but also that it could have been rather easy for either of them to find the other, but the blond hadn't wanted to be tempted with seeking him out, content with believing he was in abetter place than with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma sighs \"So kid, you mailed yourself to me, what do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For you to come home with me\" the blunt answer threw her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! No, I mean I have to bring you back but after that I'm done, your parents will kill me when we get there\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"no parents, just mom, she had a guy in her life, was kind of fun to be around, but he died. You need to come home with me to Storybrooke, it's the only way to set everything right\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma's eyebrows raise significantly, damn this kid really believes she could do that \"If I say yes will you tell me where I'm going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry nods happily \"Storybrooke, Maine\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma chuckles \"Of course it is. You mind if I get changed first or are you in a hurry to get grounded for life?\" she asks and only then does Henry notice the red dress that shows off his birth mother's well sized breasts well and provide ample cleavage to stare at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can change if you want, not like I could stop you even if I wanted to\" he responds. Emma smiles and disappears out of view, promising to be just a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing moved from Emma's apartment to her bug was like being on a ship, his vessel being rocked as it swayed with Emma's hips, the blond having changed into jeans, white shirt and a leather jacket. The bug itself gave a low rumble as they made the journey to Maine, Emma peering down occasionally to see he was flicking through a minizora scaled book as they drove, a small smile on her face as it meant her kid was in a well off family, most minizora items being rather expensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was when they arrived in Storybrooke (and Emma's fists tightened as she felt something akin to a jolt pass through her body upon entering) that Henry started to become difficult, not giving her any useful information. It was only coming across Eleanor Lamb and Ming ne Won (Storybrooke's versions of Aurora and Mulan) did she get any useful information about where the mayor lived. Smiling politely Emma drove off letting the 2 continue their walk, or date given the way the smaller brunette nuzzled the Chinese woman's neck.7<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the moment arrived, Emma looking at quiet, foreboding mansion in front of her, then down to Henry who looked just as nervous as she did. Swallowing her doubts, Emma gently lifts Henry's box and steps out of the Bug, walking confidently over to the door and knocking hard. Lights went on upstairs and she could hear soft padding as it got closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the door opened Emma nearly swallowed her tongue: the women in the doorway was a beautiful, possibly Latina woman, a little smaller in height but much larger in bust than Emma, made more apparent by the hastily put on robe which still caught Emma's attention<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" the woman calls tiredly, looking understandably annoyed at being woken up and ogled by a complete stranger<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma coughs \"Right sorry. I think something of yours arrived on my doorstep\" she says passively<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina raises an eyebrow \"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma nods \"Yeah, minizora boy, about 10, says he's my son but claims this is his residence. Ring any bells?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina blinks \"You're Henry's birth mother?\" she squeaks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and I'm here to bring him home\" she beams as she opens the box and Henry waves up at her, at least having the decency to look guilty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Regina do now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1 I would like to evolve into SwanQueen, but friends and co parents will do I guess.<br>\r\nOption 2, can unfold closer to canon in feel, sniping and arguments mostly about Henry</span></div></div>",

Didn't help she'd had him with her all night (Henry has a room of his own to do things, but due to Regina's possessive and over-protective nature he's spent every night and when he was smaller most of his days too, in Regina's cleavage or between her cheeks, both of which were large enough to keep him safe and warm) so stopping Ruby from touching him would hurt the wolf when she hadn't done anything.... unless<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cuddles are fine, as long as you had nothing to do with Henry mailing himself to his birthmother\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby gasps \"What, I'd never put Henry's life in danger like that, you know how dangerous something like that could be for a minizora as well as how protective I am of the little guy\" Ruby defends avidly, subconsciously viewing Henry as part of her pack, even if her curse side couldn't understand it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina smiles, she was nearly certain but the girl's defence helped a LOT, as well as soothed her nerves and quieted her paranoid side \"Great, then I see no problems with cuddling Henry. By the way I never say this enough, but thanks for giving up days like today to look after Henry\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby grins and waves the mother off \"It's fine, I don't really have much to do outside of Granny's during the day and you're back way too early most nights to stop me going our partying in the evening.

See you both later\" she allows Ruby to enter before leaving for work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby watches Regina's Bentley drive off with a grin then peered down t Henry \"Hey daredevil, what's this I hear about you mailing yourself to find your birth mother, do you know how worried your mother must have been, how bad we'd both feel if you'd gotten hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry frowns and looks away, clearly not having considered the consequences: sure he didn't really care all that much about the Evil Queen's performance at pretending to love him but he really liked Ruby, making her sad wasn't something he would have wanted to do to her \"Sorry Ruby\" he mumbles, but the woman can tell he means it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all I want buddy\" she coos, nuzzling him against her cheek \"Now, don't tell your mother, but I think we can get around the no TV rule, cause I can watch my nature documentaries while cuddling you so you're technically not watching it\" she grins and Henry chuckles always finding Ruby's little loopholes funny: No sweets before bed, then we'll just have sweets in your bed.  No more video games today, then he can teach her how to play one (Ruby still sucks at FPS games but is really good as RPG's). Even if Regina wasn't evil he wouldn't tell her, Ruby was too much fun to be around to risk losing that, especially over something which benefits him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, sounds like fun\" Henry grins and Ruby stalks into the kitchen to find them some juice, before putting Henry into his own comfortable seating positon (aka her cleavage) then switches on a programme about the evolution of wolves, her favourite animal,  Henry's too given the amount of time spent with Ruby as well as watching these programmes with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Henry frowns as he watches the pot bubble, he'd been feeling like the weak link in the chain recently, always being a target of whatever the villain of the week was because he was basically a normal human without magic or any kind of combat experience like his moms or grandparents (who are younger than both of his parents... his family tree was all kinds of messed up), and given he didn't have the time to learn to use a sword or bow at the level where he could be able to hold his own or help them, so he went for the next best thing: learning magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I'm sure you're wondering why he's doing this by himself and not with one of his magically powerful relatives, or even said relatives friends, who also have magic, well the thing is that both of his moms had made their thoughts on him learning magic quite clear, 13 is not a good time to be dabbling in sorcery (Emma's words, Regina was more eloquent and wordy) and while he knows his grandfather would be happy to teach him.... he wasn't as dumb as people think and knows Rumple wasn't exactly a trustworthy guy, plus he doesn't want to make things more difficult between him and the rest of Henry's family, both sides only tolerating each other for his sake. All that was left were the fairies, who besides Astrid creep him the Hell out, or some former villains like Ingrid and Maleficent, both who are good friends with one of his moms each and would tell them the moment he left after asking, if only to get permission to do so rather than actually trying to screw him over/ get him in trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo instead Henry was going it alone, having appropriated several of his mom and grandfather's spell and potion books (he had a feeling Gold knows what he's doing, given the shelf looked to be unguarded by any means) and was trying his hand at something simple and hopefully non-destructive (hence why he isn't going for his mom's signature Fireball), a shrinking spell. He even had a target set up, for fun it was an apple he'd drawn a swan on, symbolising the goal of his attempt, to join the fight with his moms and keep the town safe. Once the pot stopped and had turned a pale blue, Henry dips the wand (he'd also borrowed it from Gold) in the solution and waves it at the apple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately Henry hasn't quite perfected the whole aiming thing, as the magical pulse misses the target, hits a mirror and blasts him right in the face, knocking him onto the ground as well as out. When he comes to Henry groans as he rubs the bruise on his head, his eyes still blurry for a couple of minutes, which when they cleared up he realised just how badly he'd screwed up. He was on the ground, with the wand about a foot away from him... and being several times his current size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Fuck!' Henry thinks, he'd messed up big time, and when his mom finds out he was going to be in so much trouble. Well all he has to do was figure out a way to deal with this for a little...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Henry, are you there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry gapes as the door opens and his best friend and secret crush Ivy Belfrey enters his room calling his name. He scrambles away as she just barely avoids stepping on him, then blushes deep red as he can see her panties under her skirt due to her standing right over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Henry?\" Ivy calls, the 15 year old frowns as she wonders where her friend had gone, she'd tested out the tracking charms and this was where it told her to go, did he step out to the bathroom? Did he get kidnapped again? This was weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ivy!\" the brunette blinks, there was a squeak of something but she wasn't sure what it was \"Look down, I'm right here\" Henry shouts, standing and waving his arms in the hope she could here him, and luckily she did<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the?\" Ivy thinks aloud before gasping \"Henry!\" she shrieks, picking up her friend and pulling him into a hug, Henry's blush only deepening from getting crushed between the young mage's expanding bosom. Finally she releases her hold as she sits down on his bed, letting him sit in her hand \"What happened to you, was it a villain attack?\" she asks, looking annoyed someone would try hurt her best... okay he was her only friend but that meant there was no contest for him to be her best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry shakes his head \"No, this was me trying to learn magic, and it backfiring rather spectacularly\" he sighs \"I'm never going to get this right\" he grumbles, then tenses when he feels Ivy rub his back with a finger<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Hen, it'll work out, I've only just started to get my magic to work, Ana thinks it's so cool and Jas, well she just says I'm even more of a freak than before\" she sighs and it's Henry's turn to be annoyed \"Point is, maybe you're just too young to fully access your magic, or this is a sign that self study doesn't work when magic is involved, though I can't say I dislike the results as you are kind of adorable\" she coos, then kisses him into her palm, giggling when she moves back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I-I-I-Ivy\" Henry stutters as he stands up again, his face now pink from her lip balm as well as his blush \"Seriously?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep\" she laughs \"You are just too cute, I want to cuddle you or eat you right up\" she grins at his expression then hugs him again \"But don't worry Hen, Ivy's gonna keep you safe and sound\" and despite how embarrassed her feels the boy actually does feel safe being pressed between her thin arms and soft chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Ivy decides to have some fun and keep Henry like this for a while, hen figure out how to fix this issue<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) She goes to her own magic teacher (Anyone who isn't Gold, Regina, Emma or the Blue fairy that is a powerful mage) in the hopes they can help them with Henry's little problem<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) This is a serious problem, so Ivy brings Henry straight to him moms, luckily they were both in the same place, so that they can fix her favourite person, hopefully avoiding a punishment that stops her from seeing him though.</span></div></div>",

Even after months she eyes still light up when she see's Lily, and the younger dragon is pretty sure her own do the same as the blond adjusts herself to greet her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Lilith, you and Ms Swan have a productive lesson?\" she asks, while she may hate the girl's parents Emma has managed to get under her armour and she actually liked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could say that. I found my mate!\" Lily blurts out happily, pulling out Emma and nuzzling her against her cheek<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMal's smile nearly reaches her ears \"That's wonderful news, finding your mate when so young, maybe the universe is apologising for all the pain you both had to work through. She's also adorable\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maleficent please help Lily refuses to change me back to normal\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon snorts \"And why would she, at your current size you're much easier to protect and to love, as a veteran of those kinds of spells I know you'll have a lot of fun, but please try avoid making me a grandmother just yet, still getting used to being a mother\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily chuckles \"No promises, though while on the subject, will I ever be meeting my other parent or am I going to need to send Emma and Regina on another roadtrip\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMal twitches and crosses her legs \"You'll meet them soon enough, now run along and enjoy yourself\" Lily sticks out her tongue and rushes off up the stairs, missing a small voice in her haste<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMal on the other hand didn't, pushing up the robes she pets the back of the nude brunette currently straddling her throbbing dragondick, rubbing her needy cunt across it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was our Lilith, wasn't it?\" she asks, smiling up at her dragon<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes my dear, that was our eldest\" Mal purrs, pushing the back of Aurora's head to get her to go back to her worship \"Now we just need to explain the twins to her\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp in Lily's room the brunette flops onto her bed and pulls Emma out, kissing her several times on the face and chest \"Oh darling, we're going to have so much fun soon enough, but for now I just want your scent to fill my lungs and you get adjusted to your new size\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New size, Lily this isn't just a joke anymore you need to put me back\" Emma yells angrily, until Lily's grip became painful<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't get to make demands, you're my mate, and at your current size mine to do with as I will. You're lucky all I want right now is a cuddle or I'd have broken you in by now\" She pulls her close to her chest, the heat coming from the young dragon almost making Emma drozy but she tried to hold herself awake \"I won't leave you Emma and you won't leave me, not if I can help it\" Lily whispers and while still a little annoyed to be seen as something that is Lily's like a belt or a ring the feeling of belonging as well as knowledge that Lily is genuine, her felings mat have even enhanced by this mating scent. Still, she did have a long week at the station, so maybe a nap would do some good, maybe Lily could even calm down by then and let her be grown back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily smiles as she hears Emma's heartbeat slow, her mate was calm, she was even drozy, and that actually made her feel better about herself even if she was still new to these instincts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on....</span></div></div>",

We're taking about the White Family, who's kingdom basically banned all magic that wasn't used by the fairies, who all kissed Snow's ass because the Blue Fairy practically lived up there? No, they'll never understand, because they won't even try, they'll pretend, hope this magic thing is just a phase but it'll break one day.

A godsend was the abundance of much more stable and almost solid magical energy in the vicinity, which Emma's magic hungrily tried to absorb and assimilate. The problem came from a slight issue, Ingrid had a fully formed Ice Core, much stronger and stable than Elsa's stunted Ice Core or Emma's Fire Core, so when Emma's magic tried to use Ingrid's magic to pull itself together (The woman magic allowing it as Emma not blowing things up in the nearby area was good for both of them) the chill and mixmatch of elements, meant that Emma's core chilled and condenses, unexpectedly as her magical core shrank, so did she.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma's mind was a little preoccupied, which was why she didn't notice her diminishing size until she was looking at the edge of the desk she'd been previously leaning on, and when looking up saw Ingrid looking down at her with a mix of surprise and amusement as the girl continues to slip away until she was only a few inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Ingrid seizes the chance to have Emma be hers once more, stealing her away and disappearing<br>\r\n2) The Snow Queen uses the confusion to poof and Emma's left alone and confused... for about a minute before the other heroes show up and find her in her current form<br>\r\n2) Ingrid escapes and a fearful Emma hides away until she can get a grip on her situation</span></div></div>",

You know I have mild paronoia Henry, so it problably won't surprise you I have something that can reverse this, in the safe in my bedroom, just behind the dresser\" she explains \"Since our current condition will make getting there and retreiving the vial diffucult, can you help us?\" she asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's Henry's decision?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) With his pure heart Henry is happy to help fix his moms, though whether the potion will be enough for both, or even still be intact and undamaged when he gets it open, remains to be seen<br>\r\n2) Tired of his mom's fighting, which was clearly the cause of their current situation, Henry decides to have them sort out there differences in whatever manner works, before even thinking about bringing them to Regina's vault<br>\r\n3) Henry's tired of both of them not listening, and ignoring him, so decides while they're small and helpless to take control, maybe play with his new toys for a while, show them how it feels to be in his position</span></div></div>",

They know that Henry loves them and would do anything for them but being the size they are doesn't sit well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry enters his bed room and slams the door shut behind them, the slam of the door sends shivers up the tiny girl's spins.

But that was also his minor problem with his less innocent thoughts, as Regina had been his mom, as far as he knew completely as far back as he could remember which made what he wanted to do a little difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly enough it was easier for him to imagine Emma, despite her being his biological mother, due to her being absent for almost his entire life. The red dress, which drew attention to her fine rear and milky breasts with a deep cleavage were just a little too tempting, so he took it, picking up the blond he brings her up to eye level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you're very sexy Ma\" Henry muses, gently caressing the blond in his hands, paying a little more attention to her curves than the blond would have liked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks a lot kid....ah\" Emma squeaks as one of his fingers slide under her dress and along her bare ass, before he rips the dress right off her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Henry Daniel Mills, what do you think you're doing?\" Regina shouts, but the giant ignores her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And even better without the dress\" he laughs before bringing her closer, inhaling her scent as he nuzzles her plump, bra-less tits with his nose. He then smirks as he flips her over in his grip \"Damn, how can such a small girl have such a big ass Ma?\" he teases as he pinches it rather hard, Emma biting her lip to suppress a moan, which worked until he gave it a flick, the blond grunting and panting as he does \"I think I have a few ideas on how this family is going to work going forward\" he purrs, sending shivers down both their spines<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) He sets Emma back down on the desk, and picks up Regina, telling her she can either strip herself out of the pantsuit, or he will do it for her<br>\r\n2) Henry is the one who undresses next, showing his mom's their little boy is All Grown Up 'where it counts' ;)<br>\r\n3) Henry sets the naked Emma on the table and calls his best friend Ivy, thinking she'd also like to play with his 2 toy moms</span></div></div>",

Regina takes a deep breath, she feels nervous to strip in front of the two as the giant eyes are watching her as well as Emma's. She takes a deep breath and slides her shoulder straps down and slowly removes her dressing sliding it down nervously. Regina feels super uncomfortable doing this, she has never shown her body off to a woman before and revealing herself to her own son just makes it more uncomfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit.\" Emma gasps and quickly covers her mouth as Regina removes everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Henry asks confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing.\" Emma blushes hard looking away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Share with the class Emma.\" Henry smiles. \"Don't make me punish you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just that...\" Emma stutters turning redder and redder. \"Regina just looks incredible that's all, her curves and body shape is something I'd kill to have.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is very beautiful isn't she?\" Henry smiles running a finger down Regina's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina turns bright red and gasps as Henry's smooth giant finger glides over her newly naked body, she couldn't help but smile a bit at Emma's comment.

Not that it would matter as the door opens and Mary Margeret's class pile in, Emma freezing when the chair behind their desk moves and someone sits down, dropping onto her back like Regina just before the desk is opened and blinded by the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho's the student?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Donal, a quiet but smart boy with minimal social skills, who MM thought the dolls could help him talk to girls<br>\r\n2) Katie, a bubbly girl who the dolls are a reward for how much her work has improved<br>\r\n3) Joseph, troublemaker, MM hopes the dolls will distract or give him an outlet that doesn't involve disrupting class and other's work</span></div></div>",

It's Donal, one of Mary Margret's quiet students.He is thirteen years old with short brown hair and brown eyes. He would hardly speak in class and would occasionally put his hand up to answer questions. He spent most of his days alone writing stories and drawing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks in his desk in awe with his brown eyes looking over the dolls placed in his desk. He then smiles widely as he sees how real they look, he couldn't help but think how beautiful and real the dolls look. Emma and Regina do their best to remain still hoping that the young teen would only think they are only dolls and nothing more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you could use some friends.\" Mary Margaret whispers as she kneels down behind Donal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing,\" Donal smiles without taking his eyes off them. \"Thank you so much Ms Blanchard. I love them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem sweetheart.\" Mary Margaret smiles and ruffles his hair. \"Just promise me you'll take good care of them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will,\" He smiles. \"Thank you,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Margret giggles and stands up putting her attention on the rest of the class trying to start the day. Donal gives both the dolls a bit of a pat on the head before closing his desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is insane!\" Emma squeaks. \"I can't believe she gave us to a child.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just relax Swan, I'm sure we'll be fine.\" Regina sighs sitting down on a large book getting comfortable. \"He doesn't look like he has plans to kill us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh he probably has plans for more than that.\" Emma says shaking a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you should be grateful.\" Regina smirks. \"It's not every day you get a cutie like that wanting to fuck you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't funny Regina!\" Emma grins trying not to make too much noise. \"And how can you say he's cute?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you want me to tell him that you think he's ugly then?\" Regina smirks. \"I'm sure he'd love to hear that. That'll be enough to get on his bad side.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you so calm during all this?\" Emma asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, I've been through worse,\" Regina sighs. \"Being in the hands of this teen is probably in the middle of scary shit I've had to deal with. It's right above dealing with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma rolls her eyes and groans, she plonks herself on a book on the other side of the desk. No matter what she says to Regina she's only going to get a smart ass comment back. Emma sits there in silence just waiting for all of this to be over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina sighs and gets comfortable, while she did admit that she was hating the idea of being someone's doll, seeing the person she is with now is making her slowly come around. While she still wants to see this young teen have his way with Emma she wouldn't mind being friends or more with him. From what she had seen form him looked very innocent and she has seen that look in his eyes before. She can tell that this kid had no friends and would love to have someone like them around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina giggles softly to herself teasing to herself that she might have a crush on her new captor. How could she not, she thinks she looks cute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Donal takes his new toys out at lunch to get aquatinted with <br>\r\n2) Donal takes his new toys home <br>\r\n3) Donal waits till after school to take his new toys out as he wants to thank Ms Blanchard before heading home <br>\r\n4) Donal takes his new toys to his secret spot <br>\r\n5) The desk opens up and it's not Donal </span></div></div>",

Once the school-day ended Donal slipped the dolls into his bag and began to leave, Regina allowing herself to look smug as at least as far as she could tell he was much gentler in his handling than he was of Miss Swan, though the journey home could have been smoother, the duo getting bounced around quite a bit during the walk, Regina even getting smacked in the face by Emma's overly plump ass along the way. She really hoped this wasn't going to be a regular thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally they arrived, Donal hugging him mom before heading into his room which had several anime and video game characters on the walls and shelves, the boy even jokingly waving hello to the Tali figurine on his bedside table. \"Hey Tals, I know you're best girl, but Miss Blanchard gave me some new ones so play nice ok?\" he winks at the purple girl before setting his bag down on his bed and opening it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled out the blond first, her hair in ringlets and wearing a tight red dress which drew emphasis to her firm bust,  including a slit for deep cleavage, wide hips and large rear, all in all she was rather nice and he could tell she was well made, her assets even having a rubber or even doughy kind of feel to them, very pinch/squeezable at least in his opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting her down her removes the other doll: a Latina looking brunette with shoulder length hair, she was dressed more 'seriously' than her companion, in a kind of pantsuit type outfit, though it did little to hide her assets were even larger than the blond's her chest resembling over-sized grapes, though her ass was tamer but still pleasantly plump, all in all she was quite the exotic and sexy thing. He bit his lip, trying to push down the budding arousal at the little sexy toy in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You 2, such a lovely pair, Ms Blanchard didn't tell me what you were called so I guess I'll have to think up some of my own\" he thinks aloud, Regina still held in his firm but gentle grip<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or you could just use our real names\" Regina suggests, deciding to take the risk and drop the act, gently caressing his thumb which was held against her stomach and smiling up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does this go?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) the young teen panics, dropping Regina onto the bed and nearly bouncing off the wall in fear and shock<br>\r\n2) upon realization the dolls were people, his default response to being around pretty girls (or in this case, sexy women) kicked in, blushing and stuttering in a way Regina and even Emma find kind of cute<br>\r\n3) His eyes widen and his curiosity outweighs everything else, examining, caressing and even groping Regina as he tries to understand how she could exist.</span></div></div>",

I was asked to drop off some of Granny's pies.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina smirks as hears the familiar voice, it's Ruby. If anyone was going to mess with the tiny Emma she would be the perfect choice. Regina smirks and tires to quietly sneak off leaving Emma alone to be caught. Regina doesn't get the chance to as Ruby walks inside the house and Regina walks straight into her shoe getting kicked hard with the point. Regina goes flying and collides with Emma. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off me.\" Emma groans shoving Regina off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina wants to snark back but she's too winded, Ruby had knocked the wind and energy out of her. Regina and Emma sit on the ground too petrified to move as they just watch the giant woman enter. They do their best to remain still as possible, hoping that Ruby will just pass right by and leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby smiles looking around trying to call out Regina and Henry's names but gets no response. She sighs and sets the basket of goodies on the counter. She's had a long day and is ready to call it quits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we have here?\" Ruby smirks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squats down and reches for what looks to be two little barbie dolls laying on the ground, she curls her slender fingers around them and stands back up brining them up to her face. Her fingers gently hold the five inch dolls in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina and Emma whimper as they are able to see every inch of the giant girl's face. They do their best not to move or get her attention, while they do want and need help they don't exactly want it from Ruby. They do think she is a sweet girl but she is still young as can be very flirty towards other, with them being the size they are, they know the last thing Ruby would want to do with them is help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such cute little things.\" Ruby purrs rubbing their chests with her thumbs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two little women both bite their bottom lips resisting the urge to moan. Ruby's rub is very soft and sensual, almost feeling perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are so life like.\" Ruby gasps. \"I wonder why Regina and Henry would just leave them out on the floor like this, they must have cost quite a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina and Emma both let out a whimper, they know what's about to come next wont be exactly pleasant for helpful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Its a full moon tonight and Ruby needs some special toys to help her out with that. <br>\r\n2) Ruby's enhanced senses smell and notice something, she gives them a good sniff and sees that they are Regina and Emma<br>\r\n3) Ruby smiles and puts them in her pocket, she has to go back to work so she'll play with them later<br>\r\n4) Ruby leaves the house with them but gives the dolls away to someone who looks like they need them more than she does <br>\r\n5) Ruby sets them back down and leaves </span></div></div>",

She shivers as she feels the toys move with her body, but optimistic about how this will all turn out. She wasn't sure why she got so horny during the full moon, but this time things should be easier, now she has 2 sexy little dolls to help work out her lust on. Exiting the house Ruby makes her way home with an extra swing in her step, happy to feel her tits and ass bounce the dolls around with her, as well as uping the arousal already beginning to flow within her. She was glad she hadn't put either of them in the front of her panties, otherwise they'd be all wet and sticky already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking her way back home Ruby quickly locks the door to her room and sits down onto her bed, Regina getting very uncomfortable with the added weight pressing down on her due to this. Ruby with a giddy pant quickly removes her shirt and bra, then retrieves Emma from her deep, sweaty cleavage, where she grins at the beauty of her little sex toy \"Ready for the night of your life cutie?\" Ruby purrs, ripping the dress off Emma and bites her lip when she properly see's the blond's jiggly tits, plump ass and wet, dripping pussy because I sure am\" she laughs<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Ruby pushes Emma into her hungry pussy, the wolf roughly fucking her like a cheap dildo, at least at the start<br>\r\n2) With how close she is, the last bounce on the bed having Regina practically breathing on it, Ruby decides to start tonight with anal, forcing Regina inside her head first, while saving Emma for later<br>\r\n3) Her hormones beginning to idle her brain, Ruby decides to eat her girls out, so they'd be grateful enough when she was done, to put more effort into their new job</span></div></div>",

She didn't need anyone to tell her that her crush was messing with her head, she'd given up fighting that and was now just enjoying her future lover's prescience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one problem though: Phillip. As long as he was in the picture Aurora couldn't be hers, and she actually liked the man so she couldn't just kill him, plus he was a prince so it's not like he could just disappear...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then an idea formed in her mind, she didn't need Philip to disappear, she just needed Aurora to disappear with her when she leaves, then they can be together forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic had never been a strong suit of Mulan's, combat was but she had learnt a few things on her travels, one of which was a shrinking potion from a sexy blond with a dragon staff a few years back. Luckily it just took a few ingredients readily available in the region, as well as something magically potent to activate the potion, such as some of Mushu's scales for magical emergencies such as these (That was the actual reason he made her take his shed scales, rather than simply burn or discard them)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily the potion was more a run off from stewing the ingredients, rather than having it bubbling away in a cauldron, so Mulan was able to hide her trickery under the guise of making the other woman tea, the heart flutter inducing smile Aurora flashes her only solidifying her resolve to have the girl as hers and hers alone, in this case in a cute doll size form which she will protect and shower with affection until she understands they are meant to be... she'll continue to show her affection after but knows she'll need to go all out in the early days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe potion itself doesn't actually take very long to take effect, Mulan had just taken the cup back when her eyes start to flutter, slumping against her the Chinese warrior runs her fingers through her love's hair as her lithe body gets smaller and smaller, eventually adjusting her positon so she's lying in her lap. Resisiting the urge to coo, mostly because even though her now tiny lover is definitely deserving on one it would wake her' sleeping beauty', Mulan now had to figure out the best way to smuggle the girl when she heads out onto the road for the next town and the rest of their life together. She'll also need to wake the girl before placing her, as she doesn't want to traumatise the brunette if she was to wake up somewhere in Mulan's giant body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo where to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Mulan wants to keep Aurora close to her heart, so decides to keep her in her shirt nestled safely between her breasts<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Her love's safety at the forefront Mulan decides the best place to put her in in her surprisingly plump rear end. Plus the idea of a princess kissing her ass does sound nice to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Mulan remembers vividly when Aurora told her that while most of her body was that of a battle hardened warrior, she found if funny and adorable she still had little 'princess feet'. She hopes she still likes them now they're a lot bigger, as well as glad the potion made them practically invincible, because Aurora is going to get well acquainted with her foot, which she is now the same size as, when they're both in her boot.</span></div></div>",

Aurora bites her bottom lip as her body turns red. Mulan buttons her shirt back up hiding her form the rest of the world. Aurora smiles sightly as she has to admit that it is kind of warm and cozy in here. She's embarrassed to admit but she kind of likes it here. She smiles softly as she can hear Mulan's heartbeat. Even though she's no bigger than a doll she feels safe here with Mulan<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMulan smiles as she does up her shirt up. She's happy that she had got this far. Just on quick glance she can tell that Aurora is happy which is just making her happy. Mulan smiles and starts to head towards the town. Mulan smiles as she has Aurora right where she wants her, close to her heart. </span></div></div>",
