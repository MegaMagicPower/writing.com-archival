You look at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8am? You don't remember setting the alarm for that time, especially with today being sunday, a day off. You grumble as you prepare to go back to sleep, or try to, anyway. But as you lie back down, you notice a weird glow on your desk. What is that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnoyed, you get out of bed and walk over to the glow. When you get there you find a remote. Odd, you don't remember seeing anything like this before, why would it be in your bedroom?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glow was from it's LED screen, which simply read '100%'. There were two buttons on it's face, a large blue button and a smaller red button below it. From inspecting it, it seems like these are the only features of the entire thing, only making things more confusing. What could this be used for? Curious, you hit the blue button.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BRRRRRZZZTTTT!!!!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Beam of light shoots out of the remote and hits your desk. You jump back in surprise as your desk glows for a second, before vanishing from sight. What just happened? Your desk is gone? You lean in to look at where it used to be, and after about a minute of investigating, you see it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's your desk, same as it was, only now it's incredibly small! It can't be any bigger than a centimetre, if that! You look back at the remote, the LED now reading 60%. You point the remote and aim as carefully you can at your small target of a desk, and try hitting the red button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BRRRRRZZZTTTT!!!!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, as quick as it disappeared, your desk is back, at normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrenaline shoots through you as you look at the remote, now reading 35%. The things you can do and get up to with this remote begin shooting through your mind. You're so excited you want to try it out now. As you see the battery change to 36%, you realise that it auto charges as well. Maybe you should wait for it to recharge before getting up to no good? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Heck, you don't even know the most important part yet, does it work on people?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nobody likely to enter your room for at least a few hours, you willingly volunteer yourself to be the first test subject for this experiment. With your hands shaking, you point the remote at your chest and press the blue button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BRRRRRZZZTTTT!!!!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately are overwhelmed by an intense sense of vertigo, and close your eyes to try and stifle the dizziness. After a few seconds you regain yourself, and open your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh my god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour surround by a seemingly endless amount of coiled trees, and not small trees either, it'd most likely take you a few minutes of climbing to reach the top. You're able to piece from context that this awe-inspiring vista was once your bedroom carpet. You're incredibly tiny! You can't be much bigger than a millimetre or two! You didn't mean to this far!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the remote, which shrunk with you (Along with your clothes, thankfully). The LED reads 3%, pretty much empty. You doubt that'd get you back to your original size, so it looks like your stuck at this size for now. You begin to walk around your new world, unable to see any of the other features of your bedroom past the canopy of carpet fibres. Looking to get your bearings, you decide to climb the nearest one. Reaching it, the task looks a lot more difficult than you thought, you really underestimated how big it was! Nevertheless, with few options, you begin to climb it anyway, luckily it's easy with so many footholds along the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't have been halfway up when you hear a noise that makes your blood run cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BANG!BANG!BANG!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head shoots in the direction of the sound, it's hard to tell due to the noises being amplified so much, but you think that was the sound of someone knocking on your door! Which would be incredibly bad if somebody was to enter your room with you at this size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>CREEEEEAAAKKKK!!!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turns out that whoever it was wasn't waiting for a response, and decided to enter your room anyway! But you still can't quite make it out who it is!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is it? </span></div></div>",

You can't believe just how big she is at this scale, usually she's not that tall at all! You cling as tightly as you can to your carpet fibre as your mothers steps, which while casual to her, cause what feels like an apocalypse to you down on the floor! With each booming step, you can see the what is usually microscopic dust particles thrown off of the carpet, sending them what seems like miles into the air, all the way to about halfway up the sole of the flip-flop your mom is currently wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe earthquakes only get more and more intense as your mother steps further into the room, and gets closer and closer to your location with each step! Before you know it she's almost right on top of you! You're terrified as you've never experienced something this otherworldly huge and fast before! There's a very real chance of you getting stepped on and left as a small red dot on your mother's dirty old sandal! But, fortunately for you, the walking Goddess stops just before she reaches you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou regain your balance on the carpet and look towards your mother. Instead of seeing her, however, you are greeted with what seems to be a several mile high wall of black rubber. Craning your head all the way back, you can see five moving gigantic spheres on top of the wall, each one making it's own BOOM! noise as it fidgets about. You can figure out that you've been inadvertently spared, and are left in the shadow of your moms sandal! You desperately want to cry out for help, and for your mother to save you, but you know that there's no chance of her hearing you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?     </span></div></div>",

You don't know how long she is planning on staying here, and the longer that you're on the floor the higher the chances of you ending up underneath her feet. You try glancing up to get a hint about it from her actions, but it's no use, she's too far away to tell what she's doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach the base of the sandal, and are thankful that it didn't take that long to get there (In reality, your mothers foot was only a centimetre from you, it was really close!). You place your hand onto the rubber, and it looks like you'll be actually be able to climb this immeasurable wall!.....somehow.<br>\r\n\"Well, no time to waste.\" You muse to yourself, and begin to scramble up the sandal as fast as you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you climb, you can feel the ominous booms and thumping of your mothers mountainous toes above you through the sandal, was this really the best idea? One wrong move and you'd end up underneath them, plus who knows what'll happen when she actually starts moving. Regardless, you still think that it's better to stay up on higher ground, so to speak. And if worse comes to worse, you could try and hide by the area where the strap is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you reach the summit, and roll onto the surface of the sandal. Instantly you feel dwarfed again as you're reminded of your new tiny size, as you stare up at the dominating forms of your mothers toes. The one in front of you is the size of one of the high rises you'd see in the city, but it's in reality just mom's pinky toe! There'd be no way to survive it if you ended up beneath it, but fortunately it seems like they're being rather still at the moment. Dangerously curious, you move closer to the toe to investigate it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach the toe, and place one hand on it and rub it on the surface a little. It feels coarser than you would have expected. You've never been one to check out women's feet, but you would have thought that your mom's feet were softer and smoother than this. Perhaps it's because of your size, and that there was no way to hide it at this scale? When she first entered and walked into your room, you could see much more cracks and wrinkles on her feet than you normally could. On top of this, the smell was....interesting. Best described as a mix between sweat and foot lotion. It didn't help that the sandal also contained it's own unique smell as well, but for some reason you didn't mind it too much, perhaps because of it's familiarity in this new and impossible world you were a part of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand there, absentmindedly touching your mothers toe for a while.       </span></div></div>",

You're sent flying into the air from the force and lose all control over where you're going and where you're going to land! You try your best to get your bearings during this, but all you could make out is the rapidly rising wall that was formerly your mom's toe. Then, as quickly as it raised, it shot back down towards the surface of the sandal. Impacting the ground with a muffled <b>*THUD!*</b> and small shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stay in the air for a few more seconds before crashing back onto the surface of the sandal, tumbling down to about the centre of the footwear, thankfully for you just in front of the toes. You move to stand up but are immediately sent sprawling to the ground again as a similar <b>*THUD!*</b> noise and quake ring out, knocking you off balance. Before you can recover from this, another one occurs. You aren't sure what's happening but you're powerless to resist it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoosing to stay on the ground, you look up to try and get an idea of what is happening. You are greeted with the terrifying sight of each monstrous toe rising miles above you into the air before crashing down into the ground and repeating. The speed at which this is all happening is mind-boggling to you, it's enough to make you freeze in fear of these organic mountains that in reality are just the toes of mom's usually petite feet. You look further up past the toes, to try and make out what she's doing, but you're still much too far away to make out any of her details. What you didn't know is that none of this was intentional, it was just the unconscious wiggling of her toes causing this cataclysmic event in your world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot daring to move, you're content to wait at this distance and hope that the toes stop these movements sometime soon, before mom begins walking again. Your hopes are dashed, however after the toe closest to you, her middle toe, hits the ground with slightly more force than the previous times. A change that was unnoticeable to a normal person, but a world ending disaster to you. This time, the toe causes a thundering <b>*BOOM!*</b> as it meets the ground, and the force is enough to send you flying into the air again, despite your attempts to resist it! While normally this would have launched you back into the carpet forest, mom's foot makes the smallest shift forward, and you scream as her foot launches forward towards you at lightning speeds!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smack into another surface, but where have you ended up?</span></div></div>",

You flail aimlessly as the toe looms over you before coming down suddenly from above!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for you, you weren't crushed instantly underneath your mother's toe. You weren't sure if it was because it missed or if you were just too small for it to matter, but you weren't complaining. The more pressing concern for you at the moment was the fact that you were now stuck <i>somewhere</i> under the sole of your mother's foot, and you couldn't tell where because the entire area was completely dark!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEffectively blind, you take a couple of steps forward, trying to feel out your new location. The smell outside was faint but noticeable, here deep inside the sandal the smell is overpowering and relentless. You try to block it by covering your nose but it does nothing to slow it down, you'll just have to bear with it until you can get out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a booming noise erupts around the area, and the ground shakes too. This must be her toes moving about again, but they're much further away from last time you were near these quakes. You don't have the time to ponder this however, as you were knocked off balance and stumble over!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou face-plant onto the 'ground' and recoil in surprise as you land in a puddle of water! Water splashes up onto you as you recoil back in surprise at the unexpected liquid. The smell coming from the liquid is somehow even worse than the smell permeating the area! It doesn't take a genius to figure out you just covered yourself with a small pool of your mom's foot sweat! You splutter and cough, trying to get the taste out of your mouth, cringing in embarrassment at being drenched and accidentally swallowing some of mom's sweat. You swear to yourself to keep this experience a secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking yourself up, you try to dry yourself off but struggle to in the darkness. You can feel the smell of sweat cling to your body, and resolve to go get a shower ASAP.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when...    </span></div></div>",

The shaking is on a much more extreme level than the simple toe quakes that you've been dealing with up until now! It's so intense that despite your best efforts, it still causes you to stumble and fall, back into the puddle of sweat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll over and try to wipe the fragrant liquid off of your face again, but for the second time you taste the salty refuse. Grossed out, you gag as a reflex to the thought of accidentally drinking foot sweat for a second time. You decide to get out and away from this puddle before another quake sends you in for a third helping, but before you can pick yourself up your leg suddenly gets hit with a quick stinging sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at your leg as you feel another small spike of pain on the side of your thigh. The only thing near your leg is the remote that's still in  your pocket, so you pull the remote out to look at it. Your face goes pale as you see the screen that should usually be indicating the battery level going haywire, displaying numbers and symbols seemingly at random. Did you fall on it and break it? Or maybe it's not waterproof and some of your mom's sweat has short circuited it? Whatever the reason, if the remote breaks you're pretty much screwed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you're thinking these worrying thoughts the remote sends out another quick jolt of electricity, enough to cause you to drop it on instinct. This would prove incredibly costly as it turns out the remote did in fact still have some charge left in it, which you quickly discover as the remote activates, firing directly at you as it bounces off of the ground! Your blood turns cold as your vision is blinded by the same white light!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*BZZZZZZZZZTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly feel like you're in a freefall. You cannot make out wherever it is that you're falling as the environment is still dark, but your worst fears have been realised as the remote didn't hit you with the beam to regrow! You've been shrunken a second time, only now the remote didn't come with you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*SPLASH!*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're caught off guard as you make impact with a body of water and submerge what feels like a dozen metres downwards. You're thankful that you didn't hurt anything when you hit the water as you desperately attempt to swim in the direction that you think the surface is. Your lungs beginning to burn, you finally make it to the surface as you take in deep breaths, treading water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't have been there for more than a couple of seconds when suddenly you're blindsided by a crashing wave, sending you rolling back under the water! In your surprise, you accidentally swallow some of the water, and you taste a familiar, warm salty taste in your mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFoot sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to your mother is an unnoticeable drop of sweat from her foot on her sandal, and to the shrunken you was a small pool of sweat, has now become an entire deep ocean of your mother's perspiration! If you had time to panic rather than swim for your life you would have curled up into a ball. You were imperceptibly microscopic! The you from a minute ago would most likely be several miles tall in comparison, not to mention however unthinkably large your mother's foot, much less her entire body is now compared to you! And what's worse is that without the remote, you are now permanently stuck at this size, with no hope of ever being found or rescued!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou resurface for a second time, and are promptly dumped by another wave and sent back under. The puddle that seemed still before, is now raging with the quakes from your mothers toes and footsteps, keeping you from getting a break from this fight for your life! Nevertheless, you struggle, determined to survive this, as you pick a direction and move that way, praying that it's the closest path towards dry land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

What's she doing here so early? Never mind that, she's huge! You've always been so used to Bianca being so much shorter than you, heck Naomi was nearly reaching her height, but right now she's the biggest human to have ever existed, or at least at your scale she is!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can do nothing but cling to your carpet fibre on the ground as you watch Bianca walk into your room, her footsteps causing earthquakes across the room, and making thunderous noises as well. You look towards her feet to see them in her favourite pair of platform sandals, blowing small bits of dust from the ground high into the air, where it was sent flying by her leg movements. You sigh at the sight of them. She usually wore them to gain a few inches of height on you, but at this scale it's more like adding a few miles onto her! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the booming steps cease as you look up towards Bianca's upper body. You can't make out the details too well, but you think she's looking for you, judging by the movements of her hair flipping around at rapid speeds. You can't confirm this, however, as Bianca's rather ample cleavage is blocking all sight you have of her face! For the first time in your life you curse her massive mammaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>\"ETHAN? YOU HERE? HELLOOOOOOO?\"</b></font> Your Goddess girlfriends voice rings out across the room. Not seeing you, she adjusts her top a little, giving you a show as her mountainous breasts bounce around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooks like you guessed right. Bianca was looking for you, but bar being a psychic there's no way she'd actually find you like this. With the remote still on low charge, it seems like you'll have to either get Bianca's attention or avoid her for a while, but both seem pretty impossible for you at the moment!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's Bianca's next move?</span></div></div>",

Nevertheless, you still clung tightly to your position, to keep yourself from falling back down into the depths of the carpet if you were to be knocked off balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, Bianca didn't seem to have moved at all, you could see the pale mountains that were her toes wiggling around on her sandals far above you, but the booms coming from them shouldn't be as intense as the ones you're feeling. No, these ones were more like when Bianca first entered your room, the feeling of her earth-shaking footsteps. Luckily for you your questions were soon answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\"BIANCA?\"</font></b> A thundering voice rang out from across the heavens. It seemed to come from every direction, as if it truly was the voice of God speaking to you (Or rather Bianca) at this very moment. Although despite the volume increase, you recognised the owner of that voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you were correct, as you can spot approaching in the distance a pair of monolithic bare feet thundering their way into your room.<br>\r\n______________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Oh! Hi Ethan's Mom! Was I too loud just then?\" Bianca asks apologetically, her feet fidgeting slightly in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKathy smiled, shaking her head.<br>\r\n\"It's fine dear. And besides, didn't I tell you that you could just call me by my name last time?\" She said, crossing her arms across her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehehe, sorry! I guess I just thought that would be too casual...\" Bianca giggled, before her eyes lit up.<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah! Have you seen Ethan anywhere? He's not in here, and that's usually where he's hiding.\" She asked excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not here?\" Kathy responded just as confused, before looking around the room and confirming this. \"That's odd, I haven't seen him all morning, so I thought he'd still be in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww.\" Bianca's shoulders drooped slightly, her chest bouncing. \"I guess I'll just stay up here and wait for him to come back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry about this, making you wait for him like this. It's a good thing he's not here or I'd embarrass him with a lecture about how to treat his girlfriend properly!\" She chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't be too harsh on him!\" Bianca responded, joining her in laughter.<br>\r\n____________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the two Titanic women laughed above, you were frozen, unsure about what your next action possibly could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this size, you had little hope of actually being able to avoid one of the girls, let alone two at the same time! If they decide to start moving there's really nothing you can do to stop them or slow them down in the slightest. Not only this, but with the two of them chatting like this, getting their attention has shifted from nigh impossible to flat out impossible, too. Your options are fairly limited, although....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is a once in a lifetime opportunity to get closer to one of these women then you've ever been before, and without them even being aware of it!

And until that happens, she's not going to leave this room! And with that, she dropped onto the ground and started to wait, stretching her legs out as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor you however, it was as if the sky was falling. The humongous form of your baby sister started to rapidly head towards the ground, and although you were thankfully nowhere near the impact point, you knew that the aftershocks from it were going to be immense!

Looking to your left, you see nothing but miles of flesh colored landscape with many bumpy hills. Did you somehow end up in a desert? That didn't seem possible... Turning around you see a large black cave with an even darker cave opening and above that a long pillar of white. Giving your head a few slaps to make sure you're awake your thoughts are interrupted from the heavens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"I\"M BOOOOOOORED!\"</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat deafeningly loud voice sounded really familiar, you rack your brain around what had just happened when it dawned on you. You must have crashed onto Naomi! Which means this isn't a desert, this is her skin! Turning back around to the cave, you now recognize it as the entrance to Naomi's short-shorts she sleeps in which means you're currently on her upper thigh! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing how long you were out, panic began to set in. Naomi was a wonderful kid but she wasn't known for her patience. You go to reach for the size ray in your pocket. Taking it out you try to check the charge percentage only to find the screen littered with error codes. Low battery, check growth atomizer, check shrink actuator, these are just a handful of the codes. You must have come down hard on this thing when you fell, it doesn't appear to be working currently. The ground your standing on shakes as Naomi adjusts her sitting position, her voice rings out again threatening to deafen you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"ETHAAAAN COMEON! YOU SAID YOU'D PLAY WITH ME TODAY UGH! THIS ISN'T FUNNY\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to figure out a plan right now. You know Naomi well enough that she isn't going to stay sitting here for much longer. If she gets up, you're going to fall and being left microscopic on your bedroom floor with a broken size remote makes your blood pressure spike. Leaving you with no other option, you sprint inside the opening of Naomi's short-shorts, the inside is extremely humid and there's an odd smell in the air as your run turns into a walk. Walking for what feels like an eternity, your eyes slowly adjust to the darkness, you can make out a sheer flesh colored cliff approaching which appears to be Naomi's stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second..\" You pause. \"How did I make it to her stomach without running into any underwear?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up into the darkness you can make out the faint white interior of her panties, which means she was indeed wearing them, how did you end up here unless...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must be so small I walked under them.. OH MY GOD!\" You yell as your mind starts to race. \"What the hell am I going to do!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you say this you make the mistake of looking to your right. Your eyes now fully adjusted to the darkness that surrounds you, you make out the huge developing lips of your youngest sisters vagina. Being at a young age still, it appears to be more of a slit between her legs than anything, but to your puny form that small slit could swallow you whole without her even feeling you. Freaking out, you go to make a break for the entrance of her shorts just as Naomi has finally had enough and stands up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"OKAY WELL WHATEVER ETHAN, I GUESS YOU'RE TOO COOL NOW TO HANG OUT WITH YOUR LITTLE SISTER!\"</b> she says with sadness in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she gets up, you're sent tumbling around the confines of her underwear as Naomi makes her way..</span></div></div>",

It didn't dawn on you until you heard a very familiar cartoon that Naomi watches that you realized you should have moved. You feel Naomi's legs begin to buckle as you look back up to see her huge butt cheeks begin to part as she takes her seat. Her huge anus soon comes into view as her underwear begins to conform to her ass as she sits down to watch cartoons, lifting you closer to the puckering orifice. Within an instant you're plastered spread eagle against your younger sisters ass hole, the huge hole flexes as your body makes contact, the foul grime that coats the wrinkly surface covers your face and body and with every attempt to yell your mouth is flooded with mounds of ass flesh. The smell coming off her hairless balloon knot causes you to gag before you throw up all over her shit covered rosebud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack up above, Naomi was flipping through channels when she came across her favorite cartoon.

The giant wobbling of her huge globes is mesmerizing but you manage to break away from it's alluring trance as you needed to move from under her ass before she sat down again! Just the thought of ending up in Naomi's butt gave you the energy to sprint towards the front of her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"MOOOOM, I'M GOING TO HEAD OVER TO RACHEL'S HOUSE, BE HOME LATER!\"</b> your sisters yells out to your mother, you come to a full stop to cover your ears as her voice threatens to blow out your ear drums. With your ears now ringing, you don't hear the sound of the front door closing as you have to take your hands off your head in order to maintain balance as her huge legs swish with each step, pulling her underwear around barely giving you enough leverage to stand. Suddenly, out of nowhere, Naomi's walking comes to a stop and you take this opportunity to drop to your hands and knees, as trying to stand could result in you being flung out of her panties... outside. The thought of being microscopic outdoors scared the hell out of you and was a for sure death sentence, so you clutched onto the cloth fibers with all your might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour world is tilted sideways as you feel Naomi moving up above, as if she was climbing over something, just as the movement finished, a hard surface appeared below you that rose you and her underwear up almost as if an elevator appeared from thin air. You can hear a brief conversation up above but with your ears still ringing slightly you can't really make out what they're saying, it sounds as if Emily is talking to Naomi though. This pause gives you enough time to rack your brain on which friend Rachel was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel... Rachel.... wait isn't she the one that lives...? OH NO!\" You yell as you make the connection. You had originally thought she had climbed over one of the small picket fences to one of your neighbors yards but you were wrong, Rachel, lived a couple blocks away in the same neighborhood, which meant that Naomi would undoubtedly take her bike which meant that  you were currently standing on her bike seat! Looking up, you're both relieved and horrified as you had made it out from under her butt, unfortunately, your eyes land squarely on her developing pussy which looms dangerously close above you, small beads of sweat have developed around it from being confined in her shorts and panties on a hot day. Panicking, you stand up and start to sprint, your ears clearing up enough to make out your sisters conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...make sure your wear your bike helmet or I'm telling Mom on you. Also, don't talk to strangers Naomi, I don't know how many times I have to tell you, just because people are nice doesn't make it okay to talk to them.\" You hear the last bit of Emily's speech to Naomi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.. I'll wear the stupid helmet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*CLICK*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're barely able to make out the sound of the her helmet clicking together but it was enough to make your blood run cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you happy?\" Naomi says sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good enough, now get out of here.\" Emily's voice trails off as she walks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that you've run out of time, you fall to the ground as your adrenaline rush fades, you turn over onto your back just in time to see that you're still under Naomi's huge vagina before it begins to fall out of the sky. Almost as if it's in slow motion, the gigantic slit approaches you, opening slightly as her legs move to find the bike pedals. In mere nanoseconds, your body is engulfed in your sisters flesh as she sits down to ride her bike, completely unaware of the torture sentence she just handed down to her beloved older brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought it was extremely warm being inside Naomi's underwear, being under her now, was sweltering. All around you was her searing hot flesh, you had run far enough to avoid ending up inside her pussy, fortunately, yet you were still pinned down by her young lips, just outside. Huge globs of sweat surround you as you have to push on the soft flesh in order to make a pocket of air for long enough to breath, the salty liquid finding it's way into your mouth as you have to gulp down gallons of her sweat. On top of that, each time she pedals her bike, she shifts slightly in her seat, which threatens to move you closer to the huge opening next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her bike ride continues, you feel more and more pressure being applied as if Naomi was pushing down harder onto her bike seat. Not long after, her hips begin to gyrate slightly as if she was scratching at an annoying itch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NAOMI, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? YOU'RE GOING TO CRUSH ME!\" You yell, trying to figure out what the hell she could possibly be doing. It didn't take long before your brain drew another connection. With each day, Naomi was getting closer and closer to hitting puberty, which very well could mean she was currently using her bike seat to.... \"OH GOD! NO!\" You yell again, more salty sweat getting into your mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naomi got closer to her friend Rachel's house, her gyrating got more and more intense, your body was rubbed all around her flesh as you soaked up her sweat, you soon found yourself being moved around. Just as she rode up Rachel's driveway, she give a light moan signalling the end of her mischievous pleasure ride.

Once the rumbling ended and you stopped turning, you felt relieved and you peeled yourself off from the wall and started to roll down for a bit until you hit something springy again. You opened your eyes and stood up to see your sorroundings change completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was two soft, fleshy mountains that were on either side of you are now both to your left, one on top of the other, with you standing on the lower one. To your right is a wall that you were hanging on to. In front of you and behind you stretches a long tunnel or cave. While there is less air, more heat and less space here than when your mother was lying down, there is still lots of room at your size. In the ends of the tunnel you can make out indiscernable parts of your mom. From above, you hear a loud beating noise, which must be her heart. From this, you conclude that you should go forward, with the breasts to your left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk, you notice that the surface is much softer than when she was lying down. You bounce a little as you run forward, something that you're starting to enjoy despite the situation. \"Bouncy boobs, bouncy boobs\" you say as you advance like a kangaroo. After a few minutes of this, you stop and look left, then down. From the bulge in your pants (which shrank with you) you decide that you must at least take a closer look at those boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go to the breasts and touch the top breast with your right hand and hold it there as you look at the wedge ahead. You think it's just spacious enough that you could actually crawl inside without getting crushed. It would be a long crawl until you reach the end. If her boobs are this big, how big would her nipple be? How long would it take to reach it? While fantasizing about this, you unconciously fondle the breast that you are still holding onto, Mom's beautiful, massive, soft, pale, sweaty, milky... \"Oh shit!\" You suddenly let go and slap your face with your right hand. \"Snap out of it, this is your mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember to take a look at your remote, the LED reads 10%.

Fearing the worst, you make a run for the right to climb your mother's left breast, assuming this to be the least dangerous route.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a long way to the top and you think it's too late as the other boob keeps closing in. However, looking back, you see that the mass of flesh stopped right at the middle of the cleavage, where you just started. While you hurry upwards, the tit behind you was now going backwards, then forward again, this time stopping a lot closer to you. This repeats itself a third time and your mother's breathing becomes heavier. Then it dawned on you: she's fondling her boob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, the soft mountain stopped at a point which to you was just a few meters away. You were only a little over halfway up. Next time, you thought, you would be crushed for sure. You didn't let that stop you, though, and you ascended as quickly you could. Then it came again. You braced for impact, and the massive, soft flesh pushed you towards the other. This is the end. You were getting crushed by Mom's massive tits...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...But suddenly, the boob behind you quickly went backwards. \"I live!\" you joyously proclaimed. You had just enough air in you that you didn't fall unconscious then. After a few deep breaths, you continued the climb ever closer to the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mammoth mammary pounded you a few more times, but at least you knew you wouldn't die, and you took deep breaths whenever it happened so as to not lose air. Getting mashed between a pair of tits, even if they were your mom's, was actually becoming kind of fun, you are starting to like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few tiny-son-in-a-boob-sandwich moments later, you finally reached the top of Mount Mom. You can finally make out your mom's billboard sized face as well as the other mountain that was still being fondled by a gigantic hand. She was still sleeping, but she said something interesting in her sleep:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">\"MMMmmmph...Sweetie...\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is she dreaming about?\" you curiously asked as you kept staring at one your mom's wonderful assets in the distance. Then you turned around to see some sort of pink mound around a large, round pink area. You quickly recognize this to be her nipple. You are standing on the edge of her areola. The rest of her breasts were firm enough to climb on, but here, your hands and feet sink into her flesh. As you walk closer to the nipple, which is already several times your size, it starts to grow, towering over you greatly. Your mother felt it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">\"MMMMmmm...Yes, there...\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have an excellent idea! You could climb her nipple and play around with it, she'll be sure to notice you! Little did you know that this is just the little head taking control over the big head. There must be some safer way to get her attention, right? Something that could make you more noticeable. It's been on your mind for a while now, but you can't quite pin down what it is.

There are a couple of places where tiny hairs would grow that you could currently be positioned, so you choose to walk around a bit and get your bearings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as you can tell the area you're on is essentially an incredibly huge, long straight path. And looking off far into the distance, you can see the vague shape of what would be an object of similar shape and extreme size. This leaves you with two options: The legs or the arms. And since you don't remember mom sleeping in a position that would allow this view between arms, you conclude that you're somewhere on her legs, and judging from the size of the part your on, your positioned on the inside of her right thigh!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough being this size anywhere on this giantess' body is dangerous, you count yourself lucky that you didn't land anywhere cramped where you could easily get crushed if she moved weirdly, or worse, trapped. Still, you don't want to be on her legs when she wakes up, and you'd be worse off on the bed between her thighs than on them, so you redouble your efforts in heading up towards the main body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't have been going for more than a couple of minutes when you stop.

Every one of her features spanned what seemed to be miles, every detail of her feet was now strikingly visible to you, every wrinkle, every crack. You couldn't make out her face though, as her bodies details began to blur and fade as they reached higher and higher. She was truly a Goddess, and you were nothing but an unnoticeable speck to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrified, you knew that evading her would be hopeless, your only chance was that she did something other than approach the toilet...  </span></div></div>",

You don't get very far as her foot lands on the tile next to you, sending you flying from the force!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above, Kathy does some small stretches in front of the toilet. 'Why do I set the alarm so early every morning?' she thinks to herself, as she turns on her heels, before lowering her panties to her ankles and sitting on the toilet. As she begins to release her morning pee, she sighs and leans back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being sent flying by your moms footsteps, you're left lying on your back, looking up towards a blue sky. But you're inside, that doesn't make any sense... And then you notice a streak of white next to it off in the distance, followed by another blue streak even further off into the horizon. As your eardrums suffer from the loud noise of your mom peeing above you, you figure out that you're staring up at her panties, which seem to be striped blue and white!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing this close to a pair of panties at this size is an incredibly intimidating and arousing experience, even if it is your mom's panties we're talking about. The smell of her pheromones surround you, and you can feel yourself getting an erection from this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to get closer\" You say to yourself, eyes consumed with lust.

You've decided to take advantage of the situation and get a little closer, and you need the quickest path up before she moves again. Her right foot is slightly closer to you currently, but she is slightly tapping it on the floor, making a soft <b>*BOOM*</b> noise and a small shake of the ground with each impact. You decide that it would be safer to go the extra distance for the more stable left foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to run towards her foot, as you have a lot of distance to cover and not that much time to get there. You're unaware of this, but your mother had finished peeing before you even began to run, and you've lucked out as she's continued to sit on the toilet and think to herself for a while, giving you this opportunity. After a couple of minutes of running, you finally reach the base of her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of mom's foot is somehow even more intimidating at this close range than it was when it was moving. Although you know what you're looking at, it's so big that it looks unrecognisable, and is just a seemingly endless wall of skin in every direction. The area also has a distinct smell too, which you could detect from a distance before you arrived up close, but is now much stronger as you move to touch the foot. Looking up, you see that you should be able to climb up fairly quickly using the slight wrinkles and cracks across it, a sign of ageing and years of use that are impossible to hide at this scale. Deciding not to waste anymore time staring at a foot when there are greater sights to see, you grab onto a makeshift handhold made of skin, and begin to climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe climb was much harder than you had originally given it credit for, but you managed to run up the top of her foot when you got there and have reached her ankle in fairly good time. At this point, you've finally reached a part of the object of your desire, the former sky that was your mom's underwear. The fabric is rolled up in a bunch slightly around her ankle, meaning that you'd have to do some tricky manoeuvring in order to get on top of it and into it. You aren't sure how much longer mom will sit still so you move to climb the threads of the panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, as if on cue, everything begins the shake! You manage to look up to see the hands of your new Goddess reaching down, most likely to pull what you've been climbing for far out of your reach! If that was to happen you'd be stuck on her ankle too while she was moving, and who knows how difficult that could be! You need to make a move now, as those hands are moving faster than anything you've seen before! </span></div></div>",

Her head turns left and she looks at the shower.<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, might as well take a shower while I'm in here...\" She says aloud to what she thinks is nobody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she leans forward and reaches down to slip her panties completely off, when a tiny black dot moving across the tile floor near her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b>\"HUH?\"</b></font> You hear from above you.

AT LEAST I WON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT CLEANING YOU UP!\"</b></font> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realise that getting her to recognise you is impossible! Screw it, you don't care what your punishment is, you're going to have to regrow yourself now! You pull out the remote and point it at yourself and click the button, but nothing happens! You look down and the screen still reads 0%! You've got no choice, you turn and start to sprint as far as you can. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove, Kathy, despite her taunts, knows that the bug doesn't understand what she's saying, but she hates bugs so much, she just can't resist. She sits there, not moving, as she observes the thing for a little bit. 'Good god this thing really is tiny, what a miserable existence it must live.' she thinks to herself. 'Still at least I saw it when I did, I wouldn't want this thing crawling on me' She shudders at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she notices that the bug isn't really moving at all. She lifts and taps her big toe next to it, but she still can't see it moving. 'Does this thing have 0 survival instincts?' She wonders. 'Oh well' she thinks as she finally drops the sole of her foot on top of the speck. Feeling better than she did a couple of minutes ago, she reaches over for some toilet paper and wipes herself clean from her pee earlier. Suddenly she stops, and turns her foot over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKathy can barely make it out, but she can spot the tiniest red speckle from where her foot met the bug amongst the other bits of dirt and dust on her sole. Not one for waste she uses the same piece of toilet paper she's holding to wipe away the mark, before dropping it into the toilet and flushing it, and the final traces of you, away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKathy stands up, stretches again and walks over to turn on the shower. She'll never give that bug a second thought in her life. Your mom will never know that she crushed her darling son under her foot like an insignificant pest. <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

You hope she'll ignore the whole thing as some hallucination or something. \"BUT IT MOVED...\" - ouch, what if she thinks you're a bug! You look around for options, but carpet stretches for miles in every direction and you're already tired even after the short 'escape'. Suddenly your roof moves - you look up and see Kathy moving the enormous pillar aside with just a single finger. \"OH MY GOD!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother's voice is so loud that you have to cover your ears in pain. You realize just how absurdly small you are and running away is.. pointless - she's seen you and no matter where you go, you'll be within her arms' reach...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ETHAN..

WHAT HAPPENED?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bring both hands to your mouth and shout as loud as you can. It's no good - she keeps staring down at you. No, you'll have to find another way: you think of the remote, but it still shows 0% - no good then. You wonder how long will it take to recharge...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I CAN'T HEAR YOU ETHAN\" - your mom realizes the obvious, then adds: \"OH MY GOD, IT REALLY IS YOU! YOU'LL HAVE TO SPEAK LOUDER!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only it was so simple! But at least she can see you - you think of perhaps just acting to explain what happened, but.. you always hated these party games. You were bad at it too... No, but maybe she can pick you up and bring you closer to her ear? You point to your ear with exaggerated moves hoping she'll get the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH, RIGHT.. I GUESS YOU'RE TOO SMALL FOR THAT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? DO YOU WANT ME TO DO SOMETHING?\" - okay, at least she's trying to figure it out too. Instead you point to yourself then towards her ear, maybe that'll... \"OH I SEE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop your pantomiming efforts and brace to be picked up, but instead she turns her head and begins to lower it. You panic - it's like the sky falling down... You brace for impact, expecting her head to crush you. Instead it stops just above the carpet fibers and her ear is almost directly over you. That might work too, you realize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom! Mom can you hear me?\" - you shout upwards. Nothing. \"Mooom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAIT, IS THAT... I CAN ALMOST HEAR SOMETHING...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou repeat, but your voice is just too weak. You consider climbing some fiber, but then she moves the ear even lower. Fibers move around you, displaced by her head - luckily you aren't buried underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moooom! Can you hear me?\" - you repeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD, I CAN HEAR YOU! JUST..

Your mom continues to stare at you for a moment then looks away. \"NO, IT.. I GUESS IT MAKES SENSE? NOW.. HOLD TIGHT...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brings her right hand towards you. Fingers the size of modest skyscrapers pinching in preparation of grabbing your minuscule form - it makes you panic again, as you're sure it would crush you. You crouch down and begin to wave and shake your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT ARE YOU.. WHAT DO YOU WANT THEN?\" - she demands and retracts her hand. You try to mime putting your hand on the ground palm up and have the other walk onto it. \"OH, RIGHT...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe puts her hand down, producing a major shockwave that throws you back, and.. of course it's not as simple as you imagined it. The wall of her palm is several stories high and climbing it is clearly impossible. But.. you look around and there some fibers nearby reach almost to the top. You run towards them and climb up all the way. She murmurs some \"whoa\"s and \"oh my god\"s, but in a few minutes you jump onto the awaiting palm. Which is easily the size of a city block...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother just continues staring down, so you walk - slowly - towards the center of it and consider.. it seems like you got what you wanted, after all. A chance to climb and walk over your gigantic mom? Suddenly she raises the hand and the movement pins you down to the skin. Inertia makes you fly upwards a good dozen feet or so - your scale, of course. Landing is soft enough, but still leaves you dazed a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO, THAT WON'T WORK... HERE, CLIMB ONTO MY FINGER\" - she suggests and by the time you are able to collect yourself, you can see she already put a finger next to you. You immediately see that you won't be able to do that, but.. instead you walk to its front and climb the fingernail. Underside of her neatly trimmed nail give you more than enough room to sit down. Heck, you could easily park a bunch of cars on it, with room to spare!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no way of communicating with her now as the tip of the finger covers most of your view, so you just wait. She peers in to check up on you and moves you to her ear. You prepare to jump inside, but she tilts her head and finger so you fall uncontrollably and slide deep into the ear canal. You are fine, if completely covered in wax.. which sucks, but is definitely better than being crushed in the carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom? Can you hear me now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LOUD AND CLEAR HONEY!\" - the voice is overwhelming now, coming from seemingly every direction. Which makes sense considering it must propagate through the flesh around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moom! Can you speak less loudly, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT DO YOU...\" - she booms again, penetrating through your body - covering ears does nothing. Luckily she then lowers her voice: \"I GUESS IT MUST BE LOUD WHEN YOU'RE SO MUCH SMALLER...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I thought I would go deaf or something...\" - you stand up and try to shake off some of the ear wax off yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH, THAT TICKLES! SO...

It seems like there's just no getting around it - you'll have to.. explain yourself. You consider telling the truth, but reject that option almost immediately - wanting to 'climb all over mom while she sleeps' seems way too creepy and perverted.

In any case you can only wait as she processes it. You try to think of something else to add to your 'crazy' story, but Kathy speaks first:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I DON'T GET IT. I MEAN WHY WOULD YOU.. WAIT A MINUTE, HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN DOING THIS, SNEAKING AROUND AND SHRINKING YOURSELF?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I never! This was the first.. I mean-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SO YOU DID SHRINK YOURSELF, WHOA...\" - she catches your indiscretion. To make matters worse, she seems to have been bluffing herself! How could you not have seen it... \"BUT THEN, WHY? AND WHAT ON EARTH IS THAT THING? THAT.. SIZE REMOTE?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not.. I mean, I have no idea-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU AN DROP THE ACT NOW, YOU SHOULD'VE AT LEAST GOTTEN YOUR STORY STRAIGHT...\" - your mother is right: that was one bad lie. You consider sticking to your 'story', after all.. what can she do? Actually.. you realize there's a lot your mother can do to extract the truth from you, and even the slightest punishment at your size... you don't even want to think about it. \"WELL?\" - she demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... sorry mom, I didn't mean-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEAH, YOU DIDN'T MEAN TO GET CAUGHT, BUT WHY WOULD YOU EVEN DO THAT? I MEAN, YOU COULD'VE SHRUNK ME TO AVOID CHORES OR SOMETHING, BUT INSTEAD...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I would never do 'that'! I mean, I just.. I...\" - you try to come up with some way to make it 'less awkward', at least: \"I woke up today and found this.. thing, on the floor. Like I don't even know what it is, it looks like some kind of remote. Except it only has two buttons and... I tested it in my room-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAIT, SO YOU SHRUNK YOURSELF TODAY ALREADY?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, I mean.. I tested it on my desk. And one button shrinks things while the other grows. Or restores them, I don't know. It's not exactly like I have any idea where or what-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEAH IT IS CRAZY... I HAVE TO KEEP PINCHING MYSELF TO MAKE SURE I'M NOT DREAMING. TO HAVE MY OWN SON INSIDE MY EAR...\" - you realize you could've pushed your bluff a bit further, maybe your mom would have bought it. She continues after a brief pause: \"YOU'RE NOT JUST SOME CRAZY VOICE IN MY HEAD RIGHT?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mooom!\" - you complain, but then decide to mess with her a bit: \"Actually, I'm just that. You must be going insane!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH, I GUESS IT'S SAFE TO JUST IGNORE YOU THEN...\" - she teases and the idea actually scares you. It would be that simple: ignore, forget.. crush with just a random movement. You try to think of a clever reply, but Kathy giggles: \"I'M JUST KIDDING, DON'T WORRY... OH MY GOD.. I REALLY HAVE MY TINY SON...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you finished?\" - you complain, tired of being teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOT YET.. CAN YOU JUMP, OR SOMETHING? LIKE YOU DID WHEN I PUT YOU INSIDE?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moooom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH, I'M JUST MAKING SURE I'M NOT GOING INSANE, YOU KNOW. OR AM I JUST TALKING TO MYSELF...\" - you still think she's teasing you, but decide maybe it's best for you to play along. Instead of jumping you kick the wall of the tunnel in anger. It worries you a bit that maybe you hurt the sensitive tissue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe only giggles instead. \"WOW, THAT'S JUST.. WOW...\" You wait in silence, defeated. \"SO YOU JUST SNUCK IN HERE TO.. WHAT? SHRINK AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh..\" - you can honestly say you haven't really thought it through, but maybe: \"I just wanted to see how a normal size person would look like when I'm small, maybe even climb them or-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!?\" - your ears ring for a moment, your mom said it out loud with her normal voice. She sighs and continues: \"WHY ME THOUGH? I MEAN, YOU COULD'VE GONE TO SEE ANY OF YOUR SIS... NO, I SUPPOSE IT WOULD'VE BEEN A BAD IDEA. OR RATHER, AN EVEN WORSE ONE...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" - you concur. At least your mom was careful enough not to crush you. What would Jackie or Naomi have done... you shudder at the possibilities. Come to think of it you were lucky that your mom found you as she did - who knows if somebody didn't just step on you had you shrunk yourself before the alarm went off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SO, I GUESS YOU SAW BIG OL' ME WHILE 'SMALL'. WAS THAT ENOUGH FOR YOU ETHAN? CAN YOU GROW BACK NOW? I MEAN, MAYBE NOT INSIDE MY EAR, BUT...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the remote and...</span></div></div>",

The powerful movements throw you around the ear as your surroundings get completely dark.

You can\u2019t believe your mothers plan is to keep you in here and pretend everything is normal, whilst spending the day with your sisters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the shifting motion eventually stops it is instantly replaced with a heavy intermittent vibration which you can only assume is your mothers feet stomping away miles bellow.

You'd have to take the direct route and force her to release you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst things first though, you had to peel yourself free from this disgusting ear grease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in the outside world, Kathy was headed towards her private bathroom. Just because her only son had shrunk into speck and was now getting comfortable inside her ear, didn't mean she was going to neglect herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it was hard to wrap her mind around this whole situation. It was as if a science fiction movie had come to life and the two of them were living it. Ethan had quite literally become the incredible shrinking man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt really was a good thing he'd chosen to use the device around her and not his siblings. She probably never would have seen him again if that were the case. Thankfully it wasn't, he'd be safe inside her ear while she and her daughters had family time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what I'll tell Jacqueline, Emily, and Naomi when they ask where is?\" She wondered aloud as she walked into the bathroom. First she'd brush her teeth and then head into the shower. Then she'd worry about the rest of her kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clearly heard her from the dark tunnel as you freed yourself from the wax. She really was going to go through with this. Fine, you'll be out of here soon enough after you've annoyed your mother into submission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a calming breath and began to head towards wherever you thought the eardrum would be. \"Mom!? Hey mom!? Can you hear me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEAH! I CAN HEAR YOU!\" her voice vibrated around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's Whitney Houston's favorite type of coordination? HAAANNNDDD EEEEEEEEYYYEEE!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?\" Your mother said confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's better than Ted Danson? Ted singing and Danson!\" Oh... That was bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and your mother cringed. That was just terrible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT ARE YOU DOING?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Practicing my stand up.\" You joked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WELL PLEASE STOP.\" Kathy winced. Your bad jokes reminded her of her grandfather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirked. You're plan was working. \"But I can't now. Not when I'm on a role. So what did the drummer call his twin daughter? Anna one, Anna two!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PLEASE STOP TALKING.\" Your mother suggested, although you could tell she was getting annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a matter of time now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bought some shoes from a drug dealer. I don't know what he laced them with, but I was trippin' all day!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ETHAN! STOP TALKING.\" Kath urged, her temper rising. These jokes were just plain awful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you make holy water? You boil the hell out of it!\" Okay... that one was actually pretty good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ETHAN...\" Kathy seethed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne more push.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey mom?\" You started. Oh revenge was sweet. \"How many ears does Spock have? Three. The left ear, the right ear, and the final front-ear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP!!!!\" Kathy shouted, the vibrations enough to send you falling into another waiting mass of earwax. \"ENOUGH WITH THE STUPID JOKES ALREADY! THERE'S SO BAD THEY REMIND ME OF MY GRANDFATHER AND HIS UNCLE JOKES!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep, you remembered great grandpa Micky's jokes all too well. He's the one who told you that last one. \"If you let me out you wouldn't have to hear me.\" you suggested. You prayed she'd take the bait and the hint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKathy meanwhile was seething as she understood what you were trying to do. You were trying to force her to let you out by being as annoying as humanly possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, she was a mother of three and that made her tougher than most.

It's a pain, and not how you'd like to spend your Sunday, but you need to do it, unless you want to spend the rest of your life this size. Or worse, get crushed. You think of how you could best get your mom's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe easiest, and probably safest option would be for you to climb into her ear and scream and shout as loud as you can. At that range she should hear you despite the difference in scale. Another option is to try the more direct route and get in front of her eye, but that comes with more risks, such as the danger of falling, or her seeing a bug instead of her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn saying this, both of these options involve a part of the body that's on the opposite side to the one that you were on. You doubted that she'd sleep forever, so at some point during the trip up you'd have to deal with her moving, and you weren't sure that you'd be able to resist it, judging from how beat up you are from a short walk in Jacqueline's hand. Darn! If only she dropped you somewhere more reasonable! You kick the ground in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, everything shakes and you're thrown off your feet. And as soon as the quake started, it finished. What was that? Did your mom feel that kick just then, and wiggled slightly because of the irritation? That's it! You can cause a disturbance and get her to investigate that way! You start stomping the ground as hard as you can, jumping up and down as well. But nothing else happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis isn't working, you're too small and mom's skin is too thick to feel you. If only there was somewhere nearby that was....more....sensitive....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp, turning around and looking into the distance. You can think of a nearby sensitive area. A very sensitive area. The repercussions for doing this will be staggering, especially if it works and mom discovers you. You don't think anyone would be able to talk their way out of being found tiny inside their mothers panties. But as long as it works, you resolve to give it a try. You mentally prepare yourself and begin walking south.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of walking, or at least what feels like a few to you, you reach a steep slope. You're hands a shaking, you know what's down there. The thicker forest of pubic hairs surrounding you, curling into the sky, mixed with the overwhelming smell of sweat mixed with mom's musk and pheromones is only serving to give you a very regretful and very hard erection. \"I'm doing this because I need to.\" You kept repeating to yourself over and over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down as far as you can without slipping, and can barely make out the shape of your mom's clitoral hood. There it is. You take a minute to collect yourself before climbing down there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after a very slow climb down, you reach your destination. You stop briefly to take a small rest, your arms killing you. The smell is magnified many times compared to what it was like up top, and your sense of smell heightens as your other senses pick up to compensate for the lack of light, only making it more powerful. Perhaps this wasn't the best idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, you climb down a tad more, until finally, you're standing on top of your own mothers clitoris. It seems...bigger than you would have thought, but maybe that's just your own size influencing you. You take a moment to brace yourself, before stomping repeatedly at full power, jumping up too. Surely she'll feel this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?  </span></div></div>",

She looked at herself in the mirror.  She really needed to brush her hair but she would take care of that later.  Wiping her hands on the towel, your mother let out a loud yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she yawned, she started to suck inward.  You screamed as you were pushed closer and closer to your doom down your mother's gullet.  Trying with all of your might, you grasped onto the little ridges in her tongue in the vain hope that would save you. .but you could barely hold on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as soon as she started, the yawn ended.

She started moving her tongue around a bit throwing you to and fro as she tried to discern what the taste was.  You were flung on the top of one of her molars.

You recognise the voice, but can't see the owner, only feel them as they walk towards Jacqueline, each step producing a <b>*BOOM!*</b> of increasing power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacqueline jumped in surprise as her youngest sister Naomi snuck up on her. How long had she been there? Did she see what happened? Either way, having a second person in the area would be bad for Ethan if he was still around somewhere! She'd have to distract her somehow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh! Hey Naomi, what are you doing up so early?\" She asked, trying to make small conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi put a finger to her chin.<br>\r\n\"Well, I was getting hungry so I was waiting for mom to get up, but then I heard something in the hallway. I looked outside and saw you!\" She answered, finishing with a smile. <i>So she doesn't know</i>, Jacqueline thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you what, I'll make breakfast for you! Just head down to the kitchen and I'll be right there!\" Jacqueline said, hoping that her plan would work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi's face lit up.<br>\r\n\"Really? Yay! Thanks Big sis!\" She said, hugging Jacqueline as she said it. Jacqueline in the meantime trying really hard to control the hug and point it away from your likely spot. At least Naomi bought it, that should give her a little more time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you two doing, hugging right here?\" Kathy's voice says from behind the two, causing Jacqueline to jump for a second time. Now there's a second unaware giant in the area!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy!\" Naomi shouted with excitement. \"Jacqueline's gonna make me breakfast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKathy raised an eyebrow. \"From in front of my door?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, she was kneeling in front of it earlier, but let's go eat first!\" Naomi says, trying to do anything to fast forward towards food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKathy looks at Jacqueline again. \"Why were you in kneeling by my door Jacqueline?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacqueline starts to sweat again. Naomi might be fine, but if Mom keeps moving she'll walk right through the area that you're in! Should she tell them about what happened? But Ethan'd be in serious trouble if Mom learned he was going to steal from her! Not to mention she would be too for shrinking him like this! But if she did nothing, then who knows what could happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Jacqueline was nervous, then you were a nervous wreck. There are three titanic Giantesses all looming above you, and two of them have no idea that you're there! With every movement they make everything shakes as a loud noises boom across the environment, and you had to cover your ears to help stop Naomi's shouting from deafening you even a little. But now, as you look all the way up at the towering full height of your mom, does the fear of being crushed fill you. You can make out her feet barely from where you are, and if they go near you, you doubt you could escape. Each toe seems to be the size of a cruise liner alone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, your Goddess Mom booms at your Goddess Sister again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\"Well, Jacqueline?\"</font></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look towards Jacqueline again, to see her definitely conflicted on what she should say or do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Jacqueline do?</span></div></div>",

You look up to see the monolithic foot of your mother raising countless miles into the air! She was walking! You look towards Jacqueline to see her frozen with fear, she wasn't going to do anything to stop her!? You knew that any running that you did would be pointless, your only hope remaining is if the foot misses, or if your sister saves you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese hopes began to dwindle as your environment became enveloped in shadow, as your mom has chosen to step on this area after all! You can only helplessly look up at the approaching wall that was your mothers sole, which is still dirty and dusty from her sleep, and from walking on the carpet barefoot. It's size is beyond what you had originally thought it was, Mom didn't have very large feet at normal size, but these could probably wipe out half of a city at this scale!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the foot nears you, uncaring for your pleas for survival, it wrinkles slightly in preparation for landing. Each wrinkle was as deep as a canyon! Perhaps if you get lucky you might be able to fit in between one of her wrinkles and dodge being completely stepped on? It's a slim chance but it's all you have, as the foot rapidly approaches! You can both feel and hear the wind being pushed down as the the gigantic foot comes in for it's landing. As the faint smell of sweat permeates the area, all you could do is curl up and hope that, if there is a higher power, it would spare you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for you, in this case the higher power was your mother's foot. And it decided that your fate was to be crushed beneath it. You never felt your body be obliterated underneath the lazy footstep of your uncaring mother, who was only focusing on breakfast and keeping her daughter happy. She would never know that her son met his end as an insignificant speed bump on her path to food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKathy moved onward down the hallway with Naomi, and after waiting a few minutes for Jacqueline decided it would be easier to just cook breakfast herself. By the time she had finished eating what was left of your remains were already wiped off across the floor without a trace. Jacqueline searched for a little while longer, but after no success simply hoped that you were killed by the remote, rather than her being unable to find you, or worse. She never told a soul about your fate. </span></div></div>",

This line of thinking was only meant to distract you from your fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear that you would fail in your attempt to reach Jacqueline's room and retrieve the remote.

If you could free it, then maybe you could hitch a ride and get noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again because gnats were annoying and well... bugs.

At least that was the plan. Unfortunately for you no plan survived first contact with the enemy. It never once crossed your mind that Jacqui might try and use the shrink ray on Frank, thinking it's still a death ray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit! Retreat!\" You shouted. It was one thing to hold the remote in your hands and be on the opposite side, and it was also another to be already tiny and on the business end of the beam for a second time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank sensed your own urgency and began buzzing around like mad trying to get away. To bad for him the beam was just too big and too quick to avoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"ADIOS BUG!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned back as a bright flash enveloped you. \"Jacqueline!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash the gnat was gone. The \"death ray\" had struck again. Jacqueline briefly observed her space to find that the annoying insect was indeed gone. She looked back at the shrink ray and smiled. \"Maybe you're not so bad after all.\" She then turned back to her desk where the hammer lied. \"I think I'll just hold onto you.. y'know, in case of emergency.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jacqueline went to stash the shrink ray away, you were lost in a world far beyond what you could've ever imagined. You felt sick, even Frank wasn't looking too good. She'd hit you again. Jacqueline hit you with another shrink burst again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were probably so small now that even if she wanted to fix you she couldn't, you'd be invisible to the naked eyes. You and Frank were doomed to spend the rest of your lives as less than specks. You were the living equivalent of germs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No! Noooo!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo ended your story. To everyone else you simply vanished one day without a trace. Some speculated you might've run away and others thought foul play might be involved. At the end of the day no one knew for sure, all except one and even her information was inaccurate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacqueline never told anyone about what happened that day.

It sounds like your sister is moving, and probably...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts are answered before you even made them as the sky is filled with an incredibly large pillar that spans out across the horizon!

The entire show, and knowing that you shouldn't be seeing this is getting you aroused, and you can feel the erection in your pants growing, uncaring that the form belongs your sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the fun ends when the stretching stops and the knees begin to bend, angling her feet towards the ground in order to stand up. You, having not moved anywhere, now are left staring straight up at the bottom of Jacqueline's soles as they block the sky! Your eyes widen as you realise the danger and very real chance of you being crushed under these soles, but for some reason you still refuse to move! The feeling of powerlessness as you stare up at your own sister's impossibly large, slightly wrinkled and dirty soles, knowing that they can crush you without their owner ever knowing only turns you on more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the feet both drop down, and the feeling of the sky falling overwhelms you.

She was always fairly tall but now she has truly reached new heights, or at least to you she has! You can't quite make out all of the details the further and further her body stretches into the stratosphere, but from her upper body movements you can tell that she hasn't finished stretching yet either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacqueline then moves onto her final stretch for the morning: The Toe touch. Everything shakes again as her entire body leans forward and draws closer to your location. You duck for cover again as Jacqueline's right hand grasps the toes surrounding you.

No, it's definitely a better idea to just find a good spot in Emily's room and wait for her to get back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou creak open her door just far enough to get in, before sliding in and closing it behind you. The immediate thing you notice is the ever present smell of perfume and nail polish, shown by the collection of colours and types sitting on her desk. But you don't really have that much time for investigating, you need to get yourself in position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrinking on her bed would be the simplest option. It's the focal point of her room, and even if she doesn't go there immediately after getting back, she's guaranteed to be there at some point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you were to go to her closet, you'd have an opportunity when she came back from the shower and went to get some clothes.

Besides, while you're waiting, at least you'll have somewhere comfortable to rest too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're thoughts are interrupted by the sounds of the shower across the hallway turning off. Well, there's not long now, so it's best to not dilly-dally any longer and risk getting caught either during or before the act. Relatively quickly, you hop onto Emily's bed, and while standing on it, you point the remote at yourself and hit the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour vision is immediately blurred and blocked by a rainbow of rushing colours, mixing together into a white light, mixed with a peculiar feeling of falling while still standing on solid ground. Almost as soon as these sensations begin, they end just as quickly, and you are left standing on Emily's bed, but at a new size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt appears that you miscalculated slightly, as you're way smaller than you were expecting to be! That's what happens when you press the button and hope for the best, but it's not like the remote gives any indicator of how much energy is required for what size! You point the remote at yourself again and hit the other button, to grow to a more manageable size, but nothing happens! You look at the screen and, of course, it reads 0%. Looks like you have to live like this for the foreseeable future!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a quick look to your surroundings, and try to absorb how much larger everything is. The pillows on her bed look like they could hold an entire state, maybe even a small country! They just seemed to stretch on for endless miles. You didn't even bother trying to look for the other side of the bed, you knew it was too far away. One of Emily's stuffed toys that she keeps in her room was knocked over when you shrank, and now the thing is looming over you like some creature from a Godzilla or Kaiju movie! You started trying to clear some distance from it, but it seemed like you weren't getting anywhere!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the door to the bedroom, or at least you assume it was from the direction of the noise, creaked open with an ear piercing echo.

The rest of her body is just as similarly huge! Her hands, legs and even her face all look like they span the size of a continent, or at least a country!

Again, it just shouldn't be possible for something of that sheer size to be able to move that quickly!

The shortest member of the family has now become (to you) the largest human to ever exist!

If that wasn't enough, the shockwave from the impact followed shortly after, sending you hurtling back into a nearby strand of the carpet! You let out a cry, thankfully only winded from the impact, but the message was clear. You were truly powerless at this size, small and weak enough to be sent flying just from the footfall from your younger sister standing up! And with the remote's charge still flat, you were completely at the mercy of Naomi, whether she was aware of it or not!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's nothing you could do to avoid or resist Naomi if something disastrous were to happen.

The better news was that her wiping dislodged you from MOST of the saliva so you more trapped in waist deep water then up to your neck in wet cement.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bad news was that you had lost the size remote somewhere and you had to find it fast or you might NEVER regrow to normal size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could even start your search however Naomi looks down at you with her magnifying glass. <font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">\u201cHey bro, I think something of yours is stuck to my finger.\u201d</font> She says, showing you that yes the remote was still caught to her finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank God you didn\u2019t lose it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">\u201cTo make sure we you don\u2019t lose it I\u2019ll put it in my jewelry box.\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat?

Looking up you could see her smooth flat stomach and her budding breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hell are you thinking you wonder as you become aware of your own train of thought about your own little sister!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>BOOM</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snap to attention as Naomi\u2019s goliath finger taps the desk next to you, her other hand holding her magnifying glass to better see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">\u201cBro I really need you to strip, you can\u2019t go into the water with clothes on.\u201d</font> Naomi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWa\u2026 Water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">\u201cSam is hosting a _________ party, so we\u2019ll all be playing in the water!\u201d </font>She said excitedly, <font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">\u201cI even got a cute new two piece bathing suit for it.

Especially one as absolutely disgusting as farting on you? What is she even thinking, who comes up with something like that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully your unintended torture ends rather quickly, as you try to regain your senses after having everything shook up so much. You're able to make out the shape of Naomi's desk, and her other hand to the one you're stuck on reaching for her chair. After pulling the chair out and turning it, Naomi again focuses her attention on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\"OKAY, TIME FOR YOUR PUNISHMENT!\"</font> She says with a small, boming giggle as your finger prison moves towards the centre of the seat. Your life flashes before your eyes and you scream as Naomi drags her finger across the seat, somehow avoiding doing any damage to you in the process as she wipes you off. Luckily, in doing so, you've been freed from her spit, and can move around again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything shakes as a shadow is cast over you and the entire area around you. You look up and see what could only be the rear end of your younger sister approaching you, at a speed that can only be described as 'agonisingly slow'! She was definitely taunting you, and rubbing in how useless it would be for you to try and escape her butt! And no wonder, it definitely feels like a celestial body is falling out of the sky, and its impact point is right where you're standing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\"HEHEHE, DON'T MOVE, OKAY? I DON'T WANNA SQUISH YOU!\"</font> Naomi laughs from above. Damn it! This is definitely going too far! Regardless of your chances, you have to do something! You begin to run away from Naomi, in the hopes that you'd be able to narrowly avoid her butt when she finally sits down. You grab the remote out of your pocket and hold it, it's only getting in the way when your running. Wait, the remote!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at it's screen and it reads 20%. You aren't sure how much size that'd get you, but surely it'd be enough to avoid this! You look up as your world grows increasingly darker, and the butt of Naomi looms ever closer. You don't have much time, you've got to use it now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

OKAY LITTLE BRO, PREPARE YOURSELF!\"</font> Naomi laughs, enjoying the situation she has you stuck in. <font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">\"HOPEFULLY THIS'LL TEACH YOU NOT TO CHEAT NEXT TIME!\"</font> As she begins to move the finger you're trapped on around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" You scream as you struggle against your sticky prison helplessly. Who would Naomi do something like this? Who shoves their speck sized sibling into their panties with the intent of farting on them? You've seen her doing weird things with ants out in the backyard from your window before, but you shudder at what the other potential fates those insects had to go through, and at the thought of you sharing those fates too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll too quickly, your finger prison is now positioned behind Naomi, with your next prison in sight. Naomi's other monolithic hand rushes into sight, and pulls back the waistband around her buttcrack. You can't believe it, this isn't just a threat or prank. She's actually going to do this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Naomi, I'll do anything! Just....not this!\" You shout as loud as you can, but your pleas fall on deaf ears. Well, either that or your voice is too small for her to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">\"I HOPE YOU'RE READY!\"</font> Naomi says with another booming laugh, as she moves her finger, and you, towards her ass. You can do nothing but scream as you're pushed into the abyss.<br>\r\n_____________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi inserts her index finger and gives it a quick (but as gentle as possible) swipe across the inside of her buttcheeks. She then immediately removes it and puts it in front of her face to check for her brother.<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, Nope! Looks like you're in there huh little bro?\" She says, turning to look at her butt. \"Well, good luck in there!\" she adds before snapping her panties shut. Naomi then reaches down and pulls her skirt back up, before lying down on her front and going back to play with her dolls.<br>\r\n_____________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't see anything in the darkness, but you can sure <i>feel</i> everything! As far as you know you've been stuck to one of huge buttcheeks, which were now literally the size of moons! Unfortunately for you, despite being transferred, you're still affixed to Naomi's spit, and you still can't move! You can wriggle a little bit more than you could earlier though, and so you desperately try to get yourself unstuck. You might be stuck in her panties, but you can try and get as far as possible! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with your vision reduced, your other sense have made the unpleasant decision to heighten themselves to make up for it! The smell is indescribably awful, like a dank sweaty pit, mixed with....other things that you'd rather not think about. The smell only gets worse, as small sweat droplets that would normally be unseeable begin to build up in the area around you as well. You've been here for less than a minute and you can't take it anymore!<br>\r\n\"NAOMI! LET ME OUUUUTTTT!!! PLEASE!!\" You cry, tears forming in your eyes, and not just because of the smell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, everything shakes violently, and your new residence shakes violently as you're suddenly smacked in the everywhere with what feels like a large, but soft wall! Clearly this is the opposite cheek, but does this mean that she's moving? But where and why? But these thoughts are halted when you hear another, more ominous rumbling....<br>\r\n___________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh, here it comes!\" Naomi teases. \"Get ready! 3...2....1.....\" And instead of counting 0, Naomi releases the gas she had building up inside of her as a soft 'pfffttt' noise escapes from her behind. Doing nothing but smile, Naomi simply returns to what she was doing.<br>\r\n___________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head is ringing, and everything hurts. You can't feel anything either. Every sense in your body seems to have been knocked out of function from the force of the fart that just hit you. You have no way of telling how far away you were from ground zero, but if you were any closer, you would definitely be dead by now. Blown away like a speck in a hurricane. As the ringing subsides, and you're left with only an agonising headache, your other senses return, including your smell, unfortunately. You immediately throw up, writhing in your saliva prison. You'll never forget this smell for the rest of your life, it'll haunt you to your grave. And Naomi plans to do this to you more than once?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, light and thankfully fresh air flood your doomed landscape as Naomi's finger opens the waistband, you can see that she put her skirt back on as well. You don't dare look down, fearful of what would be waiting down there for you. Surely this is punishment enough? You can only hope Naomi shares these thoughts too..  <br>\r\n   <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That boy, I swear. Sometimes he's a real pain in the butt.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi did her best to hide a smirk, the irony of that comment not lost on her. She moved to sit on one of the chairs by the table. Then for the first time in her life, she carefully sits down. <i>\"Don't wanna squish little bro\"</i> she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKathy then set a plate of food in front of Naomi, and the family all happily shared breakfast together<br>\r\n___________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not sure how much longer you can last. You're entire body is battered by the repeated thumping that Naomi's butt has given you while she was walking, and the smell of death still hasn't left the area! What's worse, now the entire area has constricted and begun to squeeze what's left of your life out of you! This has to mean that she's sitting down, but why would she do that? She has to know that sitting on you at this size would crush you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can hear booming noises from your spot below Naomi. This has to be the rest of your family!<br>\r\n\"Mom! Help! Jacqueline! Emily! Anybody!\" You cry out. You don't care what happens later, you just want somebody to save you from Naomi's butt! But you know that they'd never hear you, let alone see you. Is this what torture feels like? Being in such a hopeless position with help just out of reach?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you're entire world shakes and shifts as your Goddess captor adjusts in her seat. This does nothing to help you, and in fact just adds to the pressure already on you! You begin to writhe and struggle, desperate to escape from Naomi's spit. If you can reach the remote, then even if it makes you an inch tall, it'll be better than being crushed inside your little sisters butt!   </span></div></div>",

Eventually it gets too much and a particularly huge impact between her cheeks winds you, and you drop the remote!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" You scream as you helplessly reach for it as it falls into the abyss!

Did she mean to continue the punishment? You writhe against your saliva bindings again but it's still no use, you're far too small and too weak to be able to break out of it. Whatever Naomi has planned for you, you're completely powerless to resist her. You can only hope that she has mercy on her own brother, or that your arm can somehow get free and reach the remote before something terrible happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything around you darkens, and you cringe as you look up, expecting to see the underwear prison closing on you again. Your eyes widen as instead you see the familiar sight of an approaching mammoth finger! Unable to adjust, you do your best to brace for impact as the massive digit impacts with your small form, before carelessly dragging you with it across the skin of Naomi's butt in an attempt to stick you to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately (Or maybe unfortunately) it succeeds and once again you feel the familiar sticking sensation of being fused with spit on your little sisters finger. Did she lick her finger again and reapply more? Your inability to move despite being grinded and battered by her finger indicates that this likely is true. Your stomach drops as you feel an incredible force pulling you upwards, and you again are thankful you hadn't eaten before shrinking, or you would have surely thrown up. You close your eyes in a feeble attempt to fight the feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling doesn't last very long as you open your eyes when the feeling subsides. Your vision is once again filled with the smiling face of Naomi. She definitely looks pretty pleased with herself, she's definitely enjoying doing these things to you. You pull at your arms again, but they don't budge. You can only watch and wait for what she does next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">\"WELL TINY BRO, DID YOU ENJOY IT IN MY BUTT?\"</font> Naomi's voice booms with a laugh. You wish you could cover your ears. The wall that is her face moves in closer to your position. Naomi points her nose at you and you suddenly feel a rushing wind pulling at you! You're suddenly glad that you're held fast on her finger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">\"HAHAHA BRO! YOU'RE REALLY SMELLY!\"</font> Naomi laughs, even louder than before as she fans you with her free hand. Each swing pushing you with a shockwave of wind. <i>Yeah, because of you!</i> You think, staying silent, knowing that she wouldn't be able to hear you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">\"ANYWAY, IT'S TIME FOR YOUR NEXT PUNISHMENT!\"</font> Naomi says, returning to her smug grin from before. <font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">\"AND THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT!\"</font> She adds. Was she taunting you now as well?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really don't like where this has all been leading. Naomi's beginning to power trip, and if you don't do something to get yourself out of this something seriously bad might happen to you! You don't have any time to think though as the finger begins to move again, pulling you at supersonic speeds towards the next punishment!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is the next punishment?</span></div></div>",

You close your eyes in an effort to make yourself feel a little better, but it doesn't make much of a difference in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the monumental finger ceases to move, and you feel comfortable enough to open your eyes. You look and are immediately greeted by Naomi's huge, grinning face. Looking past her head, you can make out her shoulders,and the rest of her immense body below that. You were above her now for some reason? She had moved her finger above herself and was staring up at you from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you were silent for a moment, Naomi content to just smile up at you, and you nervously waiting for whatver she had planned next. This continued for what felt like eons to you, until finally your little sister made her move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\"AHHHHHHHHH~\"</font> Naomi's voice thunders over the silence, as she opens her mouth as wide as she can. Her tongue, large enough to sweep up a county with a single lick moves out of her mouth too, and rests. It wiggles slightly, almost like it was excited for something to engulf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour blood runs cold. Naomi was motioning like she was about to do the unthinkable. She wasn't really going to eat you was she? That's going wayyy too far! All you wanted was to play a game and mess with the remote with your little sister, you didn't sign up to get put in her butt, farted on and then eaten like nothing! Not to mention, completely gross that she'd eat you when you were just in her butt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\"HEHE, 'ON'T 'ALL IN, 'ITTLE 'RO!!\"</font> Naomi teases, not enunciating properly due to her mouth staying agape. You can't believe she was actually going to do this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time since it happened, you pray that the saliva that's been holding you fast to all of these surfaces holds. If it doesn't, you're going to become tiny little morsel for your kid sister! You hold as still as you can, trying not to loosen it anymore than you have previously. But did your struggles earlier loosen it too much?</span></div></div>",

You hold as still as you can manage, desperately hoping that either the spit holds, or that someone somehow can come into the room and save you from what you're convinced is certain doom inside your little sister's mouth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, life turned out to be much crueller than you hoped, as neither option came to be. The spit finally breaks open, dropping you into a free fall straight towards the awaiting open mouth of Naomi! You scream as you flail around in the air, trying helplessly to do anything to save yourself from your next destination, but of course you were powerless to resist it. You brace yourself for impact as Naomi's grandiose tongue does a small little wiggle in excitement for it's new prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hit the rough, bumpy texture of Naomi's tongue and instantly feel a sharp, searing pain shoot up your right arm. There's definitely been some considerable damage done to it as it goes limp as well. You shout in pain as your tiny body rolls down Naomi's tongue until you eventually splash into a pool of saliva that has built up in one of the divots on her tongue. You retch at being drenched in a second, fresh batch of your little sisters slobber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, an ear-splitting noise roars across your entire environment. You use your good arm to cover one of your ears but the other is defenceless to this catastrophic event. You're sure that Naomi is saying something, but your so close to the source now that you can't make any of it out, it's all just become a mess of intense loud noises so bad that you're about to collapse from a migraine if it keeps up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGraciously, Naomi stops making noise with her voice, and instead chooses to act rather than speak. The ground shakes and you do your best to grip the tongue, as it slowly (and what feels very deliberately) begins to retract inside her mouth! The smell radiating from inside the dark, moist cave is unspeakable. A mix of old food and morning breath, it was almost enough for you to want to be back by her ass. Almost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're injured, and utterly helpless to whatever Naomi's planning. What was she going to do to you?      </span></div></div>",

The humidity ramps up significantly as you feel Naomi's warm breath blows around you. Naomi's mouth acts as a wind tunnel of sorts, focusing her breath hard enough to knock you over! Speaking of her breath, it's just about the worst thing you've ever smelt! The scent of her morning breath mixed with her previous meals fills the environment and wraps around you, with no way to escape from it. You gag as you use your good arm to try and cover your nose as best as you can, but it doesn't help too much, it's overpowering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try your best to get your bearings in your new hellish landscape. You gaze upwards to see a neverending row of towering white pillars, these monstrous structures must be her teeth. You feel fear grip you, if she puts you in the path of one of those teeth you wouldn't last a second! The pearly whites were illuminated by several rows of light, you look to where they originate to see the outside world that was Naomi's bedroom. You consider making a sprint for the exit, but before you could act the tongue wiggled slightly, sending you flying into the air before crashing back down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll over wincing in pain, before your body is assaulted with another pain. An earpiercing sonic boom rips through the environment, loud enough to cause you to force your arms to your head to try and combat the migraine that your getting. You weren't sure what this is, when in reality it was just Naomi letting out a small giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe noise fades out eventually, but your headache maintains. You aren't sure how much more you could take before Naomi accidentally kills you. If it was even an accident at this point after all of this torture! If only you could grab the....remote...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smack yourself on the head. The remote! You can reach it now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach into your pocket and grab the remote. Somehow it's survived everything up until now and appears to be functional. You thank whatever higher power there is and turn the remote to grow yourself. You aren't sure what will happen doing it inside your sister's mouth, but you're willing to take the risk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the more immediate higher power had a different idea. Right before you had a chance to hit the button, Naomi's tongue acts up again, more fiercely than before! For the second time you're thrown into the air, but this time you've been caught off guard and drop the remote!<br>\r\n\"NO!\" You scream in despair. Losing the remote is bad enough, but losing it in a place like this means that you'll probably never find it again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, you won't be given a chance to find it again, as the tongue moves to become a wall instead of a floor, angling you towards the back of the mouth! You scream again as you tumble backwards towards the throat, you can't believe Naomi is actually going to swallow you! Surely she was just playing around and messing with you? This questioned was answered when the tongue angled even more, and pushed. Sending you down into the depths of your sister, screaming.<br>\r\n__________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi, with her mouth still opened, wiggled her tongue around a bit, before swallowing the salvia in her mouth with a small *glick* sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, did I swallow you little bro?\" She giggled, speaking to herself. \"You're so itty-bitty I don't know if I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure of your fate, but not really concerned, Naomi shrugs. Bored, she decides to go down to the kitchen and get breakfast.<br>\r\n_________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, you didn't suffer for long. After being forced down the pitch black tube that was Naomi's oesophagus, you're ejected down into her stomach. Your voice is shot from all the screaming, but it's cut off as you impact with a pool of stomach acids, and are instantly disintegrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were reduced to nothing more than a tiny little morsel for your kid sister.</span></div></div>",

You're sure she'd get a kick out of it after her initial surprise, and besides, if you have second thoughts you can always regrow before Bianca gets here. Confidant in your choice, you hop onto your bed, point the remote at yourself and press the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're blinded by a series of flashing colours that quickly blend into a white light. Before you can react to the light however, it fades away just as quickly. Did it work? You observe your surroundings, and immediately notice a difference in your bedsheets you were sitting on, now able to see the gaps between threads quite clearly, in fact you'd be able to fit between them quite easily if you wanted to! This makes movement tricky, so you're pretty much stuck where you are now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking off far into the distance you can make out your pillows on the other side of the bed on the horizon, and even further into the distance in the other direction is your bedroom door. You can't fully comprehend just how small you've become yet, you're thankful that you shrunk on your bed and not the floor, as you'd probably be overwhelmed by the height of everything, as looking down from the cliff that is the edge of your bed gives a serious fear of heights that you weren't sure that you had before. You turn to look at your clock, and its huge numbers read 8:38. You've got about 20-30 minutes to adjust to this before Bianca arrives.<br>\r\n__________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've had a decent look at everything, and have adjusted to moving between the threads on your sheets in the time spent waiting, so you think everything will be alright. You haven't interacted or seen another person yet, but you could hear what you think was your mother walking past your door a couple of times, so the sounds won't be too much of  a surprise. Suddenly, there's a knock on your door, signaled with a <b>*BOOM!**BOOM!*</b> to you, and before you can react, the door opens and in peeks Bianca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">\"BABE? YOU IN HERE?\"</font> She says, her voice louder than you expected, as she walks into the room. Each step producing it's own <b>*BOOM!*</b> noise, though quieter than the knock, possibly due to the carpet softening the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turns out, you weren't quite ready to see a person yet. You're standing still in shock, looking up at Bianca for what might be the first time ever! As she moves a part of her hair out of her eyes you can feel a bit of the air from the movement all the way here on the bed! How fast did her hand move? You may have underestimated the difference in scale after all! You stand in awe on the edge of your bed, looking up at your girlfriend, as she looks around the room in confusion.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

She was awestruck being this small, yet absolutely terrified at the same time.  She was definitely annoyed with Ethan for choosing to shrink her instead of Ashley.  The most frustrating part was that she had no methods of communication with the two giants now.  She was far too small to be heard.  Furthermore, her cell phone was next to her on the bed when Ethan shrunk her, so it did not shrink with her.

Her she was, stuck at one millimeter tall on the disgusting sole of her best friend's foot, in her boyfriends house no less.  She was going to let both of them have it when she grew back.  Who knows, maybe she'll even shrink them and make them worship her feet.  That'll show them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the distressing reality of the situation began to sink in.  Bianca had no way of contacting Ashley or you.  She couldn't tell them she wasn't having fun and wanted to grow back.  She was far too small to be heard and her cell phone was still normal sized.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe collapsed and curled up into a ball on her best friend's foot.  The smell was overpowering.  She had always thought feet were gross but this was absolutely ridiculous.  A drop of sweat, several times the size of her own body, trickled down Ashley's foot and washed over her, drenching her in the foul liquid.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears now streaming down her face, there was no doubt about it, she was in hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand there, watching Ashley relax on your bed.

Ashley just laughs at that.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching out, you grab Ashley\u2019s sweaty foot.  You spy your one millimeter girlfriend pressed into one of Ashley\u2019s foot wrinkles.  The sight of that makes you nauseous.

Why don't you rub over where Bianca is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain your eyes widen at Ashely's request. This was way over the line, \"No way!\" you said firmly, still gripping thee blonde's sweaty foot. \"That could kill her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley didn't look the least bit phased by your reaction. \"Not if you're gentle, Ethan. Besides I thought it would make you feel better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would that make me feel better?\" you asked, clearly not pleased. You were now beginning to wonder if Ashely was even Bianca's friend at all. You'd shrink her if it weren't for the fact that Bianca might shrink too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshely merely laughs at your reaction. Did she really see nothing wrong with what she was doing. \"Hmm? Why don't you check Bianca's phone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was random. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Check her phone.\" Ashley nodded towards the device. Your eyes land on it too as you gently release the blonde's foot onto the soft cover. You carefully pick up the crimson smart phone, the dark screen reflecting your confused expression. \"Check her messages to be specific.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill not fully understanding, you comply. It was easy to access the device as you knew the password and you smiled pleasantly at the background image of Bianca and yourself at the park. \"What am I looking for again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Messages.\" Ashley sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, you find the messages icon and open it. There were a lot of new messages including the conversation you had with your girlfriend earlier, but it was the one that remained unopened that caught your attention. It was a message from your friend Trent. \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clicked open the message and quickly scanned through it. Then you read it over again... and again... and again... and one more time. Each read made your grip on the phone tighten and your blood pressure rise. You let the device slip from your hands and you turn your full attention to the speck trapped in Ashely's foot wrinkles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... and Trent? Behind my back!?\" you seethed. You were seeing red, a love confession from your best friend to your girlfriend! How could they!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ethan?\" Ashley finally cut, curling her toes slightly. \"The massage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was right, Ashley still wanted you to massage her foot. The bitter rage you felt suddenly manifested into a smirk, \"Sure thing.\" You gripped the foot that held Bianca captive and pressed a thumb into. \"Don't worry. I'll be gentle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly you began pressing your thumbs into the sweaty skin. Ashley groaned in relief and let her head rest into one of your pillows. All guilt and worry you felt from before began to ebb away as you inched closer to were Bianca was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time to teach her a lesson. As gently as possible you pressed your thumb next to her. Again Ashley moaned in delight. \"Wow Ethan? You really are amazing at this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" You grinned.</span></div></div>",

You take this as a sign to continue the massage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you know.....\" Ashley began, lifting her head up and turning back to look at you, a sly smile on her face. \"...I think you missed a spot.\" She teased, telling you that it was time to do what you were both waiting for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" You said, nodding your head. Putting both thumbs together, you pressed in on the sole before you began to slowly slide them down the length of Ashley's foot, and towards the micro Bianca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Bianca, she was absolutely terrified at the moment. She had spent the entire massage either screaming at the giant fingers moving around her, or screaming up at you, trying to explain to you how this was all a misunderstanding, but naturally she was far too small for either of you to hear. It didn't help her that her tiny voice had to compete with Ashley's moaning, either. As your giant thumbs started to drag towards her, she curled up into a ball, hoping that either she'd be too small to be crushed, or that you'll have a change of heart at the last moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't have any changes of heart, however, as your thumbs effortlessly slid over where she was and further down the giant (to her) foot that was holding Bianca captive. Ashley let out a particularly load moan when she felt you finally rub the spot you had been avoiding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, keep it down! I do still have family here at home!\" You scold, annoyed that she might cause you to answer some awkward questions at dinner tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" Ashley apologised, panting, her face flushed pink. \"I just can't believe you actually did it!\" She exclaimed joyously. Readjusting, she moved her foot closer to her face to get a closer look.<br>\r\n\"And how is our little speck-sized cheater?\" She asked. </span></div></div>",

It was extremely hard to tell at Bianca's size, but the distinct lack of blood was a definite indicator. Not only that, but the speck-sized girl was still in the same position as before. Ashley placed her foot back down and smiled at you slyly. \"You really were gentle with her, weren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course you were, you wanted her to suffer for breaking your heart, not kill her. \"Of course. I'm a gentleman.\" you joked as you stared down at your diminished ex. You couldn't even begin to imagine the torture she must've endured at the hands of your massage, but all you knew for certain was you weren't finished with her yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile down below, Bianca was a mess. Your little massage had ground her right into Ashely hot and sweaty skin. At first she thought she was going to do die, but by some miracle she actually managed to survive your massive fingers, The end result however was her being adhered to Ashley's foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could move around somewhat, now she was glued to her best friends sole like macaroni on a school art project. Tears continued to stream down her face as she desperately cried out for help that would never be heard. She wanted more than anything for you to save her, but even she knew that was unlikely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone... Anyone,,, Help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you want to do now?\" Ashely asked as she rolled over on her back. Your eyes immediately went wide at the sudden movement thinking Bianca had been flung. But a quick scan of the blonde's foot put your nerves at ease. It would seem Bianca was glued to Ashley's foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Serves her right?\" You whispered, though Ashley clearly heard you. She to looked down at her foot to see Bianca was still firmly in place. In all her excitement she disregarded her \"best friend's\" safety. Not that she had any regard for it anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde laughed. \"You know, Bianca could probably pass for a mole like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably.\" you agreed. It was true, Bianca could pass for a foot mole and no one would be the wiser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Ethan?\" Ashley smiled up at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about that footjob I promised you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If you didn't have any self control, you'd have probably ripped your pants off the instant she finished asking you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you had a different idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's save that for last.\" You say, regaining some composure. \"Wait here, I've got another idea.\" You say, as you head for the door to your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Ashley says, confused. \"Uhh... okay I guess.\" She relents, a slight look of annoyance on her face, it seems she was looking forward to the footjob almost as much as you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be right back.\" You assure her, closing the door to your room behind you. You quickly head straight for your older sister's room. Surely Jacqueline would have some spare nail polish you could borrow. Reaching her bedroom, you lightly knock on her door a few times. After a few seconds you hear some rustling before the door creaks open and the irritated face of your sister greets you, she was probably still in bed when you knocked. Oops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? Need something?\" She asks, straight to the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Bianca's over, and she was complaining that she forgot to paint her nails before coming over, so I was wondering if she could borrow one of yours real quick.\" You explain, hoping that your lie sounds fairly believable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacqueline sighs. \"Nail polish? That's it? Fine...\" She says, turning around. \"What colour does she want?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, blue?\" You say, unsure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you don't know?\" She asks quizzically, grabbing a small blue bottle. \"I hope she didn't trust you to pick the colour yourself, you've got <i>no</i> idea what you're doing when it comes to stuff like this.\" She says, coming back and placing the bottle in your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess she has more faith in me than you do.\" You fire back, getting slightly antsy the more this conversation goes on. Cutting it off, you begin to walk back to your room. \"Thanks, I'll bring it back soon.\" You assure her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh, sure you will.\" She says in response. You can hear her mutter <i>\"I'll probably have to sneak in and take it back again like usual\"</i> to herself as she closes her door, but you don't show any acknowledgement, after all, you have what you came for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm back\" you say, quickly slipping through your door. Looking at your bed, Ashley was on her phone, her feet resting on top of one another, if you focused really hard, you could <i>just</i> make out the tiny Bianca, still stuck fast to Ashley's sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally.\" She grumbled, putting her phone to the side. \"I was about to leave and have fun with little Bianca by myself.\" She teased, flexing her foot. \"So what did you make me wait for?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This.\" You answer, presenting the bottle of nail polish. Ashley tilted her head to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nail polish? What did you want to give me a pedicure first too?\" She giggled. \"I didn't know you loved my feet as much as your tiny ex-girlfriend does.\" She teased, laughing. You felt your face turn pink at her teasing. Eventually, she stopped laughing so much, and spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright fine, I guess I can roll with this, but first.....\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"...But first, let's move Bianca to somewhere more appropriate for this.\" Ashley says, before scraping her fingernail across the sole of her foot, scratching the tiny speck of a girl onto her nail. Bringing her finger up close to her eye, she gives the micro Bianca a once over before continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still kicking, B? Good. We've got a few more things planned before we grow you back. <i>If</i> we grow you back, that is.\" She finished with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBattered, bruised and exhausted, Bianca couldn't do much more than just look up at the huge, all-encompassing eye that was staring down at her. Weakly, she raised an arm. \"Ash....please....help me.\" She begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she saw or heard this cry for help, Ashley certainly didn't acknowledge it. \"Now then...\" She started, a smile creeping across her face as she lowered her finger back towards her feet. Bianca couldn't do anything but watch as the all too familiar sight of Ashley's gargantuan foot came back into view. And it only got worse as the surface she was on began to tilt downwards, sending her tumbling straight down, back onto her size 10 prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go.\" Ashley said, watching the dot that is her minuscule best friend fall from her fingernail to her big toenail. Leaning back, she relaxed again, before turning her gaze back to you, the sly look on her face still present. \"Okay, I'm ready when you are.\" She said, wiggling her toes for emphasis (And nearly making Bianca throw up as a side effect).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced down at the dancing toes, before looking back at Ashley's smiling face. \"So that's what you had planned, huh? Alright..\" You say, before you kneel down at the side of the bed again, similar to how you were positioned back when you delivered the foot massage not long ago. \"I hope you like blue.\" You say, unscrewing the cap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure whatever picked, it's going to look <i>amazing</i>~\" Ashley sighed, closing her eyes and nestling deep into the pillows on the bed. It seems like she was probably going to get off on this as well. Shaking your head slightly, you start to paint her nails, starting with her pinky toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning, Bianca stood up and started moving, her whole body sore. Picking a direction, she began to go as fast as her body allowed her in that direction, she didn't care if it led to Ashley's foot or to jumping off her toe all the way down to the bed below, she had to get off before you painted over her. Not only would the paint fumes be probably lethal at this size for her, but the idea of being stuck fast to Ashley's toe, while she continued to flirt with her boyfriend (or Ex-boyfriend?) sounded awful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, it's hard to cover much distance when you're the size of a speck, even when you're on something like a toenail, and before long hers was the only nail left to be painted. A huge earthquake struck, knocking the tiny girl over. Looking around, she could see that this was caused by you grabbing and holding Ashley's toe within your fingers. Scrambling to her feet, Bianca started to run as best she could, but it was too late. A shadow loomed over her, and despair set in as the sight of the titanic nail polish brush eclipsed her vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca hoped that what would happen would be that she could cling to the fibres of the brush, and maybe be able to use that to escape this situation, however, these hopes were as squashed as she was as the brush ran over her, smearing her into the surface of Ashley's toenail, and coating her with a dark blue paint. Still not giving up, Bianca tried to crawl the rest of the way there, before suddenly the brushes of doom returned, applying a second coat of polish to Ashley's toenail, and pressing down on Bianca a second time. Trying to move again, the quickly drying nail polish inhibited Bianca from moving at all, securing her firmly to what's now her new home. Unable to do anything else, the microscopic girl let out a scream for someone, anyone to help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Annnd done!\" You say, screwing the bottle back tight, quite pleased with yourself. It doesn't look too bad for your first attempt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm?\" Ashley moans, your voice knocking her out of her stupor. \"Are you? Let's see then.\" She says, bending her flexible legs to give her a better view of the work you've done. \"Hey, not bad Ethan! Maybe I should get you to paint my nails more often!\" She praised, laughing. Ashley squinted, staring intensely at her big toe. \"Geez, Bianca's pretty hard to see though. I can't even tell if she's alive or not.\" She observed, a smile across her face. \"Oh well.\" She said with a sing-song voice, stretching her legs out and letting out a large yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what now?\" You ask her.</span></div></div>",

Well don't worry, she'll be with us the whole entire time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would? Oh, right. You were so lost in your own head you forgot she was still a millimeter tall, painted onto Ashley's big toe. Wow.

No, it would be better if you could somehow find a method that would let you save the girls without her knowing, however unlikely that would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts are interrupted by the sound of a door being opened and then soon shut from the room inside. This was no doubt your mom entering the bathroom, presumably about to start having her shower. You never worked well under pressure so the added time constraint wasn't helping, you pretty much could only think of one solution, and that was to stealth your way into the bathroom and try to reach Bianca and Ashley while tiny, after shrinking yourself with the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a moment to psych yourself up, you quickly (but quietly) enter the main bedroom, which thankfully wasn't locked this time. Doing your best to be quiet, you creep past the discarded clothes and underwear thrown across the floor and make your way to the bathroom door. Again you can hear the familiar humming from your mother, although it was drowned out slightly by the sound of the bathroom fan. This was good, as it would make her less likely to hear you shrinking yourself, and then (If all went well) growing yourself back when you left. You didn't really want to be caught and have to explain to your Mom why you were creeping around her bathroom door while she was having a shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think you have at least a couple of minutes to act before she turns on the shower, so you'll need to move quickly!</span></div></div>",

You know what these things are, but you don't want to dare think about it, they're the carpet fibres that you were just standing on a moment before! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is really bad! Your mom has accidentally shrunken you down to a microscopic size, and what's worse is that she might not even know she did! You look straight up, and past the ceiling of carpet, you can vaguely make out a distorted obelisk further into the sky, too far way to see clearly. That must be your bed. You can only wonder if Ashley got hit with the device too, maybe if it just hit you, she could find you and get you back to normal. Although on the other hand, considering what she did to Bianca....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head. Bianca!

Your now titan-sized mother was heading right for you, and she had no idea she was doing it! To top it off, you had no chance to resist or avoid her dooming footfalls, either! Each step she took was a cataclysmic earthquake that felt like the entire world was going to break open and fracture. Which each thunderous shake, you were knocked off your feet, and before you were able to recover, the next one would strike, sending you sprawling to the ground all over again! Your only hope is if your Mom's steps miss you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they do! Phew!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou aren't given any time to relax, however, as the footsteps continue to keep you helpless.

Wherever you are, I'm not leaving until you come out here!\" She yelled to nowhere in particular, although it was directed at you. Looking around, she didn't see any sign of movement in response to that statement. She sighed.<br>\r\n\"Honestly...\" She grumbled, as she moved to sit down.<br>\r\n______<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, on the beds surface, an ominous shadow loomed over Ashley. Looking up, she saw the waist of Ethan's mom hanging above her, before suddenly the hips pushed out and her ass blocked all light coming from the lamp on the ceiling, turning from a 'normal' jean-clad ass into a large, dark falling object! Ashley screamed as loud as she could, hoping that she would be heard, but her puny voice barely made it to your mom's ass, let alone all the way to her ear. With her size so impossibly puny, there was nothing she could do but watch in fear as what seems to be her death was fast approaching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, in this situation, Ashley didn't have time to consider the irony of being crushed under someone's ass after what she did to Bianca. All she did do was close her eyes, curl up into a ball and pray for a miracle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end....</span></div></div>",

Eventually you just sigh, defeated, and decide to take your chance and hope for the best.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, here you go,\" you say as you reluctantly hand it to her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley smiles and takes it from you.  \"Why thank you, darling,\" she teases in some fake English accent.  \"And you know, a deal is a deal,\" she says laying back on your bed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch in relief as she turns over onto her stomach and removes both of her pants and her underwear.  You are left again with a view of her fantastic looking ass.  If only the circumstances were better.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley shoots you another teasing look.  \"Awwww shucks, Ethan,\" she says.  \"I knew you always liked my butt more than Bianca's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to hold your tongue as you think it's best not to piss off Ashley.  You think again of Bianca and the hell she must be experiencing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" Ashley says, breaking the silence.  \"Let's see what thing can do,\" you watch in horror as Ashley decides to.....</span></div></div>",

You knew she was going to try this sooner or later, but when she went back to the bed a small hope crept in that maybe she wouldn't do it after all. Well, so much for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Ashley, don't do this to me too.\" You plead with her, trying for the umpteenth time to get her to see reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley only smiles back.<br>\r\n\"Of course I wouldn't shoot you with the remote, you silly boy!\" She says with a small laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathe a small sigh of relief, but have a hard time trusting her, after everything that has happened. And the fact that it's still pointed at you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley speaks up again.<br>\r\n\"Not from there anyway. I'd lose you if I shot you while you were over there!\" She beckons with the remote towards her. \"Come over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart sinks as her true intentions reveal themselves again. She was planning to shrink you after all! And now you're left with no option to go along with it, otherwise something awful would happen to Bianca! You slowly walk over towards Ashley, silently cursing yourself for shrinking Bianca and not her like you planned originally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you reach the bed, Ashley points towards a spot on the floor next to her.<br>\r\n\"Kneel\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashley, is that really neces-\"<br>\r\n\"Do it.\" She cuts you off, re aiming the remote at you. You relent, and kneel on the floor next to Ashley. You feel utterly humiliated at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley laughs again, the happiness in her voice obvious.<br>\r\n\"Now there's a good boy. Now then, hold still...\" As she presses the button on the remote to fire. You can barely look, you close your eyes so you don't see what happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel an intense sense of vertigo as you assume the remote shrinks you. The dropping sensation is enough to make you feel sick, mixed with how sick you already felt from what has happened and it's an awfully bad combination. Despite this, you keep your eyes closed, even as the feelings faded away a few seconds later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, everything shakes as an incredibly loud, echoing laugh rings out across the world.<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\"HOW ARE YOU FEELING? I THINK THAT'S A GOOD LOOK FOR YOU ETHAN!\"</font></b> The voice of what could only be Ashley booms around you. You open your eyes in shock at how loud she was, you thought you were on the floor?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around to see that you still were on the floor, only you were incredibly tiny! Somehow you've managed to stay on top of a single piece of the carpet, which is fortunate for you as it's boosted you up by a considerable distance compared to if you went all the way to the floor! You look up at your bed, and it's sheer size floors you. It's so tall that you can barely make out it's summit, as if it was some unimpeachable mountain! And you can't even see at what point its length ends! But that's not what intimidated you the most about the bed, it's what you saw on top of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring down at you from her perch in the heavens was the grinning face of Ashley. You could only see her face poking out over the bed, but it's enough to send a chill down your spine. She's incredibly huge! And what's even worse, is that now you're completely at her mercy! Ashley lets out another world shaking laugh. You aren't sure if it'd because she saw how scared you were, or if she was just enjoying herself that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Ashley intend to do with you?</span></div></div>",

Your mind is racing and you are trying to process what Ashley just said to you.  \"Wait, what?\" you say, panicking.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley smiles and lays back down on your bed.  \"Oh I think you heard me,\" she says.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you want to do that?\" you say, trying to reason with her.  \"I never thought you liked me like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley shrugged, non-chalantly.  \"Eh, I'm really not,\" she laughed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why the fuck would you want me to do that?!\" you cry out in frustration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the fact that you were trying to avoid having a panic attack, somehow, Ashley was as cool and relaxed as she could possibly be.  \"Honestly, because I can.  It'll be like a bonding experience for me and Bianca.\"  She did not sound genuine when she said this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....I can't do this to Bianca,\" you plead.  \"She'll hate me for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley again gave an uncaring shrug.  \"Yeah you're right, I'm sure she's much happier being stuck inside of my butt right now,\" she said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, she's such a bitch,\" you think to yourself but don't dare say out loud.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Ashley said sitting up and starting to walk out of your room.  \"If we're done here I better get going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wait,\" you say.  Ashley turns but you can't bring yourself to make eye contact with her.  \"Stay, and I'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley smiles as she hops back onto your bed.  You on the other hand, just stand there, mentally preparing.  \"This is for you, Bianca,\" you whisper to yourself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm waiting,\" you hear Ashley say seductively.  Turning around, your eyes nearly bulge out of your head as you see her laying on your bed naked.  There was no denying it, despite the fact that you felt guilty about this and having to fuck her to save Bianca, she was ridiculously attractive and it would be tough not to enjoy this.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou strip down and begin to make out with Ashley on your bed.  Even though you are very aroused, you still can't shake how wrong this feels.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you caress Ashley's body, she lets out a moan.  \"That feels nice,\" she whispers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to kiss her but are having an understandably, very hard time focusing.  \"So what do you want me to do?\" you whisper.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley bites her lip and flips over on to her stomach.  \"I've got an idea,\" she says.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What did she think would happen to Bianca?  They were best friends after all, and you loved Bianca more than anything.  \"Wait......what?!\" you manage to spit out, still in partial disbelief as to what you just heard.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I don't want Bianca to get lonely back there,\" Ashley says with a laugh.  Apparently, this was all just one big joke to her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashley, you can't be serious,\" you say.  \"She could get seriously hurt if we do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley's smug grinned turned into a look of annoyance.  \"Look, that's the only way I'm letting her out,\" she says.  It's almost as if she's daring you, testing you to see what you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt soon dawns on you that there is nothing you can do.  When this is all said and done, and you have returned Bianca to normal size, the two of you can have all the fun in the world getting your revenge on Ashley.  But until that time, you had to just focus on keeping her alive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's do it,\" you mumble with a defeated sigh, trying your hardest not to make eye contact.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley sits up and smiles.  \"Now, let's lube you up,\" she says, grabbing your erect cock and lathering it with her tongue.  You try not to think of how good this feels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back over, Ashley grabs the pillow and sticks her ass up at you.  \"All yours,\" she laughs and puckers her asshole.  It would almost be a cute gesture if it wasn't holding your girlfriend hostage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Bianca,\" you whisper, and thrust your hardened penis into Ashley's asshole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside of Ashley's rectum, Bianca was having the worst time of her life.  She could see nothing in the darkness and the stench was close to fatal.  She could only hope and pray that Ethan would rescue her from this literal hell hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hopes briefly flared up, as she saw Ashley's sphincter open up, flooding the rectum with light.  Her small window of happiness came crashing down as she saw what was approaching.  It was a giant penis.  Not just any penis, she knew it was yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca's mind started racing.  Had this been your plan the whole time?  To shrink her then use her as a sex toy while you cheated on her with Ashley.  She had no idea how much you hated this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe screamed and tried to back away as your giant dick got closer and closer.

Like a survivor girl in a horror movie she did the only thing she could do... run. She turned tail and ran her little heart out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on the outside you groaned in reluctant pleasure. Ashley's ass was so tight. It was everything you've dreamed of and then some, warm and moist. You hated yourself for enjoy it, and you hated yourself more knowing that your penis was essentially being used as a torture device for your miniscule girlfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou prayed she was alright in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Ashley seemed to be enjoying herself as well. She moaned in contentment at having her ass filled to the brim. It really helped that your rod was long, hard and powerful, and helped dominate her \"best friend\" at the same time. Each thrust sent ripples of electricity down her spine and she could feel your dick trembling against her anal walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, Ethan! Don't stop!\" Ashley groaned into a pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't like you had much choice in the matter. Disappointing the blonde now would mean sentencing Bianca to life as a butt bug. Again you groaned from the feeling of Ashley's walls and you could feel her sphincter tightening around you. It just felt so good. This was all wrong, but damn it it felt amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently you prayed Bianca would forgive you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley on the other hand giggled as she felt the faintest movement of her other ''guest'' traversing deeper into her rectum. So that's what Bianca was doing to avoid being crushed, running even deeper into her prison. Knowing that made Ashley smile, if she kept that up she might get lost in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca didn't know where she was going and didn't really care at the moment. The light had faded long ago and by some miracle she managed to just barely avoid getting crushed by her boyfriend's penis. Every once and a while she would bump into a wall of flesh but never the less kept running through the winding tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still in flight mode and her brain could still hardly process what was going on on the outside. You were screwing her best friend, cheating on her. Why would you do this to her? How could you do this to her? Was this all planned from the start? Truly she didn't know. All she did know was her heart ached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit!\" You grunted After serval minutes of fucking you were finally reaching your limit. \"Ashley I need to pull out! I'm gonna...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you dare!\" Ashely bit back. \"If you want your micro girlfriend back you have to finish... All the way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe your ears. Ashley wanted you to finish in her ass while Bianca was still in there! \"She could drown!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshely rolled her eyes in annoyance. \"Oh just shut up about Bianca for five minutes and do what you need to do! If you pull out I'm leaving and taking her with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother reminder of how powerless you really were in this situation. Even though you were the one with the remote you were at Ashley's mercy and she was going to make sure you knew it. With a resigned sigh you let yourself go to the pleasure and did what needed to be done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please forgive me Bianca.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let go and came hard into Ashely's ass. Both of you groaned like beasts in heat. The blonde could feel your essence spilling into her and coating her anal walls. It was enough to push her over the edge as her eyes rolled in the back of her head before she collapsed on the bed. You soon followed suit and collapsed along with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly you pulled out, Ashley's ass keeping it's contents locked up tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was Bianca's fate?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You haven't tested it on yourself yet so the feeling is entirely new to you. You held the button for less time than when you shrank Bianca, so you hope that you'll be a little bigger. It'd make finder her easier while not going to far. After a second or two the white light fades, and your vision restores itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turns out, it doesn't feel like you're any bigger than Bianca was when you shrank her, because everything is incredibly huge! Especially Ashley, who's massive form takes up your entire vision in every direction! You shrank between her calves at the end of the bed, and now those two muscles are larger than any building you've ever seen in your life, and seem to stretch on for miles each! Off in the distance you can see her thighs, which dwarf her calves, even from this far away, and just past those you see it. Ashley's ass, which has become even larger than you could ever dream of it being. It'll take you ages to search that entire landmass at this size! Maybe this wasn't such a great idea after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, everything shakes as hear a booming noise all around you!<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\"HEH HEH HEH. WELL THEN, ARE YOU READY TO GO EXPLORING TOO?\"</font></b> the thunderous voice of what could only be Ashley thunders down.

AND IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE LEFT ME A GIFT TOO.\"</font></b> Ashley teases as her gargantuan hand shoots towards you with terrifying speed! You duck and brace for impact, only to be blown over by the force of her hand rushing past you! What's she aiming for? You turn around, and your heart sinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remote! It didn't shrink with you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley's hand wraps around the remote, before pulling it skyward and towards her, and far out of your reach. Not that you'd be able to operate it at your size anyway, but now you truly regret acting so rashly! You've shrunken yourself down to a microscopic size, and just gave your girlfriends captor the only way to fix you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\"THIS IS THE REMOTE, ISN'T IT? SO YOU'RE STUCK AT THAT SIZE UNTIL I FIX YOU NOW? THIS JUST GOT REALLY FUN.\"</font></b> Ashley's voice booms with a giggle as she too realises your situation. She inspects the remote for a second before placing it beside her. She turns back to look at you, a wave of fear overcomes you. Smiling, but without saying anything, Ashley's hand rushes towards you again, ready to grab you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

After a minute of searching you remember that Naomi stepped right where they were and a look of panic spreads across your face and you run to try and stop Naomi when you hear water sloshing and realize your to late.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nThere was a bright flash and everything seemed to grow to enormous size around Bianca and Ashley as the two of them shrunk to a millimeter in height. They were panicing when they heard loud booming steps and looked up to see it was Ethan taking a single step then a huge amount of wind blew Bianca into the air while Ashley managed to grab the huge carpet fibers. Bianca flew high into the air and saw that the wind was caused by Ethan's little sister Naomi. Ashley meanwhile saw a shadow eclipse the sky and two giant fleshy mounds landed right in front of her, nearly blowing her off the strand of fiber she was holding, when she swong back towards it when it the wind stopped and she instantly stick to the surface of flesh, right between Naomi's two smallest toes on her right foot. Ashley felt sick as the foot she was stuck to went flying into the air and back down repeatedly. Bianca meanwhile was floating through the air and landed in a dense forest of black hair which she recognized as Naomi's when she felt the world shake as Naomi made her way to the bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho do you follow?</span></div></div>",

If you shrank yourself before they came and no one knew, they might not even see you or be surprised at all.  The big question is who would tell about you shrinking before they came. . . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, how would you convince them that it was real too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat in the chair by your desk to think it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnock, knock, knock!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree gentle raps on your door disturbed your thought process as you turned to look at your door.  You watched your mother Kathy's head pop into the entrance of your door as she peered inside.  Her brown hair slightly concealed her eyes as she looked like she literally just woke up like 5 minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ethan? Are you awake?\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes, obviously you were awake she was looking right at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, mom.  What is it?\" you said in a gruntled tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to let you know that I'm going to have some snacks on the table if you want to grab any because Cynthia is coming over to visit.  I have some chips and dip out, okay?\" she said, wiping her hair behind her head as she started looking into your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a little early for chips and dip but at least she hadn't gotten the wine out this early yet, although with Cynthia coming, that might soon change if she arrived.  It was starting to look like your house was going to be quite full with your mother and Cynthia right outside the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, this could be a good opportunity to really have some fun with this new shrinking device.  Imagine being small around all 5 ladies, or maybe having some of them be small around you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother idea popped into your head, a tiny vacation!  You and your girlfriend could shrink down and stay somewhere in your room. You were not sure if it would be a good idea though to tell your mom.  She probably would worry too much and you didn't want that at all.  Still, if you did then you could surprise both of them when they got here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some time left before they arrived, you started doing some digging online.  Especially about this remote.  You still had no idea where it came from or how it got here after all.  You googled some of the marks on the remote and found nothing.  Strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting away the mystery of the remote, you needed to decide who to tell before the girls got there.  Spinning a bit in your desk chair, you decided to tell. . . </span></div></div>",

This would work, heh heh. . yes.  You started doing some more googling on your computer about shrinking and remotes.  There had to be something. . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnock Knock Knock!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again your door was assailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is it?\" You asked, grabbing the shrinking remote firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ethan!\" you hear the loud noise coming from your girlfriend Bianca.  You smile a bit, a little excited about the day to come.  Your girlfriend came in with a light blue tank top, revealing her nice generous cleavage as she came over to hug you.  Her arms wrapped around you as she planted a few kisses.  Your arms wrapped around her jeans, squeezing her ass as she was on top of you pushing your rolling chair back a bit.  Her black hair got into your face a little from the surprise assault, not that you were complaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, get a room you too.\" you heard from across the room.  Ashley entered the room still peering down at her phone as she entered.  Seeing your girlfriend and Ashley together was quite the size difference, given that she was about a foot taller than her.  She was wearing a pair of short exercise shorts and a white tank top as she entered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am in a room, mine.\" you said with a grin, Ashley moving over towards her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am so excited, Ethan.  What is this surprise all about!  Is it the chips on the table? I already ate some of them.\" Bianca said in a bubbily tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, not that . . it's ehh. . . \" you stopped to think.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClank!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you heard the noise of two glasses clanking together followed by a sudden burst of laughter coming from the other room.  It seemed that Cynthia had gotten here too.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like your mom's friend is here.\" Ashley began as she peered over with a bit of a smile, \"Maybe we should see about getting a little wine for ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a little early though, don't you think, Ashley?\" Bianca said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but that doesn't mean we have to start downing it all right now.  We can just hold onto some for later. . or now too, heh heh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom isn't going to let us have any of her alcohol.  You know how she is with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stuck your head out of your room and looked over into the kitchen.  It seemed the two women were sitting at the table, talking, drinking, and eating some of the chips and dip.  Damn, it looks like Cynthia brought five full bottles of wine?  Were they going to chain drink all day long?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Ethan, your mom sure likes to drink.\" Ashley said, almost a little worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not like this normally, Cynthia brings out a different side of her.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what's the plan today?.\" Bianca said, still gravitating around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think Ethan has something in mind.\" Ashley said..  She started crawling on your bed, her ass sticking upward.  Wow, it looked really good as you watched her sway back and forth reaching for behind your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ethan!\" Bianca said noticing where your eyes were staring at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehhh. . \" you started, \"Bianca. . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca looked at you, a bit peeved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Bianca,\" you moaned like a fake sick person, \"I don't feel so good.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got up out of the chair and sat down on your desk as you imitated Tom Holland's Spider-Man.  Here would be the perfect place to shrink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not going to get you out of trouble, Spidey.\" Bianca said shaking her head at such a lame reference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClutching the remote from behind your back, you were ready to shrink yourself.  You still were not sure if the remote would shrink with you while it was in your hand.  This could go totally wrong, especially if the remote broke.  Still, you had to do it.  You had to show them this thing was for real.  You were. . .pretty sure it would shrink down with you.  Closing your eyes, you hit the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BZZZZZTTTTTTT!!!!!!  </b></span></div></div>",

As you started to shrink, you realized the only way it wouldn't have shrunk with you is if you accidentally let it go or something. You watched as your girlfriend and her friend got bigger and bigger and bigger!  The whole table you were on was so massive in size but all that was nothing compared to the size of your girlfriend.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca's enormous face hovered over the table, a living planet.compared to you!  You realized that you were way smaller than you had planned to be. You watched your now God like girlfriend as she peered down at you; her opening her mouth and. . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!\"</b> She screamed, so loud so bellowing that your ears popped and your body shook at just how gigantic she was.  The ground on the table shook and it wasn't long before the screaming became a chorus as Ashley joined Bianca too with her shrieks.  The shockwave was so loud that you fell down from such massive noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, they both stopped, you now recovering from your hurt ear drums as you put your hands to your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-ethan. . w-wha. . w-wha. .  y-you are. . s-so small!!\" Bianca said her face in total shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the ground shake as Ashley came over quickly her face peering down as she watched you in total disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bianca, he. . he. .

She put her pointer finger down beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He told me he would do this, but. . wow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>WHAM!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gigantic finger slammed down next to you, it was like a building crashed down beside you.  You couldn't believe you were so incredibly tiny.  You looked at the remote.  20%.  That didn't seem like enough juice to get you back to normal size.  You'd have to wait it out a bit for it to recharge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second. . he told you but he didn't tell me?  Ethan!!\" she screamed, one again almost knocking you over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, he said he wanted it to be a surprise.  I thought he drank too much cough syrup again, to be honest.\" Ashley said pushing her finger towards you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, little one, come on.  Get on.\" she said, moving her finger downward so her large fingernail created a ramp upward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitantly, you began to climb up and onto Ashley's massive finger.  You were surprised at just how incredibly small you were and how big everything around you was.  You were pretty glad that you told Ashley beforehand though, just in case Bianca thought you were a bug but. . you did shrink down right in front of her too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Woosh!!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air felt like it was pulled apart and gravity shifted as the tall blonde haired woman brought you up towards her enormous face.  Unknowingly, she breathed on top of you, the strong current and smell of her air totally encapsulating your entire being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!!  You are so fucking tiny!\" Ashley said as she looked at you on the top of her pointer finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful with him, if you drop him. . he could get seriously hurt!\"  Bianca said trying to see her now speck sized boyfriend but due to Ashley's height it was like a kid trying to see over an adult's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You worry too much, Bianca, I'm not going to. . \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Knock, Knock, Knock!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door suddenly shook and both the girls shook with it in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you alright in there?

Almost involuntarily, your eyes would end up lost in her sizable rack. Now it was all you could see, a veritable landscape of pale skin. You were wedged between the fleshy mountains, her cleavage threatening to swallow you every time she inhaled. Your face was pressed awkwardly into a frisbee-sized freckle. The heavy bulk of her breasts made it impossible for you to do anything but wriggle around a bit. They were simply too big to escape. You gave up and sulked momentarily, remembering how you'd glanced at your soft prison just a few minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ethan...you down here?\" Bianca crouched, searching the carpet for your tiny form. She yelped as a pair of bare feet stepped carelessly into her line of vision. \"Ash, be careful! You could squish him!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit- sorry.\" Ashley sheepishly tiptoed back a bit before lowering herself down as well. They looked around intently, hoping you hadn't gotten lost in the field of beige fiber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slipped further between Bianca's massive boobs as she moved. There was barely enough space to breathe in the soft valley. Her bra added a torturous amount of pressure, accentuating her already ample cleavage. The usually eye-catching display was now dangerously close to smothering you. You felt light-headed as you were completely entombed by warm flesh. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If she was less flustered, she could have realised it was positioned right below Ashley's finger at the time you went missing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the soft skin compress you from all sides, and definitely get the feeling that you won't be safe here if you don't either get discovered or get out soon. The entire experience is what you could describe as what would happen if someone was to get enveloped and smothered by an army of pillows, only in this case it's much sweatier, and as Bianca and Ashley's panicked voices boom above, more louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting pressed together so tightly, you can feel the size remote jabbing into your left leg from the pocket it's in. It's charge would still be fairly low so pulling it out is only asking for you to drop it, and if that happens you'll most likely spend the rest of your life at this size. You shudder at that thought. Doing it occasionally is fine, but permanently? Never!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel something uncomfortable pressing into your right leg too, but you're unsure of what it could be. You wriggle your arm into the pocket, and feel a rectangular smooth surface. Oh, it's your phone. You must have forgotten to take it out when you shrunk an it must have shrunk with you. Wait, that's it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou aren't sure if your phone will work properly at this size, but if it does, then you can just call Bianca or Ashley from here, and they should be able to find you after you tell them where you are! It's a plan based on a major assumption, but it's the only one you can think of in the moment! Struggling slightly, you manage to squeeze your arm out of the pocket and up to your head, holding your phone. You select 'Bianca' from your contact list, and to your amazement the phone actually starts dialling!

Good thinking, Bianca.\" Ashley said now looking more closely on her own body and hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, look. . the echo wasn't very strong that time.  He must not be on you. . but. . he must be on me.\" She said realizing your predicament as she moved the cell phone away from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still jostled around a bit, her big heaving breasts again sucking you down.  You were now having trouble breathing and the only noise you were making in your phone was your coughing voice as the weight only got more intense.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry, Bianca, it sounds like he's coughing.\" Ashley said listening to your feint coughs coming from Bianca's phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls looked frantically over for you, Ashley looking around Bianca and her back, Bianca looking through the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe he is so small that I can't even feel him on me.  I have no idea where he is.\" your worried girlfriend said in disbelief.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she didn't find you soon, you'd be pulverized for sure.  An idea popped in your head though, maybe you could intentionally go deeper into the cleavage and try to fall on her lower body.  That would at least buy you some time so you don't get crushed in her cleavage.</span></div></div>",

You try to quickly grab it again but it's already too late! Your hand grabs nothing as a flash blinds your eyes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour vision returns a few seconds later, and you're met with a strange new world. You're incredibly small! What was before your desk is now what appears to be an endless flat landscape! A few hundred metres off in the distance you can see what looks like the end of the earth, but it's actually just the edge of the desk!

Either she doesn't notice your movements or they're too small for her to see! One of her arms begin to move towards you as her hand suddenly enters your line of sight and blocks the sky! You recoil in fear at the sight of it, forgetting for a moment that it belongs to your gentle girlfriend, as you watch her hand shoot across the sky at frightening speeds.

You can't be any bigger than a millimetre, if that! You silently thank yourself for only tapping the button if it caused this.

As she approaches,each step throws you around even more than the last, and you get more and more overwhelmed by her sheer dominating presence, being able to completely control your fate with just her footsteps. As everything intensifies, you begin to see more and more details, such as the unnoticeable cracks and callouses on her feet, the build-up of dust and dirt on her sole, the overpowering scent of lotion applied who knows how long ago. Eventually, the earthquakes, and thus the footsteps as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look in front and are greeted with a sheer wall of white as far as you can see in every direction. You know from your situation that you are looking at a part of her foot up close, but it's size terrifies you, especially with it being a few miles away from you, or, in non-speck measurements, you're 1 centimetre from her pinky toe. You feel like cowering and hiding, and this is just your little sister! You can't fathom what kind of Gargantuan Goddess that Mom and Cynthia have become! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to look up at Emily's face, but it's too far in the distance for you to make out any details, you have no idea what the intentions of this divine being are. And then a terrifying thought hits you. You didn't check behind you when you shrunk, what if she saw something? At this size with no way to grow back yet, if she finds you you are completely at her mercy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

She didn't eat breakfast that long ago but she didn't want to wait until lunch, and she's hungry now. As she reaches the first floor she rounds the corner, and just as she does so she sees what looks like a glowing blob rapidly sink into the floor by the back door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...\" She mumbled to herself. Curious, she walks over to the back door, to the spot that she thinks the blob disappeared at, or at least where she thinks it happened.<br>\r\n__________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is real bad, you're pretty much in a no-win scenario here. There are 3 possible options here, and all 3 suck. You can either be seen by Emily, and who knows what happens next from that. You can avoid detection, but get crushed underfoot accidentally anyway, or you can avoid detection completely, but then you're still stuck at a microscopic size for the foreseeable future anyway. But if it's any, you're praying to a higher power that's it the third option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts are again interrupted by the movements of the living titan in front of you. Impossible to be heard normally, you cover your ears as the sounds of Emily's bones and muscle movements threaten to deafen you from their close range. Emily readjusts herself to be squatting now above you. Her face is now barely in visible range, as it appears faded and distorted from how far away it is. Despite this, you can feel her eyes scanning the area, and over you as well. Fortunately you're so small that she still can't see you despite moving in for a closer look, trying to find any advantage that you can take from this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the Goddess Speaks<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">\"I know I saw something....\"</font> To Emily this was a mumble, but to you she may as well have beat you over the head with a bat from the force of the sound waves hitting your body. Unfortunately for you, which seems to be a common occurrence over the last few minutes, Emily again decides she needs to look closer. She readjusts again, laying her arms down on the ground for support (While causing more earthquakes and chaos for you) she moves her head right over the tile that you currently inhabit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily's face is much clearer now, as it has become the sky over your puny world. Her breaths provide both a constant booming noise and a fierce wind for you as well. And to top it off her arms now trap you, leaving you with only a single direction that does not contain Emily's expansive body. Not that escape was ever an option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear begins to grip you anew. There is a very real chance that Emily will spot you from this close and at this angle. regardless of size you do stand out against white tile, and if she detects you as a living being it's curtains for you. Every instinct in your body tells you to run, but you know that might give you away. However, at that moment your eyes meet with the Goddesses, and you can see every detail of her eye stopping and focusing. This is it, she saw you! You need to go now! You turn and run for one of the cracks between tiles, hoping you can lose her there.   </span></div></div>",

You look up, but can't see your mother, only the back and underside of the chair containing her now gargantuan mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take another look around, trying to scale yourself more accurately before you approach.

It would just feel too weird to spy on your own mom, even if she objectively would look better to other men who weren't related to her. You make the long trek towards Cynthia's chair that is miles upon miles away. Luckily for you, the women are talking about something that makes them temporarily forget about the request they gave you. Unfortunately for you, this conversation creates unintentional chaos during your travels. The women's voices are so loud as they are enthusiastically laughing and you damn near have to cover your ears to stop the noise from shattering your ear drums. You never realized how much your mom moves her feet while talking, lifting her sandal-encased foot up just a few inches off the ground before tapping down causes cataclysmic events that make your legs buckle underneath you as you fall to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's been several minutes now and at this point you are starting to be able to actually see your mom's full body as you get further ahead of her chair. Even though she is closer than Cynthia, you have a hard time even making out her facial features due to the vast distance from how high above she is to you. Meanwhile the slightest breeze blows outside, this breeze is like a strong hurricane gale at your size. Your body is forced against one of the many boulders that range from the size of houses to large enough to crush warehouse complexes. In other words, a grain of sand stops you from being whisked away like dust. <br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><br>\r\n\"Hey, where are those drinks? Did Ethan get lost?\"</font></b> Cynthia's voice thunders from the distance with an echo distorting it to it barely being intelligible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">\"Wow, I almost forgot! It has been awhile ago. I'm going to smack him if he's doing something else.\"</font></b> Your mom's voice bellows even louder from behind you being that she is closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a loud grunt, your mom shocks you as she lifts her body from the lawn chair, it's fibers and frame making a high pitch squeal from the massive weight being released from it. Miles upon miles above you now stands your once petite, and slightly pudgy mother is now a cosmic goddess to you that you have to strain your neck all the way back to see the tip top of her blurry features. Anything past the bottom of her well-worn, black sandals are is so difficult to make out. <br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b><br>\r\n\"Just a moment, I'll get us some drinks myself\"</b></font>, Your mom scolds with frustration before stepping away from the chair and towards the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first step of the titaness sends the sole of her sandal careening above you to block out all light as you can't help but scream out in fear. Under the sandal, you can make out dirt and grime that would engulf city blocks, the crushed carcass of an ant bigger than Godzilla, and plenty of large, boulder-sized grains of sand that fall around you like hail. Somehow you are lucky enough not to be crushed by the rain of sand before the sandal moves away faster than the speed of sound and crashes to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>BOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiles away, your mom's foot lands and she continues her walk towards the house. Each step she takes as she gets further away makes less of an audible boom and intense earthquake before she is finally in the house and you are left in a relatively peaceful environment consisting of you and Cynthia still sitting in her chair miles away. Knowing this is your chance to get to Cynthia without the loud voices and disruptive earthquakes caused by your mom's feet, you use your athleticism to run towards Cynthia with full speed as you hope your mom uses the time in the house to do things other than just get drinks so she will take more time before sitting back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you get closer to Cynthia, she gets bigger and bigger causing you to subconsciously slow down as you start to become disheartened from approaching this increasingly intimidating giantess. With you finally closer to her chair than your mom's, it is crystal clear that she is way bigger than Mom. Really, at six feet tall, Cynthia is bigger than the average guy at normal sized. If your mom is a cosmic mass like the Moon, then Cynthia is the Earth. The first thing you notice is her large barefeet, as she lives only next door, she did not bother wearing shoes to walk to the backyard. Her feet are wide and all-encompassing with long, slender toes compared to your Mom's. Although her feet look older and less taken care of with callouses, dry skin, and chipping red polish; they would still be incredibly sexy if you weren't so scared right now. Looking past the throbbing veins on top of her feet, you follow up her impossibly long legs covered in denim capris to her black t-shirt to the facial features that you can barely make out and finally her short, blonde hair. The neighbor that you once found jokey and slightly annoying is now an intimidating goddess and you can't help but realize how silly it is to be so scared of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, you went from running towards her to walking slowly as your legs tremble. You are still miles away but feel you basically met your objective. She is so tall that you fear getting any closer and she might just stretch her legs a little forward or slump back in her chair and you'd have to run for your life from her massive, middle-aged feet. You think you may have seen enough for today and would like to grow back now. Perhaps next time you use the remote you'll be more bold to get closer. Although you know you need to get a safe distance away where the women won't be able to see you before growing back, you decide to at least check the remote to see the charge. As you pull it out your pocket, another breeze outside blows. Once again it is like a hurricane and you are forced to hold onto a nearby boulder for cover, but not before the remote is blown from out your hand! You watch in horror as the remote is blown up towards Cynthia's body and you see it turn into a barely noticeable dot before completely disappearing as it floated somewhere between the bottom of her black shirt or the top of it due to the remote blending in with the shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to have a mini-panic attack. Without that remote, you are stuck at somewhere between speck and microscopic sized. If you want any hope at survival or a normal life, you need to get to Cynthia! Now you have no choice but to get closer...</span></div></div>",

You'd probably be kept in a shoebox or container of some kind, where your mom and sisters could keep an eye on you and take care of you without harming you. Of course, this scenario would involve you being found, rather than the far more likely scenario of you being splattered underneath Cynthia's feet without her ever knowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head, trying to clear those thoughts out of your head, as well as to try and shake away the nerves keeping you from approaching the impossibly huge mature woman any further. Nervously, you take a step forward, then another step. Alright. You can do this! You begin to formulate a plan as Cynthia grows ever larger with each step you take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, you couldn't really come up with anything concrete, there were too many variables out of your control. The best plan you have at the moment is just 'Climb up her foot and leg, and hope you don't get killed trying it'. It doesn't exactly give you confidence, but you have no choice if you ever want to become anything other than a speck for the rest of your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slow down again as you begin your final approach to Cynthia's foot. Remarkably it's been mostly still, only knocking you over with tremors from subconscious wiggles a couple of times. You don't know how it's been since your mom left, but you feel like if she comes back at this point the foot will become a lot more active and infinitely more dangerous. You can't tell what Cynthia is doing or planning, since from this perspective all you can see of her is a colossal foot spanning more than a dozen city blocks, attached to a leg that stretches on into the sky for what seems like forever, reaching the heavens that was about one foot off the ground in actual measurements. You take a big gulp and run for the ball of her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stumble a few times on approach from the tremors caused by her toes bouncing up and down, and the air around you grows a lot more humid and musty, but you deal with it and press on. You leap forward and stretch your arms out in an attempt to grab on when you get close. Fortunately you do so with little issue, your right hand finding an easy grip between some of her wrinkles, and your left hand pulling you up after pushing down on some dried skin hanging off her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wall of flesh that is Cynthia's foot goes on for seemingly forever, so you can't really tell what part of her foot your clinging to. You were aiming for the ball of her foot, but all you know is that you aren't near her toes, otherwise you'd probably have been smashed underneath them or grinded between them by now. Pressing your ahead against the skin, you can very clearly hear blood rushing through the nearby veins, again rubbing in how small you are to be able to hear something like that clearly. Wincing, you begin to quickly scamper up Cynthia's foot before something can happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were nearing the peak of Mt. Foot when...</span></div></div>",

You <i>know</i> that you have to climb this towering middle-aged woman that used to be your neighbour, but her sheer size has left you so intimidated that you just can't bring yourself to move any closer! Not to mention the very real possibility of being crushed without a trace while trying to climb up the titanic, fidgeting feet, which are your only way up Cynthia's body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>BOOOOOOOOMM!!</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're suddenly thrown off your feet by a cataclysmic and violent earthquake, knocking you to the ground. You groan to yourself as you get covered in small scrapes from hitting the harsh ground like that, and look around for the source, though the familiar booming noise has already alerted you to what it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExiting back out through the house was the colossal form of your mother, who had returned a lot quicker than you had originally thought she would! You still can't make out too many details past her toes, especially not when she's this far away from you, but you can see her carrying....something in her hands. It's probably the drinks but you can't say for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">\"I'm baaaaaackkk!\"</font></b> Your Mom's deafening voice thunders around in a sing-song voice, as her colossal legs start to move her closer to you with terrifying speed and power, each step a more intense crash and earthquake than the last. But you should be okay, you're closer to Cynthia now, and she's just heading back to her chair...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs what you thought, until she stepped right past it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What!? But why would she...?\"</i> Are the thoughts that run through your head, but you don't have time to think of an end to these thoughts as the same familiar shadow as before looms over you. You look up and your knees buckle at the sight of the bottom of your Mom's sandal, covered in dirt and dust, and you noted, an extra crushed ant than when you last saw it. It must have been stepped on when she was in the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe never ending wall of sandal grows larger and larger, or more accurately closer and closer, and you realise that this time there will be no miracle dodge. It's gonna step right on you! You finally move your legs, you need to get away! But the fear of this situation overcomes you, as your legs give out and you fall over barely after you began to move. You look up at your impending doom, and hopelessly put your hand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOM! NOOOOOO!\"<br>\r\n____________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go!\" Kathy said, handing a drink to her friend, before spinning around on one foot and heading back to the chair she was seated at before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, you didn't have to come over here! I could have reached you from here!\" Cynthia said, thanking her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense! You're the guest, so I should be polite!\" Kathy said with a laugh, putting her feet up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I won't say no!\" Cynthia laughed back. \"Did you see Ethan when you went in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKathy's face turned to a frown.<br>\r\n\"No I didn't! That boy sometimes, he disappears when you need him the most! Why did he even tell us he would get them!?\" She vented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia shrugged.<br>\r\n\"Who knows? Men, huh?\" Then, something caught her eye. \"Hey, K? You've got bugs stuck to your shoe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Ugh! Gross! I hate bugs!\" Kathy yelled, looking at the bottom of her sandal to confirm. And sure enough, there were a couple of ants squashed flat, as well as a small red splat, but it was too small for her to notice. Huffing, she went back to relaxing.<br>\r\n\"Well, serves them right! If they didn't want to get squashed they shouldn't have been underfoot!\" She declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia shrugged again.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess you're right.\" She confirmed, and the two of them continued their conversation from before.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were feeling brave at first in your quest to get the remote back from the giga-sized neighbor but as you closed in from a few miles away or less than a foot at normal size, she was becoming too intimidating to take another step. There were just too many factors that discouraged you from your plan. For one, it is apparent that as you get closer, it will be nearly impossible to climb Cynthia. You're pretty sure that the tiny ridges in her toes as so big and deep that you could get stuck inside them like a canyon. Perhaps you can get lucky and find some pieces of dry skin to hold onto and climb up her but even her smallest toe is like a mountain that I would consider myself to be successful to climb if I were normal sized and scaled something proportionate to it. Nevertheless, I'd still have to make my way up the toe I scale and onto her foot before finding out how to climb her legs that extend for miles above. In the meantime, I'd have to hope that Cynthia decides to sit in one place and talk to my mother for most of the day until late at night because that's how long it would take to reach her shirt if I climbed nonstop without rest, which would be impossible for the most fit climber. Of course, any movement that Cynthia makes would most likely be too intense to keep hold of her and would send me falling into a splat on the pavement or wherever she walks to. But hey, if I'm fortunate enough to make it to the shirt, I can then try to spend the next few hours finding the remote among the folds and crevices of fabric, if it didn't fall off her to be lost forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, the biggest issue with climbing Cynthia is that you didn't realize just how much people idly move their feet. A slight, lazily flex of her titanic toes lifts them thousands of feet in the air before they come down to make the ground quake, not to mention the chaos caused when she occasionally taps her foot. Cynthia leans back on her chair and starts rubbing her feet along the pavement, allowing the rocky and rough ground to act as a file for her callused soles. To you, the feet move back and forth alternatively as speeds that nearly make them a blur. The scraping noises from gestures were earsplitting and a gust was generated from the movement that made you cower to the ground, almost as if you were praying to the massive goddess to stop. The middle aged woman cared nothing of the plight of the ants at her feet, nevertheless the specks of dust as she continued to massage her soles against the ground for a little longer before lifting them up to allow the air to cool them down from the friction heat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly got up from the ground to look at a debris field of dry skin that could blanket many homes at once singularly. Cynthia's wide soles and long toes raised to reveal her expansive soles with a mixture of new pink skin and dusty white, callus as a visible wave of heat dissipated from under them before she allowed her feet to slam down, creating a shock wave that sent flakes of skin, boulder-sized rocks, and silt flying away like dust in the wind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the sun above compared with your fear and stress had you pouring sweat as your tiny size made you much more susceptible to the temperature but you aren't the only one getting afflicted by the sun. Cynthia started having small amounts of sweat that weren't enough to form droplets but definitely made parts of her skin moist. Even though her friend has only been gone for a few minutes and should be back anything now, she decides she will just meet her inside and they can catch up in the air conditioning. Cynthia rises up from her chair, creating even more havoc on the supports of the lawn chair than your Mom did when she got up earlier. At six feet tall, Cynthia was already much taller than your usually petite mother but at your tiny size, she is so tall that craning your head all the way back to make out any discernible figure of blurry colossus just puts your neck in pain and shatters your equilibrium as you start getting dizzy. That's when you see Cynthia's left foot move at a bewildering speed as it travels miles ahead in less than a second to reach miles to the side of you, enough to make your legs collapse from the resulting <b><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">Boooooooooooooooooooom</font></b> and earthquake associated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you see Cynthia's right foot move and you are right in front of it! \"Shit!\" You scream out before uselessly getting up to run as <font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>Whoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooosh! </b></font> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive sole swings from far above as it blots out almost all light and temporarily becomes a sky to you that spans for miles. You barely get a look at the view of blurry landscape above you before Cynthia's foot lands just behind your position with her cracked heel crashing onto the ground to create a deafening <b><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM </font></b> and the displaced air sends you sliding against the ground like the debris from earlier. Bloody scrapes and scratches line your body from sliding against the rough terrain at high speeds before your back collides against a dumpster truck-sized flake of dry skin left over from Cynthia, shielding you from a deadly impact with a massive, boulder-sized grain of sand behind it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Cynthia casually walks away. Each of her powerful steps becoming less intense with the increasing distance as she makes her way to the back door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM</font></b>, <b><font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">Boooooooooooooom</font></b>, <b><font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">booooooooom</font></b>, <b><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">booooom</font></b>, <b>boom</b>!<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs Cynthia disappears out of sight, you slowly get up and grasp your aching left shoulder before looking around to see that you must have been flung very far away. The lawn chairs are much further in the distance than before and you are now closer to the edge of the backyard cement pad where you are met with an infinite jungle of grass which would resemble trees in a forest if the trees could be taller than skyscrapers. From here, you can hear alien-like sounds of clicks and shrieks from the dense forest as it is a battleground and wilderness of gigantic bugs preying and mating in an endless cycle. Having Mom and Cynthia around allowed you to be relatively safe from the bugs since you were near them but now that you are out alone, you are noticing more activity. A fly the size of a blimp hovers from high above to cast a shadow over you before flying at supersonic speed away. You didn't realize that this was just a tiny fruit fly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself wishing that you didn't slow down when trying to get to Cynthia. You would've ended up being crushed by the giant neighbor but that would be better than you current fate to either die in the increasing heat of the sun from dehydration or be eaten by an insect. It's not like you can just travel back inside, it would take days to reach the house and a small step that leads to the backdoor would be like a miles high cliff to you. Going to another neighbor's house would take even longer and in the grass forest death is assured. Before you can start sobbing in hopelessness, another shadow is cast over you causing you to look up to see a dandelion seed float away from far above. You then realize that it came from a dandelion plant that somehow survived the weed eater and your Mom pulling them! You can climb up the dandelion and use the seeds as a way to travel!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems so simple but once again as you get closer to the \"treeline\", the dandelion grows bigger as you see that it would not be unlike climbing a skyscraper.... nope, now that you're closer it's even taller, much taller. It would take hours to climb the stem but even that is much faster than any alternative out there. You continue your trek to the plant when you see something out the corner of your right eye. You look to see a gigantic, brown spider that is crawling right towards you! You start sprinting away from the monstrous creature but you seem to be gaining no distance as the massive monster gets closer with its body increasing in size to reveal its beady, black eyes. Within seconds, a shadow is cast over you causing you to fall on your back and look up to see the warehouse complex-sized spider scuttle right over you as its long legs take it high into the air with its hardened carapace feet causing the ground to vibrate as it moves past you without paying you any mind. The tiny, baby spider moves quickly to find a safe space from the bigger predators not caring about particles too small to activate its hunting instincts. Even to the tiniest bugs, you are basically nothing. You weren't sure if it was reassuring or even scarier but you know that there are tiny insects than this spider that you would not be so unfortunate to go unnoticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the edge of the cement patch, you look up at the looming grass and the dandelion plant that is even taller as it stretches miles above with more seeds blowing off of it. Although the edge of the cement patch is like a cliff that would lead to a deadly drop to the base of the grass, the plant is close enough to be touching the cement. You walk to the thick, stem and grab hold of white hairs on the stem like they are ropes. Slowly but surely you make your climb to the very top, taking several breaks along the way as you get higher and higher above the cement patch to give you an excellent view of the backyard except for the watering can and bucket you can now make out nearby that tower over the dandelion. The winds feel stronger and you are careful to keep tight grip as you reach the summit of the dandelion to grab a hold of the wood-like ridges of the nearest dandelion seed head with its parachute hairs beginning to flap in the growing wind. Ready to glide, I push my body to make the dandelion seed move but nothing happens. I am too light to influence the seed and am stuck latching on miles above until the wind picks up to remove the seed and send me flying away! </span></div></div>",

Towering trees that you can only assume used to be your carpet surround you in every direction. You cough at the layer of dust around you as well, too small and far away for your mother's vacuum to reach. Your heart races faster and faster as it sinks in <i>just</i> how small you are. You are impossibly tiny, borderline microscopic!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, a sound rings out that (if it was possible) would have made your blood run even colder than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\"Hmmph.\"</font> A thunderous voice rings out. It doesn't take a genius to figure out who that voice belongs to. You turn towards the direction you remember facing when your vision returns, and your jaw drops. Your older sister, who was already pretty tall to begin with, is absolutely HUGE! And your so far away from her! You don't want to imagine what it would be like to be right next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she speaks again.<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\"Well, that'll stop you from doing anything weird.\"</font> she starts. <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\"I could just leave you here to get eaten by a bug or stepped on by mom or something, but maybe I should just take care of you now.\"</font> She ponders aloud. Then, for emphasis, she raises her right foot what seems to be miles into the sky, before slamming it down at full speed. A huge earthquake booms across the area as everything shakes, causing you to grab onto the carpet for balance. If she's that powerful at <i>this</i> distance, you don't want to be anyway near her at all! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\"Although looking for you would be a pain, I don't even know where you are.\"</font> She says. <font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\"Hmmmm....\"</font> She mumbles, weighing her options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're very worried about what the giant Jacqueline will decide to do. Like it or not, you need her to get back to normal size, so being close to her is ideal, but who knows what she'll do to you if she decides to look for you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end....</span></div></div>",

Your legs buckled slightly in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, your Mom moved the vacuum forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had almost no time to react. The noise from the vacuum increased even more than before, reaching a point that it blew out your eardrums. You clasped your hands to your head in an effort to stop this, but it was no use. Fortunately, you didn't have to endure this for long, as almost instantly your microscopic body was lifted up and sucked towards the vacuum at frightening speeds! You scream out as you see the black hole approaching, sucking you in further into its depths....<br>\r\n__________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez Ethan! Your floor is filthy!\" Kathy said aloud, mainly to herself. \"Who knows how many gross bugs and stuff like that is living in your carpet!\" She murmured again, unaware of the irony of her statement, or to the fact that she had just filtered her son out of the very carpet she was cleaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body was never found, considering that it was mashed up and hidden within a mountain of dirt and dust inside a vacuum cleaner.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">FEEL FREE TO ADD SOMETHING IF YOU'D LIKE TO! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is a story where our main protagonist finds a shrinking device, and when he uses it he (or his target) will always shrink to an incredibly small size. How small is up to you, but the maximum size will only be about a millimetre or two. But enough about that, let\u2019s meet the girls that you\u2019ll become a mere speck next to:<br>\r\n <br>\r\nEthan: You. Not much else to say really.<br>\r\nFeel free to just imagine yourself here :P<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKathy: Your mother. She\u2019s kind, nurturing and loves you, but what will happen when your usually short mother becomes an ultra-tall goddess? Especially when she doesn\u2019t like bugs\u2026<br>\r\nShe's about a head shorter than you, with shoulder length brown hair. She takes care of herself but is just on the verge of letting herself go. Her body proportions and measurements you would describe as 'above-average' for someone of her size. She enjoys relaxing more than she does doing work or chores, but she'll force herself to do them when she needs to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacqueline: Your Older sister. She used to pick on you when you when you were younger but she focuses on your other siblings now. Maybe she just liked picking on those smaller than her\u2026<br>\r\nShe's fairly tall, approaching 6'1, and is in good shape, since she plays sports in her free time (I'll say Volleyball, but the sports not that important :P). She also has brown hair, but it's much longer, though usually tied back. Her frame is more toned, but she makes it work. She has a tendency to assume things, and is overly judgemental.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily: Your Younger sister. She\u2019s still a teenager so she\u2019s entering her rebellious bratty phase of adolescence. She\u2019s a bit of a wildcard, who knows how she\u2019d react to all of this\u2026<br>\r\nOf all your sisters, Emily looks the most like a younger version of Kathy, even being the same height and sharing hair length and colour. Although she's a little thinner. She's a bit spoiled, despite not really getting preferential treatment that often, but does often complain about things not going her way. She's the laziest member of the family, which you can see when you look at the mess her room is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi: Your Youngest sister. She\u2019s entering puberty soon, but she still enjoys playing games with her big brother. Although lately she\u2019s been messing with the ants out in the garden\u2026<br>\r\nUnlike everybody else, Naomi has black hair, that curls at the tips. Her dress sense seems to trend towards your style over your sisters, oddly enough. She's still young enough to be completely full of energy at all times, and can be tricky to control, especially with how stubborn she can get. This clashes with how carefree she is the rest of the time, so most of you just try to keep her happy. Due to her age, she's the shortest member of the family, being a little under 5 feet tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca: Your girlfriend. You\u2019ve been going out for a few years so she can usually come over to your house unexpectedly. Would it be better to let her know or keep her unaware?<br>\r\nBianca's really short, only being 5'2, but she 'makes up for it in other areas' is what she usually says to you when you tease her about it. She has shoulder length black hair and fairly sizeable 'assets' as you might say. She usually wears sandals or shoes with large soles/heels to boost herself a little higher, and is usually the loudest person in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley: Your girlfriends best friend.  She usually tags along whenever the two of you hang out. She\u2019s a bit of a tease, mainly towards you.<br>\r\nAshley rivals Jacqueline in height, which makes it look extra silly when she and Bianca hang out. Although she's much softer around the edges. The first thing you noticed when the two of you met was her ass, and you're fairly sure she knows, since she always wears tights or exercise pants whenever you're together, but you don't dare ask. She's got waist length blonde hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia: Your neighbour. She\u2019s your mother\u2019s age but you\u2019re friendly enough to be on a first name basis. She usually visits to have chats with your mother.  <br>\r\nCynthia has short blonde hair, and is about 6ft. She's dressed the same way the entire time you've known her, which is just a t-shirt and either jeans or a denim skirt. 'It's my style', is how she defended it when you asked her once. Despite sharing ages, looks older than your mom, and even has a daughter of her own, but she's probably the second most playful woman you know (Next to Naomi).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd many more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for any \u2018rules\u2019, feel free to take the stories in any direction that you\u2019d like, so long as the chapters are readable, a few sentences at least and follow along with the previous ones. I actually enjoy death so feel free to get our hero crushed, eaten or whatever else you can think of if you want that to happen. Go nuts! <br>\r\n</td>",
