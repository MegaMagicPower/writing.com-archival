Ash always like hot older women like Nurse Joy, Officer Jenny, Mistys sisters, and Jessie, if she wasn\u2019t apart of Team Rocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked he noticed a strange altar in the middle of the forest curiously he went over to the center and read the plaque. For those who wish for a great gift it shall be bestowed upon you however it shall only work for one who is pure of heart and has a kind soul<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ash touched the center he wished he had the power to possess any women that he chooses and that he could have a wonderful harem, and finally be a Pok\u00e9mon master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe altar glows and suddenly a bright light covers the forest and Ash feels different before anything else he notices himself turning into a liquid form and once he becomes a puddle it swiftly forms into a slime body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah! This is awesome but how do I change back into my human form? Maybe if I concentrate I can turn back.\u201d Ash wondered. He pictures his body and next thing he knows he\u2019s back into his human form.</span></div></div>",

They should realize that they will never get pikachu or any of my Pok\u00e9mon.</u> Ash said in his head as he looked at the three stooges going over their \u201cmaster plan\u201d to try and catch pikachu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter going over their plan, they set out a picnic basket and prepare to eat their feast. You notice their drinks and slip into one of their drinks without them noticing. Once inside you mix with the lemonade and find it refreshing and cool. Suddenly the cup moves and you look and see that \u2014-is about to drink you.</span></div></div>",

Well at least Mom won\u2019t be surprised to see her son in a woman\u2019s body with my manhood still intact. Now to take care to these two idiots and send them packing with some of my new Pok\u00e9mon.</u> Ash thought before grabbing a Pokeball and sending out Yanmega. The dragonfly Pok\u00e9mon thought of Ash as her trainer and was ready to battle. \u201cAlright Yanmega send these fools packing with Ancient Power and Sonic Boom.\u201d Ash ordered Yanmega. Yanmega fires a silver orb and then a powerful sonic wave that mixes with the orb and it becomes a silver sonic boom. It explodes on contact with James and Meowth and sends them both flying; \u201cGood work today Yanmega. Let\u2019s go home and see my mother.\u201d Ash told the insect before returning her to her ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh finally makes it to Pallet town before nightfall and rushes to his home where he relaxes and knocks on the door to see his mother open the door. \u201cAsh welcome home. I missed you so much.\u201d Delia says while squeezing Ash\u2019s head in her impressive bust, who couldn\u2019t help but cop a feel, to see how soft they are before he finally got his head loose. \u201cHey mom notice anything different about me?\u201d Ash questions his mom to see her reaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAsh I know that your a girl with a manhood but honestly learn to cover it up, you\u2019ll scare the girls that way. Now come inside you look like you could use a bath and some food.\u201d Delia says as she walks back to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, even my mom only sees me as her son. Sweet, now I can have some real fun with these puppies and a couple of pretty girls as well.\u201d Ash says to himself as he ponders about having hot women with him in bed having wild sex and having a harem family.</span></div></div>",

Ash enjoyed his dinner telling his Mom all about your adventures until she asked \u201c So what are you going to do now Ash?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking of taking a little break for maybe a month or two so I can rest and maybe get a girlfriend or two. Either way I want to spend time with you mom.\u201d Ash said to Delia, who looked so happy and decided to hug him but all Ash could feel are the flesh orbs on her chest called boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m going to go take a shower do you mind waiting for me?\u201d Delia asked Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry mom go take your shower.\u201d Ash said to her as she started to turn on the water and started to bathe in the warm water.
