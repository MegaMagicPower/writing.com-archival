Despite our fondness for video games, me and my friends couldn't in good conscience spend this day inside. Which is why me, my sister Cassandra, and our friends Stephen and Laura decided to go to the park instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephen and I were sitting under a nearby tree, discussing recent video game announcements. Cassandra and Laura, however, were talking about family matters. Or rather, Cassandra was talking, and Laura patiently listening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you believe this?\" Cassandra exclaimed. \"That bitch told me I was <i>wasting</i> my body. What the hell does that even mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was, of course, talking about our 14 year old sister, Amelia. We don't get along with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No offense, Cassie,\" said Laura, \"but I think she means that you dress like a boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what? I can dress however I want. She's always been jealous of me. I couldn't care less about my boobs, so why is that girl so upset that mine are bigger than hers?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning over, Stephen whispered in my ear: \"Why are girls so obsessed with their looks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" Shrugging, I said, \"It's like Cassie's the only sane one. Then again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Stephen said: \"I guess the only way to understand would be to become girls ourselves. Fat chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephen and I laughed as we went back to listening to Cassie vent about Amelia's childish behavior. A few weeks ago, Stephen said Amelia was \"pretty cute, but freakishly annoying\". That description is pretty accurate. I usually ignore the girl, but Cassandra has a bit of a temper. These two fight a lot.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAfter a while, we eventually got bored of Cassandra's seemingly infinite rant. I turned to Stephen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want to do something else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couple rounds of Twisted Metal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quietly as possible, we snuck away from the girls. I don't know how Laura had the patience of listening to my sister, but Stephen and I didn't. We ran over to my place and fired up my PS3.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephen Anderson and I had been best friends since freshman year. There was a team project and... well, we were the only ones who couldn't find teammates. He's a computer nut, and I'm a gamer, so of course we hit it off. As for Laura Clarke, we met her two years ago. She came from London when her dad found a job here. She's always been a very cute girl, the kind who could have been very popular, but that's not how high school works.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her looks, Laura got picked on because she'd skipped a grade. As it turns out, popular girls and class nerds don't mix very well. Feeling ostracized by the popular kids, Laura started to hang out with me and the others; eventually becoming one of our closest friends. She's the feminine presence of the group. That was kinda needed, since the previous feminine presence was actually less feminine than the guys. Laura's been trying to get Cassandra to act, well, like a girl. Good luck with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Elizabeth's POV</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems like this is always happening. Me and my husband, Phillip, sitting on our bed, discussing what to do about our children's constant conflicts. Cassandra and David get along just fine, but whenever Amelia's in the same room as one of these two, that room turns into a battlefield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amelia came to see me earlier today,\" I said. \"She says Cassandra's been mean to her and called her a 'bitch'\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll talk to Cassie,\" replied Phillip. \"But honestly, knowing Amelia, I think she was asking for it. Bugging David and Cassie seems to be her favorite hobby these days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't they just get along? I'm getting tired of their constant fighting. Ever since Amelia entered high school, she's been at odds with her siblings. I just hope Melody won't be like that when she gets there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're teenagers. It's in their nature to antagonize everything. Still, I think we need to have another long talk with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI agreed. As their mother, it was my responsibility to make sure my daughters behaved properly. If only that were our sole problem. Unfortunately, our family had other issues that needed discussing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not the only thing we need to talk about, Phillip,\" I added. \"There's still our money issues, too. We're already behind on payments on our mortgage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, and I'm doing all I can. My job just doesn't pay all that well. Maybe I should get a second job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, don't do that, honey. You'll kill yourself working. I'll find a job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you've never worked a day in your life. You have no work experience, and I can't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Phillip's cell phone rang. Probably Larry, his best friend. These two see each other several times a week, to grab a beer or watch a sports match. Phillip answered. After a short conversation, during which he seemed quite shocked, Phillip turned to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to talk...\" he said. \"I think we may have found a solution to our problem.\"</span></div></div>",

My four year old sister Melody was enthusiastically eating and making a mess, and Amelia and Cassandra were casually throwing insults at each other, so everything looked normal on that side. However, Mom and Dad were abnormally silent. Too silent. They had an announcement to make, and we probably wouldn't like it. As if on cue, Mom spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kids,\" she started. \"We would like your attention. We have something important to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Earlier today, I was contacted by my friend Larry,\" Dad continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's that scientist guy, right?\" Cassandra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's him. He offered me a solution for our money problem. His company will completely pay for our mortgage, and throw in an extra fifty thousand dollars... on the condition that two of us become test subjects in an experiment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of experiment?\" I asked. This was getting interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Body swapping,\" Dad said. I was amazed that he managed to say that without laughing. \"He has found a way to swap two people's bodies, and he needs to test it on someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, let's do it!\" Cassie said. \"Let's just have two of us swap bodies for a week, and then all our problems are solved, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, it's not that simple,\" Dad replied. \"There's a flaw in the process he's using. He can swap two people, but he can't switch them back, or with anyone else. If we do it, it's permanent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We still think we should consider it, however,\" Mom said. \"After all, we do need the money. That's why we're putting it to a vote. I think we should go ahead with it, and so does your father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think... I think we should do it,\" I said. \"I don't really want to be someone else, but you're right: we do need the money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm with David here,\" Cassandra added. \"Besides, being someone else can't be that bad, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no way I'm doing this!\" Amelia yelled. \"I'm not giving away my life for you guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanna do body thwapping!\" Melody said excitedly. \"Da mean I can be a gwowed up, wight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am always impressed by this little girl's perceptiveness. She's clever, you've got to give her that. So that makes five against one, meaning...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I suppose we're doing this,\" Dad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've thought about it a lot, and we decided that the best way to choose who swaps is to pick at random,\" Mom explained. \"We'll put all of our names in a bowl, and pick two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince no one really wanted to be the one to swap, we all agreed that this was indeed the best way to proceed. Mom went into the kitchen, and came back two minutes later with a large bowl, five pieces of paper and a pen. She set the bowl on the table and handed the pen and paper to Dad, who started writing our names. It wasn't long before there was an interruption:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you putting <i>my</i> name in there?\" Amelia whined. \"I said I wasn't doing this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you did,\" Mom said, \"but, for the sake of being fair, we think your name should be in there too. And quite frankly, your attitude these days makes us think that maybe being someone else would do you some good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're so concerned with being fair, then why isn't Dad in it?\" Amelia asked, noting that there were only five papers, and none of them said Phillip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I am this family's only source of income,\" Dad answered. \"But if you think you can handle my job, then I suppose I could put my name in there too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh.. I don't believe this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moving on,\" said Dad. \"I think we're all set.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dropped a the papers into the bowl, and mixed them with his hand. He then handed the bowl to Mom, who picked a paper. After unfolding it, she announced the unlucky winner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, me? I was going to swap? I could hardly believe it, and yet it was true. Soon, I would be in someone else's body, for the rest of my life. Please be Cassandra, please be Cassandra, please be Cassandra! Mom put the paper with my name on the table for everyone to see, sealing my fate. She then put her hand back in the bowl, took another piece of paper, and announced the name of the person I'd become.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With an expression of shock on her face, Mom dropped the piece of paper on the table, right next to mine, clearly showing to all our family that she was the one who'd swap bodies with me. That meant I'd be my own mother. I'd become a middle-aged woman. And Mom would become me, a teenage boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... I suppose that means the two of us will have to become each other,\" Mom said, still shaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can still back down if you want,\" Dad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. You wouldn't even suggest this if it weren't me,\" replied Mom. \"We have to be fair: my name came out, I'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll call Larry,\" Dad said. \"He said we can do the procedure a week from now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to be alone,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI left the room in a hurry, leaving my barely touched meal behind. I was starving, but I didn't even care. They'd just told me I'd have to spend the rest of my life as my mother! I ran into my room and lied down on the bed. I half expected to start crying uncontrollably, but I didn't: truth be told, I was simply unable to process the consequences of what just happened. Instead, I just laid there, staring at nothing, with my brain trying to reboot after a complete crash. I barely noticed the door opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, are you okay?\" Cassandra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my room too,\" she replied. \"I'm allowed to come in here after dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner's already over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's been half an hour since you left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour? It didn't feel that long. Then again, I wasn't really paying attention to the passage of time. Cassie sat on her own bed, facing me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, I know that's a huge shock. I didn't expect that either. But you gotta keep it together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy for you to say, you're not the one who'll get turned into a housewife next week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but... look, you'll get used to it eventually. We all will. And then things will be normal again... mostly. And the rest of our problems will be solved. It probably won't even be that bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. If being Mom was so horrible, she wouldn't have put up with it all this time. The problem is that I won't be <i>me</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll always be you... just in a different body. But you'll still have me, Stephen and Laura. It'll be okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you're right about this. I really do. I'm just... scared. When I voted in favor of the swap, I didn't think it would be me. I figured it might be something like you and Amelia, maybe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F**k no, that would've been horrible. Look, I know it sounds bad, but you don't have much of a choice, here. You'll just have to get used to being Mom. For what it's worth, I'm sure you'll make a great mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thanks, that makes me feel so much better,\" I replied, sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now come on, you can't keep moping like that,\" Cassie said, as she turned on the TV. She handed me a DualShock. \"I'm gonna play Killzone. Now you can either play with me and get your mind off this, or cry in a corner. Your choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right about one thing: crying wouldn't solve anything. If I was gonna be Mom for the rest of my life, I might as well enjoy my last week as me. I picked up the controller and started playing.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Well, that was it. The week was over. I'd spent it doing the same things I always did: playing video games and reading comic books. You'd think I'd be doing something less... normal, the kind of thing I'd always wanted to do but never could. But I didn't want to spend my last week as myself like that; I wanted to spend it just being me, pretending it wasn't going to end. I spent a fair amount of time with my friends too: after all, I had to tell them about the swap. It took some convincing, as they both initially thought it was a very late April Fools joke, but at least now they knew I'd soon be my mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wonder how that'll affect our friendship. When this is done, I won't be their best friend David; I'll be Mrs. Mason David's mother who they see once in a while when they come over. Would they just cast me aside, ignoring me as they did my mother? Or would we remain close friends, despite my being almost three times their age? Laura and Stephen assured me it would be the second option, but only time will tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at my surroundings. I was in a waiting area, in the lobby of the Ambrosia Corporation offices. It was a big place, but also completely sterile, in every sense of the word. It felt worse than a hospital. And to think this was the last place I'd see as David Mason. Sitting beside me was my mother, Elizabeth. I couldn't help but look at her, examining her, as I knew that soon I would be her. She was a very short woman, something I'd have to get used to. While she was fairly thin, she was also very curvy, with wide hips and a shapely butt. She was very well-endowed in the chest area too. I wasn't supposed to be looking at my mother that way, but did it really matter anymore? Her \"assets\" would be mine in a few hours! Not that I wanted them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI also took some time to examine her face. Her features were nearly perfect, with full lips and big green eyes. She was, admittedly, beautiful, even though she had a few wrinkles. Her round face was surrounded by shoulder-length black hair. Looking closely, I could even see a few grey hairs. She was both the perfect image of femininity, and of middle age. Hard to think that this would soon be my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David, will you please stop staring at me?\" Mom asked. \"It's making me nervous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry... I'm really nervous too, you know. I just can't believe I'm going to be you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, an attractive woman entered the room. She was young, and had long blonde hair tied up in a bun. She had a big, very visible baby bump under her lab coat. I recognized her as Gloria Adams, Larry's lab assistant. I'd seen her a few times before. She walked over to us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elizabeth, David,\" she said. \"Dr. Thomas is ready to see you. Follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and I got up and followed her to an elevator, which brought us up to the fifth floor, we then followed her through a hallway, and into a large laboratory. The room had been cleared to make space for the experiment we were about to take part in. In the middle of the lab were two operating tables. Between them, a table with two syringes and a bunch of surgical equipment, along with two vials containing a blue gel-like substance. And standing nearby was a tall middle aged man with grey hair. Larry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, David. Elizabeth,\" he said. \"I haven't seen you two in a while. How are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel like my life is about to end. Literally,\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm truly sorry about that. To be honest, if I didn't know your family needed that money, I would never have suggested this. I only want to help you, but I'm afraid this is the only way I can help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Larry,\" Mom said. \"We're not angry at you. We just want to get this over with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Then I suppose we shouldn't waste time. First, I'll explain what we're going to do.\" He took one of the blue vials and showed it to us. \"This is NeuroGen. It's the substance that made all this possible. We found that, when directly applied on an open wound, this substance could regenerate nerves and brain tissue. Needless to say, the applications are obvious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... actually really cool,\" I said. \"So, with that, you can heal pretty much any injury?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct, but this isn't what we're doing here. While I am the one who discovered NeuroGen, the research of medical applications for it has been left to other teams. Miss Adams and I have decided to pursue a different use for it. We figured that, if it can heal brain tissue, then maybe it can be used to connect a brain to a body that isn't its own. In other words, body swapping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're just gonna take our brains out of our heads, put them into the other's body, and put NeuroGen on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Basically, yes. We don't transfer the whole brain, however. That would be unnecessary. Only the parts that contain, your personality, knowledge and memories. However, some of your skills will probably stay with the body. These include motor skills, language, driving... Essentially, things you do without thinking about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, I'd lose skills... and gain my mother's. I didn't know whether I should be angry or relieved to hear that. On one hand, it would make it easier to adjust. On the other... I'd lose some of who I am. Then again, he did say it was only the things we do instinctively, so it shouldn't really affect my personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I'm wondering,\" Mom said,\" is why you can't switch us back? Can't you just do the same procedure again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I wasn't very clear over the phone,\" explained Larry. \"NeuroGen has one major flaw: the immune system perceives it as a threat. After the first use, your body will build an immunity to it, and on the second use, the NeuroGen will be destroyed before it can have any effect. Any attempt to swap you back would likely leave you completely paralyzed, or dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we'll have to stay as each other until you can find a way to bypass the immune system,\" I concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It could take years,\" Larry replied. \"And even then, there's no guarantee it would work on you, since your bodies will have already built an immunity. This is a one way trip. No way around that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. I'm ready to do this,\" I said, even though it wasn't true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, then. Let's proceed. There are two gowns on this table over here,\" Gloria said, pointing at a table in the corner of the room. \"We'll leave the room while you put them on. Then we'll start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria and Larry left the room, closing the door behind them. This left me alone with Mom. We both grabbed the blue gowns, which looked like the one they have at hospitals. When Mom started undressing, I looked away. It was stupid I know: I'd be seeing a lot more of her body in a mirror, soon enough. Still, I didn't want to look at my mother naked if I didn't have to. I started undressing too, and put on the gown. When we were done, we placed our clothing on the table, and walked back to the middle of the room. A minute later, Gloria and Larry came back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like we're ready to begin,\" Larry said. \"Could you two please lie down on the operating tables?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe both obeyed his command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gloria, administer the anesthetic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria walked over to the space between the operating tables. She took one of the syringes, and gently grabbed my arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you're ready for this, David?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. She stuck the needle in my arm, and I could feel a liquid flowing into my veins. I quickly became drowsy, my vision becoming increasingly blurry. Sounds became quieter, until I could hear nothing. I could barely see. Then everything went black.</span></div></div>",

I guess I am Elizabeth now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slowly opened my eyes, finding myself in a small, brightly lit room. The lighting actual hurt my eyes for a moment, but I forced myself to keep them open, acclimating them to the bright lights. When my vision stopped being blurry, I took a good look around. The room was entirely white and sterile, much like the rest of the building. There was a full-length mirror in a corner, a table with some clothes on it, and of course the bed I was currently laying on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked down at myself. I was almost surprised when I saw how different I was. There were two large mounds of flesh on my chest, covered by the gown I was wearing. My feet, or what I could see of them past my breasts, seemed much closer to my eyes than before. My hips were wider, my waist thinner, and I could feel that my rear was a bit larger. I raised my arms in front of my eyes; they were slender and feminine, now. I noticed a wedding ring on my left ring finger. No denying it now: I was Elizabeth, wife and mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat up, feeling the weight of my breasts on my chest. Curious, I grabbed them and gave them a squeeze. Wait, aren't these my mother's boobs? I quickly got my hands off them. Now hold on a second... they aren't Mom's boobs anymore. She'll never have them again. They're mine now. I couldn't say I was particularly pleased by that thought, but at least it made me feel less perverted. I put my hands on my chest again, feeling my breasts. They weren't very firm; actually, they were even beginning to sag. They still felt pretty good, though. In fact touching them wasn't a bad sensation. I dropped my breasts again: I'd just swapped bodies with my mother, touching myself was not the most appropriate thing to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as I set foot on the floor, I could feel the difference. My balance was completely off, offset by my wider hips and the weight of my breasts. And yet I didn't fall down. I instinctively adjusted my posture. A few steps forward confirmed that my new center of gravity wouldn't require any adjustment on my part. The floor was cold. I'd heard somewhere that women are more sensitive to temperature; was that why it was so cold? Then again, it was pretty cold back in the lab, too, and I was still a guy then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a look at the clothes on the table. They were the ones Mom was wearing earlier when we came in. I suppose that meant I'd have to put them on. And for that I'd have to take off my gown. I didn't really feel like it, but I figured now was as good a time as any: I should see my nude body, get used to it right now to make my life easier later. I walked to the mirror and took off my gown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to admit, Mom still had a pretty attractive body for her age. Or rather, <i>I</i> had a pretty attractive body for <i>my</i> age. I was right earlier: my breasts were beginning to sag, but they still looked good enough. I had a good, pear shaped figure. I didn't have much muscle, but I wasn't fat either. My body was almost completely hairless, except for my head, and a patch of black hair... down there. I didn't dare examine that part in further detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just stood there for several minutes, staring at my own mother's naked body, telling myself it wasn't hers anymore, but mine. When the sight of my new self was beginning to feel normal, I decided it was time to get dressed. I went to the table and took a look at the outfit. Just great... There was an ankle-length black skirt and a red short-sleeved blouse. Even the underwear was very feminine: a pink bra and nylon pantyhose. Not to mention the shoes, a pair of black pumps with, from my estimation, three inch heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI struggled a bit with the underwear. It was a minor miracle that I managed to put on the pantyhose without tearing it. The bra was equally difficult, but a good amount of struggling with the clasp behind my back eventually worked.  Then I slipped into the skirt and put on the blouse. I had to admit, it was actually not uncomfortable. I suppose I could get used to wearing Mom's clothes. Not that I had much choice. Then I put on the pumps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy first thought was that I'd fall down, that my face would hit the cold hard floor. But I didn't. I started walking, instantly reaching an acceptable speed. I could feel my hips swaying in a womanly manner with each step. I knew how to walk in high heels. Was that what Larry meant when he said some skills would stay with the body? If so, that would help a lot. The shoes weren't comfortable at all, but I had to admit I appreciated the height boost. It made me feel a little less short. Now I understood why Mom wore them all the time. When I was done, I looked at my reflection again. I looked exactly like Mom. No one would ever be able to tell the difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at the table again. Mom's black leather purse was still on it. I guess it was my purse now. I grabbed it and opened it. It contained a wallet, car keys, a cellphone, a makeup kit and a few tampons. I shuddered at the thought of what that last item foreshadowed. Anyway, none of these items would be of any use to Mom, now that she was a teenage boy. As I thought, all of that purse's content now belonged to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked out of the room, only to find that it led directly into the laboratory where the procedure was performed. Larry and Gloria were sitting in a corner, talking to each other. As soon as they saw me, they hurried over to my side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Elizabeth,\" said Larry. \"How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not Elizabeth, I'm David,\" I replied, almost surprised when I heard Mom's voice instead of mine. \"But I feel fine. Nothing out of the ordinary... well, except that I'm a woman, but I suppose that's not what you meant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd be correct,\" said Larry. \"What I want to know is if there's anything not working properly. Are you in control of all your limbs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they work fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you feel this?\" he asked, before poking me at several spots. At least he had the decency to avoid my breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I can feel this. Now will you please stop poking me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Is there anything wrong with your hearing, or your eyesight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... I don't think so. I told you, I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything seems to be in order, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked around the room. Mom was nowhere to be seen. There was another door next to the one I'd just come from. Probably where Mom was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David hasn't woken up yet.\" Gloria said, seemingly reading my thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you keep calling us that?\" I asked. \"You know who we really are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but it's also very important that you get used to your new names,\" Gloria explained. \"You are Elizabeth Mason, now. The teenage boy in this room is not your mother, but your son David. We feel it is best that we refer to you by your new names.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I guess that makes sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the door opened. A teenage boy, who I never thought I'd see from this point of view, walked in.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hi... Mom,\" said Mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi... David,\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs my new son stood right next to me, I was once again reminded of how short I was: even in high heels, I was a few inches shorter than him. Of course, that was nothing compared to the strangeness of seeing my own body from the outside, acting on its own, only to the look down and see a pair of breasts on my own chest. The whole experience was simply surreal. And I could tell that Mom was feeling the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before we can continue, I need to ask you a few questions,\" said Larry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe proceeded to run Mom through the same quiz I'd just been through. Her answers were mostly the same as mine. Once they were done, Larry and Gloria looked at each other, a grin forming on both of their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything is in order,\" he excitedly said. \"Both of them have successfully been transferred into the other's body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meaning that... the experiment is a success!\" Gloria replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria jumped at Larry, hugging him. Both of them had a huge smile on their faces. They finally calmed down after a minute or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did it!\" said Larry. \"We have officially performed the first human brain transfer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just thinking of the impact this will have on the world... It's amazing!\" added Gloria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on... what impact?\" I asked. \"I thought this was just a one time experiment. You know, just to prove you could do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's much more than that, Elizabeth.\" Larry explained, \"we could make this public. Make it available to everyone. Just picture a world where everybody could be who they want to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, that's still a while away,\" Gloria said. \"It'll take years before we can make this a reality, with all the legal issues that will inevitably arise. But still: we've done it. It's just a matter of time now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to admit, their dream was a noble one. The world is full of people who wish they were someone else, and that now there was a chance that their wish could be granted. What had happened today might change the world for the better. This idea made me feel better: I may be stuck as my mother, but at least it was for a good cause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm happy I could help,\" said Mom, echoing my feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we're very thankful to you two.\" Larry paused, then added, \"by the way, I'll be hosting a party at my house tomorrow night, to celebrate our accomplishment. I'd understand if you'd rather stay home, but it wouldn't feel right not to invite you. You two, and your family, are more than welcome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll think about it,\" I answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and I left soon after. As we walked out of the building, I realized something: I'd have to drive. The two of us had come alone, since we assumed the procedure might take a long time. Indeed, we'd been out for several hours, as it was getting dark; it was morning when we came here. But now, it was just the two of us, and Mom didn't have a license anymore: I'd started studying for it, so I knew most of the theory, but I'd never actually driven a car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we reached the vehicle, Mom looked at me, and her eyes sent a clear message: you drive. Fumbling through my purse, I found the car keys and got in the car. Of course, the seat was perfectly adjusted to my new height. It felt a bit weird, however, when I put on my seatbelt, only to have it pass between my breasts. Trying to ignore that feeling, I unlocked the passenger door, letting Mom in. Then, I started the car... and I started driving. It was perfectly intuitive, as if I'd been doing it for years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasn't driving one of the things Larry said stayed with the body? It looked that way. And driving felt great. I started thinking of the possibilities: not only did I know how to drive, I also had my own car. I was an adult, too. I could go anywhere I wanted, do whatever I wanted. But right now, what I wanted was to go home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive home wasn't too long. After parking the car, Mom and I got out, and we stood in front of the front door. We were both reluctant to open it. After all, once we set foot in this house, our whole family would come to greet us, seeing us in each other's body. I'd have to meet my husband and children, while Mom would have to meet her sisters and father. In the end, she was braver than me, and pushed the door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, everyone was standing there in anticipation. They'd heard the car, and they wanted to see us. Dad was the first to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it work?\" he asked. Mom and I nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe this,\" said Cassie. \"It's really you in there, David?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. It's me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia just stood there, staring at us. Then, she got tired of it, and just went back to her room. I guess even a body swap wasn't important to her. If it didn't affect her personally, she couldn't be bothered with it. For a moment, I wished I'd swapped with her. That would show her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody ran to me and hugged me. \"Awe you weawy David?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's right kiddo. I'm David.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You awe Mommy now,\" she said, giggling. \"Can I caw you Mommy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat took my by surprise. Was she really going to just accept me as her new mother? Then again, she was perfectly aware of who I really was. It felt more like she was teasing me. Like she thought this situation was funny. Still, I figured it made sense: I was technically her mother now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess,\" I said, reluctantly. \"But you have to do what Mommy says. And Mommy says it's time for you to go to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don wanna!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melody, do as your mother says,\" commanded Phillip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPouting, Melody went back to her room. To be fair, it really was her bedtime, but that wasn't why I said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now we can talk,\" I said. \"So, what do we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We follow the plan,\" answered Dad. \"You two get used to each other's lives. We pretend nothing has changed when in public. Other than that, you can do whatever you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about tonight? We haven't really thought about that, but it's gonna be really weird!\" I added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and I are married now,\" Dad said. \"We'll sleep in the same bed. And I mean actual sleep; we won't do anything more than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I guess I can live with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, David, can you come with me?\" Cassie asked. \"I gotta talk to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed my arm and dragged me to our bedroom. The one that wasn't mine anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what do you want to talk about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" she said. \"But I think Mom wanted some time alone with Dad. It was getting pretty obvious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, I hadn't noticed. I'd been completely oblivious to Mom for the entire conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we can still talk,\" Cassie added. \"So, what does it feel like? Being Mom, I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started explaining all the minor differences I felt to Cassie, which took a while. At some point, she decided to change the subject, talking instead about what we'd do the next day. We planned to have Stephen and Laura come over so they could meet the new me. I hated to think that, but we wouldn't spend as much time together now. However, that didn't mean I'd stop being their friend. Also, Mom would have to get to know them, since they'd be spending a lot more time together. Things would definitely change.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><b>Elizabeth's POV</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI half expected to wake up in my own bed, in my own body. That would have been great. But, of course, that was not to be. It would never happen anymore. Instead, I woke up on the right side of a queen size bed, in an obviously female body. Something else was off, though. I felt something on my breasts. I looked down: there was someone's arm lying over me! I looked to my right, confirming my suspicions: Dad had rolled over in his sleep, unconsciously cuddling up to me. Startled, I pushed him away and jumped out of bed as quickly as I could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What's going on?\" asked Dad, still half asleep. \"Betty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty was what Dad usually called Mom. \"Dad, it's me. David. You were... you were almost on top of me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what... Oh God, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, I was just startled,\" I replied. \"I just didn't expect to wake up to this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Betty...\" Dad started. He was fully awake now; guess he really did plan on calling me Betty instead of David. I'd have to get used to this. \"I don't want to make you uncomfortable. If it makes you fell better, I can sleep on the couch for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis offer was tempting, but I felt bad about it. I couldn't just kick him out of his own bedroom; it wasn't right. Maybe I could sleep on the couch instead? That wasn't tempting either. Which left one option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look... Phillip.\" Mom usually called him 'honey', but I wasn't ready for that yet. \"We can keep sleeping in the same bed. If waking up with your arm over me is the worst that can happen, I guess I can live with it. Just... nothing more than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. It means a lot to me that you're willing to do that. The faster we get used to this, the faster things can return to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah... to normal... To him, and to everyone else, that's what it would be. When we'd all have adjusted to this, Dad would have a wife and a son again, and my sisters would have a mother and a brother. For them, it would be almost like nothing had ever changed, and they'd just go on with their lives. For me and Mom, though, everything had changed forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a look around. I was still in my parents' bedroom, obviously. Guess it was my bedroom, now. It was much bigger than the room I shared with Cassie, and it had its own bathroom, so I guess that was one of the few things I'd like about my new life. What I didn't like was my father lying in my bed. At least he was wearing pajamas; last night he mentioned that he usually slept in his underwear, but that he wouldn't do that so as to not make me uncomfortable. As for me, I was wearing one of my moth... <i>my</i> nightgowns. It was a white, opaque, knee-length one, and pretty much the least feminine choice of nightwear I found in my new wardrobe. Some of the others... well, let's just say I'd never wear them. I shuddered just to think of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at the alarm clock on Dad's bedside table: it showed <i>6:23</i>. Strange, I never woke up at that time before. I always went to bed and got up late, even more so now that it was summer vacation. It wasn't rare for me to get up past ten. But Mom wasn't like that... She and Dad had always been morning people. Guess I had her biological clock, now. I didn't feel sleepy at all anymore, so I decided that I might as well go get breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>David's POV</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt strange... down there. My entire crotch felt entirely different from usual. And it felt like it was about to explode. I quickly opened my eyes and looked down. I was partially surprised when I didn't see breasts on my chest, but it was nothing compared seeing a large tent in my blanket. Suddenly, I was fully awake, and the events of yesterday came back to me. I was in David's body, and what I was experiencing was his morning wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick look to my right confirmed that Cassandra was still asleep in her bed, on the other side of the room. To think yesterday I woke up next to my husband, and now I was sharing a room with my daughter... Safe in the knowledge that Cassandra wouldn't be looking, I pulled off blankets, staring in amazement at my new body part. Not bad; it isn't as big as Philip's, but still a decent size... I really shouldn't be thinking like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what you're seeing?\" asked an amused Cassandra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you were sleeping!\" I replied, startled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I just wanted to know how you'd react to this.\" She pointed at the visible tent in my boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you... This happens every morning, doesn't it?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! Welcome to being a guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how do I... deal with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, David just... you know, unloaded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right here?\" I asked. There was something deeply wrong about this image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No! I don't watch my brother jerking off, that's f**king gross!\" Cassandra replied. I decided not to comment on her swearing. \"He does it in the bathroom. That's probably what you should do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI poked my erect member through the fabric of my underwear. It felt weird. Somehow, the prospect of \"handling\" it was exciting... but it also made me feel uncomfortable. This is my son's body! I wasn't supposed to experience that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll just wait it out,\" I said. \"I'm not comfortable with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm not sure I'd want to do that on first day either, if I was the one who swapped, replied Cassandra. \"Anyway, I'm gonna get dressed. If you're staying here, could you look away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned my head the other way, looking away from my daugher <i>and</i> the tent in my boxers. I breathed slowly, focusing on other things instead of my \"problem\". Behind me, I could hear the sound of drawers opening and closing, followed a few minutes later by the door doing the same. Cassandra had left. Finally, my morning wood began to go away. Now more comfortable, I sat up and looked at my alarm clock: <i>10:24</i>. How did this happen? I never wake up so late! But... David does. I must have inherited his sleep pattern. All that wasted time; I could have done so many things this morning. I'll have to work on getting this back to normal. Wasting no time, I jumped out of bed.</span></div></div>",

After we ate, Dad left, saying he was going to see Larry and that he'd see me at the party. I'd almost forgotten about that... Once he'd left, I started wondering what I should do with my day. I was up way earlier than usual, everyone was still asleep, and I had no idea what to do with myself! Of course, I could have taken a shower and gotten dressed... but I didn't want to. Seeing myself naked was one thing; scrubbing every inch of my mother's naked body was another. I decided to put it off as long as I could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long before I was given something to do: Melody and Amelia had woken up. Unlike me and Cassie, these two woke up early. And of course, they too wanted me to make them breakfast. Amelia kept saying that, as her mother, it was my job to make food for her, and Melody made me cave in with cries of \"Mommy, I'm hungwy\". They were obviously making fun of me. In Melody's case, I knew she meant well; after all, I willingly assumed the role of \"Mommy\" yesterday. Amelia, however, was clearly enjoying treating me like I was her maid. Just you wait, Amelia...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they had breakfast, Melody went to the living room to watch her cartoon and Amelia left for one of her friends' house, leaving me alone again. I went back to my new bedroom, laid down on the bed and looked at the time: <i>8:12</i>. It felt like so much longer... If I were still me, I'd still be sleeping for the next two hours. In this body, however, there's no way I'd manage to go back to sleep. I looked to my right: there was a book on the Mom's bedside table. I picked it up and looked at its cover. <i>The Best of Me</i> by Nicholas Sparks. One of those cheesy romance novels that Mom loves to read. Since I didn't have anything better to do, I opened it at page one and started reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * * * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI kept reading for the next two hours and a half.  I wish I could say that I'd somehow acquired Mom's tastes, but... oh God it was horrible. It was just so corny! And yet I kept reading, because I didn't know what else to do. Is that what my life would be like from now on? Sitting in bed, reading cheesy love stories while hoping that something would happen to give me something to do? I'll have to get some better reading material... Thankfully, I was rescued from my boredom when Mom opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are,\" said Mom. \"I knew you'd be awake. I expected to see you downstairs. You haven't gotten dressed yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Mom was fully clothed. She was actually better dressed than I usually was, and her hair was still wet, I presumed from taking a shower. And I was still in my nightgown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no, I just... didn't get around to it yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand. It's hard to put this book down, isn't it?\" Mom chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, no offense, but it's really bad. I was only reading it because I had nothing else to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could have taken a shower and gotten dressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't want to see yourself naked, is that it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's not it! I saw myself naked yesterday at the lab, and when I changed into this nightgown. It's just... touching it is different. I'm not comfortable with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, David. I know how you feel: I just went through this. You just have to remember that it's not my body anymore; it's yours. There's nothing wrong with you taking a shower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm not giving you a choice. If you are going to be me, then you are going to look presentable. Go on, hop in the shower. You're not allowed to get out until you are completely clean!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would have looked really silly to any outside observer: a middle-aged woman being ordered to take a shower by her teenage son. I didn't argue, as she was completely right: I had to do this. I walked into the bathroom, closed the door, and took off my nightgown and underwear. I took a second to stare at myself in the mirror; not that I wanted to, but I figured that the more I looked at it, the easier it would be to accept my new body. Oh, who am I kidding? It doesn't matter how wrong it is, looking at a naked woman is hard to resist.</span></div></div>",

Then I started washing myself, scrubbing all over my skin. I was using Mom's hygiene products, so I'd be smelling like flowers. Just great... When I got to my breasts, it became awkward. Scrubbing them was a strangely pleasurable experience, and one that felt wrong to enjoy. I tried to ignore it, getting it over with as quickly as possible. My hair also took longer than usual, due to it being much longer. Finally, I cut the water and started drying myself with a towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I looked around, I realized that I didn't have any clothes: all I had were a dirty underwear and nightgown. I didn't really want to get back into those right after taking a shower. But then again, Mom was in the bedroom. That's when I realized: she's seen this body naked thousands of times before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I don't have any clothes,\" I called. \"Is it okay if I come out... naked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" There was an awkward pause. \"Yes it's fine, I'll use the occasion to teach you a few things about being a woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, and opened the door. There Mom was, on the bed, reading the book I \"couldn't put down\" earlier. She looked in my direction. I couldn't help but notice a bulge appearing in Mom's pants, but she ignored it. She put the book back on the table and stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First lesson: you can always wrap a towel around your chest when you forget to bring clothes in the bathroom,\" said Mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI resisted the urge to facepalm. How had I not thought of that? And... why didn't Mom tell me that <i>before</i> I walked out of the bathroom? She must have read my mind somehow, because she immediately answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it doesn't matter now, because you would have had to take it off anyway. I'm going to show you how to get through your new morning routine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I think I know how to get dressed on my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long did it take you to put on a bra yesterday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Alright, I see your point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom walked over to the dresser and opened a drawer. She picked out a black set of bra and panties and handed them to me. To my dismay, they were both lacy and even more feminine than what I wore yesterday. I figured Mom did it on purpose: she wanted to show me that wearing this wouldn't hurt me. I guess she's right on that one: it's underwear, no one will notice it. I slipped into the panties, relieved that I was no longer completely naked. Then I grabbed the bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom explained to me how putting it on backwards would make it easier to attach. Although I still struggled due to my large breasts hiding the clasp from my view, I had to admit that it was much easier than doing it behind my back. Following Mom's instructions, I spun it around and spent some time fitting my breasts snugly into the cups. I could tell she was relieved that my private parts were covered up: they may have belonged to her, but I didn't consider the impact my male hormones may have on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good,\" said Mom. \"Now, to pick an outfit. Would you rather wear a dress or a skirt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No pants option?\" I asked. Now that I think of it, I've never seen Mom wear pants. \"You don't own pants, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never like how they feel,\" Mom explained. She looked down at the pair she was wearing. \"This will take a while to get used to. I've always preferred the feeling of a skirt, it's far less constricting. Plus, they look so much better than pants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure I share this opinion,\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're free to buy yourself pants, of course. You can dress however you like. For now, however, you'll have to do with what you've got.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I guess. Let's go with a skirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom handed me some pantyhose to put on while she went to open the wardrobe. It was much easier to put on than yesterday, now that I had practice. She then started to explain how to properly match articles of clothing when choosing an outfit. I think I missed a few parts, but I understood most of it. Finally, she handed me a long-sleeved crimson shirt with a scoop neck and a knee-length pencil shirt in a slightly darker shade of red. I put on the outfit, noticing that it made my curves very obvious and showed some cleavage. I stood in front of the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you like it?\" asked Mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure. It's kind of... I'm just not comfortable with dressing up like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, David. Just forget who you are looking at for a moment. Forget that this is you, or that this used to be my body. You're looking at a complete stranger. What do you think of her look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to admit, the woman in the mirror was attractive, for an older woman. Her clothes weren't revealing or anything, they just looked good on her. She looked like a respectable, mature and beautiful woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll give you that. It looks good,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I was observing my reflection, Mom had gone to her wardrobe and come back with a pair of shoes. I took them: they were two-inch heeled black pumps. I was supposed to put them on. I was surprised to find that they were actually not uncomfortable. The heel was lower than yesterday, and I had time to get used to those, so it was actually not that bad anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we make a deal?\" asked Mom. \"To show you that my clothes aren't so bad. For the next month, neither of us buys clothes. We only use the ones we already have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was deep in thought for a moment. Her clothes weren't so bad. And I really didn't feel like going shopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's do it,\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. Now follow me, we have to do something about your hair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took another look at my reflection. I had to admit it was kind of a mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and one last thing,\" asked Mom. \"Do you mind if I keep the book? I wanted to finish it.\"</span></div></div>",

It was hard in some ways. I was adjusting to being a woman. After all, waking up every morning to two, seemingly huge, breasts, and having them as a part of me, always moving, bouncing, or jiggling in some way, never let me forget they were there, and that, in turn, reminded me of what I was. Then there was the fact that I would never be able to stand up to pee again. I found that very annoying! But, to my own surprise, I was gradually getting used to it. If I was busy with something, sometimes I would forget how different my chest felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were right about the other part though. The tough part was the transition of thinking of Phillip Mason as 'my husband' instead of as 'Dad'. I won't deny, I think part of this was because, if I start thinking of him as 'my husband Phil', then I wouldn't be able to avoid being 'his wife Betty'. And that would mean acknowledging that sex was okay between us. The idea of the man who had until recently been my father, sliding his penis into 'that place' between my legs, was both gross and horrifying to me. What I was afraid to tell either of them though, was that, well, there were times when I did wonder what it would feel like. It was not unnatural after all. Just unnatural for a boy. So, maybe they were right, going away together, where I would never be treated as anyone but Mrs. Mason, might help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I agreed to the one week cruise. It would be best if I were at see with no place to run to! David(Mom) told me to relax, and he packed my bags for me. I agreed since I had no idea what to pack for something like that, especially as a woman. Needless to say, I would come to regret that decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard waving goodbye to the family on the pier, and for a few moments, as the ship was moving away, I felt a panic. And then Phillip put an arm around me and said, \"Come on Honey. Let's go check out our cabin. They paid for a good room from what I understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bit comforting to feel his arm around me. I was so short and weak now that, at times, I felt very vulnerable. And in thinking of that, I made the first steps to accepting what I was to him. One thing I was sure of, he would protect me, and he would never hurt me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we got to the cabin, which was luxurious, Phil looked down at me and said, \"Betty, I promised not to move to fast, and I won't, but would you consent to a hug and a kiss to start our time together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't really want to, but I knew I had to start somewhere, \"Okay Phil. If it is important to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gently took me in his arms, hugging me close, but not too tightly. Part of me really did like the way my breasts pressed into his body. I looked up at him, and he bent over and kissed me softly on the lips. It was a bit prolonged, but he didn't push it further, and it was just a simple kiss. It did feel good.</span></div></div>",

I suppose it wasn't.\" I was a bit confused on the inside. Part of me was holding on to my male self, but part of me enjoyed the feeling of my body against Phil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled down at me. \"Then how about just one more, and then we will change and go to lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI said he could, and this time, he kissed me longer, and I didn't complain. It did feel good. I didn't even complain when he gently brushed his hands across my rear. It started to stir some odd feelings in my body, which caused me to start panicking. I think he sensed it, and he quickly broke our embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled and said, \"Let's change and go get some lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't agree more! \"That sounds good. I really want to get out of this dress.\" I didn't really enjoy wearing such feminine clothing in public. Unfortunately for me, since David(Mom) packed my suitcases, I soon found that almost everything was either a skirt or a dress. The only exceptions were two, sexy one-piece swimsuits, and two tight, and sexy short-shorts! There was not one thing that did not I could wear that did not scream femininity! After ranting around in anger, I finally settled on a simple sun dress. Something told me it would be appropriate for a casual lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew I shouldn't, and it was normal, but I felt silly walking around in a dress. Of course, nobody saw anything wrong, so I pushed through. One of the biggest reasons I didn't like wearing a skirt was that it was so important to remember to cross my legs, or keep my knees together, unless I risked giving some guy a view that I didn't want to give him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt lunch, a couple came walking up to us. The man said, \"Hello. It is kind of full in here. Would you mind if we joined you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could react, Phil jumped up and said, \"Please do! I am Phil. And this is my wife Elizabeth, but she likes to go by Betty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey grinned, and the man said, \"I am Paul. This is my wife Donna. Thank you for having us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I was truly stuck! And what was worse was that the 'guys' launched into a sports discussion, which I would have loved to get into, but Donna wanted to talk about hair styles. It seemed that she loved my hair! What a laugh! I hardly knew what I was doing! She soon started making suggestions for me. I figured that, since I was Betty for the rest of my life, I might as well learn something, so I tried to listen. She did have some good thoughts and ideas. I asked some questions, and soon we were in an intense discussion, so that it was actually Phil who got my attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tapped my shoulder, \"Come on Honey. I have their cabin number. You and Donna can talk more about fashion later. For now, I want to catch the show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we were out of earshot, Phil said, \"I am glad that you felt okay talking with Donna about hair. It is a good sign for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed, \"Well, some of, um, Betty's skills and memories are a part of me now. I didn't realize how easy it could be to fall into something like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned as he squeezed my rear a little, \"I just hope we can bring back a different kind of 'old habit' from those memories soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just blushed deeper, but I didn't object to the playful squeeze.</span></div></div>",

I'm David, a teenage boy, and in all likelihood I will stay that way for the rest of my life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hadn't even opened my eyes yet, but I knew everything had changed. I felt taller somehow. I could feel that my body was less... curvy than usual. The familiar weight of my breasts had disappeared. Most importantly, I could feel an alien appendage on my crotch, and it didn't take a genius to know what it was. I also felt much more energetic than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finally decided to open my eyes. Slowly at first, as I knew the lighting would be a little too bright. As soon as I could see clearly, I looked down at myself. I couldn't see much, as I was wearing a gown, but the differences were obvious: my chest was completely flat, and I could see a bulge on my crotch. I was male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised by how easy it was, I quickly jumped out of bed. To my surprise, I didn't need to adjust my balance at all: it was like I'd always been that way. Of course, I could feel the differences, but my instincts accounted for my new center of gravity. I was also several inches taller, which was very satisfying, since I'd always been very short. Overall, I'd rarely felt that great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a look around the room, seeing three pieces of furniture: a table, a full-length mirror and the bed I'd just been on. There were some clothes on the table, but that didn't interest me for now. I just went straight to the mirror. Sure enough, David's reflection was staring back at me. I wondered for a moment if I should take a closer look at my body. On one hand, that was my son. On the other, it was also my body, now and forever. In the end, I decided to quickly get it over with, taking off my gown before I changed my mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was strange, seeing a completely different person in the mirror... which is why I kept staring. I thought that maybe, if I looked long enough, it would start feeling normal. I examined my naked body in detail: overall, it was just... average. David had never been into sports, and it showed. He wasn't overweight, but he wasn't very fit either. It felt a bit weird to see hair all over my body; I certainly didn't feel feminine at that moment. However, the most interesting part was... well, <i>that</i> part. I didn't dare touch it. Even looking at it felt like some sort of violation, but I forced myself to, reasoning that it belonged to me now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps the strangest part was that, despite no longer being female, and being my own son, I felt... excited. Some part of me was happy to be David. I was young again, with my whole life ahead of me! I could do whatever I wanted, and not repeat the mistakes of the past. As soon as those thoughts crossed my mind, I felt a pang of guilt. My youth had come at a price: David had lost 26 years of his life. He would be a housewife, and a mother of three. He'd never have a girlfriend; in fact, he was now married to his own father. I felt bad about that too: I could no longer be with my husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was too late to go back now. What's done is done. My old life wasn't that bad: Phillip was a loving husband, and I was comfortable. David would get used to it. And I would get used to being a teenage boy. If I could also enjoy it, wasn't that a good thing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI realized at that point that my reflection was starting to feel a little less alien to me. I even went ahead and touched my... private parts. Somehow, touching it, feeling the contact of skin on both my finger and <i>it</i>, made it feel less strange, and helped me think of it as a part of myself. I'd probably get used to it, with time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI left my reflection alone, and went to the table. The outfit David had been wearing earlier was there, neatly folded. It was nothing special: just some boxers, jeans, a t-shirt and some running shoes. As I put on the outfit without any problem, I felt kind of bad for David: I'd been wearing a skirt, pantyhose and high heels. He'd have to adjust to these. I should have thought of that and worn pants and flats instead. If I'd thought of that, I would probably have gone bra-less too, to give the boy a fighting chance. Then again, he'd have to get used to these things eventually, and now was as good a time as any. Worst case scenario, I'd have to help him get dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went back to the mirror and took a longer look at myself. Now that I had some clothes on, I no longer had to deal with internal struggles; I could just examine myself without any guilt. Of course, I looked exactly like David. To be honest, it was a bit of a disappointment: David never put much effort into his looks. I'd always know that, if he tried, he could look a lot better. I smiled: I was him now, I could make him look however I wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving had enough of my new reflection, I walked out of the room, only to find myself back in the lab. There were three people there: Larry, Gloria and... myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Back to \"Elizabeth\"'s point of view :</b><br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1909879-Trading-Lives/map/111111\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/ite...</a></span></div></div>",

But as the shocking memory of dinner returned, a cold sickness began to fill my stomach. It sounded insane, but if this scientist friend of Dad's was right, in just a week my carefree teenage life would be over and I would become my own mother. I squeezed my eyes-shut against the tears and prayed that it had been a dream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy couldn't it have been Cassie and Amelia?! They are both teenage girls! That would have been the fairest swap, although Cassie would have disagreed. If losing my manhood wasn't enough, I also lose 26 years of my life! I go from teenage boy to middle aged woman in a single procedure. No college, no backpacking across Europe, no career or finding myself a girl, just go straight to a 42 year old housewife! Wife! The guy who was currently my father would be my husband. How the f**k would I deal with that? I shuddered at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the worst part. Maybe I could deal with the body swap if I didn't have to take the life that came with it! Right now if another woman was to come along and offered to swap instead, even one as old as mom, I would take it in a heartbeat. Even if it meant being someone else's wife, at least I wouldn't be married to my father and maybe I would even have some kind of life. I mean, I love my Mom, but she wasn't exactly a great role model for ambition. She had no college degree, no qualifications of any kind and had never worked. She would probably tell you that being a homemaker was its own reward. I guess I would find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Elizabeth's POV</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lay in bed listening to Philip in the shower, basking in the afterglow of an orgasm. I planned to make the most of these. After next week it would be a while before I would have sex again and it would definitely not feel like this anymore. I can't believe my name came out! I would become my own teenage son! But what was perhaps the most unbelievable for me as a mother was the first feeling I felt when I saw my name... Joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that recollection, a wave of guilt came over me. Poor David, no matter how we sugared the pill for him nothing would change the fact that his world was about to change drastically in ways he mostly would not enjoy. But no matter how terrible I felt, I could not bring myself to wish for a different outcome. Unless perhaps it was for Cassie, staying a girl might have been easier. The main thing was: I would be young again. I love my family and am proud of what I have achieved as a wife and mother, but I can't say I don't regret the choices I made. I should never have listened to my parents, who would not allow me to go to college or apply for a job. They believed that a woman's place was at home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now I had a second chance! I could go to college, maybe even go traveling! I had always wanted to see Europe or maybe even Asia, or Australia! Heck, I could go round the world! Thanks to one little piece of paper I had been given a new chance at life... and poor David's had been taken away. All my mistakes would become his. He would be stuck with the life I secretly found so bland. But at least he would have a good husband. I mean, it would be weird at first but surely he would get used to it? I had never felt so conflicted! I'd never wanted something so bad, yet I felt so terrible for taking it! One thing was certain, I couldn't wait until the week was over so I no longer had the option of worrying about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>David's POV</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want to do today?\" Cassie asked as we ate our cereal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, maybe a movie,\" I replied, distracted, watching mom as she fixed Amelia and Melody some breakfast. She was so short without her high heels! I had never noticed that before. What was it going to be like have an ass like that? Not to mention those breasts, they looked so big on her! Were they heavy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey snap out of it!\" Cassie hissed. \"Remember, we're not thinking about next week, just enjoying this one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Cass,\" I smiled. Easy for her to say. But I suppose she was right, I needed to make the most of this. I can't believe how many times I had taken this carefree life for granted. \"I'll let the guys know\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia sat down next to us. \"Hey Mom and me are going to the mall, you guys want to come along?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, let me see? Movies or shopping with mom? Tricky decision there, Amelia!\" Cassie replied sarcastically, making me laugh and snort milk into the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno why you are laughing so much David. We're going bra shopping. After next week, you're going to need to know all about that!\" she said smugly, bringing me right back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amelia!\" Cassie and Mom yelled at once. Amelia just smiled, picked up her bowl and walked to the lounge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom came over. \"Sorry about that, hun... although she does have a point... Maybe it would be educational?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, Mom! This is my last week as a teenager, let me at least have some fun!\" I replied angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK dear, I'm sorry,\" she shrugged and walked of with a strange look on her face... almost guilt.</span></div></div>",

He said that they just made a new advancement on the procedure. He raised the amount he\u2019s going to pay us by 30%.  The new advancement now allows them to transfer certain broad pieces of knowledge from one body to another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does that mean Dad?\u201d David asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell son, the only reason my name wasn\u2019t even in the drawing was so I could keep my job as science teacher at the high school.  Now that Larry has basically told me that small pieces of knowledge like the subject I teach can be transferred as well, it means I can still be a viable candidate for the experiment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to my wife.  She was shaking her head slowly.  \u201cPhillip...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney it\u2019s my fault that we\u2019re even forced into this experiment.  I clearly can\u2019t provide for us, if I was a better father or husband we wouldn\u2019t be here, you wouldn\u2019t need to sacrifice so much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked over at my son.  \u201cDavid come with me, let\u2019s talk outside.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid was always a good boy.  He would make a fine adult, much better than I ever could be.  \u201cIt\u2019s only fair that I go through the swap process with you instead of your mother David.  She\u2019s been though enough.  I\u2019m sorry that I have to drag you into this but it\u2019s something we gotta do son. For the family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what about my sisters?! Can\u2019t they swap with you?\u201d David said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry David, but your name was chosen and it wouldn\u2019t be fair to them.  I\u2019m volunteering to spare your mother some pain, please understand son.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid looked sad but nodded his head in acceptance.  It was probably easier for him to accept this arrangement since he already accepted to swap with his mother.  My poor boy was still going to lose his body no matter what...</span></div></div>",

Dad thought it would be less complicated this way. I had one hell of week, but if anything it had made me feel worse. It had shown me exactly what I would be missing. I mean, sure I would still have Cassie, but can you see me hanging out with my friends or playing Call of Duty in my Mom's body!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter we signed in, Mom and I hugged, before being taken to separate rooms for some tests. Dad went with Mom and told me he would check in with me in a few minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there, you must be David,\" a grey haired man greeted me as I walked into the treatment room. \"I'm Dr. Larry Thomas, your father has told me lots about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Doctor,\" I replied quietly. My stomach was doing somersaults by now. I turned to see one of the prettiest women I had ever seen enter the room. She had the cutest face, with sparkling blue eyes and blonde hair hanging down to her waist. She was clearly pregnant, and her hand rested on the sizable bump. She flashed me a smile as she saw me and my heart melted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, this is my Assistant, Gloria Adams. You'll be seeing a lot of her over the next year or so,\" Dr. Thomas said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi David,\" she said, beaming. I felt an erection tenting my pants and hoped she didn't see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" I replied in a squeaky voice. I was in love... and I would be seeing a lot of her! At least something good would come of this... except of course I wouldn't be male anymore. Dr. Thomas snapped me out of my reverie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David, I just wanted say how grateful I am to you for volunteering for the trials,\" he enthused. \" I appreciate that you are doing this for your family, but you have to understand that your sacrifice will have huge benefits for medicine. I mean, we had hoped to study the effects of an inter-gender swap, but we never dreamed that someone would volunteer for such a drastic age change! Studying how you adapt to being a middle-aged woman will be most enlightening...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Larry!\" Gloria cut him off, glancing at my white face. \"David, I apologize. Dr. Thomas is just very excited about this. Now if you would like to strip behind this screen and put on this gown, we will prep you for the procedure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking some blood samples and inserting a line, they left me whilst they prepped Mom. Dad came in and gave me a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How we doing Champ?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, I'm not sure I can do this!\" I said nervously. \"It's crazy! I don't want to become a woman! Become Mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy Dad sighed and nodded. \"I understand David, I really do. But it doesn't change the fact that we need that money. And you did volunteer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that Dad... but I can't... I mean, I would be your wife... we would...\" I rambled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think of it like that.\" Dad put his hand up. \"You would be Elizabeth Mason, you would have an important job: caring for your family and making sure they get a good start in life. With the money we get from these trials, we won't just save the house but also have great college funds set up. I know it's a huge sacrifice I'm asking you to make, but it's one that would set your siblings up. So what do you say Champ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swallowed and thought of Cassie. If there was anyone I could do it for, it would be her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Dad, tell them I'm ready,\" I said with a shaky voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks son.\" He smiled and gave me a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria came back in and prepared the anaesthetic.  \"Now David, I would like you to count to ten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One... two... three...\"</span></div></div>",

Wait a minute... this wasn't my room... it looked like a hospital ward or something... \"Oh no!\" I cried and grabbed my mouth as I heard my mother's voice come out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat up quickly and let out another cry as I felt a pair of heavy breasts bounce on my chest below my gown. I grabbed them in shock and noticed my long nails painted a light pink. Long black hair framed my view as I hastily grabbed my crotch and felt... nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, what have I done?! What have I done?!\" I sobbed. Gloria came in a few minutes later and comforted me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on now,\" she said gently holding me, \"everything's going to be okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can it be?!\" I cried. \"My teenage life is over! Now I have to live my mom's life! I'm a 42 year old woman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You knew you would be, honey,\" she chided me softly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but actually waking up like this! It's... so real... and there's no way back!\" I sobbed heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" Gloria said, holding me by the shoulders. \"You're now Elizabeth Mason, wife and mother of three. Now your da... I mean your husband told me you cared greatly for your family? Well now you're the most important person in their lives and I know you're going to do just fine, okay <i>Elizabeth</i>? Now why don't we get you up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded and dried my eyes as she helped me out of bed. Elizabeth. That's what my name would be from now on. It was so feminine... but so was I now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria did some tests and took some blood samples from me, before helping me dress. Gloria showed me how to put on a bra and I blushed as she helped me into my panties and showed me how to put on the black tights my mom had worn to the procedure. I reluctantly put on the black knee length skirt and sighed as I put on the flowery blouse with flouncy sleeves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood looking mournfully at myself in the mirror. This is how I would dress from now on. Gloria stood next to me with a slight smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? It's not that bad, is it?\" she asked gently. I looked up at her... wait a minute... this morning we were the same height, now she was a head taller than me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! I'm so short!\" I exclaimed. But of course I was, mom is short. Worse, I would never get any taller. I would spend the rest of my life being looked down on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why women use these, honey,\" Gloria replied as she dropped a pair of four inch heeled black pumps by my feet. I slipped them on and wobbled. Sure I felt taller but I also felt like I was about to break my neck! Gloria helped me walk around the room for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, you'll get used to them,\" she smiled. \"And that's the kind of thing we're interested in. Come take a seat\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wobbled over to the bed and sat on the edge. My ass felt huge as I sat down, like I had a cushion stuffed down it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the next year, Elizabeth, I am going to be studying how the swap affects you psychologically,\" Gloria said in a business-like fashion. \"I want to track exactly how you respond to your new role in life. Every evening I would like you to log onto a website we have set up and fill out a simple journal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A journal?\" I asked taking a piece of paper from her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. It can be as short or as long as you like. I would like you to note down your feelings about yourself, your children, your husband... anything you feel is relevant. Once a week you'll come in here and we'll chat. It also gives Dr. Thomas a chance to do some tests and for you to raise any concerns you have over your physical health. Okay?\" She asked in a sing song voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure.\" At least I'd get to see Gloria regularly. Just then, the door opened and Dad walked in. He came straight over and hugged me. \"I'm so glad you're okay!\" he laughed.  I flinched away as he went to kiss me on the mouth. Gloria frowned at me, so I haltingly craned my head up and kissed him on the lips. It was just a peck, but it felt so weird! \"Thanks... Phillip,\" I mumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad seemed a bit embarrassed and backed away \"Er... I'll go see if David is ready to go home,\" he said and left again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Elizabeth,\" Gloria said, \"I forgot to tell you. We've asked everyone to treat David and yourself as your new selves as much as possible. We hope that it will help you adapt faster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK... I think I understand,\" I muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, so let's get you home to your family.\"</span></div></div>",

The swishing of the knee-length skirt felt more familiar than it should. The weigth of a purse slung over my shoulder and dangling back and forth with every step. The clicking of the pumps I was wearing was so surreal to hear whenever I sat a foot down to the ground. The motoric skills I retained from my mother made it feel normal and even made me walk in these pumps. Still it was something I would have to get used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria lead me through the same hallways I walked through earlier but they looked different. The seemed bigger, probably because I was now smaller, and the colours of the walls looked slightly different. I could not pinpoint in which way different but still they were different in my memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon we were at the entrance where dad... No, I mean my husband, and a teenage boy who I saw so many years in the mirror where already waitiing there for me. The boy, my son I kept reminding myself, had the same look on his face than I did right now. The look of someone who saw himself standing infront of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi...mom...\", she or rather he said finally. \"You're feeling good...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded slowly. This situation was just plain akward. \"I hope your... feeling good aswell... son.\", I replied, still getting used to my new feminine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria smiled and tried to put us out of our misery  for now. \"I guess you have much to talk about. You're free to go now. We're really thankful for you being our test subjecta. You really helped us a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome...\", I mumbled quietly. \"I hope this technology will come to any good use.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry\", smiled Gloria. \"Anyway, I see you in a week, Elizabeth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded and my husband... and my son... went to the car with me. There we all got in without saying a word. I knew we would have to try to act like everything is normal and it seemed when we were in the lab earlier that dad would manage it but now that mom was around he looked like he had problems to look at what looked like his wife as his wife rather than his son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was seating in the front seat beside my da- husband while mo- David was sitting in the backseat. Dad wanted to stroke my hand like he normally did with my mom's before starting the engine but pulled his hand away halfway when he noticed what he was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was glad that he did it. Although I knew I had to get intimate with this man some day but I would rather have this day come later then sooner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car awoke to life and drove us back to our family. I fumbled with my leather purse the whole riede, trying to get used to the idea of carrying one for the rest of my life. I was glad that nobody wanted to talk and thus only the radio was making noises. This whole surreal situation was terrible enough and the curious kids back home would question us anyway so it was nice to have some time alone with my thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't know if I can do this...\", I thought. \"Now that it happened, that there is no way back, it's even more intimidating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked into the rearview mirror and looked at my mother, no my son. As hard as it is, I have to stop thinking about her as my mom and had to start thinking of her as my teenaged son David!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had a look of guilt on his face. Was he feeling bad for giving me his life?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before I could ask, we arrived at home. All of three of us left the car and went to the door. Before and of us could enter the key into the keyhole, the spun open and revealed the curious faces of three girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it work?\", asked Cassandra right away and looked at me. I nodded, to scared to say anything. I feared that if I said anything, it would become official. Stupid of course. It was already official. I was my own mother now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls mouths suddenly exploded and they asked us a lot of questions. Well, actually only Cassandra and Melody asked questions. </span></div></div>",

I closed my mouth, feeling the difference of my lips, and went without a word upstairs, leaving my family behind. They all looked confused as I left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpstairs I got into my room, not caring that it wasn't actually my room anymore. I threw myself on my old bed, face first, feeling how different it was to lie on my stomach now that I had breasts. Tears began to form in my eyes and I pressed my face against the pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laid there for a while, I could not tell how long. The door opened. At first I did not want to turn my head around but when I heard Cassandra's voice I did anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, David?\", she asked, purposely using my old name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\", I mumbled quietly and tried to get myself together. \"No. I'm not fine\", I repeated, louder this time. \"Just look at me! I'm mom. I'm old!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra sat down beside me when I got up to look at her. \"But you knew this was going to happen\", she replied and looked into my eyes. It dawned on me just now how ridiculous I must have been looked. A grown-up woman crying like a little girl on her teenage son's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know...\", I sighed. \"I know that I knew what was coming, but still... It's too damn hard! Thinking about this situation is one thing but actually being in this situation is something completely different. You think you can do it but when you suddenly find yourself stuck like... like this! It's... You just can't imagine how it feels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra nodded and placed her arm around my shoulders. \"I know it must be horrible. I really can't imagine what you're going through. I mean it sounds exciting at first and if you're not related to it, you might think you could enjoy it, but actually being in this situation... But you should know that everyone appreciates what you did for the family. We know what sacrifice you made. Even Amelia appreciates it in some way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded sobbingly. It's true, they really appreciate it. Now that we had the money to pay the mortgage and keep our house, even having enough for a nice college fund, we really had no other problem anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also it's not like you lose your life completely. I know we should act like you'rs mom and mom is you BUT that doesn't mean we cannot hang out together anymore. Sure, when we're in public we can't act like we used to but here in private, nobody will keep us from having fun. Also we're allowed to tell Stephen and Laura. It might not be like it used to be but we'll try to make it as similar as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain I sobbed and nodded in response. She was right again. I might have lost my life but that does not mean I cannot try to have at least a tiny bit of my old life preserved. \"You're right...\", I finally answered. \"I have to be strong. There is no turning back anymore. This is me from now on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra smiled. \"That's right. And no matter how you look, you're still David to me\". She got up and walked to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Cassandra\", I smiled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to. We're family, right? If we don't support each other, who else will?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before she could open the door and leave the room, the door was opened by someone else. Dad... Philip... My husband... to be precise. Behind him was... David...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you two...\", he said carefully and then looked at me. \"How are you feeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better now...\", I answered truthfully. \"My... daughter helped me cheer up\". It was time to get used to seeing them that way. Even though I might want to preserve some of my life, it was better for me to accept mom's life as my own now. It was easier to act like her in public if I started thinking like her in private.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good, Da-Mom\", smiled \"David\" at me. \"I have to suggest that we all start this slowly. We might have had a week to get familiar with the idea but it's still kind of sudden. I suggest that you sleep in your old room just this once. So you can get familiar with your new body before getting familiar with your new life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, thanks. I might need that\", I said truthfully. All these changes at once would be too much for me now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David\" smiled at me and then turned around to Philip. \"Come on, let's leave those two alone. I'll bring you your nightgown and some clothes for tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus my son and my husband left the room. I had to admit, mom really looked like me and acted like me but there was still something that showed that it was her and not me. Maybe I was just imagining it, maybe it is because I know it is her and not me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra turned back and sat down on her bed. \"Sooo... \"mom\", what do you want to do?\", she asked and even made quotation marks with her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrugged my shoulders, my long hair brushing over them. \"I dunno... Playing PS3?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra grinned broadly. \"My pleasure. I'll have to get the camera first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at her confused. \"What do you need a camera for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy\", she replied. \"It's the first time I see my mother playing a video game. Just the thought of this is hilarious. I have to capture this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head. She was really trying to make me comfortable with this whole situation and I was really grateful for it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I awoke in the morning, oblivious that something was wrong about my body. Unfortunately this feeling vanished when I got up in bed. The long hair, which I had done in a pony tail so that it would not get in my way when sleeping (Cassandra's idea), brushed my neck. It felt normal, the procedure really did well in that case, but I knew it was not normal for me to feel that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large orbs on my chest felt strange and yet familiar enough for me to not freak out. It really happened, it was no bad dream. I was at home, in my room, my bed but I was not me. I was Elizabeth Mason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed and slung my feminine legs out of the bed, looking at the nightgown I wore right now. This was so surreal but felt so normal at the same time. \"Can I really get used to all of this?\", I mumbled and straightened the hem of the nightgown. I sat there for a while, trying to get a grip on this reality. I then took a deep breath and got up from the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that I noticed that Cassandra was still asleep. That was strange. Normally I was the on to sleep longer. I looked at the clock. 7am. 7am?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow can this be. I normally don't wake up at this time of the day, at least not without the help of an alarm clock. Also, I don't feel this awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could it be that I now have mom's sleeping habits?\", I thought. \"Well, at least it might help when I have to play... no... BE the wife of the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then walked quietly out of the room and down to the kitchen were I found my husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you're awake\", he smiled at me. I looked at the table in front of him. He had already made himself some breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I figured you might need some time. Betty usually makes breakfast, so you'll have to make it eventually, but not today... Well, at least not for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess Melody won't be able to make herself something to eat. Amelia possibly as well...\",  I mumbled and sat down on the kitchen table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you feeling?\", asked Philipp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How should I feel?\", I replied. \"It's nearly impossible to get used to this and yet I have to try. It's harder for me than for anyone else. Mom might have gone through a sex change, like I did, but she gained back her youth while I lost everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilipp put his hand on mine. \"Don't worry\", he smiled and carressed my feminine hand. \"We all can't imagine what you're going through but we'll try to help you. You might not be able to do all the things you wanted to do but you still have a life in front of you. Yes, this might even be easier for you. You don't have to worry about finding a job anymore. You don't have to worry about finding someone who loves you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, this was getting way too awkward. My dad was stroking my hand and was implying that he would love me just like he loved mom. And I think I like it! This is NOT good, is it?</span></div></div>",

She finished pulling her tights up then said, \"You aren't the only having problems with this. I miss my feminity, and these are still my clothes.\" she said in my old voice. For the the first time I saw her side of the situation, sure she gained youth but lost all her feminity. Skills she spent her life acquiring now useless.

Last night before we went to bed, David told me how he wished that if he had to swap that it was anyone else but mom. How he would gladly swap with me or Amelia. I thought about that as I went to my parents room. I knocked on the door, and was surprised when my mother told me to come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Cassie, what's on mind\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\" I started, \"David and I were talking last night, and he was saying that he would much rather swap with me or Amelia. And that got me thinking, that maybe, I could swap with David instead of you\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you talked to David about this change in plans?\" Mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking we could keep this a secret from him. You know, not tell him until we are certain we can arrange for this change in plans. I was just thinking that because we are twins, we would adjust quicker than if he swapped with you and I don't want to raise false hopes.\" I stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand\" she started. \"I'll talk with Larry and see if we can make the change in plans. I'll talk with you later about if this is a go or not\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid's POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up this morning and noticed that Cassie was already up. I walked downstairs and saw that she was eating some Captain Crunch. I walked over to the get a bowl and join her. When I sat down I asked \"What are you doing up so early?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to go to the bathroom. I just figured I would just get an early start on the day\" she replied. I new she was a bad at lying, and this was no different. But what would happen in a few days, it was the last thing on my mind. I had planed on telling Stephen and Laura about what was going to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about Stephen and Laura\" Cassie said. \"I called them last night and gave them the basic info of what will happen\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks sis\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast, I went over to Stephens house to play some video games. I planed on trying to do everything I normally do, but with my friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra's POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter David left to go and hang out with his friends, I joined mom as she called Larry to see if we could replace myself for mom in the body swap. I couldn't really tell if it would be a go for our secret swap or not. All mom was a saying was \"ok\" or \"yes I understand\". She was in the phone for no more than 10 minutes before hanging up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who will be swapping with David\" I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will.\" firmly but kindly, mom said. \"He said he could take David before you and put him under first so he never sees that he's swapping bodies with his twin\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks mom. I think David will be more conferrable being me instead of you\" I told her. \"Still, I don't want to keep him in the dark, one of us has to tell him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded. \"I can tell him, if you want.\" she offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The rest of the week afterwards went by uneventfully. We left for the procedure around 8 o'clock am. It was a short, quiet car ride. Mom and Dad were in the front seats, and I was in the back with Cassie. Amelia had stayed home so Melody wasn't home alone. We had planed on leaving them home, mostly because Amelia would complain the whole time about being bord and we knew we couldn't entertain Melody the whole time. When we arived, Dr. Thomas was waiting for us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much for doing this\" he said. \"I would never have asked this of you had I not known you needed the money\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry\" dad said. \"We had a family meeting and almost all of us wanted this. its just nobody wanted to be the ones to be picked\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Now if you and David could come with me, your wife and Cassie can go with my assistant Gloria\" Dr. Thomas said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that we went into an examination room. There was nothing in the room really, just a desk, a few chairs, and a wheelchair. On the desk, I noticed a hospital gown and a needle like what they use to give you a shot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you change into the gown and then sit in the wheelchair  please\" Dr. Thomas asked me. I did what I was asked and when I sat down, Dr. Thomas gave me a shot in the arm and before we left the room, I was out cold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I woke up, I could feel my body was different. However I couldn't move anything. I saw out of the corner of my eye that Gloria was going over something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good, your up. Don't worry if you can't move. The anesthetics probably haven't worn off yet.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to say something but I just couldn't. I closed my eyes and fell asleep. When I woke again I was alone and I could move now. I got up slowly, not quite sure how well I would be able to walk. When I stood up, I instantly felt the weight of my new breasts. I still felt weak and woozy, likely from the anesthetics still working their way out of my system. Just as I found my balance, Gloria came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good your up. I was just coming in to check on you\" she said. \"Now here are your new clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe handed me some clothes. I looked at them but found that they weren't my mother's. They looked like the purple T-shirt, black shorts, bra and underwear, short white socks and purple running shoes Cassie had when we came here. I walked over to the mirror in the room and was shocked by what I saw. Standing in the mirror wasn't my mother, but my twin sister Cassandra. I now had her shoulder length brown hair, her Hourglass figure, her C-cup breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha, what happened!?\" I asked. \"I thought I was going to be my mother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You forgot?\" surprised, Gloria asked. she giggled slightly. \"You're still a little woozy, I see.\" she sighed. \"Originally, you were going to switch with your mother but it Cassandra volunteered to take your mothers place in the swap.\" she smiled, seeing me blush. \"Remember now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded and Gloria ran me through a serious of tests to make sure the operation went smoothly. After she was done, she lead me to see my parents. When we got to the waiting room I saw that Cassie was already waiting for me, in my body. It was weird, seeing my body from the outside. She was now the taller of the two of us, but only by an inch. After explaining that I had momentarily forgot, Cassie giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry but I just couldn't stand thinking about you becoming a 42 year old housewife. So I asked mom if I could take her place in the swap.\" she told me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Cassie. And no offense mom, but I would rather be in my twins body than the body of the women who pushed me out of herself\" I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay David, I understand.\" mom replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, we left for home. I had seen a clock on the way out and it said it was 9 o'clock. There is no way we were only there for a hour. When we walked outside however, I soon found out that it was nine at night as it was getting dark out. When we finally got home Amelia and Melody had already gone to bed. When I got inside, I went strait to my bedroom with Cassie. We donned our new pajamas then went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, I woke up and momentarily forgot what had happened yesterday. I opened my eyes and said to myself \"Why am I in Cassie's bed?\" Hearing Cassie's voice come from my mouth reminded me that I'm now my twin sister for the rest of my life. I went over to Cassie's closet (well I guess it's mine now) to look for something to wear today. I was now beginning to be glad I swapped body's with Cassandra because she is the only female in the house who doesn't wear high heels or skirts. Not to say she doesn't have a pair or two, she just doesn't wear them. In fact, last Christmas Amelia got her two pairs of heels and three short skirts. I guess Cassie never got around to bringing them back, because they were in her closet. However, I don't want to wear them any more than Cassie. I just grabbed some black shorts  and a gray T-shirt. I put one of \"my\" sports bras on and some plain white underwear. With that I left our room and went to get some breakfast. I came down and saw that Cassie in my old body had made some scrambled eggs for us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I put cheese on yours just how you like them\" she (or I guess he now) said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, I just want to help you any way I can.\" Cassie said. \"Also, Laura called, and she wanted to go for our run with you for a while. She said she wants to help you adjust as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When will she be here?\" I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About ten. And just FYI, I find the purple shoes you had on yesterday are the best for running\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool. Tell her I'm in for your run.\" I said. Ever sense Laura came here from Britain two years ago, she and Cassie would go running almost every day. I guess now, I'll go running with her every day. It was nine right now, so I had one hour before Laura will come over. Just then my phone (Cassie's old phone) said I had a text from Laura. She was asking me what Cassie just told me so I gave her the same answer I gave Cassie. The hour before my run with Laura went by uneventfully. I decided to read one of Cassie's favorite books 'The Hunger Games'. I didn't really have any interest at first, but as I got deeper in the book, I quickly learned why Cassie liked the book so much, we truly had similar interests. I stopped about five minutes before Laura would come over so Cassie could help me get ready. She put my hair into a tight ponytail then pulled out the purple tennis shoes she told me were the best for running. I hadn't noticed last night, but they were kind of springy, no wonder why she almost always had these on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was just getting finished when I saw Laura in the driveway. I quickly ran out of the house to be with my friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" Laura started \"I was wondering if you would be a little more \"girly\" than Cassie was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I like shopping like most girls, but I never had a friend to go with. I hoped that maybe I could get you to go sometimes?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.. I don't know what to say, I didn't plan on being girly.\" shrugging, I told her. \"Maybe it will just happen on its own, who knows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe talked about a bunch of things during the run. We talked about the differences between being a boy and being a girl mostly. She told me that Cassie had some secret crushes at school. Most of the names I knew, but I wouldn't say we were friends. One of them however had asked Cassie out more than once and she repeatedly said no. His name was Brian. He was in marching band, one of the two goalies on the varsity ice hockey team (backup), and also played defense for our school lacrosse team. Because of this combination of activities, most girls weren't head over heels for him. But being an athlete, he was a little more popular than my group of friends. I'm not saying he's a jerk, he just hangs out with some jerks, but he at least will talk with me and my friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe ran for maybe an hour. When we walked into my house Laura noticed my new phone had a text.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got a text. Who's it from\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Brian\" I told her. \"He wants to know if I want to do something tomorrow night\" I replied back asking what he had in mind. About a minute later he replied saying \"Maybe we could go ice sking then do a movie\" I relayed this to Laura who shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell him you can go.\" she insisted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if I'm ready for a boyfriend yet. I did just become a girl yesterday after all.\" I informed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So ask him if he has a buddy who would want to go with me so I can be there for you\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" uncertain, I said. I text him 'Yes' but asked if he had a friend so Laura could come too. Thirty seconds later he said that he has someone in mind who would be just right for Laura. I asked him who and he said his friend Curtis. Curtis was just like Brian but flipped. He played defense in hockey and goalie in lacrosse. But he was also in marching band.  </span></div></div>",

I was in denial as I read the name on the paper...Amelia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could say anything, Amelia jumped in and said, \"You've got to be kidding me! There's no way I'm spending the rest of my life as a nerd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing at her, I said, \"I'm not too happy about this either, Amelia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the two of us, Mom said, \"I'm sorry; but both of you were chosen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an attempt to plead for mercy, Amelia turned to Dad and said, \"You have to call this off; I can't be a guy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Amelia; but I can't do that.\" Sighing, Dad said, \"We could use the money, and a change of perspective may be good for you.\"<br>\r\nStill in shock, I finally said, \"I need to be alone for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone could say anything, I left the table and went upstairs without finishing dinner. Normally I would've loved mom's spaghetti; but I lost my appetite when I learned I'd spend the rest of my life as my bitchy 14 year old sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into my room, I collapsed onto the bed. Expecting myself to cry, I simply stared at the ceiling. After a few minutes, I heard the door creak open; followed by Cassandra walking into the room. \"Are you okay, bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her, I said, \"What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, this is my room too.\" Looking at me, Cassandra said, \"I'm allowed to come in to check on my brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up in bed, I looked at Cassie and said, \"Of all the people in the family; why'd it have to be her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the luck of the draw.\" Sitting next to me, Cassie said, \"Sometimes it doesn't work in our favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't want to be Amelia.\" Sighing, I said, \"What would that do to our relationship?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know; it may be rocky for a little while.\" Pausing, Cassie said, \"We'll adjust; we always do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter talking for a while, Cassie and I decided to play a video game. As we played, I realized that she was right about one important thing. If I was going to be Amelia for the rest of my life, I might as well enjoy what time I had left as me.</span></div></div>",

Amelia had spent the last few days acting even bitchier than normal; something which I didn't think was possible.  In a way I couldn't blame her; as both of our lives were being turned upside down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'd spent the last few days alternating between spending time with my friends and having, to my annoyance, lessons from Amelia on what I was to do now that I'd have her life.  I couldn't believe that she expected me to continue to be a part of the cheer squad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter we were signed in, Amelia and I were sent to separate rooms for tests.  Dad went with me while Mom went with Amelia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we were in the room, Dad said to me, \"How are you handling all this, David?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you think, Dad?\" sighing, I said, \"I'm about to spend the rest of my life as my bitchy sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to be like her, you know.\" Pausing, Dad said, \"Think of this as an opportunity to make her into a better person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI realized Dad had a good point, just as the door opened to reveal a woman in a lab coat.  As she walked into the room, I saw that she was clearly pregnant.  \"You must be David; I've heard a lot about you from Dr. Thomas.\"  Looking at me, she said, \"I'm Gloria Adams, Dr. Thomas' assistant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Gloria, I'm David.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad stood to the side as Gloria took my vitals and prepped me for the procedure.  Once that was all finished, I was placed on a gurney and wheeled out of the room.  Looking at me as she walked alongside, Gloria said, \"I'm going to put you under anesthetic now, if that's alright.\"<br>\r\n\"It's fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then.\" Smiling, Gloria said, \"I'll need you to count backwards from 10.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gloria placed the mask over my face, I said, \"10...9...8...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I awoke slowly, lying on my back as I had been before, but feeling... different, to say the least. As I struggled to open my eyes, I noticed my eyelashes seemed thicker. Was this really it? Was I Amelia now, never to be myself again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good, you're awake,\" came Gloria's voice. \"I don't know if you can really tell yet, but... the procedure was a success!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to sit up, but only succeeded in raising my head for a second before falling back down onto the veritable blanket of hair beneath me. I felt a slight tugging in my scalp, confirming the hair was mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, now,\" Gloria said. \"Your body... your new body... isn't quite awake yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let my eyes fall shut and responded with an unmistakably female groaning sound. God, they had done it. This was really happening. I laid there for a few more minutes, and as the feeling of lethargy slowly faded, I gradually became aware of every aspect of Amelia's body. As unfamiliar as it was, it didn't feel as bizarre as I thought it should.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually I managed to keep my eyes open and groggily stand up. I looked down at Amelia's hands, with their slender fingers and long nails, trying to comprehend that these were now my hands, for the rest of my life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fascinating, isn't it?\" Gloria asked. \"Well, I can only imagine, myself. Although I wouldn't mind trying it myself someday...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it...\" I muttered. I recognised my voice as Amelia's, though it sounded a bit different from the inside, and the soft tone was not one she'd normally use. I continued to gingerly stare down until she spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, we just need to run through a few quick tests to make sure the swap went smoothly. First, I just want you to walk to the other side of the room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked down at my feet, slowly placed one in front of the other and wobbled a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're thinking too hard,\" Gloria told me. \"Just relax and start walking like everything's normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a breath, fixed my eyes on the wall across from me and started moving toward it. Sure enough, I made it there with no trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Gloria said. \"Now turn and come back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did so, and on the way back caught sight of myself in the full-length mirror. While the sight of Amelia's body matching my movement was certainly strange, what really got my attention was the distinctly feminine manner in which my reflection strode past, hips swaying with each step. Was I really doing that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait...\" I said, stopping and turning back toward the mirror. I walked toward the mirror and observed my movements. Yep, that was Amelia's girly way of walking. I backpedaled and watched myself walk to the mirror one more time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aggh! Why am I walking like this?\" I asked, vaguely hysterical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes. Your new body still has the parts of Amelia's brain that regulate motor skills and other such basic things. You'll probably find yourself engaging in other subconscious habits of hers as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't like the sound of that. It was bad enough being in Amelia's body, but now I felt as if I didn't even have proper control of it. I tried to reassure myself it didn't matter that much, and I was still making my own decisions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, that sucks,\" I said. \"Couldn't you have avoided that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we hadn't done it this way, you'd hardly be able to walk at all. If you hate it that much, you'll just have to try and break the habit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'll be breaking a lot of Amelia's habits, believe me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria looked a bit concerned. \"I understand that, but... try not to be conspicuous. And remember, you are female now and you need to accept that. You can't just go back to acting like this never happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, I know... you should probably be more worried about Amelia than me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That brings up another point. Amelia is your name now, and David is your brother. You had better start calling each other as such right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just sighed at that. Well, I was still David on the inside, whatever people called me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" Gloria said, \"I need to test a couple other things. Sit down for me, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI obliged by sitting on the edge of the bed, which was tall enough that my feet didn't reach the ground. Not something I was used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria fetched a little mallet and lightly hit my knee with it, prompting me to involuntarily jerk my leg upward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, reflexes are good,\" she said. \"And now, well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria hesitated for a few moments before taking the mallet and... smacking me right in the breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah!\" I yelped, suddenly feeling very flustered at the impact to my sensitive new body part. \"D-don't do that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. That's a new sensation for you, is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" I indignantly replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. I just had to make sure you were getting the right feedback. If you hadn't felt that, it would suggest a fairly serious problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria put the mallet down on the table, picked up a clipboard and walked a few steps away while writing something down. Then she stopped and looked thoughtful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh...\" I said to break the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. Well, there's some more data we need to gather, but... It would be best to leave those things for later, once you've lived like this for a while. Now then, I'll leave you to get dressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned my head to look at the pile of Amelia's clothing. \"Ummm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never hooked a bra before? Don't worry, it'll come to you. I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think? That's not the kind of thing I want to hear from you right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you are the first human test subjects. The whole point of this is to learn, remember. I'm afraid we can't predict every little thing. Anyway, I'm sure you can manage regardless. Your family will meet you outside the room.\" Gloria walked to the door, then turned back and smiled at me. \"Oh, and one more thing... thank you. You're making a great contribution to science.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she left. I stood up, took off my hospital gown and looked at my exposed new form. I was a naked teenage girl. Somehow that made me feel weak and vulnerable. Shaking that thought away, I approached the pile of clothes. It didn't look like much, partly because Amelia's body was smaller than mine, but also because she didn't exactly dress conservatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst I slid the panties on. I had to admit the feeling of the soft fabric against my smooth skin was kind of nice. I knew the emptiness between my legs should be disturbing, but my altered subconscious seemed to be insisting it was perfectly normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took the bra, put my arms through the straps and, sure enough, reached around my back and fastened the clasp with no trouble. Now that it was on, I instinctively felt I could move around more freely. Apparently I had been subconsciously restraining my movement to avoid too much jiggling. It was unnerving to think that I just knew these things now, without even realising it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI picked up Amelia's short skirt and sighed. I had considered complaining about her choice of outfit in the morning, but I knew she wouldn't care what I thought. As far as she was concerned, her life would still be hers even when I was at the helm. I intended to prove her wrong soon enough. I stepped into the skirt and pulled it up to my waist. Simple enough, but it didn't feel like much of a substitute for trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext I donned the tank top, which was short enough to leave my belly button exposed. Why did girls wear clothes that didn't fit right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, I put on Amelia's socks and shoes. At least she wasn't quite crazy enough to wear heels all the time... although I'd half expected her to do so today just to spite me. I didn't feel fully dressed at this point, but by Amelia's standards I was. I took one last look at the girl in the mirror, sighed deeply, and headed for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened the door to the incredibly jarring sight of my own body, now inhabited by Amelia, standing there with an expression of equal parts frustration and despair. She turned to look at me, but the expression didn't change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to say something. \"Um... hi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just grunted and turned away. Several more uncomfortable seconds passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARGH! This sucks!\" Amelia suddenly shouted in my voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't exactly disagree with that. I stayed silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!\" She pointed a finger at me. \"You'd better not mess up my life, got it? Remember everything I told you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, because you're going to care so much about <i>my</i> life,\" I said. Amelia twitched angrily upon hearing her own voice disrespecting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never had a life in the first place!\" she retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for proving my point!\" Ugh, I sounded way too much like Amelia being bitchy. That gave me an idea, though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" I said, \"You want me to act like you? Here I go. Ahem. Hey <i>David</i>, why do you have to be such a dork all the time? I feel like a loser just for standing next to you! Get a life or get away from me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effectiveness of my impression, accompanied by the perfect body language, scared me a little. Hopefully it was scaring Amelia as well. She stared at me with every negative emotion she could fit on my old face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's what you're like from the outside,\" I added. \"Annoying, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you two fighting already?\" asked a bemused Larry as he approached us with our parents in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, they're always fighting,\" Mom said. \"Why would they stop now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so?\" Larry asked. \"Well, maybe you'll get along better once you've walked a mile in each other's shoes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of us silently exchanged looks of \"yeah, right\".</span></div></div>",

While not a person said a word, thoughts were churning in the mind of David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no turning back for him, he was permanently swapped into his young, spoilt little sister until the day he was laid on his deathbed. But on that deathbed, it wouldn't be him, it would be his brain, trapped in the body of Amelia. David could no longer have a relationship with a girl he liked, get married and be a father, but in the end, he realized he was going to be on the receiving end of the rod, with a man he was attracted to simply because of the hormones that ran in her body, Amelia's body. At this point, David realized he was getting turned on by this prospect, and ceased thinking such a lewd thought, though it was depressing to his male side at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Amelia and David were sitting in opposite ends of the car, and on the other end of the seats, Amelia was churning out her own deal of thoughts, as she twiddled her thumbs.. No, it wasn't hers now wasn't it? These fingers, this body belonged to her damned older brother, even his habits, twiddling his thumbs when troubled, belonged to his body alone. Amelia was going to live in his body until the end of her days, she could no longer try out new fashionable clothing in the comfort of her own body, though at the same time, she secretly craved such height, such superiority to her classmates in school. Amelia enjoyed her thoughts, deeply relishing in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car slowed down, the family had reached home after half an hour of driving. Amelia was first to get out of the car, though struggling not to let anyone notice her momentarily uplifted mood. Amelia smiled with devilish thoughts, as the first to enter the household, amongst the stares of the other family members, who could not believe the sudden change in character, the noisy spoilt Amelia was so quiet at this point of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for David however, left the car in a hurry, with a need to urinate in the toilet at home. He could not blame Amelia for his plight, as this body belonged to him now. He was walking beside his sister, Cassandra, who was giving him words of comfort, though David himself was deaf to the emotions those words contained. Both of them were the second to enter the household, much to the worrying looks of their Father, Mother and youngest child, Melody.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I entered the bathroom and closed the door behind me as I hurried to the toilet. My bladder was about to burst and I wasn't sure how to hold it in. In front of the toilet I stood still, realizing it would be the first time I would be peeing as a girl and hopefully not the last time. It was then that I already missed my old body, I could just have undo the zipper of my pants, push my member through the hole and piss like that. Now I would have to go through all that extra work just to pee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shimmered the skirt down my legs and after that Amelia's panties. It would take a long time to think of them as my own, seeing how I would have preferred wearing boxer shorts. I then sat down on the toilet seat noticing how cold it felt on my bum. Not thinking about it, I tried peeing. Just like normally I concentrated on pushing the pee out, but weirdly nothing came out. I didn't feel nothing. I was beginning to get scared, what if something got damaged during the swap and I couldn't pee anymore. I was so scared that I held my head in my hands thinking what to do. It was then that I felt something happening, it felt like I was peeing but different. I looked down and saw pee coming out of \"that hole\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI instantly felt relieved, not only because of my bladder going to be empty but also because of the fact that everything still functioned inside Amelia's body. I then closed my eyes and felt the pee escaping my body, it went on pretty long. Amelia probably drank a lot of juice just to get back at me. When I couldn't feel any more pee coming out I remembered Amelia saying something about drying it off with a piece of toilet paper. The thought of it disgusted me, I would non-directly touch my \"vagina\", my first thought was to leave it like it was and do it some other time. But then I realize I had to do it sooner or later and perhaps the best time was now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ripped a piece of toilet paper off and then began to clean my vagina. The cleaning was needed, I could feel the piece of toilet paper slowly getting wet. I then grabbed another piece and continued cleaning. However my curiosity got the better of me and with the piece of paper I slowly began to feel the shape of my hole. It was just like someone cut off my thing. \"Haha.\" I laughed a little at my own joke. It was certainly different than I was used to, I then dropped the piece of paper in the toilet and stood up and raised the panties and the skirt up again. I then washed my hands trying to avoid to look at my reflection. Being a girl was a little bit easier for me right now (a tiny bit), but seeing Amelia's reflection would still take it's time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI dried off my hands and exited the bathroom, I could hear sounds coming from the living room so I went there. \"What took you so long? Stuck in the toilet?\" Amelia asked snickering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amelia, I mean David what did we just discuss now.\" Your father asks. Amelia grumbles something about deserving it, but she let it pass. I sat down next to my mom and Cassandra on the couch, amazed by how tall they were now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Amelia, your mom says looking at you,  we talked about your sleeping arrangements, considering your new situation we think it's best if the both of you get familiar to your permanent sleeping quarters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you're saying that I'm having to go sleeping inside Amelia's bed?\" You ask your mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now sweetie, it's your bed now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on mom, can't I spend one last night with Cassandra? Please?\" You ask your mother grabbing her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" Your mom says looking unsure about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on mom, it's just one night.\" Cassandra supports you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way I'm going to sleep with that crybaby in one room.\" Amelia says referring to Melody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not nice.\" Melody says pouting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when your mother and your father leave the living room to talk about it. The suspense is killing the four of you. When your parents return, they have decided..</span></div></div>",

She was stuck having to sleep in one room with Amelia until then, so from tomorrow night we would sleep together. It would be different from sleeping with Cassandra, after we went to bed we usually would talk about the day deep into the night. Guess I would get my sleep early now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh brother.\" Amelia said rolling her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks dad.\" I said with a satisfied smile. He then lowered himself and showed me his cheek. \"How about giving daddy a kiss on the cheek?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way dad. I'm not like that.\" I said backing away from him. I wouldn't kiss my dad on the cheek, that was only a thing women did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amelia dear, you're a girl now, so you have to act like a girl.\" Your mother said raising her eyebrows in a threatening manner.

It was only then that I heard: \"Hold on kids.\" I looked around and saw dad coming from behind us up the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amelia, I mean David where are you going?\" Dad asked. I then noticed that Amelia was about to open the door to her bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to my room dad, you said yourself we could stay there for today.\" Amelia said rolling her eyes again (You certainly hope she will stop doing that in public). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What your mother and me said was that you could sleep in your old room for tonight, we didn't say anything about spending time in them before.\" Dad shook his head firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you telling me I have to spend the afternoon in her room?\" I asked outraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Amelia, that is your room. David here can spend the afternoon in his room.\" Dad said putting his hand on Amelia's shoulder. She shrugged it off and stomped her way into my old bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to be fun.\" Cassandra said rolling her eyes just like Amelia and went after her sister. Since dad was still watching me, I was forced to enter Amelia's room. Inside the room I instantly hated it. The room was so...pink. That sweet horrible pink. I really hoped mom and dad would allow me to paint it into another color, anything was better than this. Apart from the color the room was the same as the one me and Cassandra had. Only instead of the PS3 hooked on to a TV, Amelia had a vanity table for her alone, so she wouldn't need to use the bathroom mirror. I hated the thing instantly, it was in the same exact pink color as the rest of the room and on the table stood a mixture of perfume bottles, mascara, lipsticks, lip blossoms and every other thing a girl would need. I sat down at Amelia's desk and banged my head against the table. This was going to be a long day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that I heard a sudden noise from somewhere. I looked around and noticed the cellphone on the desk. It was Amelia's, the ringtone was the same she had. I wasn't sure what to do with it. Should I look at it or not? I realized this was now my cellphone and the person would continue calling me unless I would see who it was. I unlocked the phone and saw to my shock it was Alexandra Johnson, Amelia's best friend. What to do? Should I pick it up? But what if she notices something is wrong, then what?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I knew I was going to regret it, but it wasn't like I had a choice. Sooner or later I would need to meet with Alexandra, she is or was Amelia's best friend. And whether I liked it or not, I had to accept the fact that she would be my best friend now. I accepted the phone call and immediately I heard Alexandra's voice coming from the phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey girl, I've been calling you for hours, you now.\" Alexandra said quite annoyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, needed to go to a clinic, cellphones not allowed, totally rude.\" I said trying to make something up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totally girl,\" Alexandra agreed, \"so what did they do there with you? Not anything dangerous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou should now. I thought. \"No, just some routine examination, you know, it's part of some weird experiment they're holding, I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, and you actually volunteered for it?\" Alexandra asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, my parents ordered me to do it. If it were up to me, I wouldn't go there for a million.\" I told her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, right, hey have you heard about Clarissa? I heard from her sister that she actually had plastic surgery.\" Alexandra said exited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! Oh my gosh, what where?\" I asked Alexandra. And so I continued my talking with Alexandra. In the beginning it felt weird to talk with a girl like her. I mean I barely knew the girl, but somehow I just knew what to say and when. It was like I was in a play of some sort and I was taking on the role of my sister. Even weirder was the fact that at the beginning of the conversation I sat on the chair, but at the end I was lying on my stomach on Amelia's bed. I don't know when, but it was one of those habits Amelia had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you say about a sleepover at my place?\" Alexandra asked suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A sleepover? What's the occasion?\" I asked her curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing special, just a fun night together. What do you say?\" Alexandra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn't sure what to say. Here I had two choices I could make. My first choice was to go along and spend the night at Alexandra. It would be a good way to build up my relationship with Alexandra, knowing her better. I also thought that Amelia might agree to the idea, as to show that I would take good care of her life. The downside though was that I could not sleep with Cassandra, this was my last chance to sleep with her on one room. I knew my parents wouldn't change the date, they just wanted the both of us to accept each other's life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo in the end I .....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was really hard for me to do it, but in the end I decided not to go to the sleepover. It might have been something Amelia would have done, but that was it. I'm not Amelia, even though I was inside her body and had her life, that wouldn't mean I was her. Me and Cassandra have a very special relationship, we are twins or were now. Still, there was this connection between us that was so much stronger than any relation I ever knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but I have stuff at home to do. Some other time?\" I asked Alexandra as nice as I could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfh, fine, I'll call you tomorrow then.\" Alexandra said annoyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, see you.\" I told her as I hang up. Phew I thought I would get worse than that. Alexandra didn't seem to like it, but I was fine with it. At least now me and Cassandra could sleep together in one room for tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought all my troubles were solved at that moment, but that wasn't the case as the door suddenly opened up and inside the opening stood a very angry Amelia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, you!\" Amelia couldn't say anything as she walked over to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why are you looking so angry?\" I asked innocent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know what you've done? Why did you say no to her invitation? How could you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look me and Cassandra can only sleep on one room only for tonight. After that I have to sleep with Melody for the rest of the time, don't you understand it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you dimwit. Alex never asked me out to have a sleepover at her place, do you know what you've done?\" Amelia asked almost wanting to grab me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I didn't know that.\" I apologized quickly. \"But I want to spend the evening with Cassandra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't care anything about my life. I hate you, I hate you, I hate you!\" Amelia screamed as she left the room. I could hear her going into the bathroom and locking the door. I just lay there wondering if I made the right decision. Of course I did, this meant so much to me. I pondered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then walked to my former room and saw Cassandra holding a controller in her hand. \"What's up with her?\" She said still looking at the screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amelia flipped again. She was angry that I blew off an invitation to one of her friend's sleepovers.\" I told Cassandra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bummer.\" Cassandra said. \"Want to play?\" She said handing me a controller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet ya.\" I told her as I sat down to play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might want to close your legs though, I'm not interested into what's underneath it.\" Cassandra said as she pointed at my pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn it.\" I mumbled as I closed my legs quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the time me and Cassandra played video games. I noticed that even though I still had my knowledge of the games I played, I wasn't as fast as I was before. My reflexes weren't so fast anymore and the long fingernails I know had didn't help to play either. Nevertheless I enjoyed myself. Amelia went to her old room after she was finished with her sulking around. Me and Cassandra didn't say anything about it to our parents, we were both happy we could spend time like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was dinnertime the three of us went downstairs. Amelia didn't speak the whole time during dinner. Mom and dad asked her about it, but she wouldn't say a word. As mom and dad were used to it, they let it pass. Dinner was a whole different experience too. I felt my tastebuds changed as well. While I normally would eat anything that was in front of me, I now felt a different sensation to eating broccoli. It was...less good than normal (which I mean by it was gross). Nevertheless I didn't say a word about it, not whining about it like a little girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner was finished and me and Cassandra did the dishes (Amelia was sulking in front of the TV) we both went upstairs to our own rooms. I spend some more time inside Amelia's room, mostly because dad was doing some administration upstairs and could easily tell if I was in my old room. So I studied some of the homework Amelia did, it seemed pretty easy to me. Most of it I still remembered. After that I played some online video games to pass time and finally it was bed time. I took the nightgown inside Amelia's bed and went off to the other room. In the hallway Amelia was standing there too, holding out my shirt and shorts, waiting for me to come out. \"Good night.\" I wished Amelia as she ignored me and quickly went inside her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly entered my old room, seeing Cassandra already wearing her shirt and shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, I'm already finished.\" Cassandra told me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know.\" I told her. Once again I had to take off Amelia's clothes. I pulled off the tank top first and skirt. I wanted to don my nightgown already when Cassandra stopped me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can take of your bra first, sister.\" She said. \"It will feel much better, trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then took off my bra and true to Cassandra's word pulling off the bra felt much better with my breasts being free. I tried not to look at them as I quickly pulled on the nightgown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then lied into my old bed. It felt way much bigger than before. I couldn't believe this was my last time inside it. Me and Cassandra then begin having our daily talk about today's events. Finally we talked about the swap and what effects it had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I have to sleep with Amelia, those nights will be really boring.\" Cassandra said annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it, I'll have to sleep with Melody. And she will fall asleep really early, no one to talk about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I wish things could be different.\" Cassandra said signing me that she was going to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I wish you could swap too.\" I told Cassandra as I closed my eyes and went asleep. I didn't know what consequences my words had until the next morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra wanted to switch bodies, and more specifically with... </span></div></div>",

Good night, SIS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>In the morning</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up at 9 am, but it was Saturday, so there was no school today. I spotted that Cassandra has already woken up and leaved the room, probably she went down to have a breakfast. I stepped out of our room, knowing that I have to change my nightown for some clothes. Slowly I made my way to my sisters room. When I entered it I was suprised that my mom and Amelia(in my body) were looking through the wardrobe and searching for some clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's YOU. Mom and I decided that you can't compromise me and because of that we are searching for some clothes for you today, you dumbass. Maybe you will not ruin my reputation, thanks to that.\" Amelia spotted me and explained whole situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter few minutes, she and mom showed me what i will be forced to wear. Immidiately I refused, but my mom convinced me and told that I can't go anywhere looking like a tomboy. Finally, I agreed. Outfit was composed of white tank top, leather jacket, white skinny jeans and pair of black trainers. Thankfully I wasn't forced to wear heels, because that would be terrible thing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter quick getting dressed, I went down to have a breakfast. Cassandra was sitting at the table. When she noticed me she said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, SIS you look very HOT, you know?\" She shouted and laughed at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh shut up Cassie, don't be like that.\" I responded when she stopped laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we were eating breakfast, Cassie blinked to me. I did the same, to inform her that I know what she wants to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Em, Mom, Dad, there's one thing we would like to talk with yo-\" I started, but my mother cut me off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think I know what do you want to say. Cassie wants to swap with someone? I assumed that she would like to. And yes, me and Dad agreed that if she wants, she can\" My Mom explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's fantastic! Thanks Mom!\" Cassandra said happilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassie, please swap with me, I hate that body of David!

Waddling down the hallway, I winced when I felt my unborn child start to use my bladder as a drum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing a hand on my belly, in a soothing tone, I said, \"Calm down, sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a few minutes before the baby stopped; after which I continued on my way to Dr. Thomas' office.  I walked into the office to find Dr. Thomas reading over something on his computer; looking up just as I walked into the room.  \"How are David and Amelia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're resting in their separate rooms; I think it'll be an hour or so before they wake up.\" Sitting down, I said, \"Their father went home to check on the family; I told him I'd call when David and Amelia are awake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good.\" Smiling, Dr. Thomas said, \"I hope there's no complications from this test; those two will have enough to adjust just by waking up in another body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing at the computer screen, I said, \"What are you working on now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've received a call from one of the other teams. They've made an important discovery and want me to help with their research.\" Turning the screen towards me, Dr. Thomas said, \"they think they can use NeuroGen to modify the shape of the brain without affecting its content.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure I follow.\" I replied. \"What purpose would that serve?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not clear yet. It could increase the... versatility of the swapping procedure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Versatility? You don't mean... Why would anyone want to do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now, Gloria.\" With a grin, Dr. Thomas said, \"As I recall, you mentioned the possibility of us swapping bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was only joking when I said that, Larry.\" Chuckling, I said, \"Why would <i>you</i> want to swap brains with someone who's going to give birth in 2 months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be the adventure of a lifetime, Gloria.\" Pausing, Dr. Thomas said, \"A grown man swaps minds with a pregnant woman; gives birth and becomes a mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're serious about this, aren't you?\" shocked, I said, \"You'd really consider swapping bodies with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would; but only if you're okay with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Larry.\" Getting up, I said, \"I'd have to give it some serious thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Phillip's POV</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got home a short time later; barely walking into the house before I was confronted by Cassandra.  Looking at me, she said, \"Where's David and Amelia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're still at the lab; they're recovering after the operation and should wake up in the next hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\" Sighing, Cassandra said, \"I still can't believe David's going to be that...bitch for the rest of his life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassandra Elizabeth Mason!\" raising my voice, I said, \"I know your sister can be difficult; but that's no excuse for name calling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry dad.\" Wincing, Cassandra said, \"I just hope David doesn't start acting too much like Amelia; it's bad enough that we'll have to deal with Amelia being in David's body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't help but admit to myself that I had the same concerns; that David might start to act like the old Amelia once he woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>David's POV</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up feeling groggy a short time later; momentarily forgetting that I was now in Amelia's body. Sitting up in bed, I was immediately reminded when Amelia's long black hair quickly fell in front of my eyes. That caused me to realize that her hair and body were now mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the room, I saw the clothes that Amelia had worn when we came to the lab. Getting out of bed, I noticed a slight change in my center of gravity; due to my body's new shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remembered that Dr. Thomas has said that motor skills stayed with the body; which was especially evident when I didn't stumble or fall. As I decided to get dressed, I realized that I walked the exact same way Amelia did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I got a look at Amelia's clothes, I realized they were girly; a pink tank top, bright green bra, frilly panties and a short denim skirt. I hated the idea of seeing this body naked; even if I knew it was mine for the rest of my life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in from the mirror, I realized just how short Amelia was in comparison to me; she was a petite girl just under 5' in height. I knew I had to get used to the breasts I now possessed; they weren't very big, but they weren't small either. If I had to guess, they were around a B cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hesitantly examining the rest of my body, I finally got around to getting dressed. It took a while, but I managed to get dressed and have one last look in the mirror. Just then Dr. Thomas came into the room and ran a few tests to see how I was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that was finished, I followed him down the hall to Amelia's room. The moment I walked into the room, Amelia taunted me with, \"How does it feel being a girl, Amelia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her, I said, \"Hey, I'm not happy about this either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the tests were complete, Gloria called Dad to tell him that we were ready to be picked up.  Neither Amelia nor I said anything for the ride home; instead choosing to stay silent.</span></div></div>",

I hung out with my friends, played video games, and watched movies. Amelia on the other hand, kept trying to talk her way out of our situation for the entire week. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't know how to break the news to Stephen and Laura, but I they had to know. Cassie and I invited them over to our house to break the news. Stephen was shocked. \"How could your parents do this to you? Are we still going to hang out and be best friends?\" Stephen said. \"This is such a big shock, but you know we'll always be here for you no matter what. We'll do whatever we can to help you through this.\" Laura said. I thanked them for their support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now the day of the procedure. Dad drove the family to the lab where we would get the operation done. Amelia tried to make one last attempt to get out of this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't I swap with Cassie? I'd love to swap with Cassie. I'd love to do this procedure if I get to have Cassie's body forever,\" Amelia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, It was your name and David's that were drawn, it is going to be you two that will swap. Unless Cassie wants to volunteer to be you,\" Dad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way,\" Cassie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so let's just go in and get this over with,\" Dad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe walked in and Amelia and I were taken to separate rooms for some tests. Dr. Thomas took blood samples, x-rays, and ask me some questions about my health.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry it has to be you that has to swap, but you're going to be a pioneer in the world of science,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" I said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more tests, Amelia and I were ready to the procedure. We both lied down on separate operating tables and were injected with an anaesthetic. I fell asleep a few seconds afterward. I knew that when I woke up, I would be in Amelia's body and she'll be in mine.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><b>David (In Amelia's Body) POV</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up feeling a little groggy. My slowly opened my eyes and my vision was blurry. For a moment I forgot that I was just put into Amelia's body. As soon as I got up however, I was immediately reminded of the body I now occupied. Long black hair quickly fell into my face. I knew Amelia had very long hair that went down to her waist. Her hair was mine now. Her body of course, was now mine as well. I took the hair out of my face and saw my new body. I was wearing a hospital gown that Amelia and I were asked to wear just before the procedure. I now saw the body I now had. I had Amelia's small, girlish body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI started to get off the table I was sitting on and tried to stand up. I noticed a slight change in my center of gravity due to my new body's shape. I didn't stumble or fall however, I just that's because Dr. Thomas said that motor skills was one of the things that stayed with the body. I decided to get dressed as I saw Amelia's clothes on a corner table. As I walked I noticed that without thinking, I walked exactly the same way as Amelia used to! She used to walk in a very girlish manner where her hips swayed with every step. It seems as if Dr. Thomas was spot on when he said that everything done instinctively would stay with the body. I could only walk the way I used to when I was a boy when I really focused. I decided to forget about it and get dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clothes on the corner table were the clothes that Amelia wore before the procedure. To my disgust, they were very girly clothes. They were a pink tank top, a bright green bra, frilly panties, and a short denim skirt that stopped above the knee. I slowly took off my gown a little scared of what I was gonna see in the full length mirror in the room. However, I knew that this was gonna be my body forever, so I had to see it sooner or later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked to the mirror after I took off the gown and observed my new body. Amelia was a very petite girl. I noticed how much shorter I was from the moment I stood up. Amelia was even shorter than my mom. Amelia was about an inch under five feet in height. Of course, I had to get used to the breasts I now possessed. They weren't big, but they weren't that small either. I sure hope they don't get any bigger as I get older in this body. I slowly poked one of them. It felt awkward. Then I clasped one in my hand and squeezed. It was a strange sensation, and I stopped playing with them soon afterward. Then I had to move on to my new vagina. I was really scared to explore that area, but I had to eventually. Amelia had a little patch of hair between her legs, but not a lot. I slowly placed my hand between my legs and started feeling my new parts. After about ten seconds I felt I had gone too far, too quickly, and decided to explore that part of me later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finally put on the clothes Amelia wore. I put on the panties first, It felt better not having that sensation of air between my legs. Then, I tried to put on the bra. It took a while, but I finally was able to put it on. I feel better now that my new breasts had support. Then I put on the skirt, which wasn't hard, but I certainly would've preferred a pair of jeans. Then I put on the tank top, which wasn't hard either. I took one last look in the mirror, seeing my former sister Amelia, now me, looking like any average feminine teenage girl. Then I left the room. Dr. Thomas was waiting for me outside the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was glad to see that I had awaken and he asked me some questions about how I feel and if there are any problems I had. I told him that I felt well except for the obvious fact that I was uncomfortable being a fourteen year old girly girl. He led me to a room where Amelia in my body had already woken up. She, or rather, he, taunted me with \"How does it feel to be a girl, Amelia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm not too happy about this either,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some last tests with Dr. Thomas, we were ready to go home. Dad had dropped off everybody back home because the operation took several hours and everybody else completely lost patience. Dad asked out how we felt. I said that I felt weird. Amelia in my body on the other hand, bitched and complained nonstop just like she always has.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better cut that out, you're a 16 year old boy now, that behavior is now unacceptable!\" Dad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car ride home was completely silent. We pulled into the driveway and walked in.</span></div></div>",

The rest of the family was waiting for us inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it work?\" Mom asked us. The three of us nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is unbelievable!\" Cassie exclaimed. \"Is that really you in there David?\" She asked me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" I said with a depressed tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was staring at the ground from the second we came in. Amelia had her arms crossed as well as a grumpy look on her face. Melody came up to me and asked \"Are you going to be mean to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took my eyes off the ground and looked her in the eyes. \"Of course not,\" I said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better not bother me!\" Amelia yelled. \"I have enough problems now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go to your room!\" Dad yelled. \"Your new room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia angrily walked to what used to be my room. Cassie would be sharing a room with Amelia from now on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, now let's discuss how things are going to be from now on,\" Dad said. \"First of all, nobody except us and those closest to us can know about this. We don't want the media to be bursting through our door asking us about this procedure. Second, in public we must act as if nothing has happened to David and Amelia. We have to treat them like we did before in public. That includes referring to the person we're talking to by what they look like now, not who they used to be. Third, David and Amelia must dress and act like each other to the best of their ability when we're out in public. Lastly, when we're at home with no outsiders around, you all can act however you want. Everybody got it?\" Dad asked. We all nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to talk with the new Amelia in private,\" Cassie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe went into the basement and talked. She asked me about how I felt in my new body. I said that my new body felt strange and my clothes were uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I noticed that you walk exactly like she used to,\" Cassie exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Motor skills stay with the body,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's going to be hard to get used to talking to you with the way you look now,\" Cassie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I can adjust, you can adjust.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, Stephen and Laura are coming over tomorrow to meet the new you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great,\" I said, \"I could use the support of my best friends.\" We both walked back upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family ordered pizza for dinner. Amelia was allowed to come out of her new room to eat with us. Although she was now completely silent, she had an expression of rage on her face. I noticed that I couldn't eat as much as I used to. Amelia's stomach probably couldn't handle as much food as mine. Just another thing that I had to get used to. After dinner, Dad told everybody to get ready for bed. He told Amelia and I to sleep in our new rooms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked into Amelia's closet and found only feminine sleepwear. She had a lot of nightgowns but I sure didn't want to wear one of those yet. So I settled for a bright green tank top and pink pajama shorts with flowers on them. Melody came into the room and climbed into her bed; opposite to my new one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so happy I don't share a room with a meanie anymore!\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try to be the best sister to you as I can,\" I said to her. I climbed into my new bed which had a girlish comforter. I better get used to the color pink, I thought to myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to keep my emotions hidden from my family as much as possible. I was feeling really sad and depressed. One day I'm myself and the next day I'm my little sister forever. I can't be her. She isn't who I'm supposed to be and she isn't somebody that I can be. I just wanted to be myself again. It was gong to be very hard for me to get used to all this. It took me a long time to fall asleep that night.</span></div></div>",

I took little time putting the glasses on, seeing that the voice I had heard was from Gloria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you've awoken dear.  And you've probably noticed that you're not in Amelia's body.\" Gloria said to me<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happ-\" before I could finish, I gasped in shock, covering my mouth with both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"that voice...\" I thought to myself, \"it can't be\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, we had quickly realized that the procedure would not work with family members of the same blood...  However we had already removed the parts of your brain that contained your memories and who you are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked down as she said this<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, a young girl around your age just so happened to be there.  She immediately offered herself as the vessel to house your consciousness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI uttered \"and,, this young girl is someone I know, isn't it?\"  I already knew the answer though<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria answered \"yes dear, you had been swapped with - \"</span></div></div>",

Amelia looked rather like a football fan watching his favorite team line up to kick a 45-yard field goal to win with only 1 second left on the clock.  Optimistic, but definitely tense.  Melody, on the other hand, was bouncing around like she'd been told she might get a pony for Christmas.  The only real consolation was that Cassandra seemed to be as surprised as I was that our parents were considering this.  She and I just stared at each other as I tried to process the possibility of being four-year-old Melody.  The idea of being Amelia was bad enough, but to have to live as a four-year-old again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was still going over things in my head when mom and dad came back into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mother and I have given this a lot of thought and we've decided to let Melody take Amelia's place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\"  I screamed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody ran up to give dad a huge hug and Amelia, who looked visibly relieved, gave me a smug smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, you can't do that!\"  I protested again, but mom broke in again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David, think about this for a moment, OK?  I know that neither you nor Amelia wanted to switch, and this way only one person who doesn't want to switch has to.  That's better, right?  Instead of two unhappy people we only have one.  It will be a lot less stress for your father and me if only one of you is upset with things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, but why me?  Why not let Melody switch with Amelia?  I mean, that way they'll both still be girls.\"  Amelia looked less smug after I suggested that; for some reason she didn't seem to like that idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your father and I thought of that, David, but Amelia doesn't want to switch at all and you at least admit that it's something we should do.  Besides, your name was picked first, and if we'd let Melody volunteer we'd have never even picked Amelia's name from the bowl last night.  I know this is rough for you, but overall it seemed the fairest way to handle things and to make sure that it's as smooth as possible overall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed.  My parents were right; overall it just made more sense to let Melody take Amelia's place instead of mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you're right and this really is the best way.  But I'm not happy about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's OK David!  I happy for bof of us!\"  Melody's exclamation drew a big \"I win\" smile from Amelia as I simply tried to resign myself to this new development.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The remainder of the week was actually pretty nice, aside from Amelia \"accidentally\" calling me \"Melody\" any time our parents weren't around and the fact that Melody's near-constant low-level excitement was a perpetual reminder of what awaited me over the coming weekend.  Still, I'd managed to convince myself that things weren't all that bad.  After mom and dad's decision, Cassandra and I had spent the rest of the evening together talking it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't want to be a four-year-old,\" I complained as soon as we were both back in our room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, at least you'll still be more mature than Amelia.\"  Cassandra laughed and I managed a bit of a chuckle too.  \"Besides, when you think about it, this works out better for you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How on earth does trading lives with my baby sister work out better for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie gave me a knowing look, \"You realise that Amelia's signed up for cheer-leading camp in a few weeks, right?  And that she's been caught at least a half-dozen times with some boy's tongue halfway down her throat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI paused for a second there as I finally began to see what the full consequences of swapping with Amelia would have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then there's the fact that switching with Amelia would mean you'd be jumping right into the fun of having a period...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI must have looked absolutely stunned because Cassie started laughing again.  \"Oh come on.  They're not <i>that</i> bad.  I'm just saying that with Melody there should be less to adjust to.  Plus no-one expects a 4-year-old to be all that consistent, so if you start acting all tomboyish no-one will think it's weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'd been forced to admit that Cassie was making sense, and it really did help me to think of things with all those points in mind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTelling Stephen and Laura had been difficult; neither one believed me and even with mom and dad backing me up it still took the better part of an hour to convince my friends that this was really going to happen.  They were as surprised as I was that mom and dad had agreed to let Melody take Amelia's place, but, as I had, they understood the logic behind it, though Stephen did tell me that it would have been nice for Amelia's body to have a non-annoying brain in it.  He agreed that he'd earned the punch that his upper arm received as my response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, Saturday quickly rolled around and it was time to head over to Larry's lab and get things over with.  While Melody didn't seem to care, I really didn't want to have the whole family around for the procedure and dad agreed since Larry had mentioned that it would take a while, so it was just mom, Melody, and me in the car on the way over.  Since I was 16 and had my learner's permit, I was driving.  I figured that it was the last time I'd be allowed to drive for a long time so I might as well take advantage of it.  When we arrived at the lab, I parked and helped mom get Melody out of her booster seat, trying not to think about the fact that I'd be riding home in it, and then the three of us walked into Ambrosia Corporation's reception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were greeted almost immediately by Gloria Adams, Dr. Thomas' lab assistant.  We'd met her a few times before, but it had been a while and she hadn't been pregnant then.  I was surprised that she hadn't taken maternity leave, but quickly decided that she must have stayed on because of Dr. Thomas' recent discovery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi David.  You're doing a really big thing for both your family and for science you know.  You should be proud of yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI made a few noncommittal noises and commented that I didn't really see any alternative, in response to which Gloria switched her attention to Melody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you must be Melody,\" she said, smiling.  \"I hear you're really excited about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weawwy ekthited!  Imma be gwowed up!\"  Melody was positively beaming and I tried not to think about how strange my body would seem with Melody's little kid lisp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I suppose we shouldn't waste any time.\"  Gloria grinned and patted Melody on the head affectionately.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David, you can go straight into the lab and put on a gown.  Dr. Thomas wants to talk with Melody a little bit first just to make sure that she's really OK with the procedure.  The size of the developmental gap between you two means he wants to gather some additional information before starting.  One of the technicians will take some baseline medical readings for you and then I'll bring Melody in once Dr. Thomas has all the information he needs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI headed into the lab through the indicated doorway while Gloria took Melody into Dr. Thomas' office.  The lab itself didn't look very remarkable.  As far as I could tell it didn't look much different than the generic operating rooms shown on TV dramas.  I figured that I had better just get on with it, so I disrobed and put on the hospital gown that I'd found waiting for me; I'd only just finished when the lab tech came in and took my blood pressure, heart rate, and a blood sample before efficiently leaving again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot having any idea how long Dr. Thomas might take with Melody, I settled in on the operating table and pulled out the copy of \"Wired\" magazine that I'd brought with me to kill the time.  It was a good thing that I'd brought it, because it was at least 45 minutes before Gloria, Dr. Thomas, and Melody came into the lab.  Melody had also been changed into a hospital gown and Gloria helped her up onto the other table as Dr. Thomas put Melody's clothes down next to mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi David.  I apologise for the wait, but, as Gloria explained, there's a big developmental gap between you and Melody and I wanted to be sure I was getting as much information as I could.  I suppose that you're wondering exactly what's going to happen.  Well, this,\" he held up a small phial from a tray filled with surgical tools, \"is NeuroGen.  It allows the body to regenerate nerve tissue in a matter of hours.  Since the brain is simply a mass of nerve tissue, NeuroGen allows us to connect one person's brain to another person's body.  unfortunately, the body develops a resistance after the first use, so the product can only be used once, but this is still a major leap forward for science.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're physically going to swap our brains?\"  This actually sounded pretty cool; if I weren't the test subject, that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not the whole brain, no.  We tried that in animals and it caused a lot of problems because most of what we do isn't regulated by conscious thought.  Without the instinctive responses that come with the non-conscious brain the animal subjects had severe coordination and communication problems.  What we've found is that it's best to transfer only the parts of the brain that contain personality, most knowledge, and memories and leave the rest alone.  That way instinctive responses like motor skills and language processing stay with the body and prevent the problems we saw in early testing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded.  That made sense.  I didn't want to suddenly be completely un-coordinated in Melody's body, nor her in mine really.  And since my personality, knowledge, and memory would still be the same at least I wouldn't lose who I was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Dr. Thomas continued, \"are we ready to start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeth!\"  Melody was still clearly excited about being older.  I simply nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good then.  You two just lay back on the tables and Gloria will administer the anaesthetic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laid myself down and Gloria walked over, placing a mask over my nose and mouth.  I could hear the faint hissing of gas starting to flow as she asked me to start counting down slowly from ten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"10...9...\"  I took a deep breath and blinked slowly as my eyelids got heavy, \"8...\"  I felt like I was floating and it was hard for me to concentrate on what I was supposed to be doing, \"sev...uh...se...\"  And my world went dark and silent.</span></div></div>",

Slowly, the world came into focus and I lay there for a while looking up at a rather sterile ceiling and listening to the beeping of the monitor they had put on me to make sure nothing unexpected happened during recovery.  Part of me wanted to believe that the whole thing had been a weird dream, but the hospital-like room and beeping heart monitor seemed to argue against that.  Just to check I brought my hand up to my face again.  Nope, not a dream, the hand in front of me was tiny and a little chubby, in the way that's common for small children.  I placed it against the bed railing and couldn't even come close to wrapping my fingers all the way around.  There was no doubt about it, I was now in Melody's tiny body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was really surprising though was that I didn't feel out of place.  Even though I'd been a 16-year-old boy only a few hours ago, Melody's childish body felt completely natural.  Apparently what Dr. Thomas had said about the instinctive responses was correct.  This whole process really was incredibly amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was so wrapped up in how weird it was that my new body didn't feel weird that I didn't even notice Dr. Thomas come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello sleepy-head.  Your brother's been up for a half-hour already he and I are all done.\"  I yawned in response and he simply continued, \"I know everyone's eager to go home, but you and I need to go through a few tests before that happens.  The developmental gap between the two of you means I have an opportunity to gather some very interesting information and I'm not going to let it pass by.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat phrase kept coming up and it was starting to worry me.  \"Devewopmental gap?\"  It was really strange hearing Melody's voice from her perspective, as was my slurring of the question.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I passed off my slurred question as a lingering effect of the anaesthesia as Dr. Thomas started to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As the human body develops, the brain goes through several stages.  Melody's brain, being the brain of a four-year-old, is at a relatively early stage of neruological development, while your brain, being the brain of a 16-year-old, is at a much later stage.  Thanks to the two of you swapping, I can gather data that we've never been able to gather before and see if I can find an indication as to whether the advancement through the brain's developmental stages is the result of the academic knowledge that a person acquires or if it's inherent in the brain's neurological structure.  If it's the latter then even though we transferred your memories and knowledge into Melody's brain, you're going to end up a lot more like a four-year-old girl than you probably expected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gonna fowget thtuff?!\"  That was definitely not the anaesthetic...  \"Wath wong wif my voith?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just a result of you now having Melody's motor skills and language processing; perfectly normal.  And no, you're not going to forget anything.  You'll still remember being David and your personality is still intact.  Think of your brain as being like a computer.  Your memories and knowledge are like data files on the hard drive.  Your personality is like a program that retrieves and manipulates those data files.  The non-conscious responses are like the operating system; those responses handle things like feeding additional information to your personality in the proper way and allow it to so things like compare stimuli to those memories.  And the physical brain itself is like the hardware, the younger the brain, the less sophisticated the microprocessor and less efficient the memory interface.  By swapping into Melody's body, even though you've kept your data files and the program that reads them, you've substantially downgraded your operating system and hardware.  Does that make sense?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gueth tho...\"  I was thankful that Dr. Thomas had gone slowly through his explanation; even though I understood everything he said, I knew that if he'd sped through it I wouldn't have been able to grasp it.  Right now I felt like I was trying to understand things through a very laggy connection between my mental \"hardware\" and the sensory input I was receiving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's good.  Your brother didn't understand the computer terms at all, so it looks like your knowledge and memories successfully transferred.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why you cawl Mewody my brudder?\"  Talking as Melody was definitely going to take some getting used to.  Everything was making sense in my head, but it kept coming out in a four-year-old's lisp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because that's the way the world is going to address you two now, Melody, and your mother thought you should start getting used to it right away.  Now, let's get started with some basic things.  If someone arrived at a house at 9 am and left at 4 pm, how many hours were they at the house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Theven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, good.  Now, you got here at about eight this morning.  Can you look at the clock on the wall over there and tell me how many hours you've been here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first I thought he was just checking to make sure that I could see well enough to read the clock, but when I looked up at it I just couldn't make any sense of it.  There was a red pointer going around slowly and two black pointers that didn't seem to be moving at all, and then a bunch of gibberish around the edge.  None of it meant anything to me, but I didn't want to admit that and for some reason guessing seemed like a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eweven?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you'd been here eleven hours it would be what time right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Theven pm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well your math is fine, but you're clearly not able to read the clock.  It's four thirty pm right now.  Elizabeth told me that Melody hasn't learned how to tell time yet, so this is expected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Thomas just made a note in the little journal pad he was carrying but I was shocked.  I could remember how many hours were in a day and everything about how time was measured, but thanks to Melody's brain I was now unable to read a clock.  I was beginning to re-think my plans to be a famous child prodigy as Dr. Thomas continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many letters are there in the alphabet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twenty thix.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you name the vowels?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A, E, I, O, U, an' thometimeth Y.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent,\" he pulled out the copy of Wired that I'd been reading in the lab room earlier, opened it to one of the articles, and handed it to me.  \"Can you tell me the title of this article?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as with the clock, the page looked full of gibberish now.  \"No, I can't wead it...  I gueth thath cuz Mewody couwdn't wead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly, Melody's 'operating system' isn't passing the right values to your 'personality program' so even though you understand how hours and minutes work and know the alphabet, you're not able to read or tell time anymore.  OK, let's move on to some of the other tests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Thomas brought over three beakers, two of them were identical short and fat beakers and both of these were about 3/4 full of water.  The third was tall and skinny and was empty.  He pointed to the two short beakers with water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melody, can you tell me which of these two beakers has more water in it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dey bof da thame.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent.\"  He took one of the short beakers and I watched him carefully pour its water into the tall thin beaker, then he put the empty short beaker away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK Melody, same question,\" he gestured to the short, fat beaker and the tall, skinny beaker, \"can you tell me which of these two beakers has more water in it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Da taww one.  Ith way highew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Thomas made another note in his journal and then put the beakers away, coming back with a tray containing two rows of blocks, one row closely spaced and one row spaced farther apart so it appeared longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many blocks are in this row?\"  He pointed to the closely-spaced blocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One, two, free, fouw, five.  Five.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good, and in this row?\"  He pointed to the blocks spaced far apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One, two, free, fouw, five.  Five.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent.  Now, which row has more blocks in it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dat one.\"  I pointed to the longer row of widely-spaced blocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made another note and took the blocks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to give you some information and then ask questions about it, is that OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh.\"  I nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John is taller than Mary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mary is taller than Sue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother nod on my part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is John taller than Sue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mind stalled.  Why was he asking me about John and Sue?  He'd only told me about John and Mary or Mary and Sue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother notation in his journal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis when on for what seemed like ages (since I couldn't read the clock anymore I couldn't really know how long) with Dr. Thomas asking me more questions and showing me pictures of mountains while asking what a doll would see.  I didn't see how any of it was important, but I was happy when Dr. Thomas finally closed his notebook and put the pen away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Melody, it's very clear that you still have your memories and knowledge, as well as David's personality.  But it's also very clear that your brain is processing things the way that a normal four-year-old's brain would process things.  You seem to be right on the cusp between Piaget's symbolic function and intuitive thought stages indicating that cognitive development is largely a function of neurology.  This is amazing data.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tho I thupid...\"  I moped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're a perfectly normal 4-year-old,\" he reached down and tossled my hair, \"only with access to all the facts a 16-year-old boy would know, as well as his memories and personality.  It's really most interesting.  But it's time to let you go home.  I'll let you get dressed and when you're ready just knock on the door and I'll take you out to your mother and brother.  I'll be waiting just outside the door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he lifted me gently off the bed and stood me up on the floor, then walked out of the room, leaving me alone to contemplate what had just happened.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For a few moments after Dr. Thomas left I just stood there, amazed at just how large everything in the room looked.  I couldn't even see over the hospital bed I'd just been helped out of.  The most surreal thing though was that it all seemed normal and not disorienting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up at the clock and scowled.  \"Thtupid Mewody can't wead a cwock,\" I muttered to myself, only to cringe as I realised that I sounded exactly like a petulant child.  Catching a glimpse of myself in the mirror on the way to the chair that held my clothes I noticed I <i>looked</i> exactly like a petulant child too.  I sighed and did my best to take the scowl off my face.  It was too late now to change anything after all; no sense being a brat about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reached behind my neck to untie the gown and pulled on the loose end of the string.  Unfortunately, the loose end had gone through the loop of the bow and all I managed to do by pulling on it was create a very solid square knot.  Before I'd have probably been able to manage getting the knot untied, but the more I tried the more I realised that Melody just wasn't that dexterous yet.  Embarrassed, I padded over to the door and knocked on it.  I waited for what seemed like a few minutes and then knocked again, harder.  This time Dr. Thomas actually seemed to hear me and he opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melody, I thought you were getting dressed.\"  He was using the same gentle by slightly impatient tone I'd heard my parents use whenever Melody got distracted from a task they wanted her to do.  It didn't help my embarrassment level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Da wobe is thtuck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...  I should have expected something like that.  Let me go get Gloria and she can help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why I hafta wait fow Gwowia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it wouldn't be appropriate for a grown man like me to help a little girl out of her clothes Melody.  You wait here, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh...\"  I nodded, wondering why I hadn't been able to come up with that answer on my own.  If someone had asked me whether a male or a female doctor should be the one to help a little girl get dressed I'd have said the female doctor without even hesitating but for some reason I hadn't been able to extend that logic to my own situation.  I figured it was probably just the stress of everything that was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't have to wait very long at all before Gloria came in through the door, closing it behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is your robe being mean?\"  Gloria was using the same sort of mock concern that most grown-ups used when they were being nice to little kids, but for some reason it felt kind of comforting.  The robe <i>was</i> being mean after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh.  Ith thtuck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria knelt down behind me and worked at the knot.  Soon, I felt it come loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me just get the other knot for you too.\"  Gloria un-fastened the knot at the gown's waist level too before I had a chance to realise she was doing it simply to avoid the chance that I'd get that one tangled too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Gwowia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, you're welcome Melody.  I'm going to stay here with you in case you need any more help, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can dwess mysewf!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know dear, but this way when you're done I can just take you straight out to your mommy without you having to knock and wait for Dr. Thomas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, dat's OK.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Melody had been dressing herself for the last year or so and my underwear, shirt, pinafore, and tights went on easily.  I did feel more than a little bit weird seeing Melody's reflection in the mirror as I dressed, and I <i>really</i> would have preferred it if she hadn't chosen Dora the Explorer underwear that morning, but at least no-one would see them under the pinafore.  I paused for a moment to look at myself in the mirror, still amazed at how natural it felt to be in Melody's body, and then slipped on Melody's shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww weady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Gloria took my hand and we walked out to the lobby where my mother and Melody were waiting.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Remember, you're Melody now and your older brother is David,\" Gloria reminded me as we walked down the hall towards the lobby.  \"It wouldn't do for you to slip up in front of strangers so it's best if you try to refer to him as David all the time, even when you're at home with your family, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeth Gwowia, I undewthtand.  Ith gonna be weiwd dough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know sweetie, but you'll get used to it in a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't like that she kept calling me \"sweetie\" or \"dear\" but I figured that was something else I'd have to get used to now that, as far as most of the world was concerned, I was a 4-year-old girl.  At least I could still keep calling myself David in my own mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Melody, apparently at ease in my body, both stood up as Gloria and I entered the lobby.  It was weird having my mother tower over me; as David it had been years since she'd been taller than I was, but now she had a good two feet on me and it was Melody who was the tall one in the group.  Melody was the first to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.  It's really weird to see my old body from this angle.\"  I really should have expected her to be able to speak just fine since I'd acquired her lisp and childish grammar in the swap, but it was still a little hard to deal with the fact that my baby sister could now speak much more clearly than I could.  She went on, \"You know Melody, mom and dad were right; my old body looks just like a young version mom.  I can't believe I never noticed that when I had it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell that was just great.  Melody was absolutely right; like Amelia, Melody's body shared mom's coloring and Melody's body really did look like a clone of mom from her old childhood pictures.  Unfortunately for me this meant that, in all likelihood, no matter how much growing up this body did, I'd never reach my old height.  Of course, I reasoned, that probably wouldn't have been any different if I'd switched with Amelia, so at least that hadn't gotten any worse.  Whereas I was looking at things through a lens mostly of resignation, Melody seemed to be in a state of mild elation.  I'd rather expected that to have faded a bit once the switch actually happened, but apparently she really was just that excited to be older.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I was paying attention to Melody, Gloria had been talking with mom.  Normally I'd have been paying attention to that too, but I was having trouble focusing on more than one thing at a time.  I'd tried to hold both things in my mind, but I'd stopped paying attention to mom and Gloria as soon as Melody had started talking to me.  I didn't even realise that I'd tuned out mom and Gloria until mom started talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Thomas has some things he wants to discuss with me alone before we leave, so I'm going to leave you two here while I go to his office.  David,\" she looked at my old body, \"keep an eye on your little sister while I'm gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it mom,\" Melody responded as mom walked out towards Dr. Thomas' office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I no need babythitting!  I owder den you!\"  I glowered at Melody<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not anymore,\" responded my old body with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ith not funny!\"  I stamped my foot just like Melody used to do when she got frustrated.  Stupid motor skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know.  I'm sorry Melody.  This is just really cool for me.  I'm a grown up.  This is all I've ever wanted.  I'm not trying to rub it in, I'm just really happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew she was telling the truth.  Melody had never been the obnoxious sort and even though I'd never really known how to interact with her because of our age difference we'd always basically gotten along.  It wasn't right for me to take this out on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sowwy too.  Dis aww jutht vewy thtwange fow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I never really noticed that lisp when I had it.  I'm sorry you have to deal with that.  So, how'd everything go with Dr. Thomas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.  He jutht wanted to do thome tethts wif me.  Thomething wif cups of watew an' bwocks an' thuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he made me do those too.  Twice actually, once before and once after.  I felt really silly the second time realising that I'd answered wrong before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd answered wrong the first time and right the second?  Dr. Thomas hadn't said anything to me about right or wrong answers.  Was he just trying to figure out if they'd accidentally left some of my knowledge in her brain?  Maybe I could find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you do wong da fiwst time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody laughed, \"lots of things.  For example, even though I watched him pour the water from the short fat beaker into the tall one, I still said the tall beaker had more water in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Da taww one did have mowe watew in it!  It wath way highew!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melody, he poured it straight out of the short, fat beaker into the tall one, it had to be the same amount.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wath highew!  Dat meanth it wath mowe.\"  I was sure of that.  I'd seen it happen myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, let's just say I answered differently the second time.\"  I nodded, appeased, and she continued, \"I asked him if that meant I had your knowledge and he explained that the test didn't actually measure knowledge, but how rather how our brains were processing the world and that since I now had a teenager's brain, that meant I was processing the world like a teenager would and not like a four-year-old would.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank goodness.  They hadn't actually left my knowledge in my old body.  I did wonder why Melody thought she'd been wrong the first time but I decided to let it slide.  There wasn't much reasoning with a four-year-old, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to ask her how she though her friends would react to all of this when mom came back into the lobby carrying a small binder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wath da bindew fow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just some paperwork for mommy and daddy, nothing for little girls to worry about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about teenage boys?\"  Melody realised just a bit too late that her enthusiasm might not have been in the best taste, \"Sorry Melody, I didn't mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ith OK, I know you twying.\"  I gave him a hug to reassure him, slightly surprised that I'd just mentally referred to Melody as \"him\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom held my hand as we walked out to the car and then Melody lifted me into what was now my car seat, strapping me in snugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ith too tight.  I can't weach anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry hon,\" mom said, \"that's how it's supposed to be.  Child safety laws and all that.\"  Mom closed my door and then got into the passenger seat as Melody got in on the driver's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy!  He no can dwive!\"  Great, not only did Melody's speech processing destroy my grammar, it was making me use \"mommy\" when I tried to say \"mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I can!\"  Melody's comment was excitement, not protest.  \"Dr. Thomas said that driving ability should have stayed with the body like other motor skills and he was right.  Mom and I took a test run around the parking lot while you were still in the recovery room and it all just came to me.  It was so cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so we were heading back home.  I'd like to say that I remembered more of the drive, but Melody, like many young children, tended to fall asleep in a moving car and that non-conscious response, on top of the long day, meant I was soon snoozing peacefully, strapped firmly into my booster seat.</span></div></div>",

It's time to go in and see your father and your sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK mommy,\" I yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here mom, I'll carry her in for you,\" Melody offered.  Before I had a chance to protest, my old body had lifted me out of the car seat and hefted me onto its shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always liked it when dad gave me a piggyback ride,\" Melody said, \"I thought you might enjoy it now too.\"  With that, she carried me into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody had been right in her assumption too.  I found that being up high like that was a lot of fun and even though I remembered being tall before, it seemed that Melody's instinctive responses still found this a novelty.  I found myself smiling happily as she set me down on the living room couch in front of the rest of the family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you David.\" I said, remembering what Gloria had told me about making sure to use the right names for our new bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie came over and sat down between Melody and me, seemingly unsure of whom she was supposed to comfort while Amelia just looked happy that she'd managed to avoid the whole thing.  Dad broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw David getting out of the driver's side of the car.  Were they not able to perform the switch today or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody spoke up excitedly, \"It turns out that motor skills and instinctive things stay with the body!  So not only am I grown up now, I can drive!  It's really cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not fow me,\" I grumbled.  \"I can't even wead anymowe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia giggled, \"Awww, poor nerd can't read his comic books.  Guess it's dollies for you now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AMELIA!\"  Thankfully dad didn't share Amelia's sense of humor, but even though he'd gotten Amelia to shut up, she was still wearing an expression containing entirely too much amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad turned back to me, \"so that's really you in there David?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeth daddy.\"  Amelia stifled a giggle and mom gave her a stern look as I continued.  \"Da doctow thaid dat thing wike wanguage pwocething an' motow thkiww an' thtuff thtay wif da owd body.  Tho I thtuck tawking wike Mewody now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad looked thoughtful, and Cassie just hugged me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently the ability to perform logical manipulation on new information and to process the immediate world around them also stayed with the old bodies,\" mom added, looking through the binder that Dr. Thomas had given her.  \"It says here that even though David still remembers everything he's learned, we should expect him to only be able to process new information like a 4-year-old would, while Melody should now have the logical skills of a 16-year-old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy stomach was beginning to rumble a bit and I realised that neither Melody nor I had eaten since breakfast.  \"I hungwy.  Can we have dinnew now?  Pwease?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Melody agreed, \"we haven't had anything to eat since breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think mom had noticed Amelia's thinly disguised mirth too, because she quickly agreed, suggesting that it might help us all take our minds off of things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we headed to the kitchen table, Cassie finally spoke, \"Don't worry Dav-- uh, Melody, it won't be so bad.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Waking up the next morning in Melody's room was an odd mix of disconcerting and comforting.  The room certainly didn't match my memories (and I definitely could have done without all the ultra-girlie decorations that resulted from Melody and Amelia sharing a room), but at the same time Melody's instinctive reaction to being tucked tightly into bed under a thick comforter was apparently one of substantial reassurance.  I felt safe and disoriented all at the same time.  Surreal to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe disorientation passed quickly enough though as I ran through yesterday once more in my mind.  Dinner had been more of an adventure (and more embarrassing) than I'd anticipated, but at the time I asked all I'd been able to concentrate on was the fact that I was hungry.  Apparently a 4-year-old's mind didn't really do multitasking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad had made stuffed peppers, one of my favorites, along with a bowl of macaroni and cheese (the kind with cartoon character shapes for the pasta) for Melody, who had always thought that the stuffed peppers were \"ucky,\" and I was happy to see that he'd at least put the stuffed pepper in front of me (even if it was pre-cut into bite-size pieces), giving the new David the macaroni, which he was looking at thougtfully for some reason.  I was less happy about the sippy cup at my place setting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I not weawwy tho widdle!  Can I pwease have a weguwaw cup?\"  My childish voice and lisp didn't really help make my protest terribly believable, but I think Amelia's giggling actually convinced mom to acquiesce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled smugly at Amelia as mom changed out the sippy cup for a regular cup, though I did notice the new cup, in addition to being only half-full, was plastic and not glass like everyone else's.  Still, things felt like a victory so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was when it had all fallen apart, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody's body's lack of coordination made it a bit awkward getting the bit of stuffed pepper onto my fork, and the impression I had that everyone was watching me hadn't helped, but I was soon able to work it out, eager to have a bite of my favorite dinner.  As soon as I got the morsel to my mouth though, I realised something was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dat's ucky!\" I exclaimed, making a face and immediately spitting out the barely chewed bit of stuffed pepper.  I was sure that dad had screwed up the recipe somehow since everyone had been so busy watching me that none of them had taken a bite yet.  \"It not taste wight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid, however, appeared to think for a moment, \"Melody, can I try some of your stuffed pepper?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You no wike thuffed peppews,\" I replied with as much of a matter-of-fact tone as I could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to test something, OK?\"  Mom and dad were watching with clear interest, as was Amelia.  Cassie just seemed bemused by the entire situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thuppothe,\" I gave in as David reached over to spear a portion of stuffed pepper off my plate, \"but daddy made dem wong.  Dey ucky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid just shrugged and popped the food into his mouth, chewing thoughtfully for a second before swallowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!  These are <i>amazing</i>!\"  I was shocked, but out of the corner of my eye I noticed Amelia nodding for some reason.  It didn't make sense to me, but then David continued.  \"I thought so.  Our taste preferences must have stayed with our old bodies too.  I wondered about that as soon as dad gave me the macaroni.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was a bit stunned, but it made perfect sense now that the logical steps had been explained to me.  After all, taste preferences were instinctive phenomena.  I wondered why I hadn't been able to make that connection, but was soon distracted by David switching plates with me.  Without thinking, I reached out to take a big drink of my milk and get the taste of the pepper out of my mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd understood why Melody still got a sippy cup at dinner as I fumbled with the cup and ended up with most of the contents onto my lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom had cleaned me up and dinner had gone OK from there, though I was stuck with the \"kiddie meal\" and a sippy cup for the remainder.  I'd tried not to think too much about the thoughtful look that Amelia wore for the rest of the meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner Amelia had gotten ready for some sleep-over with her friend Alexandra, so to stay out of her way I'd hung out in my old room with Cassie and David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you really expected to like the stuffed peppers, Melody?\"  Cassie had still seemed curious about everything that had happened at dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeth.  I 'membew wiking dem befowe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you didn't think that taste preferences might have stayed with your old body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I..  I didn't weawwy think about it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" David had cut in, \"it was weird for me too.  The thought just sort of popped into my brain.  It was really cool, actually.  I used to have to really try to think all the steps through but here it just sort of happened all in the background.  Being grown up is really cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'd sighed and David backpedaled a bit, \"Uh, sorry Melody.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ith OK.  You gonna hafta learn a whowe buncha thtuff fow thchool dat I awweady know, tho dewe awe thome things dat awe good fow me.\"  Without thinking I stuck my tongue out at him, blushing a bit when I realised how childish the gesture was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'll bet that Dr. Thomas has a way to...\"  David suddenly trailed off as, unbeknownst to me, Cassie was gesturing behind my back for him to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctow Thomas hath a way to what?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, it wasn't important\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awe you thure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Cassie broke in, interrupting my train of thought and effectively distracting me from following up on what David had meant, \"what was in the binder that mom brought back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno.  Dey thaid it wathn't thomething I thould wowwy about.\"  I'd already forgotten about mom reading from the binder about the test results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably just some legal papers then,\" Cassie replied, giving David a look suggesting that he should stay quiet.  \"You and I should talk sometime soon, Melody, just us girls, without this silly boy hanging around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie's smile and laugh were enough to coax a small giggle from me too, especially since I'd wanted a chance to talk with her alone as well.  Unfortunately, about that time, mom came in and announced that it was my bedtime, carrying me off to make sure I brushed my teeth and got myself ready.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYup, yesterday had certainly been eventful, I thought as I struggled a bit to free myself from the tightly tucked sheets and got myself dressed in Melody's clothes.  I did wish that she hadn't been so obsessed with Disney movies as I pulled on a Tinkerbell t-shirt and made my way downstairs.  </span></div></div>",

Looking out the window, the bright sky and only moderately long shadows made me guess that it was at least 10 am, which felt a little weird since I was used to being one of the first people up in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I reached the top of the stairs I could hear voices in the family room below and realised that Stephen and Laura must have come over to meet the new me.  <i>Wonderful,</i> I thought to myself.

Da gween wath bettew dan pink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but 'Pixie Princess'?  Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked down at my shirt.  Apparently those were't just squiggly decorations...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It not my fauwt Mewody can't wead.\" I looked down a little embarrassed, as Laura walked over to me and bent down to my level, hands between her knees in the way that adults tended to do when they were trying to be non-intimidating to small children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your brother was telling us about how instinctive things stayed with the old body,\" she said, nodding towards my old body, \"but I'm still not sure you're not playing a trick on us...  Tell you what, I'm going to ask you some questions that I know Melody doesn't know the answer to and we'll see if you can answer them.  OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just nodded figuring that the sooner we got this over the sooner we could have something like a normal conversation.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's ten times ten?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One hunned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was an easy one, how about thirty-two times eight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\"  I struggled.  I knew exactly what I was supposed to do, but for some reason I was having a lot of trouble getting my brain to actually do it.  \"Dath eight gwoupth of thiwty-two aww togeddew...\"  No matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't keep enough in my head at the same time to get the answer.  \"I dunno,\" I admitted in defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura looked thoughtful for a moment and then continued.  \"OK, let's try something different, what's wrong with Mass Effect 3?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Da ending thuckth!\" I answered immediately, \"no mattew what you do in da game ith aww jutht da thame thing in diffewent cowouws!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if I said that my new computer had a 486 in it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Den you'd be thupid 'cause a 486 not new.  Awe we done now?\"  This was a little annoying but mostly I was concerned about not having been able to answer the second math question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura nodded and walked back over to the couch, patting the seat next to her to suggest that I should come over too.  I headed over and obliged her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tho, you bewieve uth now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup.  How about you Stephen?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephen nodded too, a slightly bemused look on his face.  \"Laura, why do you think David couldn't answer the 32 times 8 question?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spoke up, \"Dath a good question.  An' caww me Mewody now; I hafta get uthed to it thometime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura pondered the question for a moment, \"I'll bet is has to do with all the instinctive stuff that Mel - er, David,\" she nodded towards my old body, \"was telling us about earlier.  Melody here,\" she patted me on the head and I scowled a little, \"clearly remembered what multiplication was, she just couldn't make the more complex manipulations happen in her 4-year-old brain.  Some of math is memorization, that's how she got the first question right, but a lot of it is being able to manipulate information and a little kid's brain doesn't have the neural connections to do that yet.  So even though she knows the concept of multiplication and can do math that's simple memorization, like multiplying by ten, her brain isn't developed enough yet to perform anything more complex than reciting answers she's basically just memorized.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to follow Laura's explanation, but had a difficult time.  Not because I didn't understand what she was saying, but because my attention kept drifting to the TV that was in front of me now that I was sitting on the couch. </span></div></div>",

She'd been a typically active child and, like most 4-year-olds didn't have the longest attention span.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephen looked at me oddly, but then smiled, \"How about we have a go a few rounds on Killzone 2?  Maybe I can be the one saving your ass now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'we on, thtupid-head.  An' ith Kiwwzone twee.  Dewe no spwit-scween in Kiwwzone two.\" I retorted, mildly embarrassed that my insult had apparently gone through the same \"Melody-speak\" translation that everything else that came out of my mouth went through.  The fact that I'd stuck my tongue out afterwards didn't make me feel any better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura and Melody stifled a giggle and I shot them a glare as best I could with my current body's cherubic features as we trooped up to what used to be my bedroom and Stephen booted up the PS3 and brought up the loading screen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK squirt, let's get started.\"  Stephen's use of his nickname for Melody as he tossed me a controller annoyed me and even though I was struggling to find a grip with my much smaller hands I vowed to show him up like I always did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't work out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody's body lacked the coordination and muscle memory to handle the controller well and my character mostly careened around the map as though he were drunk.  I still had the experience to know what was coming in the game and what I needed to do, but that only made my ineptitude with the controller all the more frustrating.  On top of that, the whole game seemed to be moving faster than I rememberd it.  My child's brain was strugging to keep up with the flow of the game and failing pretty miserably.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter my fifth time accidentally killing Stephen's characted because I couldn't tell the difference between his character and the enemy I threw down my controller in disgust.  \"Dis game thtupid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody, however had been watching intently, \"You mind if I try?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, David.\"  Even though I'd asked him to call us by the names appropriate for our bodies, I still found myself a little annoyed at Stephen calling Melody by my name.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched the two of them play for a bit and was surprised to see that Melody was doing better than I had been.  Sure, she was a bit un-coordinated, but she kept getting a little better as they continued playing and she definitely wasn't having the sort of trouble keeping up with what was going on in the game that I had been having.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was getting increasingly agitated by Melody's newfound ability when Laura grabbed my hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, how about we leave these two to their  little game and go have a talk?\"</span></div></div>",

Setting herself down on the other, she studied me for a moment before jumping in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you keep letting things bother you that much, you're only going to make it harder on yourself you know.\"  Laura's tone was casual as she looked straight ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just looked down and sighed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, you knew this had to happen to help your family, right?  And regardless, there's no way to undo what's been done, right?\"  Her tone had shifted into matter-of-fact as she turned to look at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but ith hard!  I twy thtuff an' I'm thtuck wif Mewody's wittle kid abiwities.  I don wike da thame foods, I can't wead my bookth no mowe - I can't even tawk wight no mowe.  An ith aww worthe 'cuz I 'membew how I uthed to be able ta'do thtuff but I can't no mowe!\"  The words just pour out of me and it's all I can do to keep from crying thanks to the emotional reactions of my child brain.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hang my head in my hands and don't notice that Laura's moved until I feel her wrapping me up in her arms.  \"It's OK David,\" her use of my old name is comforting, \"think about it this way.  You've made probably a hundred different RPG characters in all of your gaming, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just nodded, letting her keep holding me and enjoying the comfort from that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, and you don't always make them the same, right?  You build them differently and use different skills and interact with the world differently, right?  You'd have to be stupid to play the new character the same way as the old character, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, I just nod, staying tight against Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And when you start a new character they don't have very good skills and you have to work hard to level them up and it takes a while if you're not just grinding, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So just think of all this as you having a chance to start a new character.  Yeah, you're going to have to deal with being lower level for a while, but it's a chance to play the game in a whole different way.  Maybe if you stop trying to play it the same way you've always played it you'll be less stressed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stopped and looked up at Laura, the concern clear in her eyes.  When it came right down to it, she was right.  If I kept trying to be David in Melody's body I was just going to make things horrible.  Melody certainly wasn't trying to be her same old self and she was handling things much better than I was.  Granted, that was probably easier to do when you'd gained a bunch of abilities than when you'd lost them, but that didn't change the fact that fighting reality was just going to make it worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gueth you'we wight, Wauwa.  But I don't hafta wike it wight now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just promise me you'll give it a try, OK?  Don't try to be David or Melody.  Sit down and think about the best way to manage your new character and be that person.  Try it for a week?  As a favor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, I couldn't think of a good reason not to and I knew Laura was really smart and not likely to mess with me like Stephen might.  \"I'ww twy.\" I promised her.  \"But onwy if you no teww Stephen an' David dat I wet you hug me wike dat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled and nodded.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once I made my way downstairs, I realized that my family didn't seem to be in sight.  Before I could react however, a pair of arms suddenly swooped me off the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you're a lot lighter than I remember David\" said a familiar voice, \"And you were a few inches taller than me the last time we met\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LAUWA!!!\" I exclaim loudly, wrapping my tiny arms around Laura's neck.  For some reason, it felt really nice being held in her arms - even if it was that I was literally being held in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my, you've shrunk so much, David\" Laura playfully teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Akulawe, yu hav to caw me Mewodie nou\" I say, \"docdews towd me and Dabid to refew to eachwozer by ze ozerz wamez\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"and it looks like you even got Melody's lisp with that body\" Laura noted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I na..\" I say.  However now that I think about it - \"Whar iz ewy bodi?\" I ask, wanting to know where my family was?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Da.. I mean 'Melody', your family wanted to go over the basics of 'being big' with 'David', so the whole family is out\" Laura answers<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buh wi aw you her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To babysit you silly\" Laura cues.  That's right, Laura would always come over to my house to babysit Melody when Mom and Dad weren't around.  She would especially bring her little sister Brittany over to play since she and Melody were good play mates/friends.  It never really occurred to me until now that I would now be the one being babysat by Laura and playing with Brittany.  And as far as Brittany is concerned, since Laura was sworn to secrecy regarding the swap operation, I was the same old Melody she always played with, and not David.  \"You know, now that you're in Melody's body, even though this feels a little different it also feels as though nothing has really changed\" Laura notes, regarding my lisp and mannerisms in display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"owkwa, owkwa, I cet it\" I whine.  Laura continued to chuckle a bit at how much like Melody I was acting like despite actually being David... trapped inside this body....  But soon my tummy rumbles.  \"Im hungwy\" I say to Laura<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let's get you something to eat then\" Laura responds, placing me into the toddler table seat.  I await, sitting idly in the table seat, as I watch Laura prepare me a bowl of cereal.  It got me thinking about how my friendship with Laura ever since she moved into town 2 years ago.  Despite being a year younger than me and Stephen at the time, we quickly became accustomed to one another.  While she would try to spend a lot more time with my sister Cassandra, her being the only other girl in our group, she would tend to spend the most time with me.... and if I am being honest... I had been hoping.. maybe... ask her out....  but now that isn't possible anymore with me stuck in this little body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Laura set the bowl of cereal in front of me, I was almost ready to try to grab the spoon the best I could.  But then Laura grabbed the spoon before I could reach it.  And then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, sorry 'Melody'\" Laura says while I almost choke on the cereal (not really actually, just was startled by the action, that's all).  \"I almost forgot that you were more used to feeding yourself.  You just look and act so much like Melody did now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yu guzt mez me wike thiz\" I retort once I swallow the cereal<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, it's almost hard to tell that you and your little sister had ever swapped bodies\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura kind of had a point, after all if even Dad is still coming to terms with this having happened it shouldn't have been a surprised that Laura is the same.  I simply smile at Laura, almost as if I was telling her that \"it was ok\", and ready myself for then next spoonful of cereal Laura prepares for me.  I did feel awkward about having to be spoonfed again, as it was yet another reminder of the independence I had as a teenage boy being lost to me now.  At the same time however, it was honestly kind of nice having someone else feed me while I could just sit idly with ease, simple opening my mouth, close, chew, swallow, and then open again.  I could see why Melody had always been so carefree - I wonder if she might have realized what she had given away to be in my body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the bowl of cereal now empty, Laura gently wiped any milk or crumbs that might have gotten on my face and hoisted me out of the table seat.  Having been set back on the floor, I give Laura the best hug I possibly could around her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure that's really David in there\" Laura teased.  I look up at Laura, still astonished by how much she towers me now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cawd yu.. nod tweet mwe too muj wike a 4 wew owd?..\" I shyly say to Laura, stepping back.  \"I still wanna remain friends with you... please don't go\" I was thinking to myself.  As though she could read my mind, Laura knelt down so that we would be at eye level - mostly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, we're still friends, David\" she assures me, referring to me by \"David\" instead of \"Melody\" to make her point across.  I smile back as to tell her \"Thank you\".  Again, as though she was reading my mind, Laura playfully jests that I didn't have to worry about my saying thank you sounding too embarrassing in the lisp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thing comes to my mind.  \"Iz.. Bwittani comin two?\" I ask</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before long, Mom was serving us all... spaghetti again, just like the day this all started. I wondered if that was a deliberate choice, but I didn't say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn awkward silence prevailed throughout the meal, but my futile attempts to get the spaghetti in my mouth without spilling were clearly the centre of attention. Melody watched me with interest, fascinated at seeing her clumsy old self from the outside. Amelia just kept smirking at me; I shot her a glare now and then, but that didn't discourage her in the least. And Cassandra was giving me a look of sympathy, clearly wondering how best to comfort me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Dad, meanwhile, were trying not to stare so blatantly. Dad instead focused his curious gaze on Melody, seemingly still finding it hard to believe the swap had actually happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we were done eating, Melody turned to me. \"Say, Melody... want to play a game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stared at him. Her. Whatever. \"Uhhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong? Scared of losing?\" Melody teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weww... yeth, actuawwy.\" The idea of losing to Melody at something I'd spent so much time on was not appealing. I couldn't see Amelia, but I knew she would be finding that funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cm'on, it'll be fun!\" My old body took off, and I followed it to the stairs. The gigantic stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dey tho taww...\" I muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, you can do it! I should know!\" Melody said cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slowly hefted myself up the stairs, enviously watching Melody stomp rapidly upwards, before following her into my old room. I approached the bed and stared at it until, without warning, Melody picked me up from behind. I involuntarily giggled a little before she set me down atop the sheets. Well, at least I was enjoying one thing about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched Melody fumble around with the PS3 for a few seconds before turning it on and starting up Call of Duty. Part of me wanted to protest; that wasn't something little girls should be playing. But of course, I was the little girl now, and I already knew a lot of things little girls shouldn't. So I bit my tongue. Still, it occurred to me that Melody was going to have to learn a lot of things rather quickly in the coming weeks. She was happy now, but it wouldn't be all sunshine and roses for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here ya go.\" Melody plopped down a controller in front of me. I tried to wrap my little hands around it, but there was no way I could have all the buttons in reach at once. This was going to be difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ith too big,\" I complained in a whinier tone than I intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right? You'll manage. You're the one who actually knows how to play this.\" Melody was aimlessly wandering the game's menu. I recognised the screen she was on, but the text was meaningless to me now. Being illiterate was getting old fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you weawwy wead dat?\" I asked. Sure, Melody had my ability to process the words, but could she actually understand them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think it's as easy for me as it was for you, but yeah. You just look at the letters and put their sounds together to make words. It's funny, it never really made sense to me before.\" That didn't sound like stellar reading skills, but it was more than I could manage now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Melody kept exploring the menu, my gaze wandered to the pin-up poster on the wall. I'd always thought that girl was hot, so it was surreal to look at her now and feel nothing, my new body not even being capable of arousal. Heck, it was hard to even grasp the concept of \"attractive\" now. Obviously, sexuality would be another thing that wasn't transferred. Rather than give much thought to the disturbing ramifications of that, I simply added it to my list of reasons this was better than being Amelia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Melody managed to initiate a one-on-one match between us. The ensuing shootout was... interesting. Melody had taken my dexterity and muscle memory, leaving me struggling to work the controller, but as she'd said, I was still the one who knew the game. So I compensated for my awkward, clumsy movement with my knowledge of the map, good use of cover and other smart tactics. It was like a contest between my body and my mind, and it was actually quite thrilling. For a while, our scores kept close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, though, I wasn't able to think fast enough to keep up, and once Melody caught on to my tricks, she pulled ahead and ended up winning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phooey,\" I childishly spat at the game's end, gently throwing my controller down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you did good for a little girl.\" Melody smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not funny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not just a joke, though. Remember, you might've lost a lot, but you still make a great four-year-old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumbling, I leapt off the bed and headed for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You going to your room, Melody?\" asked the boy I still thought of as Melody. \"I'll leave you alone now. I think you want some time to yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was true enough. I still hadn't had much time to really contemplate my situation... although I wasn't sure if I wanted to. As I left the room, I glanced at a stack of comics and cursed my illiteracy again. If I was going to keep up with my comics now, I'd need someone to read them to me. One of many demeaning experiences to look forward to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI approached the door to Melody's room, now my room, reached up and pulled the door handle down. As I pushed the door open and went inside, I found my expected solitude denied by someone sitting on my new bed.</span></div></div>",

It was the same amount of water.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...No! No, it wath tawwer! It... it..\" I trailed off as I realised with creeping horror I had to be wrong. I hadn't trusted Melody's judgement, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cathie... I twust you. If you thay I wong, den...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hung my head, and we both fell silent. I replayed the test in my head, trying to understand my error. I began to see how my answer couldn't have been right, but I couldn't quite wrap my head around the logic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah! It doethn't make thenthe!\" I suddenly yelled. \"It... how could... I dun'...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh... it's okay...\" Cassie cooed. \"Listen... Melody... I'm sorry I brought this up. I shouldn't be stressing you out like this.\" She closed the binder and put it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ith okay...\" Holding back tears, I looked up at her. \"Cathie... you jutht... dunno what to thay to me, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you got me,\" she sighed. \"I mean, what on Earth do you say to your 16-year-old brother who just became your 4-year-old sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat earned a nervous little chuckle from me. This really was absurd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, though,\" she continued, \"I know this must be hard for you, and... I just want you to know I'm here for you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was feeling very emotional at this point. I was tempted to blame it on Melody's instincts, but really, I had every right to be overwhelmed. I gave Cassie a hug... or at least, gave her leg a hug. \"I wuv you, thith.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, I wuv you too, Melody.\" She paused. \"I'm sorry. I'm treating you like a kid now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo my surprise, I was actually a little disappointed to hear that. I looked away and summoned the courage to speak my mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yanno what? You can tweat me wike a kid if you wanna. Ith... ith comfowting.\" I weakly smiled at Cassie before quickly adding, \"But dun' teww anyone I said dat. 'thpethiawwy not Amewia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your secret's safe with me, little sis.\" Cassie said, ruffling my hair. I smiled again, more easily this time. Anyone else doing the same would have annoyed me, at least if they knew who I was, but now I was beginning to feel I could open up to Cassie and be honest about what my hybrid mind was making me feel.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"By the way,\" Cassie said, \"Amelia was here before me. I chased her off for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Thank you. Keep doin' dat. I no wanna be thtuck awone wit' hew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you don't. Who would?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI giggled quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spent the remaining daytime just sort of relaxing with Cassie. The fact that she had already gotten along with both me and Melody helped us get over the initial awkwardness. Occasionally she almost seemed to forget who I actually was, but as long as no-one else was around I didn't feel the need to complain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, I awoke to the sound of Mom's voice. \"Melody, honey! It's time you were up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight, that was me now. I sat up, opened my eyes to the sight of Melody's bed, and drowsily looked down at my pajama-clad little arms. Yep, I was still Melody. Having calmly confirmed that, I stretched my arms and yawned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good mowning, Mommy,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom smiled, probably pleasantly surprised that I wasn't saying something about it not being a dream. \"Feeling alright? Good. Get yourself dressed and come down for breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left the room. I got out of bed and started looking through Melody's clothes. Most of the available outfits involved some kind of skirt, something I would rather avoid. It didn't really seem wrong to wear one, but dammit, I wasn't about to throw my old self away entirely. I may have begun to accept being a kid again, but no way was I going to be a girly girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually I settled on a T-shirt and a pair of overalls, which I didn't think Melody had worn in a while. I went down the stairs, feeling a little scared of falling, and entered the kitchen. Mom, standing by the counter, greeted me with a smile. She picked me up and put me in my place at the table. Dad and Melody were already eating, but Cassie and Amelia were conspicuously absent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, little sis!\" Melody cheerfully greeted me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mowning, bwuddah,\" I replied with far less enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm. It's good to see you two adjusting,\" Dad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Melody, here's your breakfast!\" Mom announced. Before I knew what was happening, she jammed a spoonful of cereal in my mouth. I nearly choked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry, were you not ready?\" she asked. \"Sorry, but like your dad said, you're doing a good job adjusting already. It's kind of easy to forget.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could understand that. The idea that \"David\" and I had been each other before the previous day couldn't be easy for anyone to accept. Still, it was a bit embarrassing that my own family could take me for the girl I looked like even when they knew better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody noticed my discomfort as I swallowed the cereal. \"Hey, just relax. It's nice to have things done for you, isn't it? You don't have to worry about anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf that was really her thinking, she wouldn't have been so eager to switch in the first place. Then again, maybe she just didn't appreciate what she had until she lost it. In any case, her words did make me feel better. So I sat peacefully and let Mom feed me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately after we were done, Cassie and Amelia entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, guys,\" Cassie said to Melody and I. \"I've already talked to Mom about what we're going to do today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia looked at the empty bowl in front of me. \"Hey, girlie, I see you've had your cereal. Did your mommy help you with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie briefly glared at Amelia before addressing me. \"Don't worry, Melody. You and I are going out today, and mean ol' Amelia can't come, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI resisted the urge to stick my tongue out at Amelia. That was when I realised she was having the opposite effect from Cassie, making me cling to my pride for fear of encouraging her mockery. Our little feud would have to stop at some point. Hopefully she would relent before I did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I wanna go too!\" Melody piped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think not, young man,\" Mom said. \"You're going to spend today learning some of the things a 16-year-old should know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, Mom! Can't I enjoy myself a little first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't trust you on your own yet,\" Dad said. \"We need to teach you some things before we can let you run around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody sighed and looked at me with a tinge of jealousy. I considered making several different comments, but decided it was best to stay quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready to go now, Melody?\" Cassie asked. \"Dad gave us plenty of spending money, so you can get all the new things you want!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" Dad confirmed. \"We owe you two for all the money we'll be getting soon, so the least we can do is let you use some of it to make yourselves comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwight, wet's go den,\" I said, hopping off my chair. I was a little apprehensive about facing the world as a little girl, but I didn't want to just sit around all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie took my hand, enveloping it within her own. \"Okay, sis! We can do whatever you want, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia raised an eyebrow at Cassie's sweet tone. \"Hey, how come <i>she</i> gets to baby you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was a little taken aback by that. I began to formulate a response along the lines of \"she's nice and you're a jerk\", but Cassie intervened with a simpler solution: \"Shut up, Amelia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Cassie and I made our way out. \"You two have fun!\" Mom shouted as we left the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So! Where to, little sis?\" Cassie asked once we were outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo things came to mind. Firstly, I wanted to change my wardrobe. Picking my own clothes would be a good first step toward taking over Melody's life and making it my own. Second, I needed to introduce my new self to Stephen and Laura. It would be immensely awkward, of course, and I was dreading it, but I didn't want to put it off and grow distant from them. Plus, I'd rather Melody didn't get to them to before I did.</span></div></div>",

Are you sure you're ready for that?\" Cassie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I no wanna put it off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's probably wise... okay, I'll give Laura a call...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie took out her cell phone and dialled. I nervously listened to her half of the ensuing conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Laura. ... Yeah. Yeah, they've done it. ... Yep. ... Pretty well, actually. ... Yeah. ... I'm with Melody now, she wants to meet up. ... Yes. ... Yes, exactly. ... Uh-huh. ... Okay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie kneeled down and held the phone to my ear. \"She wants to talk to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hewwo, Waura,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David!\" came Laura's voice from the phone. \"Is that really you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weww, I no David anymowe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this has really happened? I can hardly believe you went through with it.\" She paused. \"Hey, David...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mewody,\" I reluctantly corrected her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's nine times five?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fowty-five,\" I answered in a slightly annoyed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's thirteen times fourteen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... a hunnerd eighty-two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right! And... what's ninety-six times pi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thut up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Okay, that's convincing enough. But we ought to be speaking in person, right? My parents are away right now, so come and meet me at my house. I'll call Stephen over as well. See you soon!\" She hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Cassie asked, standing up and putting her phone away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We gonna meet at hew houthe,\" I relayed. \"Hew pawents out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her parents? Okay, but what about Brittany?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI froze up. I had totally forgotten about Laura's five-year-old sister. Brittany was a precocious kid, but she was also about as girly as they came. And I wouldn't put it past Laura to leave me at her mercy in the name of helping me adjust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She didn't mention Brittany, did she?\" Cassie asked with an amused sigh, seeing the tension on my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, ith a twap!\" I moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, you think so? Well, Brittany is just another person you shouldn't put off meeting, right? And it's not like Laura won't want to spend time with you herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed. Yes, interacting with other little girls was something I had to do now. And although I'd never seen much of Brittany, I knew she and Melody were close friends. I'd feel guilty if I refused to spend time with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, come on, let's go.\" Cassie took my hand, and we started walking down the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a longer time than the journey usually took, Cassie was knocking on the door of Laura's house. Laura answered immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stared up at her. She was huge. That shouldn't have been surprising, of course - everyone was huge. But it was still jarring to see Laura from this perspective for the first time. I would surely feel the same way when Stephen showed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Cassie,\" Laura smiled. She looked down at me. \"And... Melody. So, how are you feeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weawwy thmaww,\" I answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can imagine. Um, are you speaking like that on purpose, or...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I no can hewp it,\" I muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting...!\" Laura commented, weakly attempting to hide her enthusiasm. Though she was trying to be sympathetic, she was clearly eager to learn all about the effects of the swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura, who's that?\" came Brittany's voice from her room. Oh boy. She emerged into the hallway clad in a frilly blue dress. Although she didn't tower over me like everyone else, she still had a few inches on me. Regardless, the fact that she was anywhere near my size harshly reminded me that I was now her equal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe perked up at the sight of me. \"Oh! Hi, Melody!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... hewwo, Bwittany,\" I replied, feeling jealous of her ability to talk properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's play!\" she eagerly declared before dashing back into her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave Laura a pleading look. She kneeled down and spoke to me quietly. \"I'm sorry, but I don't want to disappoint her, you know? Play along for a while, and the meantime Cassie can tell me everything, so I won't have to bother you with more questions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI indicated my discontent with a groan before trudging into Brittany's room. Laura sealed my fate by closing the door behind me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhereas Melody's room was mostly just a kid's place, Brittany's room very clearly belonged to a girl. It was decorated in soft feminine colours, mostly pink and white. I looked around and spotted a dollhouse, a small assortment of stuffed animals, some kid-sized plastic furniture, and the wardrobe where Brittany undoubtedly kept her various girly outfits. The thought of being expected to interact with these things was not pleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, let's play dress up!\" Brittany said. Okay, no. Anything but that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no thanks...\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No?\" Brittany seemed a bit taken aback. She approached the dollhouse. \"Well... wanna play house then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to accept that. \"Okay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! You can be be the mummy this time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight. That was something little girls did. Pretend to be mothers... because that was what they intended to be someday. I shuddered a little. Was I going to end up being a mom? Was I going to want that, decades from now? How much of my old self would even be left by the time I'd grown up all over again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pushed those thoughts aside. I had a very long time before I'd really have to consider such things. Right now, I would focus on more immediate concerns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Brittany's voice brought me back to reality. \"Come on, I've got it all ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI halfheartedly followed her lead for a while, moving the dolls around, acting out the mock conversations she started, and generally doing what she seemed to expect of me. She was less than fooled, however, and seemed to grow increasingly concerned over my lack of enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, Melody?\" she eventually asked. \"You're acting all funny...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI should have been ready for that. Between Brittany having her sister's smarts and my reluctance to play with her, I knew she was going to get suspicious. Yet here I was feeling like a deer in the headlights, having no idea of what excuse I could make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs luck would have it, though, Laura and Cassie came into the room just then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you having fun?\" Laura asked. No. No, I was not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura, Melody is acting weird...\" Brittany said, looking up at her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh...\" Laura averted her eyes, an indication of guilt that did not go unnoticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know something! Tell me!\" Brittany pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, er... it's a secret,\" Laura said anxiously, knowing better than to try and convince her sister there was nothing wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A secret?\" Brittany pouted. She turned back to me. \"Melody, are you keeping a secret?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nervously rubbed the back of my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, come on! Why would you tell Laura and not me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stayed silent. Brittany began to look quite upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melody... I won't be angry... please tell me...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up at Laura and Cassie. Their expressions seemed to indicate that this was my call... if only because they didn't want to make it themselves.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I no feew good, that's awwl,\" I said, making up a lie on the fly. I wanted to minimize the amount of people who knew my secret, even if it meant having to continue hanging out with Brittany whenever I went to visit Stephen and Laura. Besides, playing with Brittany would give me the much-needed experience for interacting with little girls for when school started. September was less than a month away, and I'd be starting kindergarten. While having to go through kindergarten again wasn't exactly a prospect I was eagerly anticipating, at least I would learn my basic skills like reading. I'd have to wait until first grade, however, to learn how to write and read a clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! Do you have a cold?\" Brittany inquired. I looked up at Laura and Cassie, hoping I could send visual cues to get their help on this. However, I wasn't completely familiar with making facial expressions, what with my new face and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not like that,\" said Cassie, \"Melody just... had surgery recently. But she's better now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" said Brittany, the lie seeming to appease her. Thankfully, fooling five year old girls wasn't very tough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're going to the movies,\" said Laura. My eyes lit up. \"Ooh! Bwing me pwease!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura and Cassie exchanged a glance and then looked back at me. \"We would,  said Cassie, \"It's just that we're seeing a PG-13 rated movie. You can't go since you're only four.\" I crossed my arms over my tiny chest and looked at my feet. Yet another restriction of being a little kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, you can stay here and play with Brittany,\" said Laura. Oh joy. They would be gone for two hours at a minimum, so I would be stuck here playing with Brittany for at least the rest of the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie looked at me sympathetically and followed Laura out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we better keep playing!\" said Brittany. She picked up her doll. I picked up mine, the mommy doll. As we played, I realized that in certain ways, my doll was like my avatar and the dollhouse an RPG world. I realized that being in Melody's body was kind if like that also.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe played for a long time. There was a digital clock in Brittany's room, but since I couldn't make sense if numbers anymore, I had no idea how much time was actually passing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy doll was tending to the garden when I heard the front door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Melody, it's time to go home!\" shouted Cassie, and walked into the room a second later. I ran up to her and hugged her leg really tight. \"Okay!\" I exclaimed a little too excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye, Brittany,\" said Cassie, and she led me out. I clutched her hand the whole way to the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, what do you say to the mall?\" asked Cassie, as she strapped me into my carseat and buckled it up tight. \"Yeah!\" I exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI fell asleep on the way there. Being in a moving car was oddly calming to my four year old body. I awoke to Cassie unstrapping me from my carseat. She picked me up and put me on the ground. \"Hold my hand,\" she said, \"Parking lots can be dangerous.\" I held her hand, her seemingly huge fingers completely covering my tiny ones. I had to walk fast to keep up with her extra pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, what kind if clothes do you want?\" asked Cassie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" I said, \"Not too giwwy, but not wike a boy!\" Cassie smiled. \"So you'll wear clothes made for girls as long as you don't have to wear dresses or skirts?\" I nodded vigorously. \"And no mowe pwincess shiwts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie led me to a section labelled \"Girls-Ages 3-5\". I saw a lot of pink and purples, and shirts with random scribbles on them. I realized those scribbled were words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What dis say?\" I asked, pointing to one purple shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It says 'Angel',\" said Cassie. I looked at it, but just couldn't make sense of the random curvy lines. \"What dis?\" I asked, pointing at one if the especially weird letters. \"That's a 'G',\" said Cassie. All of a sudden, I started to get really frustrated. \"Why can't I read this?\" I said, stomping my foot as Melody was often apt to do. Cassie bent down and out her arms around me to comfort me. \"You'll learn, Melody. Really soon, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You pwomise?\" I asked, beaming up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"September's only a few weeks away,\" said Cassie, \"And then school will start!\" I smiled. \"I can't wait fow schoow! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your sister is so cute!\" I looked around to see a very tall woman, even taller than Cassie, walking over to us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why thank you!\" exclaimed Cassie, then looked down at me. \"You hear that, Melody? She thinks you're cute!\" I just hid behind Cassie's leg. \"She's just shy,\" said Cassie. I looked at the floor as I held on to Cassie's leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman and Cassie kept chatting, and Cassie told me to pick out some clothes. I was more interested in finding out what the shirts with writing said, so I gathered up as many as I could to bring back to Cassie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, I brought back the stack and asked Cassie what each of them meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What dis say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy's Little Girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How bout dis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jewel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She has such a desire to learn! So wonderful!\" said the woman. Cassie looked at me. \"Melody, this is Jan. She's a kindergarten teacher, and you might have her this year!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up at the woman. \"Youw a teachew?\" She nodded happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wiw you teach me how to wead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJan smiled. \"Of course I will, dear.\" I hugged her leg. \"Fank you Fank you Fank you!\" I said breathlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Melody, are these the clothes you want?\" asked Cassie. I nodded. \"Kay, let's go pay then. It was great meeting you, Mrs. Driver.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pleasure's all mine,\" the teacher said, and we were on our way.</span></div></div>",

For that matter, this was now the only place I could claim any sort of authority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, this is your room now.\" Amelia gave me that mocking smile that had become far too familiar recently, and started walking around and pointing at things. \"This is your bed with your little teddy bear, these are your dollies, this is your shelf of picture books and bedtime stories, here's where you keep your little dresses...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shaddaaap!\" I whined, doing that little stomp again. I was not helping myself. Thankfully, someone arrived who could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amelia!

Not knowing what to say, I wandered over to the bookshelf and fixed my eyes on one of the picture books. Might as well get started on relearning how to read.</span></div></div>",

Regardless, Mom clearly understood my words as she lifted me up into her arms, giving me a warm, comforting smile.<br>\r\n\"OK sweety\" she softly said to me as she sat down on Melody's - or rather MY bed, placing me on her lap as she held the picture book in front of me and began to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I expected, the picture book was so basic and devoid of any narrative or ideas other than \"The sky is blue\" or \"The grass is green\" that my teenage boy mind would clearly fall asleep just reading it.  However I was no longer a teenage boy, I was now a 4 year old little girl trying to imitate the words of my Mother as she read the picture book.  It was a rather surreal experience, knowing that one half of me was way too old for this sort of stuff while the other half was learning something \"new\" here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she finished reading the last page of the picture book, Mom looked down at me and said, \"You know, I read this very same book to you when you were Melody's age\".<br>\r\n\"Rweally?\" I said as I looked up at my mother's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was so many years ago, but I remember it as if it was just yesterday\" Mom said to me, \"You and Casandra were always very excited to hear me read these picture books to you two.  It was always so cute to see you two try to read the words on your own, and it always put a smile on my face when one of y'all would successfully read a word\".  She had a warm smile on her face as she said these words to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy?\" I said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tis sdil fwelz zo swange\" I said to Mom, who proceeded to set the book down and hug me a little tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melody, I know this is very hard for you sweetheart, being forced to live someone's life.  Especially since it's your little sister whose body you ended up getting stuck in.  But just know that we are all here for you, even David is here for you\" Mom said to me<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alexia's enjoin bakin vun ov me zo\" I retorted in my little sister's cutesy voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Mommy and Daddy will make sure that mean old Alexia won't pester you, sweetheart\" Mom said to me in a cutesy voice that, to be honest, sort of made me chuckle.  \"What I'm trying to say dear is to try to think of this in a positive light\" She added.<br>\r\n\"Buh houw?\" I said<br>\r\n\"Try thinking of this as a new opportunity dear.  Maybe like one of those video games you used to play where you create a character and that character has their own roles and traits to experiment with\" Mom said to me.<br>\r\nI gave it some thought as I sat in my mother's embrace.  She is right that trying to remain being David in my new body would just make this more difficult for me to cope with my predicament.  And I don't really like the idea of trying to perfectly mimic Melody's personality.  It would be best to treat this as a new character; as much as I want to cling on to my old life, I need to accept that this is my new life and make of this new life that I can.  The only issue is who am I going to be?  If I can't be David anymore and I don't want to just turn into old Melody, then who am I, this new Melody.<br>\r\nI merely left my train of thought there as I gave my mother a nod.  \"Ow-Kay\" I said to Mom, \"Ial twie\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom set me aside as she put up the picture book, returning to tuck me in what was now my bed.  She plants a kiss on my forehead, telling me \"Goodnight Melody\".  After she left my room and close the door, it didn't take long before Melody's body succumbed to slumber, as I snoozed peacefully in bed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>- One Month Later -<br>\r\nA month had past since the operation, and I had gotten somewhat used to living in my little sister's body.  Sure speaking in Melody's lisp was still somewhat annoying for me, but I've learned to ignore it (for the most part).  While my teenage boy mind still somewhat refuses to accept the change in the family status quo, I have completely accepted the fact that just about everything and everyone is towering over my small body.  There was something rather thrilling about it to be honest - trying to see all this in a positive light, I took it as being sort of an adventure; almost like I was thrust into another world and my goal was to adapt to this new world.  Besides, being so small meant I could enjoy piggy back rides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexia was still being such a \"big meanie\" (I am also trying to think in simpler terms that Melody's 4 year old brain would understand), but it wasn't too bad since she had to spend most of the day at school.  I on the other hand didn't have to go to school since Melody's body still wasn't old enough to enter Kindergarten.  Unfortunately though Cassandra and Melody had to go to school as well, the latter who has to spend even more time at school for tutoring (in order to be able to more steadily transfer into the high school setting).  And \"Daddy\" spent most of the day at work, so it was usually just me and \"Mommy\" at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsually after breakfast, \"Mommy\" would give me a bath - while I had kept insisting that I could bathe myself, \"Mommy\" told me that I wasn't old enough to be able to bathe myself and needed adult supervision.  This morning however, instead of the usual \"running away in my underwear\" routine, I \"admitted defeat\" and let \"Mommy\" bathe me without causing any trouble  - could she of at least let me dry myself though???......  On the other hand, I was still able to dress myself - however even that was taken over by \"Mommy\" as she would always choose what clothes I would wear - sometimes she would even try to force me to wear something \"girly\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, once all the whole ordeal was over, \"Mommy\" allowed me to play or watch TV.  I didn't really like to watch TV all that much - now that I was in my little sister's body I could no longer watch the shows I had liked as a teenage boy; instead it was Sesame Street for me.  At first I wasn't too fond of the idea of watching a \"baby show\", but once I gave it a try I found that within a few minutes I had become completely engrossed in the show; even though my mind was telling me that I was too old for this kind of stuff, the toddler brain that housed my mind found all the colorful characters and songs a novelty.  Often I would find myself singing along with all the characters and be engaged whenever they had something to teach me - they would even help me learn how to read (although it's still a little hard).<br>\r\nAfter around 2 episodes of Sesame Street (\"Mommy\" only allows me an hour of TV a day in order to make me go play), I would usually go up to \"my room\" to find something to play with.  As much of the brain that housed my mind was that of Melody's, I just couldn't get myself into playing with Barbie Dolls or anything girly like that.  I know Melody was always into that kind of stuff, but in all honesty I was more fond of dressing up - or rather \"rwole-pwayin\" as I keep insisting to everyone.  Now I wasn't really one to dress up as a princess, rather I was into \"roleplaying\" as a Cowgirl Sheriff, a superhero, and even try to \"roleplay\" \"grown-up work\" such as banking, running a store (I \"sold\" plastic items to Melody's stuffed animals), play house (playing as Mommy taking care of the baby stuffed animal), and even the occasional \"tea party\"..  Although I will admit that every now and then I would dress up as the \"pretty princess\" with the stuffed animals as \"my brave bodyguards\".<br>\r\nToday I had decided to \"roleplay\" in a Wonder Woman costume to fight bad guys - in this case I used the Barbie dolls as the bad guys - in order to stop them from stealing all the tea from the tea party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time I had \"saved the day\", I heard another cry for help - actually it was \"Mommy\" calling me that it was time for lunch.  I ran down the stairs to the kitchen, still in my Wonder Woman costume as \"Mommy\" noticed.<br>\r\n\"Were you able to save the day from those 'evil' Barbie dolls 'Wonder Woman'\" she playfully asked me as she knelt down to me.<br>\r\n\"Yith!!  Ze Twea pawti waz awble to pwoseed wizout animwoe twouba\" I exclaimed as I posed triumphantly in front of \"Mommy\".<br>\r\n\"Mommy\" then grinned<br>\r\n\"You know, isn't Wonder Woman technically a \"pretty princess\" also?\" she said, at which I stomped my feet and playfully pouted that Wonder Woman was a \"Warrior princess\" and that it didn't count because she's a superhero, which made \"Mommy\" giggle.<br>\r\n\"Well in that case, aren't superheroes supposed to be able to - \" before she finished that sentence she lifted me up , \"FLY UP UP AND AWAY!!\".  She held me up high as I acted like I was flying for a few seconds, afterwards setting me down into my table booster seat.  For lunch she made me a small bowl of mac and cheese along with a plate of carrots - I would only pretend to not want to eat the veggies only to eat my serving by the time lunch time was over.  Of course, being in Melody's body, no matter how hard I tried I would usual end up making some kind of mess (this time I was able to keep my costume clean though) - hence whenever I had cereal for breakfast \"Mommy\" would always spoon feed me.....<br>\r\nAfter I had finished my lunch and \"Mommy\" was done wiping my face clean, that was when \"Mommy\" said that she is going to the store pretty soon so I would be going with her.  I didn't really feel like going to the store, I wanted to play some more.<br>\r\n\"Buh Mommy, I wanna pway som mwoe\" I whined<br>\r\n\"Well I can't leave you here all by yourself\" \"Mommy said<br>\r\n\"Buh I ben by mysef befow\" I retorted<br>\r\n\"That was when you were a 16 year old boy, dear.  Now you're way too young to be left by yourself\" \"Mommy\" reminded me<br>\r\n\"Ie knoe.....\"<br>\r\n\"Also, technically your nap time is pretty soon if I recall\" \"Mommy\" said with a grin<br>\r\nNO WAY WAS I GOING TO HAVE A NAP, I'M NOT TIRED<br>\r\n\"Buh Imma not tired!!!  I wanna goe to ze store wiz you\" I exclaimed<br>\r\n\"What happened to wanting to stay home\" \"Mommy\" said<br>\r\n\"I chjanjj mie mwind\" I insisted<br>\r\n\"But remember that nap time will be after the store dear.  Promise\" \"Mommy added<br>\r\n\"Pwomith\" I responded, while also putting on a smile.  \"Buh canna at weast ztaie in my cozduem?\" I asked?<br>\r\n\"Mommy\" give my question a few seconds of thought before she responded with ____</span></div></div>",

A-P-P-L-E... apple. That just about made sense, but it took a lot of effort. I had a long way to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spent the rest of the day mostly moping around in my new room, thinking about... not much, really, as I was a bit scared to think too hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day I woke up to Mom saying, \"Melody! Time to get up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe proximity of her voice made me realise she was talking to me. I opened my eyes to the relatively unfamiliar surroundings of Melody's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bluhh,\" was all I could manage, briefly lifting my head before slamming it back down on the pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, sleepyhead! Everyone else is up already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just kept looking at her through half-shut eyes. She sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I know you're overwhelmed,\" Mom said. \"It can't be easy to wake up and face having to live someone else's life. But we're all here to support you. There's nothing to be scared of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reluctantly dragged myself out of bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl. Get dressed and we'll meet you downstairs.\" Mom left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI groggily began looking through Melody's clothes. At least this time I could pick what to dress myself in. I didn't particularly like my options, though. I rummaged through various bits of girly attire before coming across a purple T-shirt and a pair of pink shorts. Well, I could do a lot worse. The shirt had something written on it, but of course I couldn't decipher what it said. I was probably better off not knowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce dressed, I made my way down the still-humongous stairs and into the kitchen, finding the rest of the family waiting for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, here you are! Good morning!\" Mom said as I looked up to watch her pour cereal into a bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, sis!\" Melody greeted me with my old voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Melody,\" Cassie said somewhat sullenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up you go!\" Mom lifted me up and put me on my chair. Then she picked up the bowl of cereal and sloshed it around with a spoon as she walked back to me. Great, she was going to spoon feed me. And judging by how difficult yesterday's dinner was, it wouldn't be wise to object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the room shot a pre-emptive glare at Amelia. She turned her head away, trying her best to look innocent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat up, dearie!\" Mom said, offering me a spoonful of cereal. I reluctantly allowed it into my mouth and started chewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Melody,\" Mom said as she continued to feed me, \"Your father and I were thinking it would be a good idea for you and David to spend some time together out of the house. Maybe you could go shopping, give yourself a bit of a makeover. I'm sure you'd feel better then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that sounds good,\" Cassie chimed in. \"I mean, you're Melody now, but you're not the same Melody. You can do what you want with your new self. If you get a new look, I think this'll all start making more sense for all of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made sense. If I put my own mark on Melody's body, I could claim some of my identity back. I nodded, and Cassie smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And maybe then I can actually believe this is happening...\" Dad added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time I was done eating, Melody was standing up and fidgeting around, eager to get moving. She watched me get out of my chair and grinned. \"Let's go, Melody! I can't wait to get out there and buy stuff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you're ready, I guess you can go right away. I think the two of you together can handle everything,\" Mom said. She looked down at me. \"Just keep an eye on your brother, Melody. Don't let him do anything irresponsible. And on that note... listen to your sister, David. She'll know what she's talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, right,\" Melody said. \"You can teach me how to be... uh, me. We'll be fine. Let's go!\" With that, she took off for the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to follow when Cassie stopped me. \"Hey, if there's anything you need, call us, okay?\" I nodded, opting not to point out it might be a challenge for either me or Melody to use a phone. \"And when you get back... talk to me, okay? I want to hear everything that's on your mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh,\" I replied. \"When I get back, I be new Mewody. Den we tawk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. Now get out there and face the world... Melody.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I left the room, I quickly became determined to stay true to what I just said. I told myself that by the end of the day, I'd have a better sense of who I was and what I was going to do with myself.</span></div></div>",

Not to mention buckle me in so tight.<br>\r\nI know that everyone expects me to accept this change, but even with my hybrid mind/brain I still could not accept the reality that I had gone from a high school boy near adulthood to being reduced to a little girl who can't even read.  It's even more humiliating that not only has my former younger sister, Melody, been able to adjust easily to my body, but apparently she is going to be able to do everything I could do <b>BETTER</b> according to the doctors who've taken my life from me.  Heck the other day Mom kept talking about how much of a better driver Melody apparently was than me....<br>\r\nSo yes, I feel quite uncomfortable right now.  And most of all, I feel <b>trapped</b>; trapped in my little sister's body, forced to wear her skin and live her life.  I couldn't even have my own name anymore.  I was David no more as far as anyone was concerned.  That name now belonged to <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Melody</span>.  I on the other hand received her name in return.  Forced to be Melody.  Forced to forfeit my own body and life, in exchange for her's.  Forced to have her mannerisms (can't even speak without that annoying wisp).  Even forced to think like a 4 year old girl.  All this gives me the same feeling of captivity as did the booster seat I was strapped into, having no control over where my life was going from here and could only sit idly as someone else was driving me into the destination they wanted me to go to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Melody</span>David had already been driving for 10 minutes as I continued to wrestle with the reality of what I now was, just staring out the car window, at a faint reflection of my little sister's body, still not able to grasp that the reflection was indeed mine.<br>\r\nIt was then that I noticed that the music that was playing was Melody's old music sing along CDs.  Well I say old because technically speaking they belonged to me now.  Odd isn't it; normally it's the older sibling who passes their personal belongings onto the younger sibling, not the other way around.  Nevertheless what I found the most odd was that I was actually enjoying the music; from Man in the Moon, to Twinkle Little Star, and even Brush Your Teeth, I was actually really enjoying these songs.  Previously, back in my teenage boy body, I would be annoyed whenever these songs played, preferring to not play them whenever <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Melody</span>David would tag along with me on some errand I would run for Mom.  That really got me thinking however, back to several months ago when Mom had me take <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Melody</span>David to the Mall while she \"chatted with a friend\" (though I now know for sure that she was probably actually discussing with Dad and the doctors over the body swap procedure).  I remember <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Melody</span>David begging me to play those CDs for her while I had responded with a flat out refusal.  Not only that but I would also play the music I liked, hard rock, which I knew scared <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Melody</span>David.  Looking back at this as Melody now, I couldn't help but feel ashamed, which led me on an even longer train of thought - or rather memories as I began to reflect on my past relationship with my little sister.  Granted I always had a much stronger relationship with my then twin sister Casandra, but I wasn't exactly the best big brother to <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Melody</span>David.  I never really played with her whenever she asked me, yet I always had forced her into a Call of Duty match that she didn't really have the gaming experience for.  Perhaps this was the reason why I took my defeat last night and <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Melody</span>David calling me \"a little girl\" so personally.  Perhaps this is God punishing me or making me see the error of my ways.  Perhaps this is what I deserve.  Perhaps I am beginning to see things from Melody's point of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 minutes later <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Melody</span>David parked the car, having finally arrived at the Mall.  As he unbuckled me from my seat, he noticed the sad look on my face.  Out of concern, as what any good big brother would do, he said, \"Anything wrong Melody?\".<br>\r\nI looked up to him and said, \"Ife ben wondewing....\"<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n\"haf... haf I been a bad big bwother?\"<br>\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Melody</span>David only chuckled and said, \"Silly Melody, you're the little sister, not the big brother\"<br>\r\nI pouted and then teared up a bit, which was when <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Melody</span>David really got concerned.  \"Sorry I didn't mean to hurt your feelings, I was just teasing\" he said<br>\r\n\"I know...  itz juzt so all coming at me wo fazt.\"  I continued \"I also fweel wike I waz mean to you befowe ze swap.  Back when I waz ze big wone.\"<br>\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Melody</span>David gently wiped my tears as he said in a soozing voice, \"It's ok Melody.  I forgive you.  I'll always love you no matter what you do.  You don't need to feel ashamed.  Especially now that you are the little sister.\"  I calmed down a bit as he said this, my tears having dried up.  He continued, \"All I want to do is be a good big brother for you.  Just want you to know that whenever something is bothering you, you can talk to me.  It's now my job to make sure you are alright\".  None of this cam across to me as passive aggressive, but rather comforting.<br>\r\nMaybe Melody will end up being a better big brother than I was, but maybe it won't be so bad having someone to look up to for once as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore getting me out of my booster seat, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Melody</span>David asked me whether I wanted to walk (while he held my hand that is) or ride on his shoulders.<br>\r\nWhile I wanted to be able to have some freedom in my mobility after being cooped up in that booster seat, at the same time I really enjoyed that piggy back ride <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Melody</span>David gave me yesterday.</span></div></div>",

While the teenage boy half of my mind wouldn't have found anything special about the Mall, the little girl half couldn't help but find something magical about such a place.  I found myself smiling as these novel sensations reminded me of when I had been a little boy <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Melody's</span>David's age - well my age I guess - strolling around this very Mall with Cassandra while Mom would hold both of our hands.  I even remembered how the both of us would beg Mom to give each of us a piggy back ride - Mom would prevent any arguing between the two of us on who have a piggy back ride from Mom by having us take turns (30 minutes per turn as I recalled).  Maybe this was why I had given into the little girl half of my mind when <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Melody</span>David had offered me a piggy back ride.

She was far from the best, but she always liked to go to the public pool and try to swim for reasons I didn't care much about. Now, hearing that question, I felt like you had to get in a pool. I was so happy, that I hugged my brother's head, and accidentally covered his eyes. <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Melody</span>David said, \"Uh, Melody, I can't really see right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt so happy and mischievous at the moment, that I laughed and said, \"I'll lead ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, that's how I ended up telling my old body where to go, and how many steps to take. Once we made it to the swimsuit aisle, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Melody</span>David took me off his shoulders and put me on the ground. Still happy, I hugged his legs, said thanks like a bunch of times, my brain couldn't count them all, and started looking at all of the choices they had here. I quickly saw one that I knew that I needed to have! Running over to it, I grabbed the swimsuit that was painted to look like it had fish scales, and carried it back to <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Melody</span>David. <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Melody</span>David said, \"That was fast, are you sure you want this one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded really really fast, \"Yes! Yes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Melody</span>David laughed, \"Two yeses, sounds like your sure. Now, let's go pay for it, I'll call mom so she doesn't worry, and we can get you changed at the pool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't what my young brain wanted, \"No! I vanna mear it bow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Melody</span>David said, \"Sure, you can wear it out of the store.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grinned, and then ran off to the changing booths. <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Melody</span>David right behind me. The changing booths of this store were larger than those of other stores because parents would go in with their kids to make sure they actually tried the clothes, or to dress them if they didn't know how. So, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Melody</span>David followed me in. Suddenly, I felt self-conscious as I looked at <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Melody</span>David. He noticed my look and asked, \"What?\" I said, \"You hafta turn 'round.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Melody</span>David did so, with a little grumbling about how that used to be his body, but I was too happy about the swimsuit to care. I quickly undressed, but having never put on anything like this swimsuit, I had a bit of trouble, but I got it! After that, I paraded out of there, eager to show off my new swimsuit. <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Melody</span>David, telling mom about this, was right behind me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we made it to the register, the cashier smiled at me and took the tag off the swimsuit as <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Melody</span>David paid for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what?</span></div></div>",

While the teenage boy half of my mind was still experiencing some discomfort at being strapped so tight, let alone being in a car seat meant for a toddler, the little girl half of my mind seemed to have overcome my any discomfort I would have otherwise felt during the car ride as all I could really think about was how excited I was to go to the pool.  I held Melody's hand as we entered the public pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we had picked a good spot with some shade, I had asked Melody if I could go swim now, \"Hold on Melody, first we need to apply some sunblock - and don't forget about your floaties so that you won't drown\" Melody said.  \"ok.......\" I pouted, though I cheered myself up quickly afterwards.  I let Melody spray the sunblock onto my skin, which felt a little cold as it came in contact with my skin.  Afterwards, I hold up my arms as Melody places the floaties onto my arms.  Being all set, I rushed towards the pool, with Melody following me into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I had never cared much for swimming when I had been in my teenage boy body, Melody's body, much like the piggyback ride, found this to be a novelty.  I could now understand why Melody had always loved going to the pool.  The cold rush of the water soothed my skin from the heat of the sun as I splashed around in the water, and there was something about floating in the water that made me feel like I was practically flying in midair (though the floaties were what were keeping me afloat).  I could forget all the stress of having to be someone else, forget about the fact that I had gone from a teenage boy to a toddler girl, and just let myself have fun and not think about anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time, I decided that I was hungry for a snack (actually I noticed that the ice cream truck had come by), so Melody and I went to the ice cream truck that had come by.  Melody told me to choose something quick and small so that I could get back to the pool afterwards without having any stomach cramps. so I settled for a simple popsicle, as did Melody.<br>\r\nAfter Melody got me the treat, we went back to our spot and sat on the swimming towel, which Melody had bought from the store while he was trying to find a swimsuit, as I continued to suck on the fruity popsicle.

She had been wearing a red two piece bikini, which the teenage boy half of my mind found to fit very well with her dirty blonde hair and figure.<br>\r\n\"I still can't believe that's you in there,\" Laura said, \"it must feel strange having to literally swap places with your little sister\"<br>\r\n\"Ith iz...\" I replied, \"buh I ben gwettin oosest to it aweady\".

She's in the restroom right now so I'm waiting for her, but I noticed you two were here as well so I wanted to say hi\".<br>\r\n\"Doz Bwittny... bnow abot ze pwocejur?\" I nervously asked Laura.

Brittany had just exited the restroom, which was close by anyway, and eagerly wanted to get back in the water.  She had been wearing a cute sky blue one piece.  What she was not expecting was to see her best friend - or rather the body of her best friend right beside Laura.<br>\r\n\"Brittany, there's someone who'd like to talk to you\" Laura said, moving me in front of her, bringing me face to face with Brittany.  \"Stephen and I felt that you would need some more help adjusting to your new life, hence why we told Laura about the swap\" Laura said to me.  I was still frowning, but more nervous than anything.  I didn't like the Laura didn't keep my situation entirely a secret as I had wanted her, but at the same time I could understand her reasoning.  After all if I am to be with people who are my own age, might as well get all the help I can get.<br>\r\n\"H...

I frowned but her response, however she continued, \"But you can be Melody if you want to\".

She then added \" I mean if your little sister doesn't need them anymore then you don't either David\"<br>\r\nThat really stung me<br>\r\n\"Oh that's right\", Amelia continued, \"I forgot, you aren't Melody is now a GROWN UP who can do all sort of things like reading and driving\", she continued ,\" And you, David.  Are just a.  LITTLE. BABY.  GIRL.  Who can't even read or swim without your little floaties\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUD UP!!!!\" I screamed as I teared up.<br>\r\n\"AMELIA!!!\" Mom said in a firm voice, \"You go to your room RIGHT NOW!\"<br>\r\nAmelia pouted a bit and headed to her room (but not before sticking her tongue out at me).<br>\r\nConcerned, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Melody</span>David set me down as both he and Cassandra knelt down to me, trying to comfort me.  After I calmed down a bit, I said \"Itz owkay.  Imma alrite.

I turned towards <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Melody</span>David and told him, \"I men I hav a big bwotha zat woves me no matta wat\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad, with a puzzled look on his face, asked Mom, \"Are you sure that that is David in that body?\"<br>\r\nWhile the question was not asked to me, I responded, \"Zatz bewind me now.\".  I then smiled as I said, \"Imma Mewody.  Ze aw new Mewody\"</span></div></div>",

Everyone else was having meatloaf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just want to see far you've progressed Melody.  With the new life and all that\" Mom answered.  Now that I recall, Gloria had instructed my parents to gather certain data on both me and Melody.  And considering the awkward experience of last night's dinner, Mom was clearly trying to see if my mannerisms would have changed already.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buh itz onwy ben aw daw mommy,  Wie cent Ie hav meat-wof wike evwy wone elz?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, true, but you seem a little more comfortable with your body than I'd thought you'd be by now - also I thought Melody didn't like meatloaf\"<br>\r\nThe teenage half of my mind knew Mom had a point there, and Melody never did like meatloaf (even though she never bothered trying it), but at the same time I found the idea of being someone's guinea pig rather patronizing.  However it didn't matter what my teenage mind thought, for my little girl brain decided not to question anything and simply accept the circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guez zo\" I said to Mom.  Her response seemed to have been a soft kiss on my little forehead before she sat down to join the rest of the family for dinner.<br>\r\nThroughout dinner time, Melody kept commenting how he couldn't believe he had ever disliked meatloaf, while I on the other hand was still struggling to eat the spaghetti with my fork.  Although where as last night I felt awkward, thereby making a scene out of myself, this time I didn't really care that I was struggling with the fork.  I simply ate the spaghetti the best I could, not caring about the mess I was making.  The bib was keeping my swimsuit safe anyway (I didn't want to take off my new swimsuit just yet, so Mom let me wear it at dinner), even if my arms got a little messy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everyone was done with their dinner, and after Mom finished wiping me clean, I ran up to Melody and Cassandra, hugging the latter around the legs.<br>\r\n\"Can wie pway now?\" I asked my siblings<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"isn't it just about your bedtime soon though, Melody?\" Cassandra asked.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nbuh I wanna stai ap wonger\" I said.  Mom, who was nearby, must have decided that it was ok for me to not go by a set bed time just for this one night<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's still the weekend, and since this was Melody's first full day of her new life, I guess it's ok for her to stay up just a little longer\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI began jumping up in joy before coming up to Melody, asking him if he would play with me<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, but only if you change into some pajamas\" he said playfully.  I nodded, even though I wanted to stay in the swimsuit for the rest of the night it only made sense to change into some pajamas, and headed to my room.  Looking through my dressers, I decided on a set of pink pajama shirt and pants with ponies on it.  Meeting up with Melody and Cassandra in the living room, with Amelia not around to bother us, I told them just want I had wanted to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cwan wie watj a moo-vy?\" I asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" Cassandra said, \"which movie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI immediately suggested my favorite movie, \"The Shining\".  Cassandra though seemed a little concerned that that movie would be too scary for little girls.  I however insisted that one, I was not a little girl (that I was just a teenage boy in a little girl's body), two that I wasn't scared of anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Melody\" Melody said, \"I was always scared of that movie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about a different movie, maybe a Disney movie\" Cassandra said.  Melody had always loved those, but I insisted that I was not ol' Melody, that I was a new Melody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing how to convince me, Cassandra looked to Melody, who decided that</span></div></div>",

There I was pouting in my old body's lap, wrapped in its arms, as Cassandra put on the Disney+ app.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the long face Melody?\" Melody asked me<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Itz nat vare\" was all replied, Melody's little girl brain prevented me from articulating my emotions in a specific manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra decided to have Cinderella play.  I was never all that into the Disney animated catalog - well maybe when I was little (back in my old body) but around 12 or 13 everyone at school dismisses the cartoons as kiddy stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, what I found was that I was actually, sort of, kind of enjoying the movie playing before me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Cinderella's torn dress began transforming, I started pointing happily.  \"She luks pwetty\" I said looking up to both Melody and Cassandra.  They seemed to be both smiling at my comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the movie ended with Cinderella and Prince Charming living happily ever after, I was clapping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you like the movie Melody\" Melody asked me<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up at my old face.  \"Yeth, over cus.\"  I was smiling gleefully.  I had seen the movie before, but it felt really good being able to watch it from the perspective of a little kid again.  It gave me the same feeling I had when I was riding up on my old body's shoulders at the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now was that worth pouting about\" Cassandra teased.  I shook my head sideways<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sa wie\"  I replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok\" Cassandra replied.  She rubbed her hand through my hair.  She seemed to be reflecting on something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wat ya zinken?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing\" Cassandra said, \"I'm gonna get ready for bed\".  She left for her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just me and Melody now.  I looked up again, \"Mel - I men Dabid?\" I ask my former little sister inhabiting my old body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's on your mind Melody?\"  He said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wat doz it fweel wike lukin at ya of bodwy?\"  I asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already knew what I looked like\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I men ze swab\" All day I was thinking about how I was going to cope with living in Melody's little body, but only now did it cross my mind what might be going through Melody's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kind of weird I will say\"  Meldoy says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buh ya seem ta be da-win bine\" I reply.  While I was struggling with the swap, Melody seemed to be at ease adjusting to my body and life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just like being big I guess.\"  Even with the brain and body of a 16 year old boy, Melody seemed to have retained his sweet childlike innocence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buh its hada bewin bwig\" I comment<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, there is apparently something called homework I have to do soon but Laura promised that she would help teach me what I need to know for school\" she comments<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buh don yu miz bewin wittle?\"  I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe.  But I like being big\"  Melody's words were very naive, but I couldn't help but smile at her lack of cynicism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could comment further, my little body forces a big yawn out of me.  \"Im tiwad\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too\".  Melody helps me off his lap, placing me gently on the ground.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe both head to the nearest bathroom to brush our teeth.  I had to stand on a stool in order to see over the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I brushed my little teeth, I looked intently at the reflection in the mirror.  Melody's little body copying every one of my motions, still wearing the one piece swimsuit.  I didn't mind it copying me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wondered whether Melody might have been looking at his refection while brushing his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI brushed my teeth the best I could, spitting out the paste.  I swallowed the water from the little cup close to me for rinsing my mouth.  After several seconds of swishing the water in my mouth, I spat it out into the sink almost in sync with Melody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All done?\"  He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a few seconds to take another good look at my reflection.  I nodded before replying \"Okae\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI jumped of the stool, following my old body out the bathroom.  My old body started heading off to my old room, but I stood still watching it.  There was something else I wanted to tell it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh. David??\"  I call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody turns to face me.  I run up to him, hugging one of his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tfank yua fwa swappwin wiz mwe\" I tell Melody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should be thanking you\" he replies<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take a step back and look up at Melody.  \"Itz fwine.

Out of all the things to wear, I chose a cute little pink dress to wear.  After tying my ribbon in my hair, I took a minute to look at myself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was Melody's body looking back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wookin pwettie todah, Mewodie\" I said to the reflection twirling like me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI made my way to the kitchen where Mommy hoisted me up to my table seat.  She already had a bowl of cereal made for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia was there too...  \"Gonna eat your breakfast dork, or is your mommy gonna have to feed you?\" She says, yet another attempt to ridicule me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya no funnwi\" I reply back, sticking my tongue out at Amelia before letting the spoon in Mommy's hand into my mouth.  I stopped letting Amelia bother me for a while now.  I was perfectly comfortable being in my baby sister's body now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr rather I was perfectly comfortable being my baby sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral months had passed since my baby sister, Melody, and I had swapped bodies on that fateful day.  Melody, now David, had proven to be a much better big brother than I had ever been, always eager to play with me and protect me from meanie-heads like Amelia.  While I still see Laura and Stephen when they visit, I had spent more time playing with my new playmate Brittany.  It still feels weird that Laura's little sister is now more mature than me, but she's been kind to me despite knowing that I was once David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast, my now big Cassandra got a call.  I tried to listen the best I could to the conversation, but I could only hear Cassandra's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanging up the phone, Cassandra knelt down to me.  \"Laura and Brittany want us to come over\" she tells me<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buh mah nezt pway dat wif Bwiddani izent taw tomowwag\" I comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they got something important to tell us, or rather show us\" Cassandra replies<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long car ride, David unbuckles me from my booster seat, telling me that we arrived at Laura's place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can ya cawwi mwe?\" I ask David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing Melody\" David answers, holding me carefully as he followed Cassandra to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura answers the door \"YOU CAME!\" She exclaims before letting us in.  For some reason she is acting oddly giddy.  \"Someone would like to meet you Melody\" she tells me as David lets me down.  Laura then tugs on my hand, pulling me upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tu hud\" I yelp, Laura was pulling on me way too hard.  Despite my cries, Laura didn't pull any softer.  What was with her all of a sudden?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura finally lets go of my arm once we arrive in the play room.  Brittany is already sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura pushes me closer to Brittany.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iz tha zomethin impatint ya wanna taw mi?\" I ask Brittany.  She looks down... and seems very timid.  \"Bwittni?\" I ask.  I come up to Brittany, who looks at me finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hhhh... hiiee......\" Brittany sheepishly utters.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrange, Brittany has never acted like this before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thiz gam no fun!\" I pout, trying to get my playmate to stop acting strange.  But then I notice something odd...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a copy of Moby Dick on the floor, right next to Brittany.  It did not belong here, and Brittany wouldn't have been old enough to be able to read it.  And there was only one person I knew who had ever willingly read that book...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned back at Laura, who was watching us with puppy dog eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look back at Brittany, who was nervously fiddling with her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes widened.  \"LAURA?!?!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownstairs, Cassandra explains to me how Laura and Brittany's family had recently been selected for body swap procedure, with tests now more frequent.  Since their parents didn't want anything to do with the swap, and Brittany had already expressed an eagerness to be a big girl like her sister, the family opted to have Laura and Brittany swap bodies.  Leaving poor Laura inside her former little sister's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am so excited about having grown up friends to hang out with!\" Brittany, in Laura's body, exclaims while hugging both David and Cassandra tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meanwhile I'm stuck being little now...\" Laura, in Brittney's body, whines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany kneels down to her former big sister.  \"Ahh don't feel bad 'Brittany'..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't wanna be Brittany!  My name is Laura!\" Laura stomps her foot<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm Laura\" Brittany innocently replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura stomps her foot yet again, unaware of how childish she looks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany tries to hug her former big sister, but the latter pushes her arms away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate you\" Laura says before running up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrittany is speechless, and tearing up at her sister's shocking words.  \"What did I do wrong?...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid is quick to comfort Brittany, and Cassandra tells me to check on Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI go up the stairs at my own pace, where I find Laura in Brittany's room - or well her room now - sulking in the bed sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lauwa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura ignores me<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I naw zat tis is hud fah ya.  I fewt da sam wah wen Mewodi an Ie fizd zwappt budiez\"  I say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still ignores me<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buh I lund ta git uzd ta it\" I continue, \"and I can hewp ya...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura finally acknowledges my presence<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't... actually mean it.. when I told Brittany... i hate her..\" she says between several tears. \"This has just been such a shock to me and I don't know how to deal with it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI come up to her.  \"Ya unt awone at weazt\" I smile at Laura the best I could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura gets up and hugs me back.  \"Well at least we can hang out with each other again\" she tries to tell herself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hug my best friend back.  \"Wanna tawk ta Bwittni?\" I ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura replies..</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Loud beeping noises stir me from my sleep.  Slowly I open my eyes and I bring my attention to the source of the noise, my phone.  Grabbing my phone from the nightstand I shut off the morning alarm.  With that out of the way, I lift myself from the covers, lightly stretching my arms as I let out a yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it only took me a few more seconds to get out of bed, it honestly took me several minutes to choose what to wear; I've become so self-conscious about how I look after being stuck in this body for so long.  I've even been making sure to take my showers at night time just so that I'd have more time in the morning to go through my options in front of the body length mirror in my room.  Back when I was a teenage boy I never gave much thought to what I would wear, and swapping bodies with my then 4 year old sister at least made it where Mom chose the clothes for me.  But after spending the last decade as Melody, I've become more and more like a girl, so here I am in this now 14 year old body struggling to choose between wearing this cute red sundress and wearing a blouse with skinny jeans.  How ironic, I spent 16 years of my life as a typical teenage boy, being into the typical teenage boy hobbies, but 10 years later I've become rather girly in my tastes.  Even picking out what shoes to were has been a hassle for me.  Part of it might by somewhat out of envy of my best friend Brittany (Melody's best friend from before our body swap whom has stayed as my best friend in spite of knowing that I was not the old Melody), who was always one of the more popular girls in school due to her looks.  Guess you could say I was determined to show that I wasn't just 2nd place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally making my decision I put on the red sundress along with some light brown boots.  After several more minutes of fixing my hair.  While as a toddler my hair was only chin length, I now had shoulder-length hair which I usually let flow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I was finally ready, I got up and observed myself for a bit in the body-length mirror, admiring myself while thinking about how long it's been since that fateful day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's already been 10 years since I've swapped bodies with my little sister\" I thought to myself.  Both Cassandra and Melody (in my body and known as David) live their own lives now.  Melody ended up marrying my friend and crush from my old life, Laura, while Cassandra's boyfriend has just recently proposed to her.  Amelia had graduated college and has gone through several boyfriends.  Unlike Cassandra and Melody, Amelia doesn't contact Mom and Dad much really.  That leaves me as the only child left in the house - and on the verge of puberty....  The latter thus far has been a rather awkward thus far ....  I really didn't really want to think much about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't really particularly miss Amelia all that much if I am being honest, having had to share a room with the demon for several years before I was able to get my own room at 6.  However to give her credit, she sort of, kind of, might have been the reason I chose to join the middle school cheerleader squad - though II like to think it was also because Brittany tried out for the squad as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile part of me missed my old life, thus somewhat envious of Melody, I've put that past life behind me for the most part.  I've embraced this new life of mine as Melody - I even think my personality might have drastically changed from then.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again I face the world not as David but as Melody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI head down to the kitchen for breakfast where Mom and Dad greet me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I made myself a bowl of cereal, Mom made sure to remind me about my plans for the day, which was: </span></div></div>",

I sighed with immense relief.<br>\r\n\"LAURA!!!!!!!\" a girl was calling Laura's name.  Brittany had just exited the restroom, which was close by anyway, and eagerly wanted to get back in the water. She had been wearing a cute sky blue one piece. What she was not expecting was to see her best friend right beside Laura.  \"Hi Melody, so glad to see you here\" she greeted me.  However I immediately hid behind Laura, confusing Brittany.  I really did not want to hang out with other little girls, also I was very much jealous that she was able to speak much better than me.  I looked at Brittany from behind Laura's legs, noticing the sad look on the little girl's face.<br>\r\n\"Melody?\" said a confused Brittany.  I did not respond to her, I merely buried my face into Laura's legs.  \"Do you not like me anymore?\" Brittany asked, and from the tone of her voice she seems to be upset.  And to be honest in spite of my hesitation to have any contact with her I actually started to feel very guilty.<br>\r\nLaura sighed and said to Brittany, \"Melody's been a little shy today.  She had to go to the doctor recently, and she was very scared of visiting the doctor.  So she has been a little skiddish.  It's nothing against you Brittany\".  Knowing that I had almost upset Brittany, I peered from behind Laura and nervously apologized to Brittany, who accepted the apology.<br>\r\n\"It's ok Melody.  I hope you feel better soon.  How come you were hiding behind my big sister instead of of your big brother though?\"<br>\r\nLaura, being clever,  came up with a rather convincing lie, \"well you see, I recently offered to be Melody's babysitter so that David can spend more time studying for school\".  She then winked at Melody who was looking at Laura nervously. \"since I have already watched over Melody several times while hanging out with David, she feels safe around me\"  While that last part was dubious, I do recall Laura looking after Melody and playing with her whenever she came over, so it makes sense that she would pretend to be my new babysitter.  What surprised me however was what she said next, \"In fact I'm going to watch over Melody for a bit, so how about you go play with David for a bit\".<br>\r\n\"But mommy and daddy said that you need to watch over me at the pool\" Brittany said.<br>\r\n\"It'll be fine Brittany, it's only going to be for a bit, and besides I trust that my friend David is responsible enough to watch over you.  After all it's not like he hasn't babysat you and Melody before\"  Laura said to her little sister as she moved me in front of her.  I noticed her winking at me as I looked up at her.  \"Now David, you don't mind if I watch over your sister for a bit while you watch over mine, right?\"<br>\r\nMelody nodded, \"Sure, why not.\"<br>\r\nLaura looked down at me and asked if I would like to play with her, at which I nodded.  I was happy that I now had an excuse to hang out with Laura, while Melody was probably pleasantly surprised to be able to spend some time with his old best friend.  I smiled at Laura as she took hold of my hand, leading me into the water.</span></div></div>",

Melody, on the other hand, was bouncing around like she'd been told she might get a pony for Christmas. The only real consolation was that Cassandra seemed to be as surprised as I was that our parents were considering this. She and I just stared at each other as I tried to process the possibility of being four-year-old Melody.

Was there something she knew that could get me out of this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you see David, I'll be taking your place for the swap, you should thank me for being so generous. I'll even promise to hang out with you...\" She eyed me up<br>\r\nand down. \"Once in a while, when I feel like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course me knowing Amelia meant never, or maybe if I was lucky once. I honestly didn't want to hang out with her though. She's not someone I really want to be around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way am I swapping with you Amelia. David's name was picked not yours. Besides I'm sure David wants to be me.\" Cassandra yells Angrily. \"Right David?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't say I want to be you per say, but-\" Cassandra interrupts me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See he wants to be me, so me and David are swapping and that is final. I wouldn't ever trade my life with you in a million years Amelia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah slow down there kids.\" Dad said trying to break the fight up. \"The swap won't occur for about a week you know. You can all think about it until then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah we know dad.\" We all said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So about me taking your place in the swap David...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going upstairs to my room. I don't want to listen to you try to bribe me Amelia.\" I started headed towards my room and turned on the TV. I figured I'd get in a few hours of videogames to get my mind off of all of this. A few minutes into my gaming the door opened and Cassandra sat next to me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how do you feel about this David? Are you weirded out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought about this for a minute. How did I feel? I certainly wasn't happy, but at the same time I really wasn't feeling very worried about it. Even the thought of being a girl wasn't so bad. Though now that I think about it, it was starting to worry me a bit. I quickly paused the game then turned to her. \"I can't really say. How do you feel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at me, a bit of sadness formed in her eyes. \"I'm not to sure I want to swap.\" The sadness quickly faded from her eyes just as fast as it had arrived. \"But I guess it won't be to bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at her, and paused for a second. I could tell she wasn't very happy about this, but what could I do? Its not like I could do anything about it. \"Things won't be so bad, you'll see.\" I smiled at her, hoping to cheer her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I just said, silly.\" She laughed a bit, but it quickly died down. \"Thanks, David. I needed that.\" She hugged me and I hugged her back.</span></div></div>",

Both Cassandra and I passed the time, staring at each other as if to take in who we were about to become. Cassandra and I may have shared a room but we had always disrobed and got dressed either in the bathroom or facing back to back, it was a matter of respect. I was slightly taller than her, but she had similar facial features to my own, we were twins after all. I tried not to imagine what she looked like naked, I would find out for myself soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you two please stop staring at each other and talk to me.\" wearily, mom said. \"This silence is a bit unnerving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, mom.\" turning to her, Cassandra said. \"We're just nervous, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two are not the only ones.\" worry on her face, mom said. \"Although we were assured that this procedure is safe, it's still experimental... any thing could happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slowly nodded, seeing mom's fears. I had my own but it was too late to back out as a young, attractive woman, Gloria Adams, Larry's lab assistant, walked into the room. She had long blond hair, neatly rolled and pinned up into a bun. A long lab coat covered most of her body but I detected the tell tale bump of pregnancy. She walked over to us with a kind smile on her face. \"David, Cassandra, Dr Thomas is ready to see you. This way, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra and I turned to each other and nodded before rising to our feet and followed Gloria out of the waiting area and down a hall to an awaiting elevator. A quick ride to the fifth floor and a few halls later, we were standing inside the laboratory of Dr Larry Thompson. The room looked something out of an old mad scientist movie with two operating tables in the middle of the room with side tables holding syringes, surgical equipment and two vials of a curious blue gel like substance. Standing amongst it all  was a tall middle aged man with grey hair, Dr Larry Thompson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to my lab, David, Cassandra.\" smiling politely, he said. \"I hope you are both feeling well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little anxious and nervous.\" truthfully, I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ditto.\" rubbing one arm, Cassandra said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please believe me, if I did not know your family was in such dire straights, I would not have suggested this.\" serious, Larry said. \"Rest assured that this procedure is safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held up one of the vials for us to see. \"This is called NeuroGen; basically, it regenerates nerves and brain tissue almost instantly where it's used.\" pausing, he added, \"I don't have to tell you that the applications are boundless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... that's cool.\" I said. \"You're saying it can heal any injury almost instantly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right; however, being the one who discovered this substance and developed it, I turned the research of its medical applications to other teams. Gloria and I see a more... revolutionary use for the NuroGen. We know that it can heal brain tissue so we theorized that it can also connect a brain into a body that isn't its own... making body swapping not only possible but a reality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're just going to surgically swap out our brains, using that NeuroGen to heal everything properly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the basic idea but we are only 'swapping out' selected parts of the brain that contain your personality, knowledge and memories. A full transfer will not be necessary as your 'self' is contained within a small portion of the brain. Still, some skills you use automatically such as motor skills, language, driving, and so on will stay with your bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't they be swapped out?\" curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are located too deep within the brain to safely swap out.\" simply, Larry replied. \"It works to your favor as boys and girls do certain things without thinking of it as they have done it all their lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" wincing, Cassandra said. \"Tell me, why can't we be switched back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When used in high doses, as needed for this experiment, the immune system sees it as a threat and develops a resistance to the NeuroGen, taking much longer for it to work.\" frowning, Larry replied. \"True, we could still swap the pieces of your brains back into your rightful bodies but, by the time the NeuroGen heals everything...\" he shook his head. \"You will both suffer from severe brain damage or worse, be killed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a way to bypass the immune system?\" hoping, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not without taking the chance of harming the immune system, leading to worse complications.\" serious, Larry replied. \"We will work on a way but it could take years.\" he sighed. \"This swap, for all purposes, is permanent. This is your last chance to back out, if you so wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we agreed to this and we finish what we start.\" steeling myself, I said. Cassandra nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well.\" nodding, Larry said. \"Gloria and I will leave while you disrobe and change into the robes for the procedure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the two left the room without a word, closing the door behind them. Cassandra and I sighed then we both gave each other a final nod and turned, back to back to disrobe. We were twins so adjusting would not be too difficult, at least I hoped. Within minutes, we were changed and Larry returned moments later with Gloria at her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please lay down onto the operating tables so we may begin.\" politely, he said. \"Make yourselves comfortable while Gloria administers the anesthetic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe did as Larry instructed and made ourselves comfortable before Gloria gentle took my arm and injected me with the anesthetic then did the same to Cassandra. It must have been very strong stuff as I felt myself going numb before the world around me vanished and I fell into darkness...</span></div></div>",

The momentary shock of a cold object touching me forced a low moan to escape my lips. The object was lifted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her heart rate has returned to normal, Larry.\" with relief, a familiar sound said. \"She's starting to come around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"She?\"</i> confused, I thought. then I remembered. <i>Right... the body swap experiment, I'm Cassandra now.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait for her to wake up then run her through the check list, I will do the same with her brother.\" quivering with a certain excitement, Larry's voice replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor's voice had some static in it, suggesting they were talking over an intercom or two way radio. Slowly, I opened my eyes and became aware of a new weight on my chest as I saw Gloria smiling at me. \"Please bear with me for as moment.\" softly, she said. \"We need to ensure nothing was left for chance.\" pausing, the said, \"Sit up, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did so and Gloria asked me to move my arms in a circle then rotate my wrists before flexing each finger and turning my head in various directions. \"Good, your motor skills seem fine so far.\" pleased, she said. \"Please try to stand, I will help you steady yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did so and Gloria ran me through another barrage of physical motions before she began to poke me with a long metal rod that looked a lot like a radio antenna. \"Do you feel this?... this?... this?\" poking me in several places, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I can feel everywhere.\" annoyed, I said. \"Please stop poking me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria gave a low yell of joy and hit an intercom button. \"The first body swap on this end was a complete success!\" excited, she announced. \"We did it, doctor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise on my end, Gloria.\" excited, Larry replied over the speaker. \"We have all just made history!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria gave another happy yell then turned to me. \"I'll leave so you can get dressed.\" smiling she said. \"We'll wait for you in the lab for a little celebration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she left the room and I turned to Cassandra's clothes, neatly folded and ready for me to wear.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was the best thing we could ever agree upon, even though Cassandra never really liked anything too girlie. Once I was fully dressed, including socks and tennis shoes, I looked at myself in the mirror and sighed. \"This is what I am going to look like for the rest of my life.\" whispering, I said. \"At least she, err, I don't have a boyfriend at this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking another look at myself in the mirror, I slowly walked out of the room to find Dr Larry Thompson and his assistant, Gloria waiting for me with Cassandra, now David, standing nervously near by. \"Gloria and I would like to thank you both for making this experiment a complete success.\" excited, Larry said. \"You two have both made medical history!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although your names will be kept a close guarded secret, your stories will be on the front page of every medical journal in the world!\" equally excited, Gloria said. \"Body swapping is now a reality!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Larry popped open a bottle of champagne as Gloria pulled four glasses from a box on a table. \"Please join us in a toast to our to our success.\" pouring the first glass, Larry said. \"After all, your two made it possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me but... are we old enough to drink that?\" wincing slightly, David asked. \"Also, don't you think it's too early after an operation to drink alcohol?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria's smile faltered a little. \"Sorry, David.\" realizing the mistake, she said. \"We got caught up in the excitement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I apologize as well.\" looking guilty, Larry said. \"Do you mind if we toast the two of you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid and I turned to each other then shrugged before turning back to them. \"Please do.\" in unison, we said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarry rose his glass. \"To David and Cassandra Mason.\" smiling, he said. \"The twins who swapped bodies for science.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloria raised her glass in turn. \"Here here!\" smiling, she declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter drinking down the glass of champagne, they hugged each other, cheering.

Again, it only made sense. In what seemed like no time at all, we arrived home where we were approached by the rest of our family. Dad seemed worried while Amelia seemed bemused and Melody seemed confused. \"Dey change?\" trying to understand what she was told earlier, she asked. \"Dey wook da same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI giggled at that then paused, wondering if that reaction came from the body or if I actually did it on my own.

I recognized them as the Harris family, they had moved into the house down the street a few weeks ago.

She had all the curves mom had but I didn't say anything, knowing that it would be rude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone, this is a childhood friend of mine, Maria Harris.\" introducing her, she said. \"She is a pediatrician and was recently transferred to the hospital just outside of town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a pleasure to finally meet all of you.\" kindly, Maria said. \"Your mother told me a lot about you.\" she then turned to her children. \"This is my daughter, Sarah and my son, Mark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah Harris was Amelia's age but almost a foot taller, which I'm surer drove her crazy. She had a firm figure with long black hair and ocean blue eyes. She walked up to me and firmly shook my hand. \"Nice to see you again, Cassandra.\" happily, she said. \"Still breaking the hearts of handsome boys?\" she laughed, seeing me blush as she released me. \"Hey, don't knock it, I'm doing the same. Those guys at school are animals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree.\" flatly, Cassandra said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah turned to him and shook his hand as well. \"Here I thought you were the shy one.\" smiling, she said as she released him. \"Good to see you getting out of your shell.\" she giggled, seeing him blush. \"Now, don't get shy again, I deal enough of that with my 'little' big brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah...\" moaning, Mark said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to Mark; he was rather short for his age of sixteen with short sand blond hair and ocean blue eyes. Now, he was only about an inch shorter than Amelia but I heard that was the tallest he was going to get due to some illness he had as a kid. He gets a little teasing about it at school but they quickly learned not to do anything in front of his little sister, she had no fear of anyone. \"Easy, Mark.\" looking at him, I said. \"I'm sure she didn't mean anything by it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark gave me a shy smile then took a step behind his mom. That was when I remembered him mentioning he had a crush on my sister. \"Good luck, buddy.\" I had told him the last day of school. \"My sister has turned down every boy, so far, who had built up the courage to ask her out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Just great.\"</i> trying not to blush, I thought. <i>\"My first day as a girl and I have already got my first period and now we have a neighbor who has a crush on me.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a little short to be a high school graduate.\" casually, Amelia commented. \"Are you a genius or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra and I both rolled our eyes as Sarah took a protective step forward only Mark smiled slightly. \"No, I'm not a genius but thank you for the compliment.\" softly, he said. \"I'm just short for my age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia was about to say something but noticed Sarah's face harden and smiled. \"I'm full of compliments.\" shrugging, she said. she then looked Mark up and down before adding, \"You know, with the right look, you could really swoon a lot of girls; I see some potential here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark blushed brightly at that, giving me a quick glance, then turned back to Amelia. \"R-Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia nodded. \"Yeah, I do.\" discretely throwing me a grin, she replied. \"I saw you looking at Cassandra...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Mark could respond....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Amelia and Sarah broke away and began to throw each other death stares before mom walked between them. \u201cI will not have any cat fights in this house, understood!?\u201d fiercely, she asked. \u201cShake hands and end this, now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter each giving an angry huff, Sarah and Amelia quickly shook hands the turned their backs to each other while dad pulled me aside with Ms. Harris following. \u201cMay I assume you and your, um, sister were breaking up a fight?\u201d looking at me, he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were all arguing.\u201d Honestly, I replied. \u201cSarah and Amelia got hot under the collar during this and went at each other, we held them back, we kept arguing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad sighed. \u201cI know you and your twin are going through a rough spot right now and Amelia does not help that but I would expect you\u2019ve learned to tune her out by now.\u201d Scolding, he said. \u201cAnyway, Ms Harris has a larger problem and I need your input.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d turning to Ms. Harris, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David, the doctors told me that Mark is giving up.\u201d To my horror, Ms Harris said. \u201cHe\u2019s so depressed, being so small and \u2018unseen\u2019 that he doesn\u2019t want to live anymore. The body swap may change all of that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!?\u201d terrified, I asked.

Once everyone was seated, dad spoke. \"Dr Thompson is looking for more volunteers for his body swap experiments and he will pay handsomely for those who step up.\" calmly, he said. \"However, there is no way to reverse this procedure so, if you decide go through with it, you will be stuck with the body you get for the rest of your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its a huge decision,\" turning to Mark and Sarah, Maria said, \"one that will completely change your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything is better than this body.\" quietly, Mark muttered. \"It's small, weak... broken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you think that, you <i>are</i> a loser.\" crossing her arms, Amelia blurted out. \"You're practically dripping with cuteness and don't even know it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amelia...\" giving her a look of warning, mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark blushed. \"You- You think I'm cute?\" the hint of a smile forming, he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia immediately turned red with embarrassment. \"No! No; that's not what I meant!\" waving her hands, she said. \"I'm not trying to imply that at all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid and I struggled not to giggle but Sarah could not contain herself as she laughed. \"You two do look like you'd make a cute couple.\" teasing, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough, Sarah.\" sternly, Maria said. \"This is serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful with what you say, Amelia.\" firmly, mom said. \"I'm warning you all; don't start anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad cleared his throat, silencing the room. \"Back to the subject at hand,\" politely, he said, \"there are more options other than a body swap to solve Mark's inferiority complex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of options?\" hesitantly, Mark asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I seem to remember Amelia offering to help you gain some social status.\" motioning to his daughter, dad said. \"As you seem to think everything about your life is wrong, her way of helping just may be the answer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, you can't be serious!\" surprised, I protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you do not approve of Amelia's approach to things, David.\" serious, dad said. \"However, I feel it important to explore all options before suggesting the Harris family subject themselves to the body swap procedure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed then turned to Amelia who gave me a smug look as if she had achieved a victory over me. \"Just give me an excuse, sis.\" whispering, I hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom placed a firm hand onto my shoulder then turned to Amelia. \"If Mark accepts your offer to help, I expect you take that task seriously, young lady.\" looking her daughter in the eye, she said. \"Do I make myself clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia looked at mom in surprise.

When we got there, we both had to go through a long series of all kinds of tests.  After what seemed like forever, we ended up in a small waiting room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the doctor came in, he did not look happy. Now I was getting worried! He sat down across from us and said, \"I am sorry Mrs. Harris, Mark, but I am afraid that the two of you are not compatible for a swap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gasped! \"What? How can that be? We are family!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head, \"It is like organ transplants. The donor has to have certain compatible brain traits.\" He looked at mom, \"Mrs. Harris, you have a number of very unique features that make it harder to match. I am sorry, but if we tried to swap the two of you, one or both of you would probably end up a vegetable. There is no way we will risk that. Is there someone else that might want to swap with Mark?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was crying as my mom said, \"No. His sister is absolutely against doing this at all, and she likes her body, so I doubt she would agree. There really is nobody else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't take it, \"There has to be something that you can do! Can't you help me find someone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at me for a while, \"We do have a program that is for people like you, who want to swap at all costs. There are a pool of people that, for some reason do not want to live in their bodies. Some hate who they are. Some hate what they are. Others hate the idea of their future. There are many reasons, but all would rather die than continue as they are. We could go that route, but there are things to be warned about if you should do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom jumped in, \"Absolutely NOT! I won't have my son swapped with a stranger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ignored her, \"What kind of warnings doctor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared at mom, but then continued, \"There are no choices for you. What I mean is, you will be matched up to the best possible donor compatible brain. You could end up a four-year-old girl, or a married mother of three. And that is assuming we can find a match at all.\" He paused, then sighed, \"Also, in this kind of swap, certain aspects of your new life would have to be locked in to help you adjust.\" He paused, \"That means that some things would be, well, overwritten in a way. For instance, you would only know your new name. Also, a role would be enforced. If you ended up as someone's sister, you would consider yourself their sister. The problem is, this is so new that we do not know the full impact of it. For instance, if you end up a wife, it is possible that you will feel whatever the original occupant of that body felt toward your new husband. Or you could be neutral, but still feel obligated to be his wife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom looked at him, \"What? How often has this been done that you don't know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe frowned, \"It hasn't been done yet. All we have is from the swap you already know about. The human brain is a complicated thing. That this works at all is a miracle. We just can't predict anything. All we can be sure of is a stable transfer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom stood up, \"We are leaving! I am not going to permit it! Not only would I be letting my son swap with a stranger, but if I understood you correctly, he could BECOME a stranger! To me and the rest of his family! No way!\" She stormed to the door, and was almost out before she noticed me still sitting there. \"Come on Mark. This was a good thought, but we need to find another way to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head, \"No mom. You don't get it. It is this or nothing. And I do mean nothing, as in nothingness.\" I looked up at her, \"I hate my body, and I hate my life. Mom, I love you, and dad, and Sarah, but that is not enough for me to go on. If you don't let me do this, I promise you that I will be dead by this time tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was stunned, and stumbled to the chair next to me, \"Mark! Don't talk like that! At least try something else first. This can't be undone!\" When all I did was stare at her, she began to cry softly, then, eventually, looked at the doctor, \"Very well. It looks like there is no choice. Can you at least promise me that he will be safe and happy in whatever body he ends up in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor looked at her, \"I can promise that he will be safe. All that I can offer him is a new life. What he does with that life, and if he is happy with it will be up to him. I can promise that all of the applicants are in stable homes though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI held her hand, \"Mom. Thank you. I promise I will always love you. No matter what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom signed the required paperwork, and soon I was led to a small room. Dr Larry Thompson looked at me and said, \"To avoid any trauma over the selection, we are going to put you under. When you wake up, you will have a new life.\" He held up a needle, \"One last time. Are you sure you want to do this. Once I give you this shot, it will be too late to change your mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled and said, \"See you on the other side doc.\" Then I fell asleep. When I woke up, I was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When I woke up, I almost panicked until I remembered that they warned me that I would find myself restrained. Apparently some people had thrashed around and hurt themselves before they had relearned left from right. I heard a woman's voice say, \"Doctor. She is awake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that answered one question. I now had a female body. and that helped me to make sense of some of the sensations I was feeling. I wished I could sit up, and that my eyes were not covered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard the doctor's voice say, \"Kisha. Welcome back. Do you feel pain anywhere?\" Somehow, I was afraid to hear my own voice, so I shook my head no. Kisha? That wasn't my name, but, yes, it was. Then I remembered what else they had told me. I would only remember the name that went with my body. So, that was not the name I had been born with, but it was the name I would die with, since this swap was permanent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went through what they called the re-orientation process. Stimulating my hands and feet. Making me wiggle my fingers and toes. One thing I learned about my new body in this process was that my feet were VERY ticklish! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they finished all of that, the doctor said, \"Now, I want you to say, 'My name is' and tell me your name. Let it just come out. Don't think about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had no choice. I said, \"My name is.\" I stopped, and tried to clear my throat. Then I realized that this was not my voice cracking. This 'was' my voice. I started over, \"My name is Kisha Long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor was pleased, \"Perfect! Now. I will uncover your eyes, in a minute, we will release the restraints and give you some privacy to discover your new body. When we return, we will go through some questions and then give you some answers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey did as they said. I laid still until I hear the door close behind them. I closed my eyes and slipped a hand to my crotch. Wow! Did that ever feel different! I no long had a penis, and what was there was very sensitive! I had to stop myself from going much farther. Then I reached up and cupped my breasts. They felt huge to me at the moment, but something in my memory said they were not huge as breasts went, but average. A... B-cup? I wasn't sure what that meant, but I was sure I would learn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decided to look at my feminine hands, so I opened my eyes and looked held them up. However, what I saw quickly distracted me from just looking at my hands. I guess I should have realized the possibility, but I just hadn't given it much thought. I moved my hands and arms around to look at this unexpected result of the swap. I was had black skin! The thought of chocolate came into my mind, but no, my skin was a good bit darker. Perhaps dark chocolate? I sat up, sliding my legs over the edge of the bed. Long, smooth legs, of equally dark skin were barely covered by the short hospital gown. I ran my hands over my arms and legs and felt the soft smoothness of my now feminine skin. I looked at the palm of my hand, then I stopped and laughed at myself. Some part of me wanted to see if it rubbed off! How silly! I looked again. Now that the initial shock of the change had decreased, I realized something. I liked this color to my skin. I was soft, smooth, and there was a beauty to the depth of the color. It felt very right for some reason. I also learned that I liked the sound of my laugh. Was that vain?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, I got the courage to stand up. The weight of my breasts, the narrow waist, the wider hips, all made me glad I got up slowly. I felt normal, but the center of gravity was different. As soon as I took a couple of steps though, I could walk like this had been the body I grew up with. I was still aware of the difference, but they didn't phase the way I moved. I saw a full-length mirror and walked over to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI intentionally looked down at my feet as I did. I stopped a few feet away from it, then looked up. I gasped. The girl, or, well, young woman, that I saw in the mirror was beautiful! I smiled as I lifted my hand to feel my frizzy hair that surrounded my head like a black a thick wool. Well, that wasn't right. I wasn't sure how to describe it, other than it had so much more life and body than the flat brown hair that I had as a white male. Again, I liked it! The girl in the mirror was beautiful! I wondered why she chose to swap? Well, whatever her reason, I was feeling that I got the better part of the deal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout that time, there was a knock on the door. \"Kisha? May we come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tuned to face that door, and found myself a bit nervous, but said, \"Yes. It is okay.\" I was smiling nervously when they walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about one thing when they walked in though. While was still shorter than the doctor, who was tall, I found that I was taller than the nurse who had helped me in my male body. In my male body, I was a good bit shorter than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor smiled, \"Well Kisha, I must admit, I was worried about your reaction to finding yourself in the body of a black female. It is a big change in more way than one, but you seem to be taking it very well. We will of course need to run you though some tests to make sure that it is not just shock or denial instead of acceptance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled, \"Run your tests doctor. I am fine. I may not be able to fully explain it myself, but what I can tell you is that, for the first time in my life, I am happy with my body. I am more worried about getting used to being female than getting used to the color of my skin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled, \"If that is so, you will be fine. Nurse Williams has your clothing. You may dress behind there, and if you find you need any assistance, she will stay here to help you. When you are dressed, she will bring you to the orientation room where we will tell you more about your new life. We will answer all the questions we can at that point. I will see you soon.\" He turned and left.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dressing was different, but fun. I loved my new body even more when I saw it naked, though seeing breasts and not seeing a penis was going to take some getting used to. I almost asked for some help with the bra, but nurse Williams must have been able to tell from the sounds I was making. I heard her say, \"Kisha. Relax. Don't try to figure out how to put the bra on. Let your body's memory take care of that. Just relax and put it on as though you are sliding on a pair of shoes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought, \"Oh sure!\" But I tried what she said, and before I even knew what had happened, I not only had the bra in place and napped, but was adjusting the straps for comfort! It was a bit of a perverted thrill for the male part of my mind, and a bit more as I slid on my panties. I put the top on, which took a bit more of that 'relaxing' technique to button it up when the buttons were on the wrong side. I was happy that I was given a skirt to wear, though that meant that I had to first deal with pantyhose. I dreaded that part, until I slid them on. Oh my word! They felt so good on my legs! I then slid on the low heels. That worried me a bit, but when I relaxed, I walked out as though I had worn heels all of my life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNurse Williams smiled, \"Wonderful! Let's fix your hair and get some makeup on you. Then we can head over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was so thankful that the body memory seemed to help. The makeup went well after just a couple of missteps. The results though were, well, WOW! I couldn't believe how lucky I was to be so pretty! The hair was another thing though. There would be no more running a quick comb through my hair to get ready. I quickly learned that this kind of hair was harder to deal with by a lot. Especially to get it to look the way I 'knew' I wanted it to look. But body memory and nurse Williams patient coaching eventually got me there, and the result made the effort totally worth the trouble!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt strange walking down the hall in a skirt and feeling a slight bounce to my breasts. I also found myself very aware of how empty my crotch felt. Still, it was great to be taller than nurse Williams!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe went into a room where I was asked to sit across from the doctor. Now I was getting nervous. I was going to learn about my new life. The doctor had made it clear that, while in the long run, I was as free as anyone to determine the direction I wanted to take my life, but for the first few months, I would have to live the life I had been given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor smiled, \"I can tell that, from your looks and the smile on nurse Williams, that you have already passed some important tests. Now just a few questions.\" Sigh. It was more than just a few. But when it was over, the doctor was satisfied that I was adjusting well, and that I was indeed happy with my body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then said, \"Now, the next surprise for you.\" He gently sat a small object on the table in front of me as he said, \"You should know that your full name is Mrs. Kisha Mia Long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked down, this time truly stunned! The object he had set before me was a woman's engagement ring attached to a wedding ring! I... was... married? I just sat there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor made some notes as he smiled gently, \"I can tell that this hit you a bit harder than waking up as a black female. However, it is a part of your new life that you will need to deal with.... Mrs. Long.\" He paused, \"Why don't you slip the ring onto your ring finger now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy hand was actually trembling as I took up the ring. I slid it on, knowing where it went, but this time, I had trouble knowing how to react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor said, \"What is your reaction to that, Mrs. Long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head, \"I, well, um, I, well... a bit stunned for some reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded, \"Why do you think that is? You showed a remarkable acceptance for your other changes. Changes, by the way, that are often harder for people to accept than single or married.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought, \"Well, I guess I wasn't thinking about my new life beyond just me. That is, I suppose I expected to be someone's daughter, that would only be natural. But married? That is sharing my life 'with' someone in a very different, and, um, intimate way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled, \"The fact that you are aware of that is a good sign. You are rightfully nervous. However, your reaction is normal. What you are feeling is basically what a bride would feel on her wedding day.\" Then he grinned, \"Or perhaps, more like what she would be feeling on her wedding night. It is a big step to, as you rightly said, share your life with someone. However, you give me confidence that you will do just fine. Let's go over a little bit of what is now 'your' family history. It might help you let the married part soak in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was regrettably little to learn. Kisha's father left her and her mother when she was only two. She had a hard life as her mother seemed to move from one abusive relationship to another. The doctor suspected that she had been both physically and sexually abused at least once in her life, but she would not admit to that even for the program. When her mother died, Kisha lived homeless for a while, until she found a women's shelter. The found her a job as a waitress, which eventually led to her now being married. What a sad story! I had wondered why the original Kisha would give up such a beautiful body, but perhaps I understood a bit more now. Maybe a different body was the only way she could hope to forget some of her past. That still left one question though. Then why get married? Well, and if she did, why leave that life after less than a year? Was my husband that bad?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if anticipating my question, the doctor stood up. \"Well Mrs. Long, I think that we are ready for the final step. There is someone you need to meet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened, and when I looked, in walked...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I was a bit surprised at my own reaction. On the one hand, it was strange for me to see the man walk in, and my first impressions were, one, he was very handsome! Even sexy! I guess that answered my question about how I would feel about being with a male. The other reaction though was, 'He is white?' I guess that I shouldn't have been surprised. After all, this was a day to break expectations! Then I started to giggle at myself. How silly of me again! After all, in my old body, I had longed to ask out Kelly, a girl who looked very much like I do now. So if I, as a white male, saw nothing wrong with dating a black girl, then why shouldn't I, as a black female, be married to a white man? Of course, the one difference was that, as a male, I had been too shy because of my height to ever get up the courage to ask Kelly for a date. I guess that butterfly in my stomach was part of those wedding nerves the doctor had mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood up and nervously walked over to the man. The doctor said, \"Mrs Kisha. Long. Let me introduce you to your husband, Samuel Thomas Long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was tall. Probably six foot two inches. It was funny. That might have bothered me before, but now, as a female, it was okay for him to be a good bit taller than me, even wearing some heels. As I looked at his equally nervous face, I was drawn into his eyes. He had a very muscular body, but his eyes were so gentle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nervously held out my hand, \"Hello Samuel.\" His hand swallowed mine! I wasn't sure if it was that his hand was so huge, or my hand so small, or a bit of both. However, though I could feel the callouses on his hands, the gentleness in his eyes was expressed in his grip. Firm in body, but soft in spirit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled, \"Just Sam please.\" He hesitated, \"Um, I know these folks say that we are supposed to live together as man and wife, but I want you to know, the decision is yours. I won't force you to be my wife, in spite of what they say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mind was going a zillion directions at once! He was so handsome! But he was a guy! He was so nice! But would he be later? He was so sexy! Did I really want sex? I had dreamed, no, fantasized, about having sex with a girl who had a body like mine. Many times. Only now I would be the one getting laid, so to speak. Did I really want to be this man's sexual fantasy? Did I care? And did I have a choice? Were the feelings in my body attraction, or fear?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't know how long I stood there looking up at him, holding his hand. It must have been long, and as awkward for Sam as it was for me, because eventually, the doctor interrupted, \"Ah-hem!! Listen, nurse Williams will lead the two of you to the break room just off of the lobby. I recommend you talk there a little. If you feel you are okay to go home after that, you don't need to tell us, just leave. However, if either of you feel you want some help, we will have counselors for you. Just let them know at the front desk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam released my hand reluctantly, \"Sure. That sounds like a good idea. Is that okay with you Kisha?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just smiled and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce there, and alone. Sam was the first to speak, \"They told me that your previous body was a white male. This must be overwhelming to you to end up in the body of a black female, and then to find out that you are married to a white man too. I want you to know that, while I hope you will learn to love me, I won't try to stop you if you want to divorce me. I mean, well, if ....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stopped him, \"Please stop. You are too sweet to make a fool of yourself, and I think you were about to. I was always taught that, if I ever got married, I needed to love the person for who they are, not what they looked like. Obviously, you felt that way if you married me, errrr, Kisha. So why should I object?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned, \"Well, I hope I don't scare you by saying, I was at attracted to Kisha on the outside as I was on the inside. And from what I have seen of the new Kisha so far, that is still true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh my word! I didn't know their history, but no wonder Kisha fell in love with this guy! He just told me that he desired my body, but in such a way that not only didn't frighten me, but made we get a strange feeling between my legs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pulled myself out of those feelings quickly... for now. \"I can see why she fell in love with you.Look, I can tell you that, in spite of who and what I was, I am definitely feeling very much like a woman, and for whatever reason, I find you very attractive. As for me being black and you being white, if you don't care, I sure don't! The idea of being a wife though, well, that will take me some getting used to. But if you keep going the way you started, I think it won't take me long to adjust to that too.\" It felt a bit odd to me, but I gave him a peck on the cheek. \"If you think that you can be patient with me, I think I am ready to go 'home'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled as he took my hand and led me to the door. \"I don't need to be patient. I want to get to know you as much as you need to get to know me. And I look forward to learning, well, who Kisha is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn! I am a girl less than four hours and this guy makes me melt already!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sam was always a gentleman to me, and treated me with great care and respect. If I had anything to complain about, it would be that I felt like a fragile, china doll that Sam was afraid might break at any second. I guess I couldn't blame him thought. In spite of his rugged, manly appearance, he was a gentle soul, and whatever the original Kisha's reasons were for wanting the swap, I could see in his eyes that it hurt him deeply. As much as I was sure that he meant what he said, that he would let me leave if I wanted, I could tell that was also his greatest fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we got 'home', Sam showed me around. It was with a strange sense of deja vu that I saw each room. I didn't know this place, but I did. 'We' lived in a large farm house on the edge of a good sized town. It had once been part of a family farm, that had long since been developed. But the four acres the family kept had the old barn and a large workshop still there from his great-grandfather's day. The house was huge, but had a character to it that made me love the place right away. Sam had inherited a share of the property, but since nobody else in the family wanted it, he was able to work hard, and buy it from the others. Now it was his. Well, he insisted that I consider it 'ours'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only awkward moments were when he showed me 'our' bedroom, with the lovey, four-poster bed. *Did I call it lovely?* I blushed in spite of myself, thinking of both what Sam and the original Kisha had done there, and the fact that, if I did stay as his wife, what he and I would be doing there! I was still confused as to whether I was scared or aroused!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam quickly said, \"And before you say anything, I can sleep in the guest room until, um, well, until you are ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was as uncomfortable as me, so I tried to be a bit humorous, \"Ready for what? A wild night warming that mattress up the way you did with Kisha?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe looks that went over his face were many. Anger, fear, hurt, anger, more hurt, \"No! I mean, of course not. I mean, yes, I hope you will eventually want to make love to me, but, well, let's just say that Kisha was never really enthusiastic in bed, so you don't need to feel that you are required to be.\" His face was bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly apologized, \"Oh Sam! I am sorry! I was, well, nervous, and I was trying to lighten things up with a joke, but it was a terrible joke! Please forgive me. You have been so kind to me! I swear I didn't mean to hurt you!\"  I could feel tears forming in my eyes as I said it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at me, at the anguish in my face, and he smiled as his face returned to a more normal shade, \"It is forgiven.\" He gently wiped a tear from my eye, \"Really. When we are done, I will tell you more. At least, what I can understand. Kisha was very, well, complicated.\" He paused and now looked nervous again. \"Um, there is one last room to show you. The clinic said I shouldn't hold anything back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat frightened me. What was so awful about the last room that this big man was almost quaking in fear as he walked up to the door? He opened it and I walked in ready to fend off some kind of attack!  Then I looked around. It was a small room, right across the hall from 'our' bedroom. In it was a beautifully worked, hand-made crib, a matching changing table, shelves, toy chests and dressers. The painting, the duckies and teddy bears on the wall, there was no doubt, this was a nursery! Obviously, Sam had prepared it with great care in hope of a family!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy knees went a little wobbly, and I was thankful that I had stopped just short of a beautiful, wooden rocking chair. I sat down quickly and looked around. Just when thought I was 'beginning' to get used to the thought of being married. Just when I was 'beginning' to think of the idea of sex with a man as a good thing. Now a new reality was in my face. I could get pregnant! It now occurred to me that, if Sam and I had a family, I would be the one bearing the child in my body! I would would be the one going through labor and child-birth! I wasn't aware of it at first, but my one hand went to my abdomen. How did I feel about that? How did I feel about having a new life growing inside of my body? Neither of us spoke for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was speechless until I looked over at Sam. He was as white as a sheet in fear of my reaction. Then I thought of myself and I began to laugh. He looked confused as I laughed more. Finally I said, \"You should see yourself! How white you were!\" Then laughing more, \"But I was lucky this time. If my skin wasn't so dark, I would have been as pale as you! I think I almost was anyhow! You almost scared me white!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked a bit unsure at first, but then finally burst out laughing himself! We both had a good laugh that really did ease the tension both of us were feeling up until then. When it slowed down enough, Sam said, \"Why don't we go down stairs and talk in the living room. I will answer all the questions I can for you.\" Then he looked around and smiled, \"And I won't open this door again, unless you do first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a sweet way to tell me that having children would be up to me! The funny thing is, I don't think I would have understood that before I was female. Even then, somehow, I seemed to really get Sam. It was like I had been married to him for years. Maybe it was what Kisha had felt before the swap?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe both went downstairs more relaxed around each other. We really needed that laugh.</span></div></div>",

He smiled at me, \"There was something about Kisha from the start. She was special in a way that added to her obvious beauty.\" I felt myself blush as he said that since the beauty he referred to was now mine. He went on, \"It wasn't hard for me to fall in love with Kisha. She may not have been as open as I would have liked, but her heart was always tender. To me and anyone in need.\" He sighed, \"Only now am I beginning to understand that part of the reason for that was she must have been searching for something herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed, \"I am not usually impulsive, but when I introduced her to my parents, and they loved her too, I decided to ask her to marry me. In a way, I was surprised that she said 'yes'. We eloped, and I brought her back here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around and sighed, \"At first, things were great. We were happy together.\" He sighed again, \"Then things began to change. Kisha began to withdraw from me. At first, I thought it was because she missed the big city, but when I offered to get a place in the city and move from here, she didn't want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked hurt now, \"I still don't really understand what was going on inside of her head. She wouldn't open up with me. When she saw the information about the chance to swap lives with someone, that was it. Nothing I could say made any difference. She wanted out of this life.\" Now he had some tears in his eyes, \"She swore it was not me, and that she still loved me, but it was also obvious that she wanted away from this life, and I don't know why. If it wasn't me, what was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had been so nice to me, I felt so sorry for him. I found myself getting up and sitting on the arm of the chair next to him. I put my arms around him, which still felt strange as my one breast pressed against his head, \"Do do that to yourself Sam. I may not know exactly what was going through Kisha's head, but I do know this. First, she did love you.\" Some of my memories told me so, but I didn't tell him that part, because I wasn't sure yet just how much effect those memories would have on me. \"And this I also know, because I was like her in this. I hated my life and my body, but not my family. Even now, it is hard for me to put into words that might help you understand, but please believe me when I tell you, it was something inside of her that she couldn't change, just like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave me a hug, which was very awkward for me. At my first chance, I broke free. \"In some ways, I wish I could remember my old address or phone. I would like to try to explain things to my family, or, well, my old family.\"</span></div></div>",

She was about the height that I was now, but her figure made mine look almost boyish! She had what must be D-cup breasts and an hour-glass figure! Her face was incredible, and she had the most piercing blue I I had seen in my life. I actually felt a strange stirring in my crotch looking at her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor said, \"Mrs. Kisha Mia Long, meet your wife, Mrs. Megan Alicia Long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say that I was stunned would have been an understatement! Four hours ago, I was a single, white male. Now I was a married, black, female, and now I find that I am also a lesbian? I couldn't stand up, my legs were too weak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor saw my reaction. \"Megan, why don't you set next to Kisha? We will leave the two of you alone for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they were gone, Megan smiled at me, \"They tell me you were a white male before the swap?\" I could only nod. \"And it bothers you that you are a black woman now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head, \"What? Oh no! I love this body! I think being black is even exciting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan looked downcast, \"Then the problem is either you don't like the idea of being married, or you don't like the thought of being a lesbian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed heart-broken! I could tell I cared for this woman, though as yet, I wasn't sure what that meant. I smiled at her, \"Look. I don't like or dislike the thought. I had gay friends when I was male. Males and females. However, I wasn't gay. This is a lot to take in at once. For all I know, I am gay now, but I am still adjusting to being female and black.\" I sighed, \"Then they told me I was married. I had a hard time wrapping my head around that thinking you would be a man. Then a woman walks in. That adds a whole new layer to this.\" I could tell she was still in distress. It bothered me. \"Look. I am not saying no to you. Do you think you could be patient with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up, \"Do you mean you would be willing to give our relationship a try?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at her, \"Why not?\" I had to laugh, \"I wanted a different life. I can't think of a life more different than this compared to my old life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed encouraged, \"Thank you! As long as you want to try, I can try to be patient.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case, there is not much point in the two of us staying here.\" I said, \"Are you ready to take me home?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>We got to 'our' home. It was a nice place in a suburban neighborhood. Megan showed me around. When we got to the right place, she said, \"This is the guest bedroom. I will sleep here, um, until you are ready.\" We went across the hall, \"This is our room. Well, yours for now. I will need to come in for clothing and such at times, but I promise to knock. Since this is the master bedroom, it has its own full bathroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a great house, and we even had a pool! We finished at the pool. It was a warm day. Megan said, \"I have the day off. Would you like to swim a while?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI always loved swimming! \"Sure! That sounds great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, \"Wonderful! I will show you where your swim suits are while I get mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing I did not think of was that, as a female, there were some major differences in swim wear. Especially, as I soon found out, that I didn't have a single one-piece. All were sexy bikinis! As I sorted through them, regretted saying I wanted to swim, and sounding so enthusiastic about it. Now I was committed. I ended up picking a white bikini with matching top. By relaxing, I knew just how to put it on. It felt very strange, and 'very' exposing! I walked over to a full-length mirror and caught my breath!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gasped and said out loud, \"Damn! I am hot!\" There before me stood one of the most beautiful black women I had ever seen! And she was as sexy as hell! So much so that, looking at her started to give me strange feeling in my pussy, so I turned away. I found a short robe to put on to cover myself up a little. I had already decided to minimize my exposure to Megan by not taking it off until I was ready to get into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI resisted a temptation to play with my new body a little since I was alone, so I headed out to the pool. I still felt incredibly naked under my robe as I walked out. As a guy, I had loved seeing girls in bikinis. Never once did it cross my mind what she felt like wearing one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat I was not ready for was the sight of Megan in a bikini! Her curves were much more defined than mine. My body was a bit more athletic, but Megan was curved in all the right ways! Her large breasts were barely covered, and the bottom was little more than a patch covering her pussy! If I had been a guy, I would have had an erection right then! As it was, I felt a stirring in my pussy, and my nipples tented out! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan smiled, \"I checked. The water is perfect! Ready to go in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI realized that I had been staring! I blushed and said, \"Sure. Lead on.\" But my eyes watched her butt as she made her way down the steps in the pool. I could see Megan watching me as soon as she was in. I was hesitant, \"Um, maybe I am not ready for this yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan looked disappointed, \"Please don't go away. If you like do swim, let me leave. I want you to feel comfortable.\" She started to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stopped her, \"No. Wait.\" I sighed, \"Maybe just don't watch me get in yet?\" She agreed. I felt both embarrassed and sexy as I finally entered the pool. I made sure to quickly reach a deeper section where the water was up to my shoulders.This felt soooo different! As I moved my legs, the water flowed between them in a way that felt very different from my experience as a male. And my breasts felt buoyant. I was tempted to float on my back, but not with Megan right there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard for me to be in water and not actually swim, so eventually, that need overcame my nervousness, and I found myself doing laps. I loved the way my new body moved through the water! It felt very different as I felt the water course over my breasts, and I had to admit that, without a penis in the way, my crotch felt more free, and the movement of my legs seemed more natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I had worked off my tension, I actually swam up to Megan and stood up, breathing just a bit hard. \"This is a great pool! Can I swim any time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, \"Of course! Remember, this is yours as well as mine. So is everything in the house. There is no yours and mine between us, except for a few naturally personal items of course.\" She pulled herself up onto the edge. I couldn't help notice that she sat with her knees slightly apart, which was a bit embarrassing to me since I had a hard time not looking at her crotch, \"You seem like a very good swimmer. It will be nice to see the pool used for more than just a place to cool off. Maybe you can help me learn how to swim better sometime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled. My love of swimming took over again, \"Oh! I would love to do that! Um, I mean, if you really think I can help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, \"You will learn that my swimming ability is mostly enough to keep from drowning if someone pushes me into the deep end, so yes, I am sure that you can help.\" She laughed, and so did I. \"Would you like some lemonade? I brought some out while you were changing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was thirsty! \"Sure!\" I followed her out of the pool, \"Everything is so beautifully kept here. Do you do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed, \"No way! Everything would either be a mess or dead if it was up to me!\" She sighed, \"You see, I am a trust fund baby. I have a dress shop, and it does turn a profit, but it is mostly for something to do. So I hire people to maintain things.\" She motioned, \"Please, have a seat and I will tell you more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat, and I didn't even realize that I had instinctively crossed my legs until much later. Megan told me about her family, and her dress shop, and her side of meeting and falling in love with Kisha. That last part was awkward since that highlighted the fact that she might be in love with me, or the physical me anyhow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, \"As a female, I am going to have to learn a lot about things like fashion. I don't know how much I can rely on Kisha's memory for everything.\" I hesitated, \"Do you think I could help at the dress shop someday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan almost choked laughing, \"Sweetheart! You don't know how much I dreamed of the original Kisha saying that! For one thing, I always wanted it to be a family business. For another thing, minorities are so poorly represented in the fashion industry that we would be a trend setter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled, \"Then, after I get settled into this part of my new life, you will have to show me the shop.\" I tried to look at my arms while not looking like I was looking at my arms. I had actually been so absorbed in the conversation that I had forgotten that I was now black. That was a good thing, since it shouldn't matter. But if it shouldn't matter, why was it good to have a black woman working in a dress shop? It seemed to be a paradox in my mind. Or was I reading too much into it? This was all so new! Being female, being black, and if some of the things I felt looking at Megan were what I thought they were, being a lesbian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan got up and said, \"Are you hungry? I would like to go out to eat, if that is okay with you. Or I can order something delivered. Anything you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I also stood up, it was only then that I had realized that I had been sitting and standing in front of Megan, in my bikini, and did not feel self-conscious, which was good I guess. I thought about it and said...</span></div></div>",

Sarah glared at Amelia, her hands flat on the table as if she was ready to jump on top of it and attack Amelia head on. Fortunately, she kept her cool. \"You better get this right.\" softly, she hissed. \"I don't want my brother getting even more depressed than he already is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Don't worry.\" placing a hand onto Amelia's shoulder, dad said. \"Amelia will turn Mark into a social bug in no time.\" he then slightly tightened his grip, just enough to get her attention as he asked, \"Right, honey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure... no problem.\" forcing a smile, Amelia said. \"I can get started this weekend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The weekend is two days away.\" curious, I pointed out. \"Why start then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia gave me a glare then forced another smile. \"Well, I do need some time to prepare.\" recovering quickly, she said. \"If Mark was a girl, I would already be dragging her to my room.\" she paused then quickly added, \"You can't just jump into these things, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I start?\" looking at Amelia, Mark asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amelia paused to think of a response, I could not help feel sorry for Mark. I really did not socialize with him as he rarely approached anyone to be sociable, he seemed to be more comfortable on his own. Had I known of his depressive state, I might have made an effort to reach him. \"Maybe you can look at his wardrobe, see if there is anything there to work with.\" after a thought, I suggested. \"Its possible his dress clothes are more fashionable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good idea, Cassandra.\" smiling, Amelia said. \"I'd ask you to join me but, well...\" she pointed to Casandra. \"Look at your taste in clothes before your 'identity crisis'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI huffed, trying to control myself as Cassandra did the same. Only Mark looked at us and asked, \"What's wrong with their clothes? They look fine to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Mark.\" standing up, Amelia said. \"How little you understand.\" she motioned to Cassandra. \"David's colors do not match in the slightest, he looks like he was attacked by the dryer in the basement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah held back a reaction giggle, making it look like a sneeze as Cassandra threw Amelia a dagger like glance. \"I will admit I will be tweaking my look but my style is just that, mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are welcome to it, dear brother.\" patting Cassandra on the head, Amelia fired back. \"That and your <i>tiny</i> little circle of friends from school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat angered Cassandra and myself and we were about to speak when dad cut us off. \"Amelia, don't start anything.\" firmly, he warned. \"You have already been told this once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, daddy.\" batting her eyes, Amelia said. \"I guess I better go to Mark's home with him and look at his wardrobe so I know what I have to work with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on ahead, Amelia.\" nodding, mom said. \"Just remember to behave over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll behave.\" rolling up one sleeve, Sarah said. \"I have no doubt about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah, no fights in my home.\" firmly, Maria said. she then turned to Amelia. \"Young lady, if I see you starting a fight under my roof, you will wish your mother was passing the punishment instead of me, understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia turned to mom who gave a firm nod. \"You have my full permission to discipline Amelia as you see fit if she misbehaves, Maria.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have fun over there.\" smiling, I said. \"Keep us posted, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, don't be afraid to ask for help, alright?\" smiling as well, Cassandra added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for having us over, Elizabeth.\" hugging mom, Maria said. \"I'll try to return Amelia in one piece.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra and I held back a snicker as Maria then led her children and a slightly pouting Amelia out the door...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was covered with framed band posters, each with a first single CD! They were all current bands, each the most popular on the radio charts and CD sales! Among them were epic photographic shots of the bands on stage! I found myself fighting the urge to scream. <i>\"Who would have guessed this guy had such an awesome collection?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love photography and music.\" standing behind me, Mark said. \"Because of my small size, I can get the best shots of the bands performing without being noticed by the crowds. The bands love the pictures I take, one group asked me to go on tour with them.\" he then sighed. \"Only I don't get a lot of credit for the photos; just these posters, a few extra shots, and pay for my time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hobnobbing with the hottest bands, getting free stuff!, asked to go on tour!?\"</i> my hart racing, I thought. <i>\"This kid was the coolest boy in school and no one had a clue!

David mouthed, <i>\"What happened?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing my hand onto the receiver, I whispered, \"Sarah and Mark swapped bodies but Mark said they made a mess of things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid winced as I then turned back to the phone to hear Mark, now Sarah, was still crying. \"Mark, get a hold of yourself!\" firmly, I said. \"You are supposed to be a tomboy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that.\" sniffling, Mark said. \"I tried to be one but I just couldn't, no matter how hard I tried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long ago did you swap bodies?\" curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause, as Mark sobbed. \"Two weeks ago.\" finally, he, or rather, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed. <i>\"They both jumped right into it without any preparation or planning.\"</i> frustrated, I thought. <i>\"I can just imagine the mess they are in right now, unable to act like each other.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David, please!\" sobbing, Mark pleaded. \"Help us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Okay.\" quickly, I said. \"Can you come up to the house in an hour? We'll try to help you straighten all of this out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your house?\" calming down a little, Mark asked. \"One hour?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you get here?\" patiently, I pressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll come.\" taking over the phone, Mark's voice said. \"See you in an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the call ended, I sighed, placing the receiver down. \"What a mess...\" muttering, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess, they were not properly prepared when they swapped bodies.\" serious, David said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were not prepared at all.\" annoyed, I replied. \"I'll grant you that no one can really prepare for something like this but we are so much alike...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And they are practically polar opposites.\" sighing, David said. \"I wonder how much trouble they made for themselves in trying to be each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrugged. \"We'll find out in an hour.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I did not notice that she had locked it behind her. She then walked to her nightstand to retrieve a bottle of Mydol from the drawer. \"Take one of these every six hours, as needed.\" handing me the bottle, she instructed. \"Don't take more than four per day or you'll risk making things worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened the bottle and took down one of the pills. \"You said you wanted to discuss something with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed. \"Please look at this through a young woman's eyes, as that is who you now are.\" turning to me, she said. \"Gloria Adams, Dr Thompson's assistant, is getting married next month.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>New Cassandras POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up around 7:30 the next day. I remembered that Laura wanted to spend a lot of time at the mall today, and she was going to be over here soon so I had to start getting ready. I started by throwing on a pair of sweatpants, sports bra, and tee shirt. Then I went to the bathroom to brush my teeth, and once I got there I realized I needed to brush my hair to. After maybe ten minutes or so in the bathroom, I made my way downstairs. As I hit the last step, I heard the door open and saw Laura come in. \"Hey, how's it going?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty good, I guess. Just gotta get some breakfast\" I answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, once your done we'll head upstairs so that we can get you dressed\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" I asked. \"I already got dressed\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry. You look like your still in your pajamas\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still look like you just woke up. We'll have to work on your hair a little bit more, as well as change what your wearing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with this\" I asked gesturing to the clothes I had put on not to long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, if your staying in the house all day. But if your going out and about you have to at a minimum wear a pair of jeans\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\" I said as I got a bowl of cereal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly scarfed it down and followed Laura upstairs to my room. Once we got there, she went straight to my new closet and grabbed a pair of jeans and handed them to me. Once I replaced the sweatpants with them Laura went to work with brushing my hair. She was easily working on it for at least a solid 10 minutes before she decided we were ready to go. I put on a pair of socks and tennis shoes and followed her out to our garage. My mom told us on the way out that she had transferred a couple hundred dollars of the $50,000 we were given into the checking accounts of David and myself, and that Laura and myself could take her car to the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we got there and found a good parking spot Laura and I headed inside. It seemed like she had a very specific store in mind because she seemed like she was on a mission. Once we got there she seemed like a kid in a candy store as she took a look at every rack of clothes, pulling nearly every other thing off to get a better look. Occasionally she'd ask me how I liked this or that, and I could tell I was frustrating her because there wasn't anything I was even giving the time of day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't keep doing this you know\" Laura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't keep ignoring that these are the kinda clothes you gotta wear\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just, I'm not sure I'm ready. And since Cassie was never an overly feminine person I figured I'd just be that way to and keep up appearances\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, Cassie is David now. I don't think he'll mind if you change what he used to wear a little\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess your right. So, what did you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking of a little bet. I'll put together an outfit and if you like it, even just a tiny bit, you take this shopping trip more seriously\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if I don't like it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I stop bugging you about this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. Head on over to the changing rooms and I'll be over there in about 15 minutes or so with something for you to try on\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did as I was told and headed over to the dressing rooms and waited for Laura. I pulled out my phone and played some solitaire while I wanted. It felt like it had been the longest 15 minutes of my life, but eventually Laura came back with a pile of clothes in her arms. \"Here you go\" she said. \"You think you're gonna be alright in there\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll call out for you if I need help\" I said with a smile on my face as I took the clothes from her. Once I entered the changing room and locked the door, I set the clothes on the bench and quickly got undressed down to my sports bra, panties, and socks. The first thing I did was put on a pair of grey skinny jeans, followed by a plain white tee shirt. Then I slid on a pair of black boots that came up a few inches past my ankles. And lastly, a black jacket and grey scarf ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://secure.polyvoreimg.com/cgi/img-set/cid/96497731/id/rsg6zp0W4xGuK9AAFYJoxg/size/y.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://secure.polyvoreimg.com/cgi/img-s...</a> ). I looked in the mirror for a solid minute, before taking the jacket off and looked in the mirror again. The more I looked at this new reflection of mine, the more I realized that wearing clothes like this made Cassie's body look a lot more attractive. I'm not sure if it was that I was looking at it as my body now and not that of my sisters, but there was just something different about how Cassie looked now. And I kinda liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's taking so long\" Laura said. \"I wanna see\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, I unlocked the door, opened it and stepped outside. \"What do you think?\" I asked, a little nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, you look amazing. I mean, you have no idea how long I've been trying to get Cassie to wear anything feminine. And finally seeing it, it's almost like I imagined\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" I replied. \"You know, I can't believe that I'm actually going to say this, but I kinda like this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, so you'll actually try to find some stuff you like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'll actually try to find some clothes here I like\" I said, before pausing for a second. \"I think I'll start by getting this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us had to have spent another 3 hours or so in the store looking at clothes. Laura occasionally pulled something off the rack, suggesting that it would look really good on my or it would go good with something already in my new closet. I agreed with her most of the time, except when she'd talk about something back home. I really didn't know much about what I had back home because I hadn't looked through my clothing options back home. Eventually we headed up to the register to pay for the pile of clothes we were carrying. Just before we got there I spotted a pretty cool sweatshirt, and decided to add it to the pile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the cashier scanned everything, I stood there in a bit of disbelief. Just a few days ago I was a guy who wouldn't have been caught dead looking at any of these clothes. And now, Laura had managed to talk me into buying several different shirts, pants and shorts, and even a few skirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everything was paid for, Laura and I began wondering into and out of various stores inside the mall. Eventually we wondered into a show store, and spent a good while in there. I ended up purchasing a couple pairs of sandals and flats, and even a pair of ankle boots with a medium sized heel to them (Laura was really persuasive).</span></div></div>",

There was nobody around and there were only a few old magazines lying on the table that I already read before. Nevertheless seeing as there was nothing else for me to do, I decided to read them again. It did not however made me stop me thinking about my children. My children who were willing to swap their bodies to help their parents with their own problems. A mortgage which shouldn't even be known to them. I felt terrible about it, the only thought keeping me up was the fact that David and Cassandra were twins which made the swapping process easier for them and for us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only then that I noticed Gloria, Dr. Thomas' assistant standing there looking at me. I immediately stood up as I thought she came to get me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can sit down again Mrs. Mason Dr. Thomas is still busy. And no nothing has gone wrong.\" Gloria said as she sat next to me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it was just that I thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I understand it. You're worried about your children.\" Gloria stated to which I nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope I get the same feelings with this one here.\" Gloria said pointing at her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How far are you?\" I asked interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seven months. I wished the little one would come out already, I can hardly wait for it.\" Gloria said excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seven months? But if I may ask why are you still at work?\" I asked curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because of this major discovery we made. I was just about to go home and stay when we discovered the NeuroGen. It was too good to be true and I just couldn't stay at home and do nothing. I'm not one to sit on the fence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded to her statement. How I wished I went to college and got a job, but sadly that life wasn't meant for me. The thought still haunts me though especially on days when it's all calm and quiet. I would wish I could go out and about and have my own life earning my own money. Not that I hated that Philip was the one bringing in the money, it was just that sometimes I wished I could get something for myself. A nice dress or some high heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me and Dr. Thomas had a talk after Philip talked to your husband. We are looking for another test subject for the experiment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Why ask me? I mean aren't the kids enough?\" I asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The results we would be getting from them would be helpful indeed, however the more research data we the better results we receive. Dr. Thomas is willing to pay you another fifty thousand dollar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifty thousand dollars. With that money we could do so much, it was so tempting to do it. And as an added benefit I would have a new body. But then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean it will not be someone from my family?\" I asked her to which Gloria shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but we have someone picked out already. The question is only if you're agreeing to it.\" Gloria asked looking me straight into her eyes. The offer was too good to be true and besides the person who would be getting my body would get a fifty thousand dollars as well. That meant the money would come to the good of the family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, I'll do it.\" I said with a shaky voice. \"Do I need to go somewhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes just follow me please. I'll show you who you're going to swap with.\" Gloria said leading me to another room. There I saw....</span></div></div>",

Enjoys reading comic books and playing video games on his PS3 (which is set up in his bedroom). He prefers staying indoors, being terrible at sports. Though he is a loner by nature, in high school he started warming up to others, and formed a close circle of friends consisting of himself, his twin sister Cassandra and their friends Stephen Anderson and Laura Clarke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Cassandra Mason</b><br>\r\n<i>16 years old<br>\r\n5'6\" - 125 lbs<br>\r\nHourglass figure - C-cup breasts<br>\r\nShort brown hair - Brown eyes</i><br>\r\nDavid's twin sister, who is very close to him. She is as smart as her brother, but unlike him she actually spends time studying, giving people the illusion that she is much smarter than him. The two of them share a room, many of their hobbies, and even their friends. She is often seen as a tomboy, due to her lack of interest in most \"girly\" topics and because she never wears skirts, high heels, makeup or jewelry (all of which she finds impractical). Despite all this, Cassandra remains a very attractive girls, and is regularly asked out by boys, all of whom she turned down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Amelia Mason</b><br>\r\n<i>14 years old<br>\r\n4'11\" - 95 lbs<br>\r\nPear figure - B-cup breasts<br>\r\nWaist length black hair - Green eyes</i><br>\r\nDavid's younger sister, and the polar opposite of him and Cassandra. She is a very feminine girl, generally preferring dresses and skirts, and never leaving the house without makeup. She is a cheerleader, and spends all her time with her clique, talking about fashion or boys, which has led her to often neglect her studies, sometimes to the point of putting her at risk of failing classes. She despises David, who she views as a nerd, and is jealous of Cassandra's looks, which she thinks are wasted on a tomboy. She often gets frustrated when people suggest that she looks younger than her age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Melody Mason</b><br>\r\n<i>4 years old<br>\r\n3'1\" - 35 lbs<br>\r\nShoulder length black hair - Green eyes</i><br>\r\nAs the youngest in the family, Melody is pretty much what you'd expect from a girl her age. She likes playing dress-up or dolls with her friends and is otherwise sweet and innocent. She speaks with a noticeable lisp, which sometimes makes her hard to understand. Luckily for her older siblings, she is usually polite and calm, and avoids getting in the way. Though Amelia doesn't care much for her and David isn't good with kids, Cassandra often takes time to play with her little sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Phillip Mason</b><br>\r\n<i>45 years old<br>\r\n5'10\" - 190 lbs<br>\r\nShort brown/grey hair - Brown eyes</i><br>\r\nThe father of the family, and a science teacher at the local high school. Despite having lots of experience dealing with teenagers, Phillip often feels that he can't understand his own children. As a result, he tends to be a bit distant from them. He is a calm and rational man, who tries to avoid conflicts whenever possible and always considers the consequences of his actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Elizabeth Mason</b> <i>(born Roberts)</i><br>\r\n<i>42 years old<br>\r\n5'1\" - 125 lbs<br>\r\nPear figure - D-cup breasts<br>\r\nShoulder length black hair - Green eyes</i><br>\r\nThe mother of the family. Raised by very conservative parents who refused to send her to college, she married Phillip at a young age and became a housewife. She later cut contact with her parents, but felt it was too late for her to go back to school. Though she has regrets, she is happy with her current life and proud of the family she has raised. She tends to push her children a little too hard, hoping they'll do better at school, but this method had mixed results.</span></div></div>",

A British immigrant who arrived two years ago, Laura was a perfectly normal girl, except for her exceptional intelligence. Due to constantly getting near perfect scores in tests, she eventually skipped a grade. Unfortunately for her, the other girls labeled her a nerd... and that's who she ended up hanging out with. She quickly learned that her new friends were preferable to the \"in\" crowd, but she often feels disappointed at the lack of femininity in the group, especially in Cassandra.

She's more mature than most girls her age, and is very smart. Being a year older than her two best friends, she's about to start school.

While Phillip would veer towards teaching, Larry became a lead scientist for a major medical company. He used to be married, but got divorced eight years ago. His scientific research led him to create NeuroGen, a substance that would allow surgeons to safely detach and reattach parts of a human brain. While the medical applications are obvious, Larry and his bosses had other ideas they wanted to test...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Gloria Adams</b><br>\r\n<i>26 years old<br>\r\n5'7\" - 140 lbs<br>\r\nHourglass figure - D-cup breasts<br>\r\nWaist length blonde hair - Blue eyes</i><br>\r\nAfter her parents' death when she was fourteen, she went to live with Larry Thomas, a friend of her family.

She met her fianc\u00e9, Kyle Rogers, when she was in college, and is currently seven months pregnant with his child. Despite this, she refuses to take a vacation from her work, as she and Larry have just made a major discovery. Gloria is a beautiful and unashamedly feminine woman.

NeuroGen is a substance capable of regenerating nerve and brain tissue, healing previously permanent injuries in a matter of hours. Applying the gel-like substance can cure paralysis, reconnect amputated limbs and much more. However, these applications were researched by other teams. Dr. Thomas and his assistant Gloria Adams were authorized to pursue another possible use of this miraculous substance: connecting a person's brain to another's body, resulting in a body swap. After a few months of research, they reached a point were human testing was considered safe. The first test subjects were two members of the Mason family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, NeuroGen has a major flaw: it can only be used once on an individual. After the first use, the immune system builds up defences against NeuroGen, and a second dose would be destroyed before it could have any effect. This means the body swapping process is a one way trip. Dr. Thomas nonetheless decided that, even with this problem, body swapping was still worth pursuing, as its world-changing potential was too great to be abandonned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe body swapping process consists of transferring a part of the brain from one body to the next. The transferred part contains personality, memories and most academical knowledge. However, abilities that are used instinctively, such as motor skills and language, stay with the body. For example, a child who swapped into an adult would acquire the ability to read or drive, but would not have access to cultural or scientific knowledge. Meanwhile, the adult in the child's body would retain all of his knowledge, but would no longer be capable of reading or driving a car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you are still confused about the body swapping process used in this story, please send me an email with any questions you may have. I will do my best to answer them.</span></div></div>",
