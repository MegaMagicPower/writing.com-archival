Little had happened that day so she was pretty bored, the only real exciting thing she could think of was that shooting star she saw streaking across the sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings got even more exciting when she realized it was coming down right toward her lawn. Lindsey took cover behind a tree just before the meteorite crashed with a loud BOOM not even five feet from where she\u2019d been lying minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey waited as the dirt finally stopped falling like rain and carefully crept over to investigate. The crater was about a foot deep and at least three times as wide. The meteor was in the center, the last glows of heat from friction had faded revealing what appeared to be something like highly polished silver about twice the size of a fist. Now that the rock had landed, Lindsey needed to think of what to do, but suddenly\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She grabbed a stick near the base of the tree she\u2019d been hiding behind earlier and prodded the substance with it. It took a small push to break the surface of the substance, almost like Jell-O. When nothing happened to the stick, Lindsey tossed the stick away and reached out with her own hand to touch the strange goo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment one of Lindsey\u2019s finger touched it, the goo sprang to life and engulfed Lindsey\u2019s entire hand. Lindsey screamed when it jumped but was too scared to scream again when she saw it growing, oozing up her arm. She tried to wipe it off with her other hand, but the goo only started the same process there too. Within a minute Lindsey was completely surrounded by the semi-transparent goo.

A giant monster? *sigh* I shouldn't have touched that.\" she thought, and ducked to have a better look at the policemen. They were scared, and opened fire. Lindsey was startled, but surprisingly the bullets felt good, making her even a bit aroused (and unknown to her, they made her grow a bit as they were absorbed). The three policement patrols decided to retreat as she began going forward. Lindsey began to feel happy about this as instint and pleasure took over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling her body she could feel her hips and thighs upon the pool of goo. As she brushed her vagina she suddenly felt an incredible wave of pleasure; she had become incredibly sensitive down there.

As soon as her foot touched the ground its surface tension broke and Lindsey\u2019s body splashed down into an enormous puddle. \u2018This isn\u2019t going to be easy.\u2019 Lindsey thought as she concentrated on reforming her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a bit of practice Lindsey was able to keep her new slime body intact, after that she headed downtown.<br>\r\nAs she walked through town, Lindsey came to love her new body more and more.

She looked down and saw that a young woman\u2019s leg was trapped in her own foot. Curious, Lindsey bent down and grabbed the woman and brought her to her face. It was Laura Grace, a girl who used to bully Lindsey back when they were in school. Lindsey smiled, now was the perfect opportunity for revenge, but how?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer came in a sensation Lindsey felt through her whole body. It didn\u2019t take long for Lindsey to figure out it was hunger. \u2018Well, I technically have no stomach so it has to go somewhere.\u2019 Lindsey thought, smiling even more.

However, as she was about to do so she had an idea; just the thought aroused her enough to make her grow a bit. She instead lowered Laura and absorbed her through her crotch. She felt an incredible wave of pleasure as her former bully filled her vagina, and she exploded in growth, doubling in height in few seconds; now most buildings in the city were level with her hips. The growth slowed down as Laura became smaller inside her body, but she still kept growing steadily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she inserted her arm through her crotch to push Laura towards where her stomach used to be she felt an even bigger wave of pleasure which caused an even bigger growth spurt. Her legs made their way through the buildings around as she reached 150 meters in height, leaving the small city's skyline below her knees. Her legs started making their way through the buildings around, enveloping them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought came to her mind as she took out her arm: \"Wow, I just killed a person. That's bad\". But she didn't feel too bad. Though she retained her personality and she still had a conscience, her genetic transformation had altered her view of people, seeing them instinctively as food and toys rather than equals. And not only she was horny, her monstrous instincts urged her to grow bigger and bigger. But her personality prevailed; she wanted to stay this size for now to keep exploring the city like only a giant monster could. If she hadn't taken out her arm she would have grown past the kilometer mark in a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lindsey was so busy with following her primal instincts and continued to pleasure herself a small drop in a different color - a paler blue - trickled from her vagina over her inner thights to the ground. It was far to small to be noticed by the giantess, who moaned louder and louder. At the ground the small drop began to flew. Nobody noticed it, because they all ran in terror from the giant menace and the fact that the drop was pretty small. Only 3 inches \"tall\" Laura fled in terror. Whatever happened to Lindsey, it had infected her too. Her body was out of a pale blue slime and she was an insect compared to her enviroment and even more so compared to the nymphomanic, sex-crazed, now skyscraper-tall bitch Lindsey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll pay for using me as a sex toy... and for transforming me into... this!\", she swore. Under her feet the ground shook, when Lindsey reached another climax, moaning with her booming voice. Laura couldn't help but notice that despite her minuscle size she moved at great speed. \"I have to find out what happened to me!\", she realized. An evil grin appeared on her face, when she realized that she actually knew a person able to help her with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaetitia hid in her basement lab. Horrified she watched the news showing her fellow college student Lindsey, now a gigantic blue slime creature, pleasing herself in the city. Occasionally the giantess stopped to mastrubate and toyed with cars and buildings, most of them lasted only for a short time. \"Extraterrestial... Nothing on earth could have changed her that way\", she muttered. Laetita was brilliant in natural sciences. A fact that had earned her a lot of punishment and social mobbing during back in school. Despite the fact she was a stunningly looking young woman with long bruenette hair, a beautiful face, a pleasant voice long shaped legs, very pronounced female curves and a she has always been a kind and gentle soul, she had became an outsider during this time. Even now at age 21 the tall bruenette with the pale blue eyes was a single and had only few friends. She found it hard to trust people and feared they would make fun of her, so she focused on her scientific work. A familiar voice caught her attention: \"Laetitia?\"<br>\r\nLaura?, she thought. Puzzled she looked around. Her lab was empty. \"Down here, nerd!\", Lauras voice said. In front of her stood her former nemesis, only 3 inches tall and made out of pale blue slime. Before she could say a word Laura told her everything she knew about the changes and commanded her to help her. Laetita grinned and started to examine her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree hours later Laura became more and more imaptient. Occasionally she insulted Laetitia and ordered her to work faster. Laetitia took a last look at her screen and smiled. \"Ok, Laura! Like I suspected the changes to you and Lindsey were caused by an extraterrestrial material. It severly changed your bodies! Lindseys body is able to grow more powerful by absorbing organic material... And I'm quite certain that pleasure is involved in the process too\"<br>\r\nLaura snorted disrespectful:\"I'm so lucky I talk to a genius, who needed hours to ascertain the obvious!\". Suddenly she hesitated: \"Wait you said our bodies, Do you mean I could grow like her too?\"<br>\r\nLaetitia ignored her and continued:\"During your transformation you was exposed to Lindseys bodily fluids, which changed the results of the process.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In which way\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaetitia slowly put Laura on her palm and raised her in front of her face, with a small syringe she injected Laura a fluid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your growth would be triggered in a different way. You should be able to grow by absorbing objects.\" Slowly she eyed Laura. \"The liquid I just gave should enable you to retain a more human and solid appearance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura wasn't listening. In her mind she punished Lindseys and grew and grew. This world would be hers.</span></div></div>",

You really thought I would let a horrible person like you running wild with such powers?\", Laetitia hissed. Waiting for the expected changes she sat down. First she felt nothing, but suddenly a warm wave of pleasure hit her, growing stronger with ever passing second. She gasped, overwhelmed by the sheer intensity of this  sensation. Slowly she unzipped the jeans under her lab-coat and slid two fingers into it. Her thights seemed to burn with heat and every touch send jolts of pleasure through her body. Her fingers brushed her shaved vagina, which was already soaking wet. Laetitia's clothes felt different and she realized that her body began to grow. Suddenly she stopped touching herself and looked down at her chest. Her breasts had swollen to huge proportions. They were at least 28 GG's now. Her jeans was fighting to contain the added size of her hips and butt. The topmost button of her lab-coat lost the struggle against here expanding bosom and was ripped of so her coat and top exposed more and more of her impressive cleavage. The feeling of clothes getting tighter made her just hornier and she began again to please herself. When she came the orgasm triggered a larger growth spurt. Her legs tore the seams of her jeans, which was becoming more and more a short compared to her improving size. Her breasts finished the last buttuns of a former knee-long lab coat, which was now only a strangely cut top for her. The black T-Shirt she wore under the coat was already in ruins and slid two the ground, followed by the small remains of red bra, which had lost it's hopeless struggle against the weight and mass of her breasts minutes ago. Her left index finger felt a twine while she slid it in and out of her moist vagina. Grinning she realized this \"twine\" was her thong, still caught in a heroic struggle against her butt and hips. A small red line vanishing in the depths of her private parts. Finally the growth stopped, which Laetitia commented with an disappointed grunt of protest. She still felt incredible, but it was not the same intensity of pleasure without the growth process. Slowly she took a look around She had smashed large parts of her cellar lab under body and filled large parts of the room. Her proportions had stayed the same, relative to her size her legs had the same length, her improved bust was still a large double G.<br>\r\n\"Time to test my theory\", she muttered and touched the large metal security door with her right hand focused on absorbing it. First happened nothing but suddenly the door glowed in a pale blue light and seem to melt into her hand. Instantly the pleasure waves returned and she grew again. Her \"feeding\" was rewarded with an massive climax and she moaned while her body shot upwards again. With a crunching noise her back maimed the table, pulverising the beakers and experiments on it. She grabbed the massive metal locker, marveling how light it was for her, before she used it to please herself and finally absorbed it, when it became to small for the task. Laetitia filled the whole cellar, her body pressing against the wall and the ceiling. \"Metal, I need metal!\" she thought and continued to absorb and please herself. Climaxes caused growth spurts which hurried the normally constant and slow growth process to short but effective growth spurts. Her head crushed through the floor and she sat up, fondling her breasts with one hand, pleasing herself with the other. Bend down she crashed through the first floor and the second floor wasn't able to contain her shortly after that. Falling plaster bounced harmlessly against her mighty body. \"Bigger! Bigger!\", she moaned, lost in the pleasure of growth. When the second floor ceiling crumbled and revealed the attic she used both hands to massage her enormous breasts. They felt so incredible sensitve. Laetitia moaned loud and decided to speed the growth again by She started to finger herself, and moaned. Her gigantic breasts heaved forceful with her quickening breath, knocking back the furniture in their way. And then, with a sudden giggle of pleasure, she started to grow faster again. Laetitia's head rose closer and closer to the roof, finally pressing against it. It made short work of it. The roof snapped easily, and her bruenette head rose up into the midday sky. She was growing relentlessly bigger, her eyes rising to peer over the roof. This house would not going to contain her much longer. Laetitia's monumental breasts rose above the remains of the roof. Suddenly,she let out a thundering cry of satisfaction and was growing at an even more amazing rate, her head shooting upward into the air! She had freed her hands, which rose up through the roof. Finally, her growth slowed, until finally she stopped, her legs as tall as the whole house. Gently Laetitia lifted one enormous leg - like a pillar to heaven - and climbed out of my house. The sun was rising behind her, bathing the body of the female behemoth in golden light. Leetitia looked magnificent. Then she looked down, peering over her spectacular breasts. \"A whole town to explore and an alien to stop. Where do I start?\" she asked playfully.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Back when Lindsey, Laura, and Laetitia were in high school, Laura had been the queen bee of the school. Blessed with a gorgeous and athletic body, a devious mind, and parental connections, it wasn't hard to manipulate the entire student body, many teachers as well, into giving into her demands. She had loved the feeling of all that power and especially enjoyed the fear she instilled her fellow classmates. She was the queen bitch and everybody knew it. However, that all changed after high school. She had continued on to a local college with the idea that it would similarly easy to take over. But she was wrong. Teachers were no longer cowed by her parents' influence, nerdy students were more comfortable with who they were and did not care what rumors were spread about them, and groups of similar bitches merely laughed and bullied her when she attempted to take control of them. Suffice to say, Laura hated it. But rather than change her ways to try to fit in somewhere, she nurtured her hatred, waiting for the day when she would be given a chance to crawl her way back to the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, with a little help from the idiotic Lindsey and the naive Laetitia, she had her chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Not only will I regain the power I once had, but I will take this world as my own. However, I can't do that at a mere 3 inches tall. First things first, I need to get bigger. This nerd said my growth was different from that giant whore's. While she needs organic things, I merely need objects.</i> She looked around the underground lab at the various instruments Laetitia had collected and smiled evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will do quite nicely\" she said quietly enough so that Laeticia wouldn't hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Laetitia turned to look over her results again, Laura made her move. She ran over to a pen that had been dropped and concentrated on bringing it into her body. To her delight, it worked! The pen seemed to quickly dissolve into slime and fuses with Laura, causing her to grow to 7 inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura wheeled around and, taking advantage of the messy laboratory, started absorbing every object in sight. It was during this process that she realized the nearly orgasmic feeling she received whenever she absorbed something. She couldn't help but moan as she grew bigger and bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaetitia, hearing moans from behind her, turned around and gasped in fright at what she saw. Laura had devoured enough items to make herself around 7 feet tall. She watched as Laura grabbed two chairs and absorbed them, adding another two feet to her height. Laeticia attempted to back away from this new monster quietly. Unfortunately for her, she backed into a bench, scraping it against the floor, which alerted Laura to her presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura smiled as she walked menacingly towards Laeticia, one hand absently fondling her breasts as she did. \"You know, I really must thank you for all your help. This body is quite amazing and your lab has turned out to be a decent appetizer.\" As she said this, she reached her free hand out and grabbed Laeticia by the throat. Her hand was so big, however, that it also covered her mouth. \"Sadly, your usefulness has come to an end. After all, you are the only one who has analyzed me. It would be bad if some sort of serum was made that might ruin plans. You understand, right?\" Her smile just grew bigger as Laeticia's eyes widened as she realized what was about to happen. Laura then lifted the nerdy girl up and slammed her into a cabinet. However, she misjudged her own strength and, to her delightful surprise, went straight through the cabinet AND the wall behind it. Laeticia's mangled corpse fell to the ground in a shower of metal, plaster, and blood. Laura then proceeded to absorbed the cabinet and bench, along with all their contents. This caused a surge in her growth, bringing her to a beastly 23 feet tall, which barely allowed her to fit in the small lab basement, her skin pushing against all the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd now, my ascension truly begins!\u201d screamed Laura as she started absorbing the entire room, causing her to explode with growth. This, in turn, further fueled her growth by letting her absorb the whole house. Instead of being smashed by her growing body, the house seemed to bend at unnatural angles and dissolve into Laura's rising body. \"Bigger! Bigger! I must beat that bitch Lindsey! I must become que- ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!\" The pleasure hit her like a truck. Absorbing the house had become like second nature to her as her entire concentration shifted to pleasuring herself, fondling her incredibly sensitive breasts and shoving her hand into her equally sensitive vagina. Unfortunately, Laeticia had been correct: Laura's growth was different from Lindsey's. Neither organic objects nor simple pleasure could stimulate growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer growth finally slowed to a halt at a noteworthy 120 feet as she finished absorbing the house. With a show of great willpower, Laura stopped pleasuring herself and stood at her full height to admire her new lofty perspective. She chuckled maliciously as she looked around at her new kingdom. \"Yes, this is what I deserve. All this and more shall soon be mine. There is only one obstacle left.\" And with that, she looked around for Lindsey. What she saw nearly broke her resolve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey had become MASSIVE! She had somehow made her way a couple cities over and grown to a terrifying 15 miles of height. Right now she appeared to be asleep and laying in the middle of the city. Laura cursed as she realized just how far she had yet to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it all! I will not let that whore take what should be mine!\" With that said she reached towards two houses next to her to begin her growth process anew.</span></div></div>",

Laura\u2019s impressive former height was six foot two, accompanied by huge double D's and angelic face \u2013hiding her rather mean attitude- with a head a flowing dirty blonde hair and a slender figure, with athletic muscle tone which she had more than once used to \u2018enforce\u2019 her will, whenever manipulation and verbal harassment had failed. Greatly improving her features, especially her curves had been a great method to banish Lindsey from her thoughts first. Moaning as softly as woman of her gigantic size could Laura looked down at her chest. Her breasts had swollen to huge proportions. At her old size, they would have been at least 40FF's now. Gently her right hand explored the added size of her hips and butt. But all her certainty in victory had vanished the moment she had reached the 1 mile mark and been able to examine her gargantuan opponent more thoroughly. Revelling in the pleasure of growth and being too small to fully gauge the leviathan in front of her, she had been unable to see that Lindsey had improved her proportions too. While her breasts had swollen well past any kind of sensible letter scale by now, Laura estimated they would have been at least a large HH-Cup at normal size. And Lindsey was massive beyond comprehension, even for a titaness of Laura\u2019s new size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven resting spread-eagled on her back Lindsey absolutely dwarfed the smaller giantess by far. The mountain range-like wall formed by the succulent orbs known as Lindsey\u2019s breasts overshadowed her opponent, even subtracting the mighty torso supporting them. Having already consumed a whole city and vigorously continuing to absorb, Laura felt increasingly demoralized. She needed a plan to catch up and equalise Lindsey's almost unbeatable advantage. Fully aware, she needed to hurry, because an awakened Lindsey would quickly ruin all her plans, Laura searched for a solution. Lightning fast she lashed out, catching several carelessly approaching news-helicopters, unwilling to pass a chance on unexpected \u2018fuel\u2019 for extra growth, while her feet processed the outer suburbs of the neighbouring city of her already-vanished hometown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm!\u201d she moaned, when she was rewarded with increased tingling, the pleasure this brought caused black curtains to creep in at the edge of Laura\u2019s vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing is as rewarding as good old vehicles!\u201d she cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n In an instant she got an idea how she could seriously bolster her growth. Eventually the entire world\u2019s largest compactor facility was only two cities away. She vividly remembered the news, announcing how many square miles of space had already been filled with the densely compacted scrap and how many miles it would cover, if still uncompressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEagerly she abandoned the city at her feet and headed southwards. At her height it was quite easy to spot the enormous site of her targeted facility. The company operating the site used two adjacent valleys as junkyards, where the scrap was stored, the compactors placed in an enormous facility on a large ridge between them. Well, large by human standards, Laura smiled. With two large strides she closed in and placed her feet next to the valleys and slowly lowered her luscious butt. Squatting down she engulfed the facility with the glistening folds of her womanhood, instantly starting absorb the massive walls and machinery. Almost simultaneously she moved her feet into the valleys and their almost unlimited supply of high-density materials. With a cracked cry of delight Laura once again began to grow at an incredible rate...surging upwards, swelling larger, while her body quivered with an earthquake of pleasure.<br>\r\n Quickly she doubled in height, tripled and was approaching four miles now, her pale blue butt now covered the entire areal on the ridge. <br>\r\nIn all that time Laura had only a single moan, one that started soft and low, grew, deepened, became a shriek. Unable to hold back any longer the titaness reached her huge hand down toward her crotch and started to finger herself with renewed vigour, her other hand caressing her enormous breasts.<br>\r\n After this it became difficult to pick out any individual event, to find any kind of continuity. Reality was just a shifting series of slide show images. Laura\u2019s juices were pouring out all over the ridge. She gasped, gulping down huge mouthfuls of oxygen. Laura felt herself pulsing, streaming out, coming again and again. This time the speed of her growth matched her pleasure, but she still craved for more relief. The pressure of unrestrained building-up lust still rose. Just when Laura thought she might actually even die if this went on much longer, the end came. Using two fingers of her right hand, she pressed savage hard against her g-spot. The pressure built\u2026 and built\u2026 and built...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hit the twelve mile mark \u2026 thirteen\u2026 fourteen\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, she came.<br>\r\n</div></span></div></div>",

Be sure you keep hidden.\u201d Lindsey said before she oozed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny was good at keeping hidden, she\u2019d been a popular bully target and learned how best to keep from being noticed. She looked around searching for the right girl. \u201cThis should be simple. Find a girl, take her back to the meeting place with me, make her a slime and see who she wants to serve.\u201d She said to herself. Admittedly it would be nice if the new slime-girl did want to serve her, but I would be pretty cool if Lindsey was \u201cin control\u201d. Soon enough, Jenny spotted a perfect candidate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey went elsewhere for her \u201ctest\u201d. She remembered how the dew and Jenny\u2019s clothes made her grow, although the growth was barely noticeable. She needed something bigger and/or more nutritious to see if she\u2019d really grow. Her search was cut sort. As she went through another alley next to a very tall building, she happened to be where a man had jumped from the top floor, attempting to commit suicide. Lindsey instinctively liquidized as she was hit and her body enveloped the jumper. \u2018Oh, what a happy coincidence.\u2019 She thought as she felt the man dissolve in her body. She felt amazing as the nutrients coursed through her body, she felt so good she almost had an orgasm. The growth felt just as good. As the man she engulfed was digested, his mass and volume were added to Lindsey\u2019s, making her grow to about 9 feet tall if she kept her human form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey was the first back to the alley she and Jenny agreed to meet in. Jenny returned not too long after, dragging along a terrified looking girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLin!? You\u2019ve grown!\u201d Jenny exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I have. I\u2019ll tell you about it in a bit. Who\u2019s that?\u201d Lindsey asked looking at Jenny\u2019s captive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Michelle Williams. She doesn\u2019t really know us and we don\u2019t really know her, so I thought she\u2019d be the best one to help us determine an answer.\u201d Jenny replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA good choice. Well don\u2019t mind me; you\u2019d better get on with it.\u201d Lindsey replied, stepping back to give Jenny room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny did what she remembered Lindsey doing. She kissed Michelle and absorbed her clothes. Michelle\u2019s terrified expression quickly changed into one of pleasure as Jenny fed her arm into her pussy. With a quick scream and a release of sexual juices, Michelle collapsed into a puddle of blue slime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey looked at her friend, she didn\u2019t seem to grow like she had. Jenny had both Michelle\u2019s cloths and cum to grow with, but they didn\u2019t seem to do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was amazing.\u201d Jenny said breathlessly as she sat near Michelle\u2019s puddle, \u201cSo, how did you grow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I grew some, very little, from the dew on the grass this morning. And I bit more from your clothes. But I grew the most when a man jumped into me.\u201d Lindsey explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo I look any different?\u201d Jenny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid not. It\u2019s probably because I touched the original space-slime thing.\u201d Lindsey replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh well. You can\u2019t win \u2018em all.\u201d Jenny sighed, \u201cOh hey, Michelle\u2019s waking up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Michelle, how\u2019s it going?\u201d Jenny asked as Michelle sat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cF-fine I think.\u201d Michelle replied, poking at her new blue body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, now you can help satisfy our curiosity.

Similar for the men, if we make them our food source and eat them all we\u2019ll starve.\u201d Jenny said over the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoo, that is a problem\u2026\u201d Lindsey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. At first I thought it might be a plot so that she could keep her boyfriend, but after thinking about it, she\u2019s got a point.\u201d Jenny replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, so I guess we\u2019ll just have to limit ourselves. Leave like the kids and maybe like 2 out of every 5 adults, of each sex, alone. If you run into Michelle on the way here, tell her she can keep her boyfriend. It would be good to keep the girls happy. If you don\u2019t run into her, I\u2019ll tell her. Did you take care of your place?\u201d Lindsey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, just finished before I called you. My little bro was pretty tasty.\u201d Jenny giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, see you later.\u201d Lindsey said before turning off the phone and returning it to it\u2019s base.</span></div></div>",

Weren\u2019t expecting this when you got home did you?\u201d Lindsey giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened, how did you get like this? Is there something I can do to get you back to normal?\u201d Helen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll explain how this happened later. If there is a way to get back to normal I don\u2019t want to know what it is. Right now, there\u2019s something I need to do.\u201d Lindsey replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuch as?\u201d Helen asked, suddenly feeling nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, since you\u2019re going to be part of it I may as well fill you in. Earlier this morning I changed Jenny, you know my best friend, into a slime-girl. And a little while later she changed Michelle into one, she\u2019s that shy Latino girl we always parked behind when you used to drop me off at school. Anyway, the three of us decided we liked being like this, so to keep safe we decided to make sure our families didn\u2019t notice we were missing, and as time went on we\u2019d spread our good feelings.\u201d Lindsey explained, nudging her mother closer with her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened to your dad?\u201d Helen asked, her expression was both fearful and angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though she was bigger now, seeing her mother even slightly angry still unnerved Lindsey. \u201cUh\u2026 um\u2026 I\u2019ll explain about Dad later. As for right now-\u201d she said quickly before grabbing her mother and enveloping her in her slimy body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be alright Mom. I\u2019m not digesting you or anything like that. I\u2019m just changing you into a slime-girl like I did with Jenny. Well not the same way I did with Jenny, but I doubt that\u2019s a problem.\u201d Lindsey said comfortingly, not letting it show that her mother\u2019s kicks and struggles were arousing her. She smiled warmly as she felt her mom\u2019s clothes dissolve into her and as she felt her mother\u2019s body change into slime. Carefully Lindsey brought her mom\u2019s new dark green body from hers and set her mom gently on the couch to rest. \u201cNow all there is to do is wait for the girls.\u201d Lindsey said to herself as she lay down to wait.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lindsey picked up the phone and answered the incoming call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sweetie!\" the voice on the other end of the call exclaimed; it was Lindsey's mother calling in to check in with her family. \"I just wanted to call and let you guys know that I'll be out at my sales conference for another two days. It turns out that I sold the most products on the convention floor yesterday, and now I get to stay at the hotel for free for another two nights, courtesy of the corporate office!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Mom, that's great!\" Lindsey lied. In her head, Lindsey was infuriated that her plan to transform her mother into a fellow slimegirl was delayed by another two days; in two days, her new race would advance so much further with Lindsey as their queen! \"So, you're sure you'll be back then? We really miss you, Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, thanks honey!\" Lindsey's mother responded. \"I miss you guys too. Don't worry, I'll be back before you know it! Tell your dad the same too, alright, pumpkin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure Mom, I'll give him the message.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Linds! Love you! See you in two days!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK! Bye, Mom!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Lindsey hung up the phone, ending the call with her mother. Immediately afterwards, Lindsey picked up the phone once again and called Jenny's home phone number. After Lindsey heard three dial tones, Jenny picked up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi! This is Jenny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny, it's me, Lindsey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Your Majesty!\" Jenny joked. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just calling to let you know that my mom won't be transformed for another two days. Hopefully, this doesn't slow down our progress at all. I still wish to proceed at our current pace, even though my end of this part of the plan isn't completed yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do know that you're calling the shots, right, Queen Lindsey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...Queen Lindsey...I'm liking the sound of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to hear, my queen.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Michelle's surviving family looked at their ruler, gooey eyes wide and shiny. A couple of their mouths gaped as they followed her movements. Limdsey felt that she would have blushed had she still had any pigment. Wanting to fulfill the proper role of a host she went to her fridge. Stooping down, she peered inside and began to take out all the packaged food her family had frozen. Placing the frozen pile on the counter, she sliced open a pack of bacon, four chicken breasts, a couple of steaks, and a package of sausages. Lindsey smiled at her slimes, who beamed at the attention,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's some food, I don't think it matters if we cook it anymore,\" Lindsey said. The eight or so relatives crowded around the kitchen table, stroking the streaks Lindsey's hands had left on the food. After a minute they began to place the cuts of meat inside where they quickly broke down. Just as the last chicken fizzed out of existence in an aunt a knock came at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delivery!\" A voice called from outside the door. Lindsey bounded for the front of the house, grinning at Jenny's introduction. She yanked open the door. Waiting on the doorstep was not Jenny, but a pizza man. He looked up at the tall slime girl, mouth open, pizza on the ground, arms straight out at his sides. His mouth opened and closed quickly while slight choking sounds came out of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-um, I have a delivery for Jenny?\" He managed to squeak out, edging away from Lindsey. Just as he started to bolt Lindsey snagged him by the arm and pulled him inside. She slammed the door, hoping it would muffle some of the screaming. She pinned him down as he tried to get out of her grasp, her fingers rapidly burning through the uniform and leaving angry red marks on his skin. After a second's thought, Lindsey decided she had one option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry buddy,\" Lindsey said. Then she leaned forward, completely enveloping the man. His screams gargled out of existence as she filled his mouth and covered him. Lindsey moaned as she stood up, stepping clumsily down the hallway. She stopped a few feet from the door and fell back against the wall, opposite the full-length mirror on a closet door. Inside her, she watched the delivery guy thrash as she digested the poor soul. Much of his clothes were gone, and layers of skin were starting to burn off. The sight took her breath away and she slid down the wall, barely able to keep her human shape. Her fingers teased her labia, jolting her body. Lindsey didn't have to go much farther, watching her victim die inside her was all the gratification she needed. It was hard to tell if he drowned first or simply died from the pain of being dissolved, but after four minutes the red cloud inside her was recognizable only by the skeleton. Lindsey still lay collapsed on the floor, panting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother knock at the door. Lindsey was almost too lost to notice, but then it came again. She rose to her feet, narrowly avoiding splashing her head on the ceiling. At her new height she barely fit in the hallways, the rooms would be far too low for her. She looked briefly out through the windows above the door, and confirmed this time that it was Jenny. Lindsey opened the door for her friend, who was greeted by a view of Lindsey's stomach, the last bits of a skull dissolving within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you received my appetizer your majesty,\" Jenny said, smiling broadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was so mean! He had no idea what was happening. I feel bad, Jenny. Why'd you do that?\" Lindsey said, ushering her friend inside. Jenny frowned slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad? So did you not want all these guys to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I was kidding. But seriously, he looked so shocked. Who'd you get?\" Lindsey asked, gently poking the last few bone stubs floating inside her. Jenny grinned up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three of your ex's, one of mine, and two random guys off the street,\" Lindsey reported, counting them off on her fingers. \"They're in the back of this van I borrowed,\" Lindsey gestured to a small commercial van parked on Lindsey's driveway. \"Where do you want them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring them in and put them downstairs, they won't be bored for too long,\" Lindsey said, waving her hand dismissively. She looked briefly outside to make sure no one was around. Then she ducked outside and opened the rear door of the van. Five people cowered before the slime girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny, I thought you said there were six!\" Lindsey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. I got a little hungry on the way back. Only one random guy, my bad. Now come on, out of the van my little morsels.\" Jenny reached in and began pulling them out. Lindsey helped usher them inside, already hungry at the prospect of her feast.</span></div></div>",

The more immediate threat was the four yellow figures that had surrounded the table, and now trying to surround her.  Lindsey sobbed, \"Where am I? What do you want with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pinging sound came from a sound speaker in the wall, catching the attention of the yellow figures, as well as Lindsey.  \"Young lady, you were found at your residence with extremely high levels of radiation.

The two orderlies claim that there is nothing visible, but Doctor Von Shout assures you that there are better ways to confirm it.  Bringing in an electric microscope, he examines your arm again under varying magnifications.  Doctor Von Shout announces, \u201cIt appears that the young miss was able to see what cannot be seen with the human eye.  With an x100 magnification, it does appear that the parasitic goo is moving around in her veins, possibly using her cardiovascular system to reach all parts of her body in a record amount of time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the observation deck, a big shot voice called out, \u201cAre you saying that she is completely infected with that space bug?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt appears that the goo is well with her system.  This could also explain her eye-sight; the goo has potential to enhance the host\u2019s body in various ways.  The height enhancements, the vision improvements\u2014these are just the beginning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf this is bug is inside her, then she needs to undergo further exams, and she needs to be quarantined\u2014to prevent contamination of any more humans.\u201d  The official voice from the general catches the attention of everyone in both the laboratory room and the observational deck.  \u201cFor the safety of everyone, strap her down, and sedate her.  Run the tests you need to isolate the goo, and extract it.  If you can remove it, we can let her get back to her life.  However, if not, we will need to take her to more isolated facilities to perform more specific analysis on the purposes of the space bug.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, what are you saying?\u201d Your head turned towards the orderlies, only to realize that they each had one of your arms pinned to the table.  As the restraints were closed around your wrists, you tried to move off of the table.  Pumping your feet against the table, you tried to break the metal restraints, but the restraints defy your pull.  The orderlies strap your ankles to the table, and you lift your upper body into a slanted position with your elbows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am sorry, my dear miss, but if we don\u2019t do as the general says, he may call in the bio-contamination \u2018death squad\u2019 just to eradicate you and your little gooey friends.  At least this way, you have a better chance of staying in one piece,\u201d the yellow suited doctor moved towards you, holding out a needle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf that needle got to your skin, you knew it was over.  End of story.  Bucking against the restraints, you lean as far away from the doctor as you possibly can.  \u201cNo, you can\u2019t do this to me!  Stop!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone hears the clothing on your shoulder tear apart.  A column of green space goo appears from the skin of your shoulder, and bends as a wave towards the figure of the doctor.  Forming a blade-like appearance, the goo lashes out, catching the doctor off-guard.  The slime splits the needle in two pieces, just above the doctor\u2019s grip.  As he stumbles backwards with his worthless tube, the goo, with the appearance of a geyser and the movements of a cobra, slides back towards your stomach.  While it does not lash out at anyone else, it does not appear to grow or diminish in size.  From the observational booth, the general\u2019s voice shouts, \u201cWhat is that thing?  Restrain her now!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slime column faces your arm and you look down at it as well.  With your goop-enhanced hawk vision, you see that your skin cells are oozing of the slime, in a lighter green-yellow color.  The gooey droplets collect together, and even more ooze out of your pores.  You realize that it may be at least a minute before anyone sees that the arm is being coated in a thickening cast of the gooey substance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green space geyser from your shoulder perks up, and reforms itself into a blunt hammer.  It lunges out, catching an orderly in the chest, and sending the person sailing into the wall.  The orderly slumps against the wall, and this distraction was all the time that the goo needed to complete its cocoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor and analyst shout out, and point at your arm.  Your arm, human just seconds ago, is now coated from the elbow down in green-yellow slime.  It starts at a paper thin layer, changing your skin from Caucasian to Yellow, but the gooey cast grows to thicker and thicker proportions, covering up the restraint, and blurring the appearance of your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking from your left to your right, you see that both of your arms are now covered in the thick goo, making it appear as if you have rolled-up sleeping bags wrapped around your lower arms.  Within the cast, you try to move your arm, and you raise both of the casts off of the table, to the surprise and horror of the doctors and the observers above.  Lying back down on the table, you can see that the cast is slowly moving up your arms, shifting from below your elbow, and moving the cast to your upper arm.  Your fingers are exposed at the bottom, and the doctor tries to take photos of your transformation from a safe distance.  The fingers are almost five times bigger than they were before, and the palm of your hand is big enough to wrap around the whole human chest.  The cast has shifted visibly to your upper arms now, and you feel a mixture of muscle and bone growth, causing spasms of pain.  You arch your back, and scream out now, as the upper arm enhancements seem to cause much more pain than the hand and lower arm adjustments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is going on down there, doctor?!  What is that thing doing to the victim?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor Von Shout struggles between taking video recordings, measurement observations, and explaining what he believes the space slime is doing.  He cries out, \u201cIt is enhancing her growth rate.  From the overall 4 inches of growth from first exposure to now, the goo is manipulating her growth rate to x5 the proportional size of the human body. The goo produced a nutrient rich environment from itself, to enhance the development of her body for self-preservation.  As a result, she is suffering from both sudden growth plate changes in her bones and the stretching and development of her muscle tissues.  The fact that she has stayed in one piece is remarkable.\u201d  The doctor continues to take photos of the slime\u2019s progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the slimy substance had produced casts around both of your feet now.  The casts allowed the feet to float in a bubble-tube of goop.  You don\u2019t feel the restraints around your ankles.  For kicks, you roll off the table, and drop to the floor.  The goo flattens out around your feet, before it thickens again and covers over your feet.  Before too long, the goo shifts up your thighs and exposes your feet and ankles.  The same expansion rate occurred down below, and you feel the same strained expansion rush through the muscles in your thighs.  Your legs are aching, and you sit back on the table. \u201cOh, that really burns,\u201d you groan.  You flex your fingers and your toes, feeling the sensation of the floor, all tingling with the mix of open nerves and fresh skin.  Out of the corner of your eye, you notice the pieces of metal sticking out of the table where the restraints had been.  Looking at your hands, you see full bracelets of metal sticking out of your expanded skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor Von Shout waves his arms at you.  \u201cMiss Lindsey, you need to lie down on the table.\u201d  He approaches you with his hands empty, and you look at him.  A trickle of sweat glistens behind the mask of his suit, something that makes you aware that he is frightened of your bond with the space goo.  With one of your new muscular hands, you reach out and engulf his body in your fist.  Lifting him up off the floor, you bring him up to your face and scream \u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She just hopped from her cute 5'4\" to pretty 5'10\" in a matter of seconds. Her clothes prove she has grown by at least an inch or two. In disbelief she looks down at herself and slides her hands across her body to check if everything is on it's right position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is this possible?\" she asks to herself looking at herself. Her eyes wander from her improved body to her new necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you do this?\" she asks it without expecting an answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey waits 15 minutes for it to see if it does something. But instead of feeling another spurt, she just waits for nothing. \"Are you really that incalculable?\" she asks it. After waiting another 10 minutes without any results, she decides to go to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn some comfortable clothes, which are now tighter than before, she lays down in bed. She hasn't put away the necklace tho. Because it's tiny and mostly just flat metal she decided to wear it over night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA late time she inspects her body and the necklace, still waiting for another spurt. Disappointed she lays back and tries to sleep in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a really calm moment she feels her body being tingly again. Her feet crawl out under her blanket and her sleeves crawl up her arms. The panties she wears dig into her hips while she takes more and more space of the bed. She sits up as she already stops to grow. Again she grew about 6 inches to now 6'4\". She looks down at herself realizing her top being stretched to it limits and if she moves to fast her panties will just explode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is awesome. Please do it again!\" Lindsey begs the necklace. But again it doesn't seem to show any reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause she can't control the necklace she just gives up and decides to go to sleep again and interact with it tomorrow. Because it's really uncomfortable she strips of her panties and changes to baggy shorts, which are not so baggy anymore and feel more like extended somewhat comfortable panties. She leaves her top on because she doesn't want to also change that. It seems to hold some of her movement, so she doesn't worry anymore about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey lays down in bed again and....</span></div></div>",

Lindsey walked over to her closet and put on her pajamas, which was a simply red tank top and black short-shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stretched her body for a little bit before hoping onto the bed. Before she laid down, she examined the space necklace once more. A smile crept on her face, excited to show her new accessory to everyone. Her excitement kept her up longer than she expected, but she eventually fell asleep. Little did she know, the necklace began to emit a purple aura from the jewel while she slept...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey woke up groggily as she sat up and stretched her arms. She felt some weight on her neck and looked down for at the necklace. She then remembered what happened last night and it caused her to get an extra spring to her 'step' as she jumped out of her bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she stood up, she stretched her arms once more time. Her hands suddenly came into contact with something. Lindsey looked up and saw that her hands were touching the ceiling. Her fingers barely touched it, but she was able to. Lindsey's eyes widened in shock as she ran over to her full body mirror to look at herself. She was surprised to see that, from the same spot she was posing last night, she could no longer see her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god....I grew!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey took a few steps back to see herself entirely. She was now 2 foot taller than before, placing her around the 7 foot mark. Lindsey immediately concluded to one thing: It was the space jewel. It caused her to grow some-how.</span></div></div>",

She tried to budge it a few times, then tried desperately to take it off. She was throwing a panic tantrum, crashing into objects in her room as she tried to take it off. For whatever reason, she couldn't lift it. It dangled in the front with the jewel, but the backside felt like it was attached to her. She tried pulling the backside, but couldn't. Some-how, the necklace was was attached to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lindsey! What was that sound?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey stopped in her tracks at the voice of her mother.

As she cleared 12 feet and still going, Lindsey began to feel a pleasurable sensation. It wasn't a strong one, but it did serve to ease her tension and worry to a degree as she grew past 14 feet in height. She moaned softly, \"Oh...this actually feels nice... Why was I thinking I wanted shrink back down to normal again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey sat on the floor of her bedroom, it creaking slightly over her increasing weight as she continued to grow. The growing girl wasn't so lost in the relaxing sensation to realize she was running out of room, and so climbed out of her bedroom window, landing on the ground below even as she grew past 17 feet. She stretched and stood up straight now that she didn't need to worry about going through her ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe amulet's glow and the sensation faded once Lindsey had grown to about 20 feet tall. She was amazed at her surroundings, but also confused. While she still didn't remember why exactly she wanted to shrink back to her original size, she still remembered wanting to. \"I wonder why I grew when I was wanting to shrink back down to normal? I guess this only goes in one direction, then. I suppose that I can only grow up from here. Oh well! A girl could get used to growing bigger!\" she thought aloud. Lindsey also realized that for some reason, despite having just gotten up a little while ago and not having eaten anything yet...she wasn't hungry. Nor was she thirsty for that matter. Still, she could still go for a snack or something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, another thought came into her head. Well, two actually. The first was that she wanted to grow even bigger. And indeed, she could do that at any time. The second thought was what else the necklace could do? Sure, her pajamas were comfortable and all, but it would also be nice to be able to switch for something else in her wardrobe and have it fit her just like the pajamas were doing. And a pajama-clad giantess didn't sound as appealing as say a giantess clad only in her bra and panties, or in a bikini to Lindsey. Finally, she comes to a decision as to what to do now.</span></div></div>",

All the hours she spend on the gym gave her a body to die for and now, at 20 ft tall, she had the biggest and sexiest frame on the planet and she would show that to the world the proper way. <i>I can't just be wearing these old clothes anymore, i just can't.</i> Said Lindsey as she tried to figure out how her Necklace works. She knows that it can affect clothing, she has grow 20 feet and her top and pants aren't even tight but can she grow fabric without wearing it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt her new height, going back to her house was tricky at best. she couldn't pass through the door anymore and there was barely enough room for her to move from room to room, Searching for options on the closet was not going to be an easy task, as if her huge pair of Hands wasn't enough, her way to the closet was obstructed by the bed in the middle. Lindsey put her arm through the window frame and carefully tried to reach the closet. She put aside the bed as gently as she could, but her new strength make way too much force than needed and the bed was slammed it against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Fuck, my bed</i>\" though the Giantess as she quickly took the hand out, witnessing the disaster that was her bed. \"<i>well, i can see the closet at least</i>\", said Lindsey, this time she took the closet and pull it out of the room as carefully as she could and put it on the grass. She took a brief moment to contemplate her closet, at her size, it wasn't as small as a dollhouse furniture but sure it was close. Lindsey sat on the floor and took out the drawers from the closet, placing all her best bathing suits on the floor. <i>\"Now, what i should wear\"</i>, she wondered to herself while she took out all of her favorite bikinis and examinate them. it was a big collection, most of the were give it to her for free and even modeled herself. they were two of the that she like it the most. The first one was a green Bikini with a camouflage style. The second one, and arguably more fitting to her current situation, was a leopard style Bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"look at this\"</i> She gigled as she took the Leopard bikini and look at it, <i>\"i mind as well use this one and call me Giganta\"</i> she laugh and smiled at the idea,after all, wouldn't that be fun?, going around the city, smashing buildings and stomping cars like Giganta. She reached to the military bikini and though to herself <i>\"maybe i should take this one instead and take things carefully, maybe just a walk through the City, showing off, gave a huge show\"</i> Maybe not as amusing as, say, going Godzilla on the town but at least she won't get any trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"But what if it doesn't work\"</i> she though at loud <i>\"i'm not going to ruin these suits if something happens, i should test it first\"</i> Lindsey search through her stuff something she won't miss, she finds some old shirts she doesn't use anymore and take it as close to her necklace as she can. <i>\"Ok...here goes nothing\" </i>said Lindsey as she grabs one of the shirts with one hand and the necklace with the other, as close to each other as she can. She close her eyes, took a deep breath, and just like she did to grow herself, she pictures the shirt in her hands growing to fit her new size. Lindsey feels a warm sensation coming from the shirt, as if she had taken it off the ironing board. Next, she felt the fabric growing on her hand to the desired size \"YES, it works\" said with a smile of excitement on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the sun rising on the horizon, it was a matter of time before the neighbors wake up. Lindsey was feeling like a child with a new toy, It was time to show off her new form, but the big question was, What to do, and what Bikini shoulw wear.</div></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lindsey, now tall enough to reach into her bedroom window, pressed her side against the clapboard siding of her house and stuck an arm through the window frame. She couldn't see what she was doing, but she had a general idea of where everything should be. Her fingers stubbed against her bed, eliciting a small curse, and knocked over a chair before finally  finding the soft fabrics in her closet. She grabbed the whole pile, hoping something suitable was contained within. Dropping them onto the grass at her feet, she tried to separate out the mundane clothes from those suiting a giantess. She finally settled on her bikini, white with electric blue patterns on it, black panties with red lace on them and a matching bra, or a slightly less used orange tank top with a nicer pair of pajama-type shorts. Wondering just how she should go about enlarging her new clothes, Lindsey took another look at the amulet. The gem sparkled hypnotically, and seemed to radiate a purple light into the air around it. On a whim, she grabbed the bikini from the ground and pressed it against the stone. Her fingers grew hot through the swimsuit and she thought it must be working. After a moment, the heat became uncomfortable and Lindsey smelled burning plastic. Drawing her hand back she saw she had accomplished nothing but burning a hole right through the bikini bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No way I can wear that now,' she thought. Roughly, she moved on to the underwear. This time she only brought it within the purple haze surrounding the amulet. The air around the clothing seemed to get thicker, and the light more concentrated. Lindsey was already considering where she'd go first to show off when a sharp electric shock stabbed her fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch!\" She shook her hand, pressing her fingertips against her lips. The underwear was completely gone, but Lindsey was only paying attention to whether or not she had singed her fingers. The saliva on her hands felt cool in the morning air, but after a moment she realized that her fingers weren't the only part of her feeling chilly. She looked down and shrieked loudly enough to be heard from blocks away, and rapidly sank to a sitting position. She scooted her bare back against the wall of her house and tried to cover herself with her arms. The amulet had not only vaporized the clothes she'd tried to grow, but also the pajamas she'd had on. And now, with the neighbors waking up and curious about the sudden noise, Lindsey was a 20 foot tall giantess completely naked and trapped outside. She pulled her knees up to her chest, her facing glowing with embarrassment. One hand covering her exposed womanhood and the other being nervously chewed on, she thought of her next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lindsey, was that you?\" A voice from below asked, as the door to her left creaked open. The downstairs neighbor, a salesman a few years older than herself, stumbled onto the pavement still in a morning daze. He looked up at the giant girl on the lawn, his eyes slowly widening in comprehension as hers filled with panic. Her hand swept down from her mouth, and Lindsey swore she was only trying to push him back inside before he could see her naked. Her much bigger hand struck with a much greater force than intended, and she lifted him bodily from the ground with almost no effort. With a wet thump, she had misjudged his position in relation to the door, she slammed him against the wall. Lindsey felt things break inside him. She couldn't move her hand off him, she didn't want to see what had happened. But next door, lights had flicked on. She felt something warm and wet and stick on her fingers, and the man in her hand didn't seem to be moving at all.</span></div></div>",

As she stretches and turns around she repeatedly thinks something could be better. She touches the necklace as she looks right into the mirror and says to herself: \"I wish I could be bigger, so it fits my outfit perfectly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stops speaking her necklace starts glowing. Suddenly a feeling flows through her body which is kinda tingly but also pleasuring. Her arms push out of her shirts sleeves and her legs extend out of her baggy pants. Her bra is put under pressure as her C-cup boobs push against it as well as her pants start tighten on her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs sudden as her necklace started glowing, it stops glowing and the sensational feeling leaves Lindsey's body. Party pleasured and shocked at the same time she looks at the mirror and yelps quietly as she only see her boobs at the top of her mirror instead of her head. Her pants transformed into Yoga pants that reveal everything below her knees and her top has become kind of a tight croptop that is hardly trying to keep her boobs and bra in. The necklace however didn't change. It's still as big compared to her as she found it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...grew.\" She says speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at her mirror crouching still not believing what happened. To be sure it really happened as she thinks she says: \"I wish I was twice as tall.\" The necklace glows again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer whole body rumbles before she starts growing again. Her panties now started to push into her flesh aggressively. Suddenly she hears a short snap and her bra falls of under her boobs but are still touching them because they can't fall through her tight top. But as she grows and grows taller her shirts cannot take on her size anymore and gets teared apart. Her pants only rip apart on her side but stay on her body for a surprisingly long time. Even when she stops growing they still hold on to her massive hips and legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey wants to stand up while she covers her boobs with the remains of her shirt but hits the ceiling that forces her to sit down. She grew from her original 5'6\" to 7'4\" and now stands tall at 14'8\". Impressed, excited and pleasured she looks down at herself and seems enjoying her new size. But the tightness of her clothes and he naked torso makes her a little embarrassed. She touches her necklace thinking about her clothes growing as well. Suddenly her leftover pants and panties start loosening. They now grow on her demand as well. But they stop growing at the point they become comfortable yoga pants. It doesn't feel and look bad for her. Lindsey grabs a shirt and also thinks about it growing. The childish looking top grows in her hand until it would fit her perfectly but also look good on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is awesome. I wonder what else I can do with it. Let's see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey looks out of her window spotting a woman waiting at the bus stop. A well dressed woman with a little skimpy outfit for work. Lindsey smiles and thinks of the woman growing. Just as she desires the woman starts growing. The growth is mostly unnoticed by her until her kneesocks start tearing apart. She drops her phone and freaks out as her clothes become tighter by any second. Just as her top bursts open because of her bust pushing against her button shirt, Lindsey stops growing her. She gave her about a foot of size which should be enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrified the woman picks up her phone and runs home because of the strange incident. Meanwhile Lindsey laughs amused while giving her another slow growth spurt. The woman notices her slow growth and runs away quicker until she is out of Lindsey's sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey thinks about changing back to her first extra size and dwindles down in size quickly. This time her clothes change size with her. She is a bit tired by everything and lays down in her bed. Because of her new size she has to bend her legs a bit in order to fit in her bed entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she falls asleep she thinks of many possibilities she could do with her space jewelry that makes her change size of everything. As she thinks about everything she looks down at her boobs and imagines them as insane F-cups. Her shirt rises while thinks of it and ends up covering two gorgeous little mountains. Lindsey can't describe her joy and falls asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other day Lindsey notices...</span></div></div>",

It's skin was a very pale blue/green.  It's eyes glowed a bright white, even though they remained partly closed.  It looked injured, it's clothes burnt and tattered.  I had hair that resembled human hair, except it was a shade of blue.  It had no ears...at least none that Lindsey could see.  It's eyes were very slanted, almost like taking the shape of human eyes, and twisting them 45 degrees, the insides going down.  They were much bigger eyes though, and shaped like a cross between a circle and a square, except that they flared out on the ends like a human eye would.  Her nose was small, but her lips were full, a slightly darker shade than her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alien looked up at Lindsey, and was startled.  It tried to inch away from her, in fear, but clutched herself in in pain.  She had only 2 fingers and a thumb, but that didn't look like it was caused by the crash.

Like that old movie.\u201d Lindsey muttered fearfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I resent that you automatically assume that I\u2019m a parasite!</i> The alien said angrily, <i>Our connection is mutually beneficial. I survive in your environment, we both have access to the other\u2019s minds and intellect, and you come closer to your species ideal image.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey looked at her body and saw what the alien said was true. Her breasts were about half a size bigger, her body was more fit and toned, and she was a few inches taller. \u201cOh wow, this is\u2026 incredible. But where are you, uh; what\u2019s your name?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The closest translation of my name into your language is Naryt\u00edss.

For example here the composition of your planet\u2019s atmosphere combined with the frequency of your sun\u2019s light waves would have caused my flesh to dissolve; fortunately it was nighttime when I crashed so the rays reflected by your moon were vastly less damaging. A few day in you and I\u2019ll be healthier than I\u2019ve ever been in my life. But I digress, it would seem that your species and mine are on a similar evolutionary path, making it simple to form a bond.

The alien knew of another side effect of their bond that she kept hidden from her host. The nourishment she would absorb would cause her to grow, and in turn would cause Lindsey to grow to accommodate her. But Narytiss knew a way to suppress the growth for a time; if she calculated everything correctly it would be enough time to find a way to get a new body. And then, the fun would begin.</span></div></div>",

For example here the composition of your planet\u2019s atmosphere combined with the frequency of your sun\u2019s light waves would have caused my flesh to dissolve; fortunately it was nighttime when I crashed so the rays reflected by your moon were vastly less damaging. A few day in you and I\u2019ll be healthier than I\u2019ve ever been in my life. But I digress, it would seem that your species and mine are on a similar evolutionary path, making it simple to form a bond. And it would seem that the waste materials in our respective bloodstreams are beneficial to the other. You\u2019re the perfect environment for me.\u201d Narytiss explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, so you\u2019re saying that the stuff that\u2019s bad in your blood is good stuff for my blood?\u201d Lindsey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is correct.\u201d Narytiss said before Lindsey felt another mind probe, \u201cA few weeks together and you\u2019d have the body of one of your super-models and be one of the healthiest being on your planet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey was quite keen on that idea. \u201cWell, I guess we can do this symbiosis thing for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Lindsey didn\u2019t know was what Narytiss had planned. The alien knew of another side effect of their bond that she kept hidden from her host. The nourishment she would absorb would cause her to grow, and in turn would cause Lindsey to grow to accommodate her. But Narytiss knew a way to surpress the growth for a time; if she calculated everything correctly it would be enough time to find a way to bring control over the human\u2019s body.

Her old bras were now useless, too small to cover her new bust. Her pants were difficult to pull up over her new, full, hips and ass; and were always tight on her when they were on. She stepped to the mirror to brush her hair, and lost balance, not use to be 6'3\". \"Nary...how long are you gonna stay in me...I mean, I like my new body and all, but I'm starting to get a little bit too big here...\" Lindsey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarytiss, inside Lindsey's body, had grown to 3 times her original size. Her body had fused with much of Lindsey's, but Lindsey didn't know this yet. \"Oh, just another day or so. I gotta make sure I'm fully healed.\" She said. Narytiss, though, was really trying to hijack Lindsey's body completely, and today was the day. Narytiss had been waiting patiently for Lindsey to leave her house and head somewhere private, but she was taking her sweet time. <i>Suck it up Nary, you need just a few more hours to ensure success. Besides, the wait makes the rewards that much sweeter</i>.  Narytiss thought to herself, making sure her mind was blocked from Lindsey\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey went out to the mall that morning to look for clothes that fit her better and to show her body off. She\u2019d come to enjoy the lust-filled stares of men, the envious glares of women, and both from the occasional lesbian over the past few weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The shopping center\u2026 not quite what I had in mind</i>. Narytiss thought, Lindsey\u2019s trip was unexpected, but Narytiss always prided herself in being flexible in her plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later Lindsey was washing her hands at the sink in the ladies room, Narytiss couldn\u2019t use everything, and was the only one there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It\u2019s show time.</i> Narytiss thought excitedly, and began taking control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey gasped. Narytiss did too. \"Nary...what...what are you doing...\" Lindsey asked grabbing the sink to keep herself steady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop... resisting...\" Narytiss said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...what? Stop it!\" Lindsey said, feeling Narytiss' thoughts fill her mind. \"What are you doing, stop, I'm already too tall!\" Lindsey as her height inched upward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey and Narytiss suddenly both had access to Lindsey's senses. Lindsey looked down, and was shocked, seeing the skin of Narytiss' skin color overtaking hers. Lindsey looked up in the mirror, and watched her eyes start to glow a light green (a combination of Lindsey's green eyes, and Narytiss' glowing white eyes. Lindsey watched as her body continued to inch upward. Lindsey's hair lengthened down her body, and had streaks of both Narytiss' hair color, and Lindsey's. Her clothes felt ready to burst and fall to the ground as Lindsey passed 6'7\" in height. \"Nary, what's going on!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey's facial features slowly began to shift into Narytiss', her body altered and shifted. The transformation stopped. Lindsey was still mostly human, except with bluish green skin color, glowing green eyes fill with bioluminescence. Her ears were slightly pointer, and her body stopped growing at 6'10, at least for now. Then her muscles seized, releasing her grip on the sink and forcing her to the tiled floor where she blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short while later Lindsey\u2019s eyes opened but Lindsey wasn\u2019t the one opening them. \u201cI was hoping you\u2019d put up more challenge than that.\u201d Narytiss said with Lindsey\u2019s mouth. Lindsey could see through her own eyes and felt her mouth move, and felt her muscles moving as her changed body stood up, but nothing moved when she wanted it to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What\u2019s happening, why can\u2019t I- YOU! You bitch! I trusted you, and in return you take my body from me?!</i> Lindsey thought, unable to say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, pretty much. In all truthfulness I\u2019ve done a bit of lying to you since I landed. Your atmosphere isn\u2019t harmful to me or my species, and despite what it seemed I didn\u2019t come here by accident.\u201d Narytiss replied verbally, as though to mock Lindsey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why are you here then?</i> Lindsey asked timidly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarytiss smiled, \u201cI was sent here, by the queen of my planet no less, as\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Humanity isn\u2019t going to bow down to tiny things like you!</i> She thought triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoever said we all would be tiny?\u201d Narytiss asked.

Now you\u2019re probably thinking \u2018A few of you in human bodies won\u2019t do much good\u2019 right?\u201d Narytiss giggled, knowing what Lindsey was really thinking, \u201cIf so you\u2019d be wrong. One thing I never told you was that our bond would cause the both of us to grow to, oh about 100 feet or so, using your measurements. With a few more like me, conquering your world will be quite simple.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A hundred-!

The small flash of pain from breaking the ceiling disappeared quickly as the pleasurable tingling grew strong as Narytiss grew bigger. Lindsey heard the screams of people seeing Narytiss grow, and felt Narytiss\u2019 cruel pleasure of hear those screams. Within minutes Narytiss stood at the 100 feet she promised. \u201cYour world looks quite different from up here, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Narytiss giggled.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Satisfied that she now totally controls Lindsey's body, Narytiss decides to take a walk in the countryside. Before leaving she remembers to pick up the now very tiny bag of clothing that Lindsey had bought that day. She knows that without food from her home world she can't maintain her current height for very long. Not that she would tell Lindsey about this weakness. So once she's out of sight of everyone, Narytiss starts allowing Lindsey's body to return to its previous size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey really liked being a giantess so when Narytiss said, \"It's time I returned to your former size.\" Lindsey panics. She thinks that Narytiss will completely return to her original height and fairly flat chest when Lindsey first found her a few weeks ago. She doesn't realize that Narytiss meant her recent height of 6' 3\", not her original height over a foot shorter. So as their blended body shrinks Lindsey starts chanting to herself over and over EVERYTHING FOUR INCHES BIGGER. She figures that being almost 5' 6\" tall wouldn't be all that short and if anybody asks her how come she's suddenly a foot shorter Lindsey would say (with Narytiss permission) that she grew so fast, she popped. Which would probably get some interesting expressions from her friends or others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Narytiss a much longer time to shrink her NEW body then it did for her to grow. Because Lindsey was already taller than over 99.9% of women Narytiss doesn't realize that instead of being 6' 3\" tall, Lindsey's body is now 6' 7\" and her 40D bust was now a 44F. Trying to put on some of the clothes that Lindsey had purchased quickly became an exercise in futility that Narytiss couldn't understand. She had seen that everything Lindsey had purchased earlier had fit her even though some of it WAS fairly tight, so she figures that that should still be the case. Lindsey's sub-conscious had found a back door out of Narytiss total mind control. Unfortunately for Lindsey's sake, it would only work when Narytiss was really focused on changing the size and/or shape of Lindsey's body which would not be very often. So until the fleet arrived and Narytiss decides to again become 100 feet or so tall, Lindsey will be going along for the ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She went several miles from the town to a field of tall grasses. She set the device down and pushed a button on it before leaping onto a small platform on top of it. Lindsey watched through Narytiss\u2019 eyes as all the grass within six feet of the device was instantly incinerated, she would have screamed if she was able to.<br>\r\n \u201cYeah, our military engineers never quite grasped the concept of subtlety.\u201d Narytiss said noticing Lindsey\u2019s shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarytiss stepped down from the device and pressed another button on it and a red light started flashing on it. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not going to explode.\u201d Narytiss said, sensing Lindsey\u2019s apprehension. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes passed before three beeps came from the device. \u201cAh, excellent. They\u2019ve got the location.\u201d Narytiss said almost merrily as she turned the device off and picked it up. Several minutes passed by with nothing happening, but then the craft appeared and landed in the cleared area the device made. The ship was about as big as a coffin, but if Lindsey remembered correctly how big Narytiss was when she landed there could be several aliens in it. In fact there were twelve of them, all females like Narytiss and dressed similar to her when she landed, minus the shreds and tears in the suits; they exited the craft and lined up side-by-side in military precision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c[Welcome to our next conquest ladies.]\u201d Narytiss said in a strange alien language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c[It is good to be back in action with you Commander.]\u201d one of the aliens replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c[Love the new body Commander, a very fine specimen.]\u201d another said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I probably can understand what they\u2019re saying through Narytiss\u2019 mind\u2026</i> Lindsey thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c[Many thanks Sergeant, however, many of this girl\u2019s assets have been improved since I bonded with her. I\u2019m sure you all have read my report.]\u201d Narytiss said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c[We have. Even the queen herself has taken interest in this.]\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c[An interest? She was ready to come here and try it out herself before we even started.]\u201d The sergeant laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c[Really? But, regardless; this human female and others like her are the key to our offensive on this world. Once the bond is formed, you will need to proceed carefully to seize control of the host and suppress the growth. Only once you have control over the body can you allow the growth to take place. We were assigned this mission because we are the best. We were sent ahead of the troops because we get the results this mission requires. Bond with a female and get control of her body; we\u2019ll meet back here in one month. Remember girls, I expect no less than your best and will accept nothing less.]\u201d Narytiss said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twelve aliens saluted and went off towards the town, leaving Narytiss (and Lindsey) in the clearing with the ship. \u201cWe\u2019ll hide this back at your place. Can\u2019t leave it lying around where some important might find it.\u201d Narytiss said, returning to speaking English as she effortlessly lifted the ship and started back to town herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Narytiss planned, a month later before the sun rose she and the twelve other aliens met at the landing site. All twelve of the aliens had bonded and taken over the bodies of a woman. \u201c[Excellent work girls. And now the fun begins. Spread out around the town. We\u2019ll meet at the center and clear a zone for the troops to land. And by the way girls, while this may be a serious mission, try to have fun.]\u201d Narytiss said with a mischievous smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twelve girls matched Narytiss\u2019 smile or giggled manically as they walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sun started rising the twelve other reported in ready. \u201cI hope you weren\u2019t too fond of this town Lindsey, it\u2019s not going to be around much longer.\u201d Narytiss giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey didn\u2019t have time to reply as the familiar tingle of growth started. And once again they stood 100 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you remember the last time we did this. But this time things will be a bit different.\u201d Narytiss said as she started walking towards the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey experienced every bit of Narytiss\u2019 rampage. She felt every building crushed beneath her bare feet, she tasted every person on her tongue and felt every futile punch or kick of every person trapped in her stomach whenever Narytiss swallowed a helpless human. By midday the town had been leveled and Narytiss met the other twelve at the center of town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c[This was good. I haven\u2019t had this much fun on a mission since we put down that rebellion on Xakriss IV.]\u201d  The sergeant said gleefully as another slurped up a pair of kicking legs into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c[We\u2019ll have time to celebrate later. The first transport will be arriving by nightfall. Oolaxyy, Varrysa, Wusyit, and Rimlyix, you four stay with me and clear space for the command center. The rest of you start setting up the landing platforms in the southern half, we\u2019ll join you when we\u2019re done.]\u201d Narytiss ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarytiss and her crew worked fast. All the rubble was cleared and several large metal platforms for ships were built and all of them shrank back to human height long before the first transport descended from the sky. While the twelve others helped unload and build various command structures, barracks and mess halls, Narytiss was excused by her high rank and retired to a temporary structure for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe had some fun didn\u2019t we?\u201d Narytiss asked with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey didn\u2019t answer; she was still shocked by all that Narytiss did earlier that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarytiss giggled again. \u201cWell, now that we\u2019ve set up shop, it\u2019s time for your reward.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Reward? What reward? And what for?</i> Lindsey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI always like to reward those that help me. Normally it would wealth or power in the regimes we set up on our conquered worlds. But this is a different case, as our two species are so similar, so I have something special in mind.\u201d Narytiss replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Special? I don\u2019t like the sound of that.</i> Lindsey said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarytiss laughed out loud this time, \u201cYou are quite the pessimist. Aren\u2019t you? You remember that I entered into \u201cyour\u201d body and it stayed hidden within the ribcage. Well starting tonight it will start transferring to \u201cour\u201d womb. As shall your consciousness.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What!?!? You mean you\u2019re gonna\u2026</i> Lindsey trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty much.

She replied, \u201cNah, I don\u2019t think that will be possible.  Having a second mind in this body causes all of my thoughts to just buzz in the back of your skull.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flippant attitude in Narytiss tone caused something in Lindsey to snap. <i> I will break you.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caught Narytiss\u2019 attention. \u201cWhat did you say, midget?  You think that you will be able to defeat me?  How?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If you shove me into that womb-bound body, and eject me into the world, I will be the bane of your invasion.  I will remember every building that you crushed with my feet, every single body that you forced me to consume, and I will strike at your invasion force with the wrath of 100 Amazon warriors.</i> Lindsey pressed forward with her threats, emblazoning them with images of burning wreckage she remembered from every horror flick, news broadcast, and even memories of the crushed city wreckage that she wrought that day. If she could scare Narytiss with a resistant cog to the alien war machine, Lindsey might be able to avoid losing access to her human body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarytiss didn't even give her a second thought.  \u201cBig talk for someone who doesn't have anything to back it up.\u201d  Narytiss hummed to herself, as she began to pull Lindsey\u2019s consciousness towards the husk drifting inside of the giant\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey screamed one last threat. <i> I would hunt you down and eradicate every giant being that your species possessed.  I won\u2019t care if the humans reject me, as long as I make the planet safe for them again.

From the view of the moon, it appeared to be closer to midnight than to dawn.  She let out a shrieking noise, and the dozen commando troops swarmed out of the darkness and formed ranks in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Girls, there has been a development.  My generous host just threatened to overtake the invasion force using the body that I previously possessed.]  Murmurs arouse from the crowd of assembled aliens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWusyit asked [Is this really an issue to be concerned about?  My host seems to enjoy the carnage that we brought down upon the indigenous peoples.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[It appears that these humans might attempt to resist the brainwash re-birthing process; if successful, they could learn how to resist our technology, and develop countermeasures to our ships and weapons.]  Narytiss informed her troops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOolaxyy, Varrysa, Wusyit, and Rimlyix looked among themselves.  The others also shared looks of concern.  Finally, Varrysa raised her hand and asked, [What are the options, Commander?]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarytiss shook her head in what Lindsey realized was amusement.  [Two challenging choices stand before you troops.  The first option demands a brainwash and rewrite of the memories of the implanted conscious, permitting complete obedience.  The second decision will require at least a week of leave to allow for undisturbed mental focus, to cage the conscious of the host, cutting off its ability to take control, to communicate with you, to sense anything outside and inside their own body.  This should reduce the buzzing in the mind, while permitting them to keep their bodies.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRimlyix demanded [Will the other troops be alerted to the body changes and warned of the brain resistance?]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarytiss nodded, [As soon as I provide the initial intelligence lectures to the forward troops, I will be taking some time off to ---]<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lindsey began to feel again, with a mix of wonder and horror as her new body moved through the uterus wall.  Inside, the mucus-filled walls of the endometrium cushioned the body.  Lindsey felt the waves of muscle as her new head was slowly rotated toward the cervix, her eventual passage of rebirth.

In the time that she has been gone, the invasion forces of the alien species\u2014Earthlings now call them Succumbs\u2014had demolished nearly all of the highly populated metropolitan areas in North America, including the national capitals of Canada and the United States, and most of the strategic military locations.  Even domestic missile attacks smashed harmlessly against their shielded space ships, provoking harsh strikes on the launch sites and all nearby populated areas, led by the Super Commander of the Advanced Forces, Narytiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrike forces of alien ground troops are accompanied by the altered human-alien giants.  Towering at over 100 feet high, the \u201cNephilim Spawns\u201d could simply stroll into a city and smash apart buildings and devour all the humans they can, like teenagers raiding the kitchen pantry.  When humans were not consumed as food by the Nephilim-classed Succumbs, they were captured and taken to internment camps for two reasons.  The first reason was slave labor, mainly consisting of the males, the elderly and children.  The second reason was take-over of female victims, in an effort to mass produce Nephilim troops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the first month of terror and destruction caused by the \u201cNephilim Spawns\u201d and the forward troop invasions, the queen of the Succumbs, one Royal Highness Tabitha, had arrived on planet.

All of the other continents banned together, and pulled back all their cargo ships, their transport vessels and their planes, to prevent alien exposure within their own countries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, the embargo succeeded in preventing the crossing of the Succumbs into other countries and continents.  Most of the resistance now comes from the more rural areas, or the most hostile and barren environments.

With all of the alien technology at her disposal, she decided to not risk damaging either her Nephilim body or her alien hybrid child, rather seeking out a stable \u2018anti-alien\u2019 hospital to extract the hybrid baby.  However, as a safety measure, she brought along a restraining collar, capable of stunning even the most aggressive hybrids that her species had produced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelp me; I think it\u2019s coming out!\u201d  Narytiss cries out, catching the attention of the medical professionals in the lobby.  They rushed her into a wheelchair, dashing her off to the maternity wing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours later, the head appeared between Narytiss\u2019 legs, and the doctor cradled the baby\u2019s head.  When the baby opened up its eyes, the lava red orbs caught sight of Narytiss and narrowed down to burning slits.  \u201cALIEN!\u201d the little head screeched.  The doctor and all the nurses scrambled away as the baby began to writhe its way out of Narytiss\u2019 womanhood.  A pair of bony arms squirmed their way out, and gripped each leg, pulling the rest of its body out of the vaginal passage.  It landed on the floor, a mesh of adult sized limbs with sharp red claws, and an infant head and torso.  Screeching \u201cALIEN!\u201d at Narytiss, the infant creature backed towards the hallway, slipping out of sight.  Furiously crawling down the hallway, the baby drew screams of terror from nurses, doctors, and orderlies who scrambled out of the way.  It leaped at the high ventilation system, smashing through the grate and disappearing into the building, with one last scream of \u201cALIEN!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarytiss, still in the delivery room, heard the screams of terror in the hallway.  Sighing to herself, she looked at the petrified doctor and nursing staff still in the room.  She asked, \u201cI don\u2019t suppose that we can just pretend that this incident, like, never happened, and I can quietly leave the building?\u201d  When they didn\u2019t respond, she groaned as she pulled herself off the medical gurney and stood to her Amazonian height.  She towered over the staff, waiting for an answer.  When they continued to cower against the wall, she rolled her eyes and began to grow, smashing through the floor and the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hybrid creature had made it out of the building and to the roadway when Super Nephilim Narytiss smashed through the roof of the hospital.  Turning to watch, the conscious of Lindsey stirred in the creature, igniting distant remnants of Lindsey\u2019s vow to destroy all the aliens.  As the infant watches the painful destruction of these innocents, it gains control of the leg muscles and begins to straggle away from the destruction occurring at Narytiss\u2019 futile attempt to find Lindsey\u2019s new form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*&amp;*&amp;*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a month, rumors had circulated as to the existence of a new alien monster.  Some told of the destruction of human hospitals as Nephilim, in human form, infiltrated the hospital to birth the new monstrosity babies; upon delivery, the Nephilim trashed the hospitals and walked away carrying clawed babies.  One of the stranger rumors was the Howling Hybrid, which would strike at various human internment camps.  The hybrid, which bore red eyes and triangular ears on the side of its head, would attack alien soldiers and tear down the fences, allowing the humans to escape.  By the time reinforcements would arrive, the monster would be gone, leaving a pile of dismembered Succumb bodies buried under the shredded structures of the camp.  Surviving humans, on both sides of the fighting, claimed that the Howling Hybrid would howl the phrase \u201cDestroy Aliens!\u201d as it tore apart the alien forces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarytiss knew what the hybrid was: the reincarnation of Lindsey.  However, even with all her tracking skills, Narytiss could never track the creature for very long.  Other than the occasional set of tracks with three fingers and a thumb, there was nothing else to go on: no thermal trail, no tufts of fur or scales, and no scent trail.  While Narytiss would have loved to track down her prey to the ends of the earth, she had other things to attend to.</span></div></div>",

However, the ship designs do not allow for suitable atmospheric battles, making the \u201cNephilim Spawns\u201d the most suited weapons for land based engagements: all they had to do was swat the planes out of the air.  Unfortunately, there were no sea-worthy transports among the alien arsenal.  To correct this flaw, the \u201cNephilim Spawns\u201d had been ordered by Royal Highness Tabitha to procure human military ships and transport vessels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuspecting this very strategy, the naval fleets of the United States had evacuated to extreme distances off shore, anticipating long range bombardments from the alien invasion forces.  When the Succumbs could not capture any naval ships, they moved their forces towards the Eastern coast port cities.  In Norfolk, the aliens met severe resistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a now emptied naval station, the Succumbs deemed that they could possess the facilities to construct alien-enhanced human ships, either from new construction or advancements on cruise ships, which would be big enough for transporting the \u201cNephilim Spawns\u201d to the other continents.  Realizing the alien strategy, human military troops had moved in to try and destroy the construction yards, rendering them worthless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the tanks on the streets, the flamethrowers and explosive charges in the construction buildings, and the single Nephilim Spawn bearing down on the town, all of the citizenship was in chaos.  The Nephilim Spawn brought her hand to her mouth and whistled loudly.  For a half mile, all the windows in Norfolk either cracked or shattered due to the blast of noise.  In the silence that followed, the people waited for the giantess to move, triggering a mass exodus in the opposing direction.  However, wolf-like howls broke the silence, as the new forces of the alien invasion made their debut appearance.  The Nephilim Spawn stood back, watching as the hybrids began to tear the city to shreds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe baby hybrids barreled into the city, tearing along the roadways.  They leaped over houses, smashed through cars, and slashed at any other obstacles in their paths.  Appearing like the werewolves of ancient legends, nearly 2 dozen blue shaggy haired alien creatures began rampaging through the streets.  With their long muscular arms and razor-like claws, the 10-foot tall creatures slashed and hacked at anything that moved, from escaping cars to dug-in defense troops.  With their agility and minuscule chests, the creatures did not appear to take damage from bullets or grenade explosions.  The creatures made swift work of the outer defense lines, and moved towards the ship yards and dock areas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the alien\u2019s monster forces approached the storage container shipping yard, the resistance cells and the Army troop forces bolstered up a new line of defense.  From the highway, six of the werewolf babies followed the train tracks towards the shipping yard.  Another three came from the direction of downtown Norfolk, through the Old Dominion University campus in a rush to reach their master\u2019s goal.  The troop forces could see the blood lust in their eyes, and the blood and gore on their muzzles and claws.  The outer booby traps, placed hastily to try and deter the monsters, detonated and maimed two of the nine creatures, bringing a frenzied rush towards the gates of the ship yard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new roar\u2014with the charisma of a lion\u2014froze both forces in place.  Leaping from the highway-bound train tracks, a hybrid creature with the same appearance as the others leaped in between the two forces.  Unlike the blue haired creatures, this blond furred beast turned its back to the humans and bared its teeth at its sisters.  In a possessed rush, all of the blue beasts jumped the blond one, screeching and extending their claws to shred the newcomer.  The two wounded from the defenses leaped at the blond werewolf from the left.  The blond stood up to her full height, a towering 20 foot creature, and slapped those two with the back of her front paw.  They sailed backward, falling among the booby traps and snares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour blue freaks tried to tackle her legs, while the final three used their momentum to climb to her back and neck.  The blond she-wolf-creature did not seem disturbed with the creatures climbing all over her.  She kicked out at one of the werewolves tangled around her leg, and pinned another two under her front paws.  The fourth blue pup drew a fresh red muzzle away from the leg, only to find itself pierced through the chest by the blond creature\u2019s needle sharp teeth.  Shaking her head, the blond monster tore apart the chest of its victim, and tossed the twitching body behind her.  It landed among the soldiers, where it twitched once more before falling completely still.  The two pinned under her paws were decapitated by a flick of razor claws.  Sprays of red gushed from the necks as the blond demon rolled their bodies into a pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching around to her back, she slashed a leg off of one of the blue mongrels, causing it to fall to the pavement below.  The second one was grabbed in her claws.  Struggling to reach the final pest in her fur, a growl of frustration turned to a roar of agony as the struggling creature bit down hard into her forepaws, and the final one found skin near the neck to slash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp until now, the troops had watched the freak show, not sure how to react.  When the creature roared out, a shot rang out from the ranks of troops.  \u201cWho shot that?\u201d a captain screamed out.  Turning around, the captain noticed a sergeant with the smoking barrel of a sniper rifle.  The captain snatched the rifle.  \u201cWhat do you think you are doing?!  What if that creature turns on us now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, sir.  Look over there,\u201d the sergeant points over at the behemoth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond creature had shrunk away, but then realized that the pain was gone.  Tumbling to the ground, the final blue wolf creature landed with a bone snapping thud.  A howl of satisfaction met the troops as she snapped the one in her paw into two chunks of alien meat.  Piling up the bodies of her victims, the blond werewolf seemed to count the victims.  Looking around, she saw her final prey.  The one she had kicked was making a dash for the Norfolk bridges, back into the Old Dominion campus area.  To the surprise of the men, the blond creature bounded away chasing the blue deserter, as she screamed out, \u201cDestroy Aliens!\u201d</span></div></div>",

She asked, \u201cI don\u2019t suppose that we can just pretend that this incident, like, never happened, and I can quietly leave the building?\u201d  When they didn\u2019t respond, she groaned as she pulled herself off the medical gurney and stood to her Amazonian height.  She towered over the staff, waiting for an answer.  When they continued to cower against the wall, she rolled her eyes and began to grow, smashing through the floor and the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hybrid creature had made it out of the building and to the roadway when Super Nephilim Narytiss smashed through the roof of the hospital.  Turning to watch, the conscious of Lindsey stirred in the creature, igniting distant remnants of Lindsey\u2019s vow to destroy all the aliens.  As the infant watches the painful destruction of these innocents, it gains control of the leg muscles and begins to straggle away from the destruction occurring at Narytiss\u2019 futile attempt to find Lindsey\u2019s new form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*&amp;*&amp;*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a month, rumors had circulated as to the existence of a new alien monster.  Some told of the destruction of human hospitals as Nephilim, in human form, infiltrated the hospital to birth the new monstrosity babies; upon delivery, the Nephilim trashed the hospitals and walked away carrying clawed babies.  One of the stranger rumors was the Howling Hybrid, which would strike at various human internment camps.  The hybrid, which bore red eyes and triangular ears on the side of its head, would attack alien soldiers and tear down the fences, allowing the humans to escape.  By the time reinforcements would arrive, the monster would be gone, leaving a pile of dismembered Succumb bodies buried under the shredded structures of the camp.  Surviving humans, on both sides of the fighting, claimed that the Howling Hybrid would howl the phrase \u201cDestroy Aliens!\u201d as it tore apart the alien forces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarytiss knew what the hybrid was: the reincarnation of Lindsey.  However, even with all her tracking skills, Narytiss could never track the creature for very long.  Other than the occasional set of tracks with three fingers and a thumb, there was nothing else to go on: no thermal trail, no tufts of fur or scales, and no scent trail.  While Narytiss would have loved to track down her prey to the ends of the earth, she had other things to attend to.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In a matter of weeks, many of the Midwestern states started to rebel against the infestation of the Succumb internment camps.  Various resistant cells were formed from the released prisoners.  These cells banded to hunt the small Succumbs; when a bigger Nephilim appeared, the cell warriors would scatter like leaves to the four winds, forcing the giant to chase only a small group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all of the set-backs in the central part of the continent, Royal Highness Tabitha started to demand more expansion results from her troops.  Deterred by the mammoth mountains of the West Coast and the desolate desert regions of Central America, the alien forces made mass approaches to the Eastern Coast.  Several cities fell, including Norfolk, Boston, and New Orleans.  Sea based missile attacks, as well as sabotage performed by resistant citizen groups and military troops was able to disable many ports.  Unfortunately, the Succumbs caught on to the pattern, and sent a squad of Nephilim to Miami to secure the city and ports.  Narytiss volunteered to lead the squad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*&amp;*&amp;*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the tanks on the streets, the flamethrowers in the construction buildings, and the half-dozen giantess marching towards the river, the city was in total chaos, and most of the citizens had fled.  One of the smaller giantesses was approaching a squad of tanks when she was attacked from behind.  Falling down to the ground on her knees, the giantess shook its arms while screaming and grabbing for her back.  The tanks let loose a barrage of shells, torching the giantess\u2019 front side.  Dazed into unconsciousness, the giant let her arms lull to her side.  She collapsed face-down to the concrete, producing a tremor upon impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the smoke and debris clouds, the soldiers in the tanks noticed a creature rise up from the back of the giant.  With a wolf snout and long orangutan arms, the monster raised a three-finger hand high up above his head and brought it down.  A gleam of daggers flashed; blood sprouted from the giant\u2019s back, reaching the strength of a geyser.  A howl of approval came from the beast.  It leaped at a building, and smashed through the glass window, disappearing into the 10th floor of an office building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the soldiers asked, \u201cWhat was that thing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tank leader replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know what it was; but it wasn\u2019t interested in us.  Come on.  We better leave this giantess alone; otherwise, the others will think that we did this to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tanks back away from the fallen and dying giantess, and went to support another unit trying to destroy the cruise ship marinas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*&amp;*&amp;*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the sudden appearance of the \u2018long slashing wolf\u2019 creature, the tide of battle began to shift to the humans.  The smoke-furred monster would smash out of buildings, and surprise the giants.  Darting around in the smoke and flames, the creature slashed at the ankles of the giants or scratch up the alien backs.  Whenever the humans worked in tandem with the appearance of the monster, the giants suffered even more damage, from the burning shells and machine gun blasts to the wolf needle teeth and dagger claws.  When a giantess actually fell, the wolf monster would move for a kill blow on the back of the neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the alien forces dwindled down to a few small altered troop transports carrying Succumbs foot soldiers, meant to seize the port buildings, and the last standing Nephilim, Narytiss.  With most of the docks and port areas in either smoldering cinders or ruby flames, the army forces had reformed a moving barricade, pushing the last bits of resistance towards the everglades in the west.  Between the tanks barging up the streets, the modified Succumb troop transports scurried away like bugs.  Even Narytiss felt forced back.  Tank shells smashed around the buildings that she was using for her cover and mortar fire formed debris clouds at her feet.  She could not understand how the humans could be so organized and destructive enough to beat her Nephilim troops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA roar and howl reached the ears of everyone within the battlefield.  \u201cDESTROY ALIENS!!  DESTROY ALIENS!!\u201d  Looking up to the roof of a high-rise, both battle forces witnessed the gray-furred monstrosity glaring down at Narytiss.  \u201cALIEN BETRAYER!  BODY SNATCHER!!  TIME TO DIE!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Howling Hybrid!  Where did it come from?\u201d  One tank commander shouted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the Long Slashing Wolf that killed the Giantess on 8th Street.  It jumped on her back, freaking the giantess out.  When we shelled her front, she fell and the creature dealt a kill blow.\u201d  This came from a tank gunner, who had witnessed her earlier during the siege.  \u201cShe ignored us completely, just jumping into a building and disappearing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother trooper radioed, \u201cWe were helped by Smoky too.  The crafty devil slashed at a Giantess\u2019 ankles in the Pinecrest suburbs.  Dagger claws it had; why, it even tore up one of the Succumb trucks with its bare paws.  Seemed to be ignoring us too.\u201d<br>\r\nNarytiss, on the other hand, was not relieved by the site of her flesh and mixed blood.  \u201cALL Succumbs, forget the humans.  Focus all fire on that Hybrid Warrior.  Destroy it at all costs!!\u201d  With that announcement, she turned her focus off the wolf monster.  She instructed, \u201cKeep it away from me.  I will destroy the tanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do the tanks respond?</span></div></div>",

She was overfilling her new D cup bra, which she just brought a few days ago.  Her pants wouldn't pull up over her new, full, hips and ass.  She stepped out of her pants, and lost balance, not use to be 6'3\".  \"Nary...how long are you gonna stay in me...I mean, I like my new body and all, but I'm starting to get a little bit too big here...\"  Lindsey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNarytiss, inside Lindsey's body, had grown to 3 times her original size.  Her body had fused with much of Lindsey's, but Lindsey didn't know this yet.  \"Oh, just another day or so.  I gotta make sure I'm fully healed.\"  She said.  Narytiss, though, was really trying to hijack Lindsey's body completely, and today was the day.  Narytiss had been waiting patiently for Lindsey to leave her house and head somewhere private, but she was taking her sweat time.  \"Ugh...forget it.\"  Narytiss said, and began to take control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Narytiss didn't know was that her species and humanity did have a common ancestor, and unlike other species, Narytiss wouldn't be able to take control so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey gasped.  Narytiss did too.  \"Nary...what...what are you doing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop....stop resisting...\"  Narytiss said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...what?  Stop it!\"  Lindsey said, feeling Narytiss' thoughts fill her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I can't....this...something is wrong.\"  Narytiss said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey and Narytiss suddenly both had access to Lindsey's senses.  Lindsey looked down, watching her breasts slowly fill up her already too small bra.  \"what are you doing, stop, I'm already too big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch!\"  Narytiss said, using Lindsey's mouth to speak.  \"Take off your bra, that hurts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey reached behind, and forced the clasp open, her breasts sprang free.  \"Stop making me bigger!\"  Lindsey said.  \"I'm getting taller too, stop it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't....I don't know what's wrong!\"  Narytiss said.  Lindsey brought her hands to her face, and was shocked, seeing the skin of Narytiss' skin color overtake hers.  Lindsey spun around in the mirror, and watched her eyes start to glow a light green (a combination of Lindsey's gree eyes, and Narytiss' glowing white eyes.  Lindsey watched as her body continued to inch upward, her panties getting buried by her swelling ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey's hair lengthened down her body, and had streaks of both Narytiss' hair color, and Lindsey's.  Her panties snapped, and fell to the ground, as Lindsey passed 6'7\" in height.  \"Nary, what's going on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey's facial features slowly began to shift into Narytiss', her feet turned into a partly hooved version, her body altered and shifted.  The transformation stopped.  Lindsey was still mostly human, except with bluish green skin color, glowing green eyes fill with bioluminescence.  Her ears were slightly pointer, and her body was 6'10, with insane curves.  Her hips exploded out more than 50 inches, but her waist was almost a 30.  her massive breasts defied gravity, 2 basketballs attached to her chest.  \"Dammit...\"  Narytiss said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell just happened...wait a second.\"  Lindsey said, feeling the alien's mind in hers.  \"You were going to take over my body?!\"  Lindsey shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!  Dammit!  I...Yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bitch!\"  Lindsey shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would've died otherwise!  I would've left you eventually....\"  Narytiss said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey paused.  \"What the...no!  When you would leave my body it would've killed me!  Oh God we are stuck this way now?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid so...\"  Narytiss said.  \"We can get back to my planet, my doctors can figure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way.

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Although Lindsey was now only days away from her 20th birthday she was still slowly growing taller and rounder. Her family naturally matured much later than would be normal for humans. She hadn't even started developing her very small sized 32B bust until after her 17th birthday. So when Lindsey started sprouting with Narytiss help no one in her family paid any attention to her growth. Her parents were actually relieved to see Lindsey FINALLY blossom. After all, when her 11 older half-sisters [her father really, really liked being married and having daughters] had grown up, the smallest had been a 36D by her 18th birthday. All of them sometime between their 17th and 19th birthdays had ended up somewhere between a 38 and 41 inch bust carrying a D or DD cup. Lindsey also had barely 17-year old identical twin sisters who already wore size 35C bras and were several inches taller than her. Because she lived alone in an efficiency apartment off campus no one [family or friend] saw Lindsey's new body that day. Once she realized the full extent of her changes, Lindsey had chosen to carefully sort through what she could use to disguise as many of her changes as possible. Other than her new height, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause she was still in the final phase of puberty, Lindsey's mind was totally immune to Narytiss control. Something which she had still not yet figured out. Narytiss just figured that she had failed in her attempt because Lindsey was awake and could actively resist her. So late that night a couple of hours after Lindsey had gone to sleep Narytiss tried again. This time things turned out even worse for her. Lindsey was in the middle of a very erotic dream when Narytiss begin her second attempt taking over Lindsey's body. Which turned out to be the absolute worst possible timing. Lindsey's body grew more twice as much as before. Her moans of sheer ecstasy from the orgasm she felt were heard nearly a mile { 1 1/2 km} away. Within minutes her body exploded up another one and a half feet. Her bust ended up being slightly under 81 inches {2.05 meters} around. Her hips expanded to become 5 feet around and her waist shrunk 5 inches more. Lindsey also developed just enough muscles to keep her bust riding high and proud. She was delighted when she saw that they felt no heavier to carry than her previous 32B bust. Surprisingly, Lindsey slept through all of these new changes. The next morning when she did wake up Lindsey fainted when she saw how big she had grown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up a over an hour later, the first thing Lindsey tried was to try contacting Narytiss. Lindsey failed because Narytiss was still deeply asleep from sheer exhaustion from her attempt to take control of Lindsey. Her total failure left her very vulnerable to Lindsey now taking control of her. Lindsey took advantage of that by accident. Thinking to herself, I wish I knew how this happened, Lindsey's mind was suddenly filled with images from Narytiss memories of the changes. Realizing that somehow she could now fully access Narytiss mind, Lindsey tries and totally succeeds in taking control of the alien. Now rummaging through this wonderful closet of information, Lindsey first tells Narytiss that she needs to stay asleep. She then starts searching for anything that she can do to disguise her changes from other people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes most of the day before Lindsey discovers that Narytiss species has the ability to camouflage themselves similar to a chameleon does on Earth. So after eating a very hearty dinner Lindsey spends most of the night practicing her new chameleon abilities. Waking up shortly after noon the next day, Lindsey is confident that other than her height she can successfully hide all of her bodies changes. Now that she's over 8 feet tall, Lindsey knows that she will immediately STAND out wherever she goes. Ordering take-out and having other groceries and supplies delivered Lindsey spends most of the next month on her final really big problem. One thing that bothers Lindsey is that although she ordered Narytiss body to stop growing bigger so that Lindsey will stop growing, Lindsey is still slowly growing bigger. So a month after Narytiss second failure at seizing control of Lindsey and figuring that she has learned all she can picking Narytiss dreams, Lindsey finally orders her to wake up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Narytiss wakes up, she again foolishly tries taking control of Lindsey's mind, within seconds learns that she is no longer the boss. Narytiss then screams bloody murder in Lindsey's ears to no avail. Within minutes Narytiss starts laughing hysterically. Telling Lindsey, \"Well, I've lost any chance to take over your body. However, with the size and shape your body now is, you're just as trapped as I am. Maybe even more so because as soon as you go outside the police or some other branch of the Government will capture you to perform all sorts of tests to find out what kind of alien you are. All I have to do is to sit back and sooner or later someone from my planet will wander into your solar system. Their sensors will tell them that I've crashed and they'll come rescue me. Even if I've left your body by then, you'll really be sorry. Lindsey knows that Narytiss is telling the truth and it really annoys her so she orders Narytiss to go back to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, however, she also tells the alien to let her access EVERYTHING!! Which results in Lindsey learning several major surprises. One is just how their two bodies are blending [for lack of a better description] together and how much Lindsey can control it. She can now speed it up, slow it down, stop it and even reverse all or part of the blending. Lindsey can even choose to keep some of Narytiss alien body in her forever. Another more important surprise appears to solve Lindsey's slowly increasing height problem if she's willing to use it. Unfortunately for Lindsey, to make it work she will need the assistance of a handful of people either friends or family. It will work when Lindsey willingly orders Narytiss body to in a limited special way blend further with Lindsey.Third, her order to Narytiss has accidentally permitted Lindsey complete access to ALL of her alien technology. Narytiss had kept hidden from Lindsey that her ship was not a total loss after all. For although it would take some time to do, it's at least repairable enough to get back into orbit. That was the real reason why Narytiss wanted to take over Lindsey's body. She didn't want Lindsey to learn anything about her planet's technology. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She felt nourished, she felt amazing, she felt like this was heaven  Her body formed into a perfect female form, and slowly enlarged.

On a daily basis, Lindsey would examine her body, which grew anywhere from half an inch in height, to 2 inches.  Her breasts burlged forward, her hips flared outward, her butt was full and perky, and growing more and more perfect.</span></div></div>",

I never realized how much I appreciated the scientists and engineers that designed this. But then I\u2019ve never had a crash like this before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey watched silently as the alien worked. She stepped closer once again as the remains of the meteor started humming. The hum grew louder, and then suddenly stopped. An instant later there was a large and bright flash of purple light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff Regan, a retired old police officer came into his backyard in the morning to water the rose bushes along his back fence, mumbling about last night\u2019s abrupt end to his satellite television connection. Through the chain link fence he saw his neighbor, Lindsey\u2019s, yard. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary, all that was there was an empty hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynam'ra* inhaled deeply after her feet touched the familiar Cyprarcaean ground. \u201c[Ah, it\u2019s so good to be home.]\u201d** She sighed happily. Rekoo'la wouldn\u2019t be too happy about the lost ship, but after hitting that metal structure above Earth there wasn\u2019t much else that she could do. Lynam'ra glanced ahead and was pleased to see she had landed a short ways away from a city. She was about to start toward the city when she heard a familiar sounding moan behind her. It was familiar for two reasons: 1) she herself had made similar sickened moans the first few times she\u2019d gone through a wormhole; and 2) it had the same tone as the voice of the human girl she encountered before teleporting. \u201c[Oh no. She didn\u2019t\u2026]\u201d Lynam'ra whispered fearfully as she cautiously turned around. It indeed was the human girl, lying on her back still as huge to Lynam'ra as she was on Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey moaned again as she woke up. She remembered seeing the tiny alien woman working, hearing the hum from the spaceship wreckage, and the seeing a flash of purple before everything went black. She opened her eyes and blinked in surprise. The sky above her wasn\u2019t blue or even the black of night, it was red like her uncle\u2019s truck. She chanced a glance at the sun, realizing it was daytime, and saw it was blue like her shirt, the clouds were black, the tiny blades of grass she was lying on were a pale pink; the dirt beneath it was an even paler blue-purple. \u201cWha-! Where, where am I?\u201d Lindsey tensely asked aloud, though to whom she had no clue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, this is not good, this is not good at all.\u201d A familiar voice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey turned her head, still queasy from whatever occurred, and was both shocked and kind of pleased to see the alien woman from earlier. \u201cHey, it\u2019s you. What happened?\u201d Lindsey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI teleported home and, intentionally or not, you hitched along. So\u2026 welcome to Cyprarcaea, where no human has been before. And just so we get it out of our way, my name is Lynam'ra.\u201d The alien woman replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Lindsey. So uh, is every one of your people like you?\u201d Lindsey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYyyyyeeeessss.

Heavy footsteps lightly shook the ground as the thirty-something foot tall being walked out of the ship and looked around her back yard. She peeked out a little farther from the tree to get a good look at the otherworldly invader. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a woman. Her hair was red, short, and spikey. Her crimson eyes scanned the area with a fiery glare, like she was looking to pick a fight. Her body was wearing what appeared to be a type of armor...but Lindsey doubted it could block much. It had a long breastplate and shoulder plates, but the only thing covering her muscular thighs were a pair of spandex shorts. Plus, nothing was covering her tail...a tail?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when she realized this woman's outfit was the same as someone from that old Dragon Ball cartoon she watched as a kid. But this was reality. If this woman was a saiyan like the cartoon, it would mean the end of the earth. They were supposed to be a violent race of warriors that conquer other worlds for the sheer love of combat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time, the giantess spoke. <br>\r\n\"This is Rita, checking in. I've landed on the designated world, but there has been no response. I'll continue surveying for signs of sentient life.\"<br>\r\n\"Affirmative. If there are no signs of intelligence, continue your mission for resource extraction. If you come across any hostile lifeforms, you are approved to dispose of them.\"<br>\r\n\"Understood.\" She seemed to hang up her earpiece before making a long sigh. \"There's no way this rock has any sentients. Will they figure it out if I just blast this rock into nothingness?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cold chill ran down Lindsey's spine. She really will destroy the Earth! Unless...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please wait!\" she called out. The Saiyan's head snapped down at the source of sound, instantly locking eyes with the human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does the giant woman act? </span></div></div>",

Lindsey watched hesitantly while hiding in the hem of her shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra was family, and Lindsey was sure that she wouldn't try to do her any harm. After all, they loved each other. But on Cassandra's part, maybe <i>too </i>much... Growing up, they had to spend a lot of time with each other because of their mothers' close relationship. Things were fine...until Cassandra hit puberty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeeking her head out, Lindsey practically screamed from seeing Cassandra staring directly at her! She froze like a deer in headlights from the giant brunette's stare...until she followed her gaze. Cassandra wasn't looking at her, she was eyeing her clothes. More specifically her panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few gigantic strides, Cassandra had reached the bed. She looked around the room, half expecting someone to spring out and bust her. When no one came, a clammy hand snatched up the pink fabric and brought it to her face. Lindsey felt a little sick to see her own cousin sniffing her panties like a pervert. That decided it, she could not allow herself to be caught by this teenage nympho. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Lindsey...\" she moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Cassandra jumped onto the bed to sit then twisted to lay down! Lindsey yelped before running for the side of the bed. Moving as fast as her little legs could carry her Lindsey just made it in time before her cousin's giant back pressed into the mattress. The sheer force of such a casual movement sent Lindsey flying into the air before landing roughly on her front. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a few moments to catch her breath, she watched the perverted giantess before her. There were only two things that came to mind to avoid her horny wrath. She could either run up to the pillow and hide behind it until she left. But the chance of discovery or crushing by the giantess was also a factor. The only other option was escape. At the foot of the bed, her blanket had run off the side to the floor, making a perfect escape route. But that would include running in open sight past her feet and making a mile long climb to the floor. It would be a lot easier for her to be spotted, or stepped on if anyone came by. <br>\r\n\"What to do?\" she muttered.</span></div></div>",

Then they felt themselves being lifted up off the ground by a greenish colored tractor beam. Now flying towards the ship, they both see the bottom of the vessel opening up to engulf them. The couple watches helplessly as they float into the ship towards an unknown fate. The next thing they know, they are both standing on a stage, next to each other with several lights on them. A thunderous female voice then said in English, \u201cTiny humans, please remove all of your clothes so we may examine you, or else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOr else what,\u201d Steve said angrily? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOr else we will kill you horribly, now strip, get naked,\u201d the loud female voice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The tiny couple\u2019s eyes then adjust to the lite in the room, and they saw that this huge room is full of dozens of giant weird looking aliens. The still clothed tiny human couple then begins to undress out of fear. Those giant things are about 60 feet tall, maybe even taller, and the tiny couple was afraid, very afraid, as they stripped naked. Now completely naked, and standing nude next to each other, they watch as something steals all of their clothes. The tiny nude couple is at...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She felt this was drawing her near and could feel the power radiate .Thoughts raced through her head, she knew not to touch it but all common sense and fear had left her. Reaching down she touched the outer shell as to see if it was hot. Pulling back her hand in pure adrenline ,the cold touch reassured her and again reached out and grasped the meteorite in her hand. Then both hands, holding it in front of her. Fear and excitement raced through her head. She knew she had to leave and leave now.</span></div></div>",
