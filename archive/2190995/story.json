            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Inspired and based on Jelliroll's Comic. May you rest in peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn desk duty was Zootopia's first fox cop, Nick Wilde. The former con artist turned cop enjoyed being part of the ZPD, but found desk duty could be boring. Nick was taking the place for Clawhauser. Currently, he was on the phone speaking with his bunny partner on the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no big deal, Carrots. I'm glad to help out.\" Nick said to Judy as she laid back on his chair with his feet on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do they have you on any big cases without me?\" Judy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naw. They got me on desk duty while Clawhauser is on vacation.\" Nick stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, try to be good at your job. Even if it's only desk duty. Can you handle things without me?\" Judy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piece of cake!\" Nick said still looking confidently. \"See ya, Carrots!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye, Nick. I'll see you in a week.\" Judy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Judy ended the call, Nick hears and sees a commotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Nick went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!!! STOP RIGHT THERE!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick get out of his desk to see what was wrong and sees that and large rhino got off of the hold one of Nick's fellow <br>\r\nofficers and started running toward Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wilde! Look out!\" A grey slightly pudgy wolf officer shouted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get squished, copper!\" The rhino shouted out as he charged at Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick didn't seem fazed. Instead, he slight moved to his right with his left foot out and tripped the rhino over. Nick then pounced on the back of the rhino and cuffed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, great job!\" The grey wolf said cheering on Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew, that was close!\" A yellowish-brown mule said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what they say. The bigger they are, etc.\" Nick said as he gripped onto the rhino's arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick's ZPD training really paid for a small fox like him to apprehend a big rhino with such ease. The mule then took the rhino perp away. Nick then went back to the front desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the save, Wilde.\" The grey fox said thanking Nick. He then took out a brown paper bag. \"Have these truffles. You earned them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, thanks!\" Nick said happily to accept the treats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick quickly dug into the bag of tasty chocolate truffles. They were tiny but tasty. The bag turned emptied within a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm! Wow, those went quick.\" Nick said as he licked his chops and sees there aren't any crumbs left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, Nick is still on desk duty. Since nothing was happening, he decided to take a nap. Someone then walks up to Nick. It was the same mule from before, holding a box of doughnuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Wilde, thanks again for helping out earlier.\" The mule said thankfully. \"These have a blueberry creme filling, I heard it was your favorite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is, thanks!\" Nick said eagerly taking the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick opened the box and sees half a dozen creme-filled doughnuts topped with chocolate creme. They each looked equally delicious. Nick then took one at popped it in his mouth. He was really good. Like tasting a piece of heaven and since they were blueberry flavored, it was even better. Enjoy the first one, Nick was tempted to get another.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As Nick was in the locker room, ready to end his shift and leave for the day, he looked down and noticed his gut had some extra pudge to it. Enough to make his cream-colored belly a bit exposed. Nick didn't seem to happy about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I can't believe I ate that whole box,\" Nick said to himself as he places his paws on his waist. \"I'm gonna wind up like Clawhauser if I'm not careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick felt he needed to be careful not to overeat. Then someone called out to Nick. It was a male elephant in sweat clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Fox!\" The elephant shouted out to get Nick's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick turned around and looked a bit scared looking up at the large mammal. The elephant was carrying a large brown bag with his trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard ya help out my buddy Bianchi with a violent perp. I got ya some blueberry tarts as thanks.\" The elephant said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm.... wow.... thank you,\" Nick said losing some of his nervousness. The elephant then gave Nick the tarts. The bag was pretty big being about half of Nick's height. \"I do love blueberry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the big bag of tarts, Nick made his way home. As he walked, he can smell the aroma of the blueberry pastries. It smelled so good he was tempted to eat one right now. But he decided to wait until he got home. After a few minutes, he finally made it to his apartment. Once there, he took one of the tarts from the bag. It looked like tarts were made for mammals on the larger side because they were much bigger than the tarts Nick usually gets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeesh. A lot are in here.... and they're huge.\" Nick said to himself. \"I just have one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Nick ate and enjoy the first tart, he....</span></div></div>",

His belly was exposed out of his uniform and he was looking close to a mini Clawhauser. He was starting to wonder if it was desk duty that made Clawhauser fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nick goes to the front desk, he sees a package for him. He looks at the box and sees Judy's name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! A package from Judy! Wonder what she got me?\" Nick asked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick opened the package to find two whole blueberry pies. Nick was very happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blueberry pies! The little bunny knows me so well.\" Nick said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick didn't waste time eating one of the pies. Not even eating it with a fork or knife. After eating the first pie, he licked the tin clean. It was clearly the best pie he has ever had. With one other pie leftover, Nick ate the other pie as well. Same way as before.

A baked good truck had turned over a bunch of giant chocolate glazed doughnuts down on the ground. Each of them looking as big as Nick's head, if not bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet cheese and crackers.\" Nick said stunned by the site.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. A tire burst and dropped some of the cargo. Luckily, the driver is fine.\" The mule said as the grey wolf officer is filing a report of what happened with the bear driver. \"It's gonna be a real pain to clean all of this up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick looked at all the doughnuts and while he had two pies earlier, he was still hungry enough for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.... I volunteer for clean-up duty.\" Nick said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick went over and did one of the things cops did best, eat doughnuts. Eat giant doughnuts. Even if they were the kind meant for bigger mammals, Nick didn't mind. Only that they were so tasty. One was filling enough, but with Nick's growing appetite, one wasn't enough for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaaaah. I love this job.\" Nick said happily as he patted his stomach and prepare for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEating doughnut after doughnut and gaining a doughier belly from it. After a couple of minutes, cleanup was finally done and the fox was closer to a Mini-Clawhauser now. Nick was now twice the weight he was before he started feasting on the doughnuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great job, Wilde. You cleaned everything.\" The wolf officer said complementing Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick responded with a burp. After cleaning up and finishing up, Nick went home and rubbed his belly. Nick wasn't the skinny fox he used to be. Yet, he didn't mind it.</span></div></div>",

On his desk was a big empty box of doughnuts and half an eaten pie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, Nick was on the phone with Judy talking to her about yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were as big as my head, Judy. It was awesome.\" Nick said describing the doughnuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. They sound pretty tasty.\" Judy said from the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, Carrots. They were.\" Nick said happily as he patted his exposed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud shout then came from Bogo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WILDE! Is that a personal call?\" The chief buffalo shouted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eep!\" Nick shrieked. \"Gotta go!\" Nick then quickly hung up the phone and tried to regain his composure. \"Of course not. That was Officer Hopps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBogo gave Nick a look, but was willing to take his word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you know, the quarterly award is up.\" Bogo stated. \"The votes are in...\" Bogo then started smiling. \".... it would seem congratulations are in order. You done quite a good job, fox.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther officers came and cheered for Nick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You turned out to be a real great cop.\" Bogo said looking proud of Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick couldn't help but feel a bit emotional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so.... I'm so honored, sir.\" Nick said a bit tearful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the officers then brought out a large 3-layer cake with white frosting and a #1 in the middle with blue icing. The cake was clearly for Nick and he already couldn't help but get a big slice. The cake was chocolate and pretty condensed. Nick's belly was expanding quite a bit from just a few bites.

It also made it his work easier. But he did needed a bigger uniform since the buttons on his current one were close to popping. After work, Nick went home and quickly realized he needed more than just a new uniform to fit him. He had other clothes  that weren't gonna fit him so well either. He had stretchy sweatpants and put that on, but no shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he laid the couch, that was closer to a chair for him now, he was wondering about how much bigger he could end up.</span></div></div>",

This would most likely be Nick's last day on desk duty. Clawhauser's vacation is almost over, so you would most likely go back to the best. Judy's also supposed to come back soon. While Nick didn't say it, he missed Judy this past couple of days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, with his growing appetite, Nick consumed box after box of doughnuts. There wasn't much going on today. Nick finished his fifth dozen box of giant doughnuts. He licks the frosting of his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm. I see why Ben loves these so much.\" Nick said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick's belly has been growing more and more from the eating. Especially it came to pastries. Another few pies from Judy, a couple more doughnut boxes, tarts, and other treats. Nick's weight was now matching the weight of a hippo. Bigger gut, a thicker butt, puffy cheeks the size of basketballs, and arms thicker than branches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I wonder how Carrots is going to react to me like this?\" Nick thought as he lifted up his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the day, Nick went home to relax. He had the day off tomorrow morning. So it was a good time to chill. As he changed his clothes, even if they barely fit him, something  got his attention.</span></div></div>",

In fact, she was close to showing the same obesity as Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly was exposed and partially touching the ground. Her cheeks showed extra puffiness like it was holding two tennis balls. The only thing bigger than her gut was her bunny rump.

Same thing happened to me with this gut of mine.\" Nick stated to the stuck bunny.<br>\r\n\"Just help me out!\" Judy said getting mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick insisted to help Judy and grabbed both her arms to tugged. After three pulls, Nick got Judy out, but put a bit too much power in that last pull. It caused Judy to trip and fall on Nick. It was a good thing that Nick's belly was like a big cushion. His belly smooshed together with Judy's. Both Nick and Judy were red-faced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S.... sorry!\" Judy said flustered.<br>\r\n\"N.... no! It was my fault.\" Nick said as flustered as Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy and Nick then got up the best way they could. After that, Nick and Judy looked at each other. Still surprised by the weight they both put on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So.... uhh.... what happen to you?\" Judy asked.<br>\r\n\"Apparently, taking Clawhauser's job also meant having his weight.\" Nick said lifting up his massive go and dropping it to watch it bounce. \"This is the result of doughnuts, truffles, tarts, pies, a 3 layer cake, and more doughnuts. What about you?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm the product of Gideon Grey's baking.\" Judy stated as she patted her stomach. \"Carrot cupcakes, carrot-ginger pie, carrot cake, and carrot doughnuts. A little here....\" Judy then patted the side of her butt. \".... and a LOT here.\"<br>\r\n\"So we both went a little overboard.\" Nick said.<br>\r\n\"A little is an understatement.\" Judy said as she places her paws on Nick's blobby belly. \"Looks like you packed a lot into this gut.\"<br>\r\n\"Looks like you packed a lot into that butt.\" Nick said with a smirk as he looks at Judy's backside.<br>\r\n\"Don't remind me.\" Judy said not looking too happy. \"I was tempted to stay at Bunnyburrow because of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis information stunned Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were?\" Nick asked.<br>\r\n\"Look at me, Nick. How can I be a part of the ZPD looking like this?\" Judy asked.<br>\r\n\"Have you seen me and Ben?\" Nick asked. \"Even with the extra baggage, I can handle the weight.\"<br>\r\n\"There was.... also something else.\" Judy said. \"Gideon.... he had feelings for me.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh....\" Nick said with widen eyes. <br>\r\n\"He.... even wanted me to stay.\" Judy admitted. \"But, while I was thankful for the treats, and told him.... there was someone else. He seemed down but totally understood.\"<br>\r\n\"Feelings for someone else? Anyone I should know?\" Nick asked with a grin.<br>\r\n\"He's smart, cunning, a bit of a joker, but he's also really sweet.\" Judy said with a smile.<br>\r\n\"Oh. Sounds like he's a real catch.\" Nick said smiling slyly.<br>\r\n\"You know it's you, right?\" Judy asked with a smirk.<br>\r\n\"The moment you started talking.\" Nick said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick then held Judy's paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whether thin or pudgy, you and me are meant to be.\" Nick said with a smile.<br>\r\n\"Are you gonna kiss me now or what?\" Judy asked with a sly smile.<br>\r\n\"I intend to, my not-so-little bunny.\" Nick said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Judy then kissed.

Nick was too busy taunting Judy with her carrot recorder, she forced herself out of the driver's seat only for Nick to use his foot and push Judy\u2019s head to the wheel which then honked, and all of a sudden the workers on the dock quickly skedaddled. A car pursuit was then followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile trying to catch up on one of the smuggling vehicles, Judy became so infuriated at Nick for blowing their cover. When crossing an intersection between Tundratown and Sahara Square, all of a sudden, a fast car comes rushing in and plummets the driver\u2019s section of the squad car into hitting a light post. Nick luckily survived, but poor Judy was all banged up. He wanted to make sure if she was okay but then called for an ambulance, which arrived shortly thereafter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at ZPD, Chief Bogo was not happy at the fact that Nick\u2019s point of view was something that Bogo wasn\u2019t buying into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChief, what I did was a very silly and stupid mistake. I didn\u2019t mean for Officer Hopps to be wound up like this,\u201d said Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYet your insubordinate actions have caused your partner to be lying in a hospital bed at the moment!\u201d Bogo yelled in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, I\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this playtime for you, Wilde?\u201d Bogo continued while standing up, \u201cYour days of being a kid are no more! You need to act up and prove to me that you\u2019re a true officer of the law! If not, you\u2019ll be let go and into the unknown, but until then, I\u2019m suspending you from fieldwork until further notice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBogo sat back down in his office chair, while Nick wasn\u2019t excited to hear this news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh c\u2019mon, Chief. One week out and I\u2019m temporarily grounded? I mean what can I do in the meantime.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be reassigned to work at your desk with some paperwork every day for the time being.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick facepalmed himself, \u201cUgh, great. I\u2019m gonna be stuck doing the most boring job in all the precinct.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Wilde, but when stuff like this happens, and you\u2019re responsible, you\u2019ll have to get used to reassignments every now and then. And I know you\u2019re still relatively new to this, but if you have any problems in general you can always come up to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Chief. But where exactly is my desk again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNext to Clawhauser\u2019s.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, that big guy who\u2019s into Gazelle all the way down in the lobby?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, he was reassigned back to regular desk duty just a few hours ago. The big guy slipped and fell on some wet floor next to one of my best men, next thing he knew is he broke that man\u2019s leg. Someone will take over for him upfront at the reception desk. In fact, I reassigned him just before you put dear Hopps to beddy-bye. Alright, now go to your desk and start working\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d said Nick, but then he thought \u201cUh, where\u2019s\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNorthwest from where you are. Same floor. All the cubicles look like S\u2019s. Not that hard to find\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick\u2019s new job at the ZPD was boring. He was stuck at his desk filing some important documents. But sitting across from Benjamin Clawhauser, a morbidly obese cheetah, was an entirely different feeling. He just picked up three boxes of a dozen donuts, as well as a six-pack of bottled Sunflower Soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Officer Wilde. It\u2019s nice to finally meet you\u201d said Clawhauser in excitement. He let go of the six-pack in order to greet Nick\u2019s hand, \u201cJudy has told me a lot about you. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re my new partner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClawhauser\u2019s bubbly and lighthearted personality at least gave Nick a little ray of sunshine from that dark cloud that\u2019s been hurtling around his head for the past few hours. Surprised by the way Clawhauser looks, he may have already felt like they became quick buddies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yeah. You can call me Nick. Apparently Bogo reassigned me to be with you for the time being.\u201d To which Nick replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I can\u2019t wait to start off this new friendship with you Nick.\u201d He sits down with the donuts in place. \u201cNow, I know what you\u2019re probably gonna ask me why I\u2019m this fat, but it\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve had people calling me that over the years, but I\u2019ve embraced it. I\u2019m happy with my body and who I am in general. I love being this big. I don\u2019t care if you complain at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s not gonna be me. I\u2019ve had friends growing up who were big as well, and I know how they feel when they\u2019re being called on.\u201d How long have you been working at the ZPD?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlmost 10 years.\u201d Clawhauser was already down a couple of donuts while answering the question. \u201cI was on active duty for my first three but then my partner, Jonny Colfax, hit his head on a cement wall while playing a little basketball.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh, sorry to hear that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, he\u2019s fine, his head\u2019s made of stone, but I don\u2019t wanna get into too much detail.\u201d Clawhauser continues to devour his first box of donuts. Nick on the other hand was surprised at how much he could eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut ever since then up until, just now I guess, you were working in the lobby?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor the most part.\u201d As Clawhauser just finished his first dozen.He then grabbed a bottle of Sunflower Soda to help wash down the donuts in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClawhauser then continued, \u201cSorry. Where are my manners? Do you want one? I heard from Judy that you love blueberries. There must be a few in there. I thought it would be nice to give you a little something sweet for a pretty salty day you\u2019ve been having\u201d He hands Nick a new box of donuts to which he\u2019s tempted in.</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m fine with whatever.\u201d Nick replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey keep walking down a few blocks until they reach a Mexican food truck called Locos con Todos. It is run by Julio, a jaguar who\u2019s about half the size of Clawhauser. He started his business just a few years ago after surprising his friends with his home cooking at a Cinco de Mayo celebration. Julio was sporting a long blue-collar shirt with his sleeves rolled up with an apron covering it up and a red baseball cap flipped backwards. His truck\u2019s usually parked close to the shopping district, but it wasn\u2019t too busy, despite being dinner time. When he saw Clawhauser coming up to his truck, he immediately knew his favorite customer was gonna bring a chunk of change to his business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHola, Benny,\u201d said Julio, \u201cHow\u2019s my favorite officer these days?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMuy Bueno, Julio\u201d Benny responded back with compassion, \u201cAs a matter of fact, I heard Gazelle\u2019s extending her residency at the Zootopian bowl till the end of next year.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, I figured. You won\u2019t find a singer more excelente than her. My little ni\u00f1a can not stop listening to her music.\u201d Julio didn\u2019t realize that Nick was there as well. \u201cHey, Benny, is he your new amigo?\u201d he said, pointing at Nick looking happy yet a little confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy yes, it is. Introduce yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, I\u2019m Officer Wilde. I was just assigned to be Benny\u2019s new partner for the time being.\u201d To which Nick responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell any amigo of Benny, is an amigo of mine.\u201d shouted Julio, \u201cAs a matter of fact, you two should order a lot,\u201d looking back at Benny demandingly, \u201cYour friend right here is all skin and bones. He needs to get grande!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s necessary at all. I\u2019m-\u201d Nick said, as he was trying to convince Julio he doesn\u2019t need the extra weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOfficers like you and Benny need to be well-fed every day. No officer needs to starve!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, thanks, but-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a simple si or no question. It\u2019s an order.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenny tries to calm Nick down, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about that, he just likes seeing people with a little more pudge around them. You\u2019re not gonna feel terrible about it. In fact, I won\u2019t mind seeing you a bit on the wide side, Officer WILDE.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenny was poking at Nick\u2019s shirt which was tight, but his stomach felt a little pudge. Now he felt completely guilty for trying to force himself out of it, and yet Clawhauser\u2019s silly move made him even feel more sympathetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, fine. I\u2019ll do it.\u201d said Nick, \u201cBut for one thing. As soon as Judy and I are back as partners, I\u2019m gonna plead Chief Bogo to offer you back your front desk position. From there, we can still see each other on a regular basis. I mean, I like you a lot, Benny, don\u2019t get me wrong. But promise me, no matter how big I get, I'm gonna start losing it afterward.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t really have to do it,\u201d Benny replied. \u201cIt\u2019s more like Julio\u2019s order in general.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if it\u2019s his or your order, I\u2019m gonna do it no matter what. I\u2019ll eat whatever you want, whenever you want, wherever you want. I\u2019ll eat however many you get. Okay, so whaddya say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBenny\u2019s eyes widened when he heard that spiel, \u201cOhhhhhhhhhhhh, it looks like Wilde\u2019s gonna get wide now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, fantastico,\u201d said Julio, \u201cSo what\u2019ll it be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, how many burritos are you getting Benny?\u201d said Nick while raising his arm midway through his torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, did I mention these burritos here are huge?\u201d said Benny. \u201cLet's get...\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The burrito has an Asian-based ingredient known as wheat gluten but is typically called \u201cSeitan\u201d,  it mostly acts as a meat substitute where it has a chicken taste to it. They cook it with diced green chilies and caramelized onions in a sweet and savory sauce, plus a mix of Colby jack and pepper jack cheese, plus big heaping portions of cilantro-lime rice, black beans, french fries, guacamole, and sour cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking through the window of the food truck, Nick was seeing how making that BIG of a burrito was somewhat oddly satisfying and making him hungrier. He then was thinking in his head, \"These things are MASSIVE! You can't eat all 3 of these, you'll only eat about half of one. YOU NEED TO STOP THIS, NICK! YOU'RE CRAZY!\", He should've thought twice about saying he would eat as much as Clawhauser, each one was about the size of his own foxy head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took about 30 seconds to assemble each one, and there were two of Julio\u2019s co-workers working on it. Within two minutes, Nick and Clawhauser\u2019s food was ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Order up\" shouted Julio as he rang a bell while carrying two big brown paper sacks on his other arm. Clawhauser grabbed the sacks from him that are filled with burrito goodness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMuchas gracias, Julio. You and your hombres are lifesavers,\u201d said Benny as he and Nick were about to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it,\u201d Julio replied, \u201cI hope your new friend will enjoy the pleasures of being big.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I hope for it.
