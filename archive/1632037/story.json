Kakashi had already left, and the three genin were just about to do the same when something caught Naruto's attention. He saw something sticking out of a bush. He walked over to it and pulled it out to see what it was. It was a scroll. The blond ninja then opened it up to read its contents. \"It looks instructions for a jutsu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of jutsu?\" Sakura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know. It doesn't say.\" Naruto said. \"Guess we'll just have to try it out to find out what it does.\" he said as he started doing the necessary seals to preform it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think thats such a good idea. You have no idea what it could do.\" Sakura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's right. We should take that to someone like Kakashi-sensei before you try it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, don't be so scared you two. It'll be fine.\" he said, just as he finished perfoming it. There was a flash of light that filled the three's vision.</span></div></div>",

She then turned and looked at Naruto. \"You! Its all your fault Naruto! If you hadn't messed around with that stupid scroll, none of this would have happened.\" she said as she took him by the collar and shook him. She then stopped as she realized that he was still in her body, and she didn't want to hurt herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do now?\" Naruto asked, hoping she would know what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura thought for a bit, then asked \"Why don't you try the jutsu again? Maybe it will fix this mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That a great idea, Sakura.\" Naruto said as he put his hands together, about to do the hand seals, but couldn't recall what they were. He tried to remember what he did, but nothing would come to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? Whats taking you so long?\" Sakura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh... I forgot the seals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura groaned. \"You're such an idiot some times. Lucky for you, I saw you do the whole thing. The seals were...\" she trailed off mid sentence. She couldn't remember the seals either! She tried to think of what they were, but couldn't remember them no matter how hard she tried. This was impossible! She had never forgotten the seals for a jutsu before, and her memory was amazing! It was as if the knowledge of what they were had been earased from her mind. \"Sorry. I can't remember them either...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two looked down, upset at the prospect of being stuck like this. Then Sakura realized something. \"The scrol! We'll just look in there for how to do it again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! Great idea again, Sakura!\" Naruto said. But that was when the two noticed that the scroll was nowhere to be found! \"Oh no! Where is it?\" Naruto said as the two were franticly looking around the area, but found nothing.</span></div></div>",

She didn't really seem to care about too much now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, none of them found the changes had taken place with them to be odd. While they noticed them to an extent, they didn't find them to be strange at all, and felt completely natural to them. As they walked, they came upon Team 8 on their way to the training grounds, who were each just as oblivious to their own changes as they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey.\" Hinata said uncaringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you guys off to?\" Kiba asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To get something to eat. I'm starved.\" Sasuke answered. \"What about guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got the day off, and we came here to do some serious training.\" Shino said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you want to waste a day off doing something troublesome like training?\" Sakura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, just cause you would waste a day off laying around doing nothing doesn't mean others would.\" Shino said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shino, weren't you ready to do just that until Hinata said she was going to train and then you said you didn't want her to get ahead of you?\" Kiba asked as he put his hands on his hips in a feminine manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, c'mon Kiba! Don't make me look bad!\" he whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit being so annoying.\" Hinata said coldly as she continued towards the training ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Just wait! I'm gonna train way harder than you!\" Shino said as he followed after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkamaru watched the exchange before him with confusion. Not only was his master and his teammates acting strange, but so were the members of Team 7.</span></div></div>",

Well, I guess I could. I could use something better to wear, too.\" he said. \"Sure, lets go do some shopping.\" he said, and with that, the two of them headed towards the village, with Akamaru following right behind them, still just as confused by his master's strage behavior.</span></div></div>",

Like how he now wore her clothes, she was now dressed in his signature oragne tracksuit, and had her headband tied around her forehead, with her pink hair now rather messy. She was looking down at herself, quite shocked by what she seemed to be wearing currently. She then looked up and noticed Naruto, and when she saw what he was wearing, she looked like she was about to explode in anger at him for wearing her clothes. However, before she could, Sasuke spoke up in a bored tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was a waste. It didn't do anything.\" Sasuke said, causing his teammates to stare at him, wondering why he didn't seem to notice what had happened to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing seems different to you?\" Sakura asked, dreading what she thought he was about to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Everything is the same as before you used that jutsu.\" he replied. \"Anyway, I'm heading home.\" And with that, he turned and headed back to the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Sakura stood there dumbfounded for a few minutes before Sakura regained her composure and rushed at the blonde. \"Alright Naruto, what the hell did you do!? Why are you in my clothes, and why didn't Sasuke notice anything was wrong!?\" she demanded as she shook him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know! I don't know!\" the blonde said repeatedly until she stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you did, undo it!\" she demaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, right. Well, first, where is that scroll?\" he asked. Sakura then noticed she had been holding the scroll, and handed it to him. After looking at how to do it, he did the same hand seals as before, but when he finished, nothing happened. Nervously, he tried again, and even a third time, but nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, give me that.\" Sakura said as she took the scroll from him. Reading it for a second, she did the handsels herself, but still nothing happened. \"Why isn't this working!?\" She then noticed some writing started to appear near the bottom. Reading it, it said: \"This technique only works on a person one a week. After which, the two it was used on switch lives. While it can be used on different people, those who it was used on are stuck like that for an entire week. No one but those who it has been used on will notice any differences, and will be treated by others as the person they have switched with, and they will also switch all abilities and techniques, including bloodlines. This scroll must be present when using this technique.\" After a few more minutes, the writing disappeared again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'll we do now, Sakura?\" Naruto asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How should I know! This is your fault!\" she yelled at him. \"Now we're stuck as eachother for a whole week!\" After a while, she calms down, and they talk about what they will do with the current situation. After some discussion, they decide to try and live as echother for the week</span></div></div>",

As they walked, Kiba couldn't help his curiosity, and opened the scroll to take a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what are you doing? You shouldn't just go looking through someone elses stuff like that.\" Hinata reasoned. She didn't think he should go looking through Naruto's stuff like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring her, he looked over the scroll seeing the instructions for a jutsu. \"Huh, I wonder what this does?\" he said, starting to form the hand seals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiba!\" Hinata said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah don't worry, Hinata.\" he said, and then finished the jutsu.

Her sandals were the first thing to change; the colour shifted from blue to red, matching her dress, as the hole at the front where her toes poked out sealed up. In exchange, the tops of her sandal began to shrink, revealing her ankles and the tops of her feet as the material changed into a harder, shinier substance. Finally, the heels at the back slowly rose up, becoming taller and thinner until Sakura's sandals had completed their transformation into red four-inch stilleto heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what the!?\" Sakura shouted, looking at her new footwear. Naruto blushed immensely at seeing his crush wearing such... risque footwear, while Sasuke's eyes simply widened at the change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't the only change however, as Sakura quickly felt her shorts begin to rapidly lengthen and slither down her legs. As they did, the material changed from spandex to nylon, and the colour faded from dark blue to bubblegum pink. The shorts-turned-pantyhose completed their changes by slipping into Sakura's new shoes, completely encasing her feet. As they did, her bra and panties dissappeared<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing tremendously, Sakura cried out as she grabbed the front and back of her dress and pulled it down, trying to preserve her modesty that was on display thanks to the sheer material. When she did, however, she felt the two ends merge over her crotch, changing her dress into a sort of leotard. The neckline began to plung as her sleeves shrank and vanished; the white designs vanished as the upper area dissappeared until her shoulders and upper chest were on display. The leotard stiffened as it changed material, pushing her budding breasts upward and giving the illusion that they were bigger while showing off what cleavage she had. A white cotton tail materialised just above Sakura's butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sakura fearfully felt her new costume, she noticed a white shirt-cuff appear on each of her wrists, held in place with a golden button shaped like the Konoha symbol. She felt a weight on her throat as a matching shirt collar formed with a matching red bowtie. Finally, the headband she wore in her hair shrank into a regular hairband, as two white rabbit ears sprang out of it, completing the transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what the hell is this!?\" screamed Sakura at seeing her new outfit. She didn't have time to ponder what was happening, as she quickly found her own body moving against her will. Her pantyhose-clad legs took step after step, her hips swaying seductively on their own as she moved towards the two shell-shocked boys. Standing in front of one, she gently leaned forward and kissed him on the lips. It was only for a few seconds, but Sakura blushed bright red as she gave her first kiss away, but more importantly it \"passed\" the change onto the boy, who would soon also be dressed in a similar outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who was it she kissed?</span></div></div>",

As she backed away, the boy opened his mouth to say something, when an odd feeling came over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what was...\" he began, but was cut off as he felt his sandals changing. Glancing down, he gasped as he saw them begin to go through a similar transformation to Sakura's; the toes sealed up, the colour changed, the heels raised and they became four inch stiletto pumps. The only difference was his were orange, unlike Sakura's red shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" gasped Naruto in horror, as the change continued up his body. His trousers became a pair of dark brown tights, contrasting Sakura's pink ones, while his jacket became an orange leotard with a bunny tail. Unlike Sakura, Naruto lacked breasts so rather than emphasising them like it did with her's, Naruto's outfit was slightly padded to give the illusion of a figure and bust. A white collar, matching cuffs and a rabbit-ear headband completed the outfit, and now both genin were in colour-coded bunny uniforms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto immediately grabbed at the top of his leotard, but began to smooth it down as he soon lost control of his body. His mouth forced itself into a smile as the two children strut their way over to Sasuke, hips swinging with each step. The Uchiha prodigy was in such a shock that he didn't realise what was happening until his teammates were each holding onto an arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Sasuke could pull free, Naruto and Sakura leaned forward, raised one pantyhose-clad leg each, and kissed the remaining child on the cheek.</span></div></div>",

Additionally, each of their fingers now ended in false nails that were manicured to perfection and painted in colours that matched their outfits (red for Sakura, blue for Sasuke and orange for Naruto).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Sasuke's eyebrows had been expertly plucked and shaped into thin, feminine arcs just like Sakura's, right before the three of them tried out every form of makeup the salon had. Long false eyelashes were glued to their face before being coated in multiple layers of black mascara and matching eyeliner, while their lips were now a shiny pink colour and their eyelids were dusted with eyeshadow that matched their nails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile their faces were being madeup, another set of salon staff had gone to work on their hair, putting in extensions and washing it with a variety of women's shampoos. Now, each of the genin now had long, silky smooth hair; Sakura's looked just like her style before she cut it in the Chunin exams; Sasuke's looked like his usual stye, only long enough to extend past his shoulders; while Naruto's was long enough to reach his butt, and was put up in two oversized pigtails causing it to resemble his Sexy Jutsu's hairstyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd for one final \"gift\" (read: blow to Naruto and Sasuke's manhood), the three of them absolutely reeked of the girliest perfume available as the three of them sashayed down the street.

This letter was sent to all three members of team  7 and like good little ninjas they all went to the location. Arriving there Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura began to talk about what they thought the letter was about. This went on for many minutes until they heard a voice telling them to come inside the closest house. When they entered they saw a familiar face Danzo. This immediately worried the team and they began to question him about why they were called. Danzo responded by explaining what had happened earlier that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>earlier that day </b>l<br>\r\nTsunade was having lunch at her house with her friends Anko and Kurenai when suddenly an assassin jumps through the open window and poisons all three this left each of them in a dire condition.<br>\r\n<b>back to the present </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanzo then told team 7 there new mission they must pretend to be the trio while they recover in a secret military hospital. They must each pose as one of the members to not arouse suspicion. Before each member had time to respond Danzos men had placed a seal on them. Danzo then explained that he would change Sasuke in to Tsunade because he was the most responsible, Anko in to  Sakura because he thought they were very similar and Naruto into Kurenai to screw with him. And just like that he put chakara into all three seals and they began to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura became taller, her breasts enlarged to a modest c cup, her hair became dark and her hips grew slightly. Sasuke became much taller, he grew huge breasts, his hair went from dark to blonde his hips widened and he grew a large ass and finally his voice changed. Naruto also began taller, grew breasts, changed hair and changed voice but unlike the others whose stomachs grew tough and muscly his began large and round <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the transformation finished team 7 were in shock. After Danzo inspected his creations he clicked and three people rushed in each carrying a bag of clothes they then dressed them in their respective clothing and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this was over Danzo told them that the fate of the village was in there hands.</span></div></div>",

After a bit of this he took down her pants and panties. Going over to a mirror he started intently at her body as he rub her tits and gently played with vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura was transported to Ankos house.

We've tried everything short of activating it to find out what this machine is, and what it does, but nothing has yielded results.\" the researcher responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, if that is the only way to discover what this thing does, then that is what must be done.\" he said. \"The only question now is where to find the right guinea pigs to test it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another part of the Soul Society, Ichigo Kurosaki and friends were walking. He along with Orihine, Uryu, and Chad had recently come to the Soul Society to do some training, and met up with Rukia and Renji. As they made their way to where they planned to do the training, they came to a clearing where they came upon and strange machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is this thing?\" Ichigo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I've never seen anything like it.\" Rukia said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think it does?\" Orihime asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know. Maybe we should turn it on and find out.\" Renji suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not so sure that's such a good idea.\" Uryu said. \"We have no idea what that thing does, so activating it would just be foolish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds to me like you're just scared. C'mon, whats the worst that could happen?\" the red-haired shinigami asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not! For all we know, it could be a bomb! Are you sure you want to be an idiot and activate it without knowing what potential danger it could cause?\" the Quincy argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That still sounds like you're scared! And don't call me an idiot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you guys doing?\" they heard someone ask, interrupting the argument between Uryu and Renji. They looked over and saw the captain and lieutenant of the 10th division, Toushiro Hitsugaya and Rangiku Matsumoto, and the 5th division's lieutenant, Momo Hinamori approach them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Toushiro.\" Ichigo greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Captain Hitsugaya.\" the boy corrected him for the umpteenth time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that thing?\" Mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know; we just found it here.\" Orihime said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what it does.\" Rangiku said curiously. \"Maybe we should turn it and find out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Doing that without knowing what it does will just cause problems!\" Uryu tried to reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, come on. What's the worst that could happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plenty!\" the Quincy stated, irritated that he was having the same arguement for a second time. \"You don't know what could happen if you turn it on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I want to know what it does.\" she whined. \"What do you think captain? Don't you want to know what it does?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" the white haired boy responded. \"I agree with him; activating it without knowing what it does would just be stupid, and I'm sure it will just cause trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, you're no fun! Where's your sense of curiosity?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't touch it.\" a voice commanded them, and they turned to the source to see the Captain of the 2nd Division, Soi Fon shunpo in. \"That machine was planted there by Captain Kurotsuchi. Knowing him, this is part of some kind of bizarre experiment. The area around that machine is to be quarantined until it can be safely removed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUryu gave Renji an 'I told you so' look before saying \"Let's get out of here. I have no intention of being part of one of that lunatic's experiments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for them, the machine had been set with a remote activation device that the mad scientist had planted to activate it himself if the ones who discovered it did not do it. The machine instantly activated before any of them could leave, and there was a blinding flash that engulfed all those present.</span></div></div>",

As he stood up, he felt different, but wasn't sure why. There was a strange weight now on his chest, and his clothes now felt a bit baggier. He also had a headache, and as he put his hand to his head, he noticed that his hair was now much longer. He then looked down, and almost screamed when he saw the pair of breasts that he now possessed. He then reached down to check, and found that he also now possessed a vagina as well. \"Alright, stay calm. This is just some sort of dream...\" he, or now she, said to herself, noticing her voice had changed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you you?\" she heard a groggy voice, and turned to see a boy with short orange hair, dressed in Orihime clothes. \"Whats wrong with my voice? And why are my clothes so tight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Orihime?\" she asked the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know me? Wait...\" the boy responded, as he examined the now female subsitute shinigami. \"Ichigo? Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, its me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and you a boy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" he said as he looked down, finally noticing the change. \"Woah! I'm a boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew something bad would happen...\" the heard a voice and turned to see the now female Uryu getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one, Chad, Rukia, Renji, Rangiku, Toushiro, Momo, and Soi Fon all came too, all now the opposite gender than what they were before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! My breasts! My figure! They're gone!\" Rangiku whined at his current situation. \"It took me years to get them like that!\" The others ignored his complaints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say it.\" Renji said as she looked over at Uryu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say what? That I was right?\" the Quincy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I didn't touch it! This isn't my fault!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He... er... She... Renji is right. No one touched it, so then how did it go off?\" Ichigo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain Kurotsuchi probably set it up to activate it remotely. He probably figured not everyone would dumb enough to activate it.\" Toushiro said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do?\" Chad asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As much as I'd like to find the captain and make him turn us back, maybe we should find some more fitting clothes. Some of us need it more then others.\" Rukia said. The now females turned to him and the other now males. Rukia, who had been pretty short before, had gained a few feet, and his uniform no longer fit him properly at all, and was much to small for his new body. Orhime hadn't gotten much bigger, but his clothes were meant for a girl's body, which was something he no longer had. As for Soi Fon, like Rukia he had also gotten bigger and his uniform had been meant for a smaller frame, and it was even worse for him with the tight uniform for the head leader of the Onmitsukido he wore underneath it. And while he didn't voice his opinion, they could tell he had similar comfort problems. The only ones without a problem with their clothes was Rangiku, who was still mourning the loss of his breasts and figure, and Momo, who tried to calm Rangiku down.</span></div></div>",

While not as big as Orihime's had been, in Kon's eyes, they were almost as magnificent, even if they were Ichigo's. \"Oh, Ichigo! I never knew you could look so good!\" he yelled out passionately as he leaped at her. A little taken by surprised, she was unprepared for the mod soul, and he latched onto her new breasts.

Ichigo decided to take in her appearance while she waited, walking over to a nearby mirror. As she had noticed earlier, her hair had grown longer, going down to her mid back now. It still resembled his old style, being more wild than straight, spiking out a bit. Her face had also softened up, and was a bit more round and feminine. She then looked down as her new friends on her chest. While she didn't want to think about it, she thought that they looked to be about a c cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then decided to take a look at the others affected. Chad looked like she had gotten a bit smaller, and looked to be a bit less muscular, but was still taller than the rest of them. Uryu looked as if her hair had lengthened by a few inches, and her face looked considerably different, being much more feminine. Renji hair had lengthened by a lot, turning her previously spiky ponytail into a much longer one, and her face had changed even more than Uryu's. And the last of the former males, Toshiro, her hair had grown much longer, and face had rounded out a bit. If it wasn't for her scowl, she might have looked like a cute young girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then started to take the former females looks in. Orihime didn't look too different. His hair had shortened by a lot and was now styled neatly into a short style, and his face, while having some changes to give it a slightly more masculine appearance, still looked close enough to his face when he was a girl, giving somewhat of a 'pretty boy' look. He then looked over at Rukia. As noted before, he had gotten taller. His hair had lost some length, but was still a bit long. His face was also more masculine, and somewhat resembled Byakuya a bit. Rangiku was the next he looked at. His hair had stayed fairly long, and his face seemed to have . Momo's hair had shortened in length, and he seemed to have an androgynous face. Soi Fon had gotten taller and the once petite woman's face, like Rukia's new one, had grown considerably more masculine, and he seemed like almost a different person than his previous self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'They all look kinda cute...' Ichigo found herself thinking absentmindedly. She then shook her head, wondering where that thought had come from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so bored!\" Rangiku whined as he leaned in the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to agree with you there.\" Renji said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its pointless just sitting here and waiting. Lets do something elsewhere.\" Rangiku suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. Its fine for most of you, but I don't want anyone I know to see me like this.\" Ichigo said. 'Keigo, for example, would never let me live it down if he saw me like this.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no one is gonna recognize you looking like that anyway.\" Rangiku said. \"Besides, all you have to do is get a change of clothes and they'll never even know it was you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo found himself glancing at the mirror. He was still wearing his own clothes. He also found a part of him actually thought he was right, and that he could get some new clothes. \"Fine, I guess we could go somewhere else as long as no one recognizes me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm waiting here.\" I don't want to be seen in public like this either, plus I'd rather wait to get this resolved as soon as possible.\" Toshiro said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also plan on waiting here.\" Soi Fon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRangiku whispered something into Momo's ear and he nodded before walking over to Toshiro and grabbing her shoulders and standing her up. Rangiku likewise held Soi Fon by the shoulders. \"Oh, come on you two! Lighten up and don't be so serious! Its not gonna reverse the problem so lets all just go somewhere and have fun until they need us!\" Rangiku said as she and Momo dragged the two captains out of the room.

This may not actually be her body, but it wasn't like she was going to be attracted to her nude reflection. That'd be downright bizarre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrushing off her thoughts, Ichigo slipped into the outfit carefully. Feeling the too brush against her chest was incredibly strange and she grimaced at the thought of purchasing a bra. She'd never hear the end of it from the other guys-turned-girls. They were all getting outfits though and she needed to be practical. Plus if it rained, it would cause a lot of trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing her little dress up and rationalizing, Ichigo once again returned her gaze to the mirror. A cute girl stared back. Still hard to see that as her. The outfit looked good though, very flattering. Against her better nature, she posed, just a little. A cool posture here. A ready-to-brawl pose there. A few cute gestures, like curling her fingers behind her back or brushing hair out of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small, content smile began to climb her face.</span></div></div>",

They had been doing some diving for exercise while they rested in the harbour, and he had found it at the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" shouted Luffy, as ran over to chest; it was bigger than he was. \"It's so huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get your hopes up, Luffy.\" chuckled Sanji as he walked over. \"Knowing Marimo it's probably full of junk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro growled and shot the cook a death glare. He was too tired after his swim to bother arguing, though, so he just flipped his middle finger at him and went back to wringing out his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what're we waiting for!?\" announced Nami, Belli signs already in her eyes. \"Open it, open it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Nami...\" muttered Usopp as he picked the chest's lock. \"You've gotta be careful with these things. They could be boobytrapped or anythi...\" he was cut off by a loud click. \"Got it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsopp and Luffy pushed the humongous lid back, revealing a huge variety of gold, jewels, antiques and pretty much everything else of value.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" shouted Chopper, his eyes widening in wonder. \"So pretty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so shiny...\" gasped Brook. \"Why, I think it's starting to hurt my eyes! ....except I don't have eyes! Yohohohohoho!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've really outdone yourself, swordsman-san.\" stated Robin with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, swordsman!\" laughed Franky with a thumbs-up. \"You did a SUPER job!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy drooled as he stared at their newfound treasure. However, something quickly caught his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? What's this?\" he asked, as he plucked out some sort of gold amulet from the pile. It was round with a blue jewel in the middle; it didn't seem any different from the piles and piles of jewelry already in the chest. And yet, there was something about it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy didn't have time to ponder this any further. The amulet immediately reacted to his touch as the jewel glowed, before releasing a blinding light from it that engulfed the entire crew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" shouted Luffy as he attempted to shield his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luffy!\" screamed Zoro. \"What did you do!?\"</span></div></div>",

He would never be tough enough or strong enough. He did his best to work around these factors but... it still hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, that fear had vanished. Being so weak just... didn't bother him anymore. It wouldn't stop him from working hard, but it felt him feeling far more comfortable than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery now and then, he couldn't stop himself from looking in the mirror and feel a profound sense of disappointment. It was several different things. His hair was too messy. His body too lanky. His skin too rough. But worst of all was... the nose. That long, obstructive nose. It had looked nice on his mother. But on him... it was so gross. How could people stand to look at him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd never be cute or beautiful like the others like this. Perhaps... perhaps he could borrow something from Robin that could help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro's changes were more subtle. He had never been one to care about appearance and that wasn't about to change. His thoughts turned to his childhood. All the remarks about Kuina's womanhood. The certainty that she could be never as strong as the men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, it felt so much more infuriating than usual. He began training twice as hard, three times as hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd show them the power of the greatest swordswoman in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanji's was more distinct. As he cooked, his movements shifted. Even more refined. Even more careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe threw out the smokes. It wasn't proper. He had certain rules to follow. He couldn't go around being so harsh. He needed to be... softer. Sweeter. He had to give love to the crew, love to the big, strong handsome men. Those bastions of masculinity, protecting the weak and fragile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman's touch was exactly what this place needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy huffed. They didn't have to be so mean...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChopper was checking on the captain's bruises, making sure they weren't anything serious. He smoothed a band-aid over Luffy's arm. \"Should be good at new soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! Thanks Chopper!\" But before the captain could run off to play again, he paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why this one?\" Chopper had drawn a little flower on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor looked away, blushing. \"I just... thought it was cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy considered. \"...you're right! It is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Like you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh- stop it, I hate you, you think I'd fall for compliments like that?!\" But he was wobbling around in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shifts in crew mentality were slow but certain.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A light wind blew through the window. The sounds of birds chirping and people starting about their day caused a red-haired girl to slowly stir. Ranma Saotome shuffled in her sheets before managing to force herself up. She stretched her arms wide, trying to pop all the kinks in her muscles. She blinked blearily at the light shining in from the window, slowly waking up for the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's strange... Pops usually tries to sneak attack me by now...</i> But she decided to take her blessings where she could as she climbed to her feet. She was too sleepy to pay much attention to her surroundings, but there was a sense of unease in the back of her mind. Something was definitely different about the shared guest room today. For one thing, there wasn't a sight of Genma anywhere. Not even his mat was here. And the room seemed... cleaner than usual. Less of a mess of their typical Saotome laziness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she had her full faculties, she might notice that she herself hadn't gotten up from a mat, but a full bed. That her clothes were in a drawer that wasn't there yesterday and weren't quite the same clothes that they were the previous night. But with little more than a yawn, she strolled out the door, heading off to the bathroom. She splashed hot water on her face, waiting patiently for the shift back to manliness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it didn't arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tug of panic gripped her stomach before she brushed off the concern. The water just must not be hot enough. One boiling tea kettle would do the trick. Pushing her fear down, she continued her trek down to the main Tendo dining room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning,\" she mumbled as she emerged from the stairs. Nabiki and Soun were invested in different parts of the paper, while Kasumi worked to set down the breakfast. Akane was already munching on some toast with jam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good morning, Ranma-chan.\" Kasumi smiled brightly at the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to see you up, my girl!\" Soun wasn't far behind her in spirits, chipper as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" Nabiki as apathetic as always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut oddest of all was Akane's surprisingly kind smile. There wasn't a trace of her usual anger on her features. \"Morning, Ranma.\" A trace of a smirk crawled up her lips. \"You're going to make us late again, sleeping in like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waved her off. \"Like it takes long for me to get ready anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabiki snorted. \"You've barely even washed up. Wouldn't want Kuno to see you make-up-less.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma groaned and shivered. \"Don't even joke about that....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, your uniform is clean and ready for you in the family room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUniform? Ranma had never gotten a uniform. Or if he had, he'd quickly lost it. Curious, she peeked into the family room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly there had to be a mistake. The only male clothes among the laundry was Soun's stuff. \"Are you sure, Kasumi? I don't see it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be silly, Ranma. Its the third pile, right next to Akane's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe checked again. Right next to Akane's clothes was a girl's uniform, along with some other skirts and bras and such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Kasumi, stop fooling. There's only girl's stuff here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a few seconds of silence from the kitchen. \"...What else would there be, Ranma-chan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma could only look between the clothes and kitchen in absolute confusion. Something... something was wrong. Kasumi wouldn't joke about this. Kasumi didn't really joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what the hell was going on? What sort of world did he trip into?</span></div></div>",

Not <i>\"his\"</i> head, of course, because she still wasn't changing back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ranma?! What are you doing?!\" Kasumi was there in an instant, trying to clean up the girl and the floor. \"You've caused such a mess....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabiki snickered to herself. \"Really needed to wake up, huh Ranma?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane, once again, surprised Ranma by looking at her with genuine concern. \"Is everything okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma could only look at them then back at her hands, brow furrowing. \"I'm not changing back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back to what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach Tendo (sans Nabiki of course) were fixing her with looks of concern and alarm. Like she had never dumped hot water on herself before. Like there was nothing for him to transform back into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if that was the case, well... explaining a curse might not be the best move right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Don't worry about it. Just... tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by the one, the Tendos reluctantly accepted the explanation. \"Well, hurry up, Ranma. We're gonna be late!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to sneak away to go investigating. Surely the old hag knew something about this mess. And where was Pops? But Akane was keeping a close hold on her now, insisting Ranma get dressed and ready to go. She was almost ready to force Ranma into the skirt herself if the martial artist hadn't finally relented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been in skirts before, but never the school uniform. And the schoolbag that Akane had accused her of forgetting. It felt like Ranma was stuck on a rail today. No matter what she did to get off the track, she was quickly herded back into the position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see why you're in such a big fuss, Akane...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because Kuno and his cronies, of course. You might not care, but I don't want to be carrying buckets in the hall again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe zeroed in on Akane. Kuno's cronies...? \"They're still bugging you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane laughed. \"God, you can't be so strong that you've stopped noticing.\" But her good cheer vanished, teeth tightening. \"Those stupid boys never stop...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd sure enough, the mass of boys fighting for Akane's attention were waiting for them at the school courtyard. The two girls quickly made short work of them, kicking and punching them aside. Ranma felt her stomach churn. They all had a wolf-like gleam in their eyes. And not all of them were focused on Akane. A good number of them were focused on her too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of them tried to grab her ass, so she quickly knocked out her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were late, of course, and they had to stand outside in the halls once more. But Akane didn't seem to mind. She was focused on other priorities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe what that creep tried to do to you!\" Akane hissed in righteous anger, offended on her behalf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma growled, staring at the little cracks between the floor tiles. \"I don't even want to think about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They normally don't manage to get as close as that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flashed angry eyes at her fiance. \"So what, its my fault?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Akane didn't engage in her usual banter, shaking her head quickly. \"Of course not! I was just worried... you've been off your groove all day...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grumbled again, returning her gaze to the floor. \"This never would have happened if I was a man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane sighed, looking relieved. \"You say that all the time. At least you still sound like yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...That's right. She remembered now. When she first came to the Tendo house, Akane had been nothing but nice to her. It was only when she turned back into a man that Akane started whacking him with hammers and fists and so on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this what would have happened if she had never turned back?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was easy to notice other changes now that she had a theory to work off of. Ranma just had to think of it as a battle. Movements and positions on the board had changed, but once she had it all lined out, everything would come together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first noticeable change was Akane. She was nicer than she ever had been before. She practically doted over Ranma, walking everywhere together. Even when she tried to start an argument like before, Akane just let it roll off her like it wasn't a big deal. To this Akane, Ranma was a fellow martial artist who she'd trained with and lived with for ages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second change was the other classmates. Boys would eye her from a distance, while girls practically fawned over her. No longer was Ranma the potential pervert who Akane was stuck with. Ranma and Akane were local heroes, for fighting off the all too eager boys and the dangerous likes of Happosai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabiki and Kuno were roughly unchanged. Ranma supposed that for them, business and obsessive love were the only things they could focus on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as far as she could tell, there wasn't any sign of Shampoo and Ryoga. Ranma tried testing Akane's memory, but only Shampoo sparked a reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, hopefully she's still out of town. I don't want to deal with the likes of her anytime soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Shampoo hadn't been around in a while. Had she still been cursed? Or did she have no reason to train at Jusenkyo if she never learned Ranma was really a man? And where the hell did Pops get off to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the end of the school day, Ranma once again found herself in a position of freedom. Akane swung around her schoolbag casually. \"Anything you wanted to do? We could hit the ice cream parlor again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma tried to egg her on one last time. \"It could be nice to sweet talk my way into free treats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut simply Akane rolled her eyes. \"I'll never understand how you're this shameless.\"</span></div></div>",

Anyways, being with Akane like this was... nice, in a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, why not?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane stopped short when she heard these words. Ranma sidled up to her, arms behind her head in typical fashion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her casual intent was completely ignored by Akane. Ranma went rigid when she felt a monstrous strength encircle itself around her and spin her around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane was up and ahead of her in a few seconds with a cheery gait, almost dragging the dizzy Ranma after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Ranma\u2019s delight, the store Akane had taken her to was familiar \u2014 the parlor where she had eaten her first sundae. Happy at one of the few good things to happen today, she excitedly ordered a Strawberry Supreme as Akane ordered Death by Chocolate with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finding a booth to sit in and giving a quick thanks, both of the girls started to dig in to their respective sundaes \u2014 one a bit more messily than the other.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTheir conversation was brief, but nice. Topics mostly drifted around stupid boys at school, and went into some fighting talk from there. Ranma was a little surprised \u2014 she knew Akane could hold her own in a fight, but she could articulate her techniques surprisingly well<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Conversation died down, however, when Akane spied Dr. Tofu out the window. Ranma sullenly spooned ice cream into her mouth as Akane made googly-eyes at the doctor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>She never looked at <b>me</b> like that before...</i>\u2019 Ranma pouted to herself, the embers of jealousy still smoldering in this strange new world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought popped up in Ranma\u2019s head.

Whatever normalcy that Akane's presence granted was gone, and the sense of unease started to blossom into anxiety, gnawing in her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides her current form, things weren't exactly <i>unpleasant</i> \u2014 excepting the band of perverts in the courtyard \u2014 but everything was just wrong enough to be uncomfortable. Pa and Happosai weren't the best to have around, yet it was just... quieter without them. It was nice to not have to fight Kuno every time the wannabe Casanova saw Akane and her together, but she was greeted with a metric ton of love letters from him every time she opened her shoe locker. She didn't have to contend with Ryoga and Shampoo, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cold chill ran across her back as she connected the pieces. A world where she was always a girl. There wasn't a single person wondering if she was a man. So, then, what could've happened to Shampoo and Ryoga?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma would've never considered herself a good Samaritan, but something about their potential situation made her stomach churn.

At least they had the decency to look sad after admitting to not seeing a black piglet or a blue kitten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, the sun was setting, and Ranma was beat. Even her normally inexhaustible supply of stamina was flagging after the day she had, and bed seemed a wonderful alternative to exerting herself further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStretching her arms behind her head, she turned the corner into a shortcut she hadn't used in a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to her surprise, she was greeted with success, rather than a shorter way home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And as if she needed that final confirmation, a familiar bandana had been firmly tied around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quick as she could, she lifted up the little guy from the ground. Ryoga immediately started squirming in a panic, BWEEEing incessantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryoga! Relax! It's me! Ranma!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pig stopped at the name drop, turning to fix Ranma with a curious squint. She could almost see the slow gears struggling to move forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, don't tell me you forgot about our battle. You kept me waiting for days!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat finally did the trick. With the final penny drop, the pig's eyes light up in a rage. With a fearsome BWEEEE, he leapt from Ranma's grip in a flawed attempt at an attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't deny it though, the biting hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Would y- ow! Would you relax?! I'm just trying to- OW! Quit it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a lot of doing to get Ryoga to relax. She had to let him think he was winning a battle before he began to let up. He was so sensitive: the slightest thing would set him off. But more importantly, the pattern was holding. Ryoga couldn't turn back in hot water either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn due time, she managed to sit him down at a table in the ice cream shop. Other girls smiled and fawned over the famed Ranma and her pet, much to both of their displeasure. But once their food had been acquired, Ranma got to work. Ryoga watched in irritated fascination as Ranma scibbled letters on notebook paper. Satisfied, she set it down before him. Very letters and words in English and Japanese were laid out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, here's how we'll do this. You ever used a Ouija board?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pig shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" She tapped her finger on an English P. \"All you gotta do is point to the letter or word you want to say. So P C H A N for P-Chan, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother frustrated BWEE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh pipe down. It's a way to talk, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pig rolled his little eyes before quickly taking to the paper, hopping on each letter he required. Ranma leaned in eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-A-N-M-A-S-A- oh for pete's sake- yeah, it's me, Ranma Saotome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pig glared again, continuing his hops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-O-U-W-I-L-L-P-A-Y-F-O- look, Ryoga, I get it, I'll pay for hurting your honor or whatever, is this really the time for this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pig continued unabated in his long speech before Ranma finally picked him up to frantic BWEEEs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Focus on the priority here! Both of us are stuck like this and we need to find a way out. We can fight later!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with the BWEEs, Ranma had known his rival long enough to pick up on certain intentions and feelings. The man wore his heart on his... pigskin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need an equal battle, right? So you gotta get back to normal first. It's not fair otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyoga bweed a quiet grumble, but the words seemed to have an effect. Satisfied, Ranma set him back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we're agreed. Then I need to check something: when you challenged me to our first battle, what gender was I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pig gave him the most confused look Ranma had ever seen. Which was saying something, considering Nerima.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just answer, okay? I need to figure out how this curse works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnoyed, Ryoga got to hopping. M-A-N.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood. That meant before Jusenkyo, people still remembered he was a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Then what do you remember after that? With the curse and onward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyoga looked down at the page warily, already dreading having to hop so many times. Ranma leaned back with her ice cream, patiently watching his story unfold.</span></div></div>",

Ranma stood practically motionless in front of the last two pieces of clothing she hadn\u2019t thrown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, Ranma? You doing alright there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma slowly turned towards her, a mixture of disgust and horror on her face. Her attention wasn\u2019t fully on Akane, but on the content of her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bra, bright pink, covered in lace, glitter, and at least four different shades of pink. Small butterflies were embroidered on the front of the cups, and, worst of all, it had the name \u2018Ranma\u2019 stenciled on the inside in a flowing, feminine script. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWords finally came to Ranma\u2019s lips. \u201cIt\u2019s so, so\u2026\u201d Her mouth opened and closed in sheer shock, all the assorted curses she learned came to mind. Her grip slowly tightened on the clothes, her knuckles turning white as her face turned red. \u201cIt\u2019s so \u2014!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane cut her off. \u201cYeah, I get it, it\u2019s not your color, but your mom <i>insisted</i>.\u201d A nervous expression made its way onto her face. \u201cSpeaking of which, you should get dressed and made up \u2014 we\u2019ll clean this up before sh\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane\u2019s panicked rant was interrupted by a familiar voice. \u201cOh dear, what\u2019s all this?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, god no.\u201d Akane groaned. Quickly maneuvering Ranma slightly out of view of the doorframe, the two girls peeked out the door, Ranma\u2019s face reflecting frank bemusement, Akane\u2019s resigned acceptance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGentle footfalls accompanied by a heavy <i>thunk</i> echoed throughout the house. Through the doorway, Ranma could see a slim figure carrying a conspicuously long covered package. Ranma squinted, trying to make out the person \u2014 wait, did Akane say \u2018your mom?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodoka stopped at the table, shooting a warm smile at the three remaining Tendos there, Soun returning a slightly nervous grin, Kasumi almost perfectly reflecting the pleasant expression, and Nabiki giving a nominal wave. \u201cGood morning, all. I\u2019m quite sorry for sleeping in \u2014 I stayed up quite late making a new outfit~!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held up two pieces of clothing that were only barely recognizable as a Furinkan High School \u2014 the white shirt had various faux-gemstones embedded into the white shirt, accompanied by a small unicorn patch on the back. The skirt was shortened to mid thigh, the bottom notably more \u2018ruffled\u2019 than the standard. Everyone gaped in horror, sans Nabiki, who gave an amused smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoun was the first to speak up, the trembling of his held newspaper belying his nerves. \u201cS-say, Nodoka, isn\u2019t that a bit\u2026 much for school?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodoka simply responded with a light giggle, letting the long package rest in the crook of her arm. \u201cNo need to worry, Soun-san, I cleared it with Kuno-san. He said it was just like what they wore in Hawaii, so I just had to sit through one of his presentations on bowl-cuts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoun swallowed anxiously, but pressed forward regardless. \u201cWell, I meant to say, shouldn\u2019t you let Ranma decide for herself\u2026?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodoka only tilted her head lightly in confusion. \u201cMy, my Soun-san, you know I can\u2019t do that.\u201d She walked towards the laundry room, seemingly leaving it at that. Soun\u2019s white-knuckled grip loosened on his paper, a large sigh of relief leaving his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Nodoka whirled around, the cloth around her parcel unwinding, and Soun\u2019s face paled. \u201cI, um, quite understand, Saotome-san, there\u2019s no need to\u2014!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Nodoka paid him no mind, and started to unsheath the family katana. \u201cIt was fourteen years ago, when Ranma-chan was a cute little baby.\u201d She fumbled when pulling out the blade, accidentally leaving the blade piercing the floor, much to Soun\u2019s dismay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlthough Genma and I were happy together, we knew there <i>must</i> be a heir to the Anything Goes school!\u201d She half-mindedly yanked the blade out of the ground and sliced it to her side, tearing a large hole in the rice-paper wall. Ranma watched the not-quite-familiar display with dread fascination, a ball of trepidation squirming in her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI begged Genma to take us with him, but he refused. \u2018It\u2019s too dangerous for women,\u2019 he said, and I knew in my heart of hearts that he was right.\u201d Tears sprung to Nodoka\u2019s eyes, and her next wild movement sent the tip of the blade right through Soun\u2019s newspaper, turning his ashen face into a bright white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd so I swore that I would raise Ranma to be the most womanly woman, or else\u2026\u201d She accidentally let go of the katana mid-flail, sending it soaring directly into the laundry room door, inches away from Ranma, eliciting a short but loud squawk of fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c... we would commit seppuku together, having failed as a wife and daughter!\u201d The last words of Nodoka spurred Ranma to hasty action as she desperately searched for the dropped underwear with Akane\u2019s assistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer reverie over, Nodoka only now seemed to realize the swathe of destruction she had caused, not to mention the katana she had left embedded in the laundry room door. She lifted a hand to her mouth in concern. \u201cOh dear. I\u2019m quite sorry for the mess, Soun \u2014 I\u2019ll be sure to repair it later today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoun merely responded with a shaky thumbs up, his breath still taken away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving a small bow of thanks, Nodoka walked over to the laundry room door and pulled out the katana in one fell swoop. \u201cRanma-chan, are you there? I have a new outfit for you~!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could do it herself, the door was flung open, revealing Ranma clad in the garishly pink underwear, one leg bent up at a feminine angle and displaying two \u2018v\u2019 signs next to a wide smile. \u201cHiiiiiyaaa, mama~!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma was nothing if not adaptable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodoka clapped her hands together in delight. \u201cOh, wonderful! I have your outfit for today all set out, could you put it on while I make a bento?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma\u2019s smile dropped a few notches. Maybe not <i>that</i> adaptable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma stomped along the route to school, a light dusting of red, and sullen expression on her face. She hated the itchy feeling of the embroidered patch on her back, the sequins on her bra digging into her skin, and <i>especially</i> the swishing of the skirt around her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had worn girly stuff before, but it didn\u2019t feel like she <i>had</i> to, and the whole able-to-turn-back thing served as a small degree of separation. Most people in Furinkan didn\u2019t know it was her, but now \u2014 as evidenced by the half-hidden giggles of girls she passed and the gross feeling of guys openly leering \u2014 this was a common sight. But now she was trapped with a mom who\u2019d probably slice off her head and her own if she was caught fighting, and (as evidenced by quick experiments she conducted when no one was looking) she <i>couldn\u2019t</i> turn back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hand on her shoulder interrupted her train of thought. She whirled around, only to be met with the concerned face of Akane, softening her scowl a bit. \u201cHey, you dropped this.\u201d Akane held a small purple compact in her hand, sending Ranma\u2019s mouth curling back down in displeasure. She took the proffered object and shoved it back in her school bag, again stomping along the path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least Akane meant well, even if she was still reminding her of all the weird girly stuff that Nodoka apparently enforced. Still, there seemed like there was an invisible barrier between them, a lack of familiarity that they had before. She was way nicer than before, sure, but <i>something</i> felt like it was missing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as if she was reading her mind, Akane spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs everything alright? _____.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Thankfully the hole was only five feet deep so neither Inuyasha or Kagome were hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the smoke cleared, Kagome''s hand came to rest on something.  It felt smooth and structured unlike the broken rocks and shifting dirt around her.  Turning, Kagome found an odd box.

Look what I found.\"  Crawling over to her, Inuyasha noted the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know I just found it.\"  Opening the box up, Kagome found an old book.  Opening the book, Kagome found page after page of old chinese characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you read any of it?\" asked Inuyasha as he stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a bit,\" answered Kagome as she followed Inuyahs'a example.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well bring it along, we might be able to find someone in town who could possibly read it.\"  Inuyasha then hoped out of the hole and then helped Kagome out.  </span></div></div>",

After half an hour of trying, Kagome, in further frustration, slammed the book down on the ground, balled up her fist, hit one of the opened pages, and then flopped onto her side.

As she scratched her head, her nails felt sharper than normal. \"Ow... Just because I wander about in the wilderness is no excuse to let myself go.\" she utters, rummaging for her nail file in her backpack. As she searches, it felt like the chirping birds were getting louder and clearer, the smell of the flowers sharper and sharper, and the stitching detail of her backpack more and more acute. \"Here it is!!\" Kagome chirps, overjoyed to find her file. A few rays start encroaching on the horizon, only a few minutes from sunrise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile looking down to file her pointy nails, she notices three red stripes on her outer thighs. \"Great!! The ground must have been harder than I though, and now I have marks on my legs...\" With this exclamation, Inuyasha starts to wake. \"Kagome, could you keep your complaining until <i>after</i> breakfast... Wait, I smell something strange...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Inuyasha...\" Kagome utters just as the sun rises, and a peculiar ripping sound startles her, followed by sensations few a new alien appendage. Inuyasha stares blanky at Kagome, then stutters, \"K-K-K-Kagome, I w-w-wouldn't look behind you if I were you...\" Kagome did, and promptly fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForty-five seconds later, Inuyasha splashed some water on Kagome, successfully waking her. Kagome screams, \"<b>INUYASHA, WHY DO I HAVE A TAIL, AND WHY IS IS PINK?!</b>\" Kagome grabs the appendage, which has ripped a hole in her panties and lifting the rear of her skirt up, and thrusts it at Inuyasha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha holds up a mirror and says, \"That's not all that's pink.\" Kagome looks and sees her originally black hair was now a cherry blossom pink as well. After some well understood initial screaming, Kagome looked herself over. She now sported pointed fingernails and toenails, which by accident she realized she could extend to dagger-like lengths and retract to her original human size, a total of twelve red stripes on her, three on each thigh, and three on each shoulder, shiny irises (which were still green), pointier teeth, and of course, her pink hair and pink furred tail, which resembled a cat's tail. \"I don't know what happened, Kagome, for some reason you smell like a half-demon now, a cat demon to be exact. Something or someone must have cursed you overnight, almost as though they overheard our argument, but I don't know how they did it without me sensing them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKagome seems to off in her own nervous breakdown, blurting, \"Maybe this is a nightmare!! Maybe if I pinch myself I'll wake up!!\" She pinches herself on the tip of her tail to find it disturbingly sensitive, quickly gripping and nursing it. \"Aaaaauuuuggghhh!!! Oooww!!! Not a dream, not a dream!! I never knew tails were this sensitive!!\" She looks at Inuyasha, exclaiming, \"Inuyasha, what am I going to do?! I can't go home like this!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha answers, \"Actually, I do remember those things called 'hair dye' in your time when you drug me out shopping, and the stripes are easy enough to hide, and oddly enough even though you're half-demon you still have human-shaped ears. It'd just be a matter of hiding the tail...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit, boy!!\" Inuyasha goes splat into the dirt. \"That's not what I mean!! I don't want to worry if my tail is lifting my skirt up or not or not for the rest of my life, I just want to be a normal human girl again!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright... We'll figure this out. In the meantime, let's wait for for Miroku and Sango to return...\"</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>DemiVeemon stretched and yawned. He had just woken up from a very pleasant dream, involving a thirty-foot tall stuffed Thanksgiving turkey, just for him. He yawned again and looked around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since the Digidestined had defeated MaloMyotismon just a few months ago, his partner, Davis, had actually matured a little. Before that, his room was usually quite messy; with old chips bags, some dirty laundry, ect. just laying everywhere. Now, his room was relatively clean; the only things laying around now being his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Davis, he was currently still sleeping on his bed, snoring up a storm. Davis' newfound maturity had also extended to his attire; instead of the yellow pajamas he used to sleep in, he now slept in a white T-shirt and a pair of dark blue boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at his partner, DemiVeemon thought: 'Ever since MaloMyotismon bit the dust, Davis has been more chipper than ever. He doesn't even slack off as much in school now. He's really enjoying everything he can.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDemiVeemon sighed. 'You know, it must be nice being a human. Going to school, playing soccer, hanging out with your friends...' He sighed again. 'Sometimes, I really wish that I could be a human, like Davis.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny further thoughts from DemiVeemon were interrupted, because at that moment, the screen on Davis' computer started to glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey, what's with the lightshow?' thought DemiVeemon, as something came out of the computer screen. When the light died down, DemiVeemon saw what it was. It looked like some sort of shiney star-shaped stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What the heck is this thing?' thought DemiVeemon, as he reached out to touch it. The moment that he did touch it, he could feel himself getting stronger and bigger. When the feelings stopped, he had digivolved into Veemon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What is going on here?' thought Veemon. 'How did I suddenly digivolve without Davis' help?' Veemon spun around to see if Davis had noticed anything. He hadn't. Davis was the kind of guy who could almost only be woken by his alarm clock. In fact, a herd of stampeding elephants could have passed right by him, without waking him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back towards the stone, Veemon reached for it, thinking: 'Now, what exactly are you?' When he touched it this time, he could feel his mind being filled with information about the stone. Appearently, it was known as a Change Stone, an ancient artefact from the Digital World, that allowed the user to swap/change/modify pretty much everything one could think of, by simply pointing it at whomever they wanted to swap with and then thinking about what they wanted to change between both themselves and/or others. They could even decide if others would notice any of the changes that were made, or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he regained his bearings, he held the stone up to his face, going over all of the new information in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So, this thing is called a Change Stone,' thought Veemon, as he studied it more carefully. As he mentally went over the functions of the Stone, he smiled as realization dawned on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This is perfect! This is why it caused me to digivolve; so I could used this thing easier!' thought Veemon, as he held the stone in his right hand. 'Thanks to this little humdinger, I can not just become a human like Davis; I can actually BECOME Davis!!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning towards his still sleeping partner, Veemon aimed the Change Stone at Davis and prepared to use the Stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before Veemon could use the Stone, a thought occured to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wait a minute...' he thought, pausing with his hand loosely holding the stone. 'I can't swap bodies with Davis; I don't know the first thing about actually BEING a human! Sure, I know that the Stone can alter reality to make it seem normal, but even so, other people might get suspicious if I end up acting more like a Digimon than a human.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLowering his hands, Veemon started to think things through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Of course, I could just swap knowledge of how to be human with Davis, but that would be too easy. I want to experience being a human, while still being 'me' mentally and keeping things otherwise normal. Hmmm..... what to do?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, an idea popped into his head. 'I've got it! I'll simply make due with just swapping one aspect of being a human, between Davis and me! That way, I can get used to that one thing, before I swap another! Yeah, that's it!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeemon once more looked over at the sleeping Davis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now, what human aspect should I swap with Davis?' Veemon thought long and hard about this. Finally, he thought he had an answer. 'What about if I swap clothes between Davis and me and make it so no one notices? Wearing clothes is something that I've never tried, so that would be something I would have to get used to. Plus,' Veemon sniggered, 'watching Davis go about his day in the nude, without anyone finding it weird, is just too funny to pass up!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, I think getting used to wearing clothes takes priority over other things,' decided Veemon. Aiming the Stone once more at Davis, Veemon got ready to make the changes. However, before he could, another thought occured to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hold on! According to the information about the Stone, if I choose to swap clothes with Davis, then I'll get Davis' clothes. The problem is, that the clothes will be altered to suit me perfectly. That won't do! I want to become a human, sure, but I don't want that drastic a change right now. If I want to get used to wearing human clothes, then I shouldn't alter them. Otherwise, they would be Digimon clothes instead of human clothes. Besides, it just wouldn't be as funny! No, I'll have to think of a way to get it as I want it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeemon thought hard about his little dilemma for about five minutes. Then he got an idea to how he could get it as he wanted. He then aimed the Change Stone at Davis and thought about what specifically he wanted to swap between him and Davis. When the flash from the swap died down, nothing appeared to have been changed; Davis was still sleeping soundly in his bed, still wearing his clothes and Veemon was still standing on the desk, pointing the Change Stone at Davis. But Veemon really had swapped something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeemon had chosen that nothing should change physically after the swap, including not altering the clothes, but that the clothes should still belong to him and that no one would find it strange. That way, the clothes all stayed at their regular size, yet they all now belonged to Veemon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLowering his arm, Veemon heard Davis' alarm clock ringing. 'Whew, just in time!' thought Veemon, as Davis began to stir. 'Now, if all went according to plan, even though they are still human-sized, Davis should think that all of his clothes are really mine now.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Davis sat up, groggy from having just woken up, Veemon thought: 'Perhaps I should call Davis out on him wearing 'my' clothes and see his reaction! Then again, it just might be funnier, if he was allowed to notice it himself!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Davis was streching out, Veemon came to a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Nah, why wait?' he thought. 'I'm curious to see if that rock actually worked!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis was in the middle of a yawn, when Veemon put his plan into effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Here goes nothing,' he thought, before he exclaimed: \"Davis!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis, still groggy, looked over at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whassup, Veemon?\" he drawled. \"How'd you digivolve?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind that!\" exclaimed Veemon. He thought: 'I hope that Stone worked,' before he continued pretend-yelling at Davis: \"Would you mind telling me why you are wearing my clothes?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're you talking about Veemon?\" said Davis sleepily. When Veemon simply pointed down in response, Davis looked down at himself. It took a few seconds for him to properly register everything, but when he did, he jumped up with a yelp of shock, all traces of tiredness completely vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaahh!!! You're right Veemon!\" exclaimed Davis. \"How did I end up wearing your clothes?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What do you know; that Stone-thingy worked!' thought Veemon to himself exitedly, while out loud, he pretended to still be angry at Davis, by yelling: \"I don't care how you got them on, just get them off, now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-of course, Veemon!,\" stuttered Davis, as he frantically began to take off the T-shirt and boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Veemon looked angry on the outside, on the inside he was doing cartwheels out of excitement. 'It really worked!' he thought. 'Thanks to that Change Stone, Davis' clothes are now all mine and no one finds it weird at all!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, Davis had managed to take off both the white T-shirt and the dark blue boxers, leaving him completely in the nude. Still pretending to be slightly miffed at him, Veemon said: \"Now, could you please explain to me why you were wearing my clothes in the first place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I honestly have no idea, Veemon,\" said Davis. \"I'm certain that I went to bed as normal last night; so I don't know why I was suddenly wearing your clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I know why,' sniggered Veemon mentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we can figure out how this happened later; I have to get ready for school,\" said Davis and as he threw the T-shirt and the boxers over to Veemon, who caught them, he added: \"You'd better hurry and get dressed, Veemon.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, duh! They are your clothes after all!\" said Davis and crossed his arms. \"Besides, it just wouldn't be decent of YOU to stroll around naked, even inside the house. Don't you remember the time when you tried to go out naked like me, and you were almost arrested for it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right! I forgot!\" Veemon played along. But secretly, he was impressed with just how much the Change Stone had altered reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, hurry up and get your clothes on, Veemon; I have to get ready for school,\" said Davis, still buck-naked, before he walked into the kitchen, leaving Veemon, still holding the T-shirt and boxers, alone in his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Veemon stood for a minute, still holding the T-shirt and the boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Should I really put these on now?' he thought. 'Thanks to the Change Stone altering reality like I wanted it, all of Davis' clothes have become mine now, so I suppose I should put them on.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeemon thought more about it, before he made a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Nah, it can wait,' he thought, letting the clothes fall to the floor. 'I'd rather observe Davis as much as possible before he leaves for school. I don't want to miss one moment of this funny situation. I can put on the clothes once Davis leaves.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeemon walked over to the door and peeked out. He had to cover his mouth with his hands, so he wouldn't end up laughing loudly at what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis was sitting buck-naked at the kitchen table, eating his usual breakfast cerial. Veemon of course knew that this was normal for Davis in this altered reality, but that didn't stop it from being funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Amazing!' thought Veemon. 'Davis is just going about his morning rutine as always, exept that he's now naked and he thinks that's perfectly normal for him! This is hilarious!!!' Veemon had to really restrain himself from bursting out laughing. 'It's a good thing that Davis and I are the only ones here at the moment; otherwise I'd never be able to get away with spying on him like this, even with the altered reality.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, Davis and Veemon were currently the only two individuals in the apartment. Davis' mom and sister were out of town at the moment, visiting a sick aunt of theirs. Surprisingly, Davis had actually managed to follow the instructions that his mother had left quite well, even as far as the food went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of food, Davis had finished eating his cerial. He walked over to the dishwasher and put his plate in it. Veemon then observed the naked Davis walking across the room and entering the bathroom. Judging from the sounds coming from in there, Davis was in the middle of brushing his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I still can't believe it,' thought Veemon, still trying his best not to laugh. 'Davis is walking around completely naked and he doesn't find anything odd about it at all! That Change Stone is really impressive!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeemon ducked back inside Davis' room, when he heard Davis finishing up in the bathroom. A few moments later, Davis walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, Veemon!\" he said when he saw his partner. \"How come you're still not dressed yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... Just haven't decided on what outfit I should wear, I guess,\" fibbed Veemon. He found it harder and harder to bite back the laughter, but he managed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, just don't take too long,\" said Davis, as he found his school-books and made to put them in his backpack. \"I don't want to come home and find that the police arrested you for 'public indecency', Veemon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt those words, Veemon had to quickly cover both his mouth and nose with his hands, to prevent a laughing-fit, although he still let out a definite snort of laughter. Davis didn't notice however, as he was busy staring at something in his backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up, Davis?\" asked Veemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis looked at Veemon with a slightly guilty expression and said: \"Uh... Veemon? I swear, I have no idea how it happened, but...\" He then pulled out several things from the backpack; a red T-shirt with a white number '18' on the back of it, a white pair of shorts with a red stripe down the side, long white socks with a red stripe near the top, and a pair of red, white and black sports-shoes. It was Davis' soccer uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis continued: \"Honestly , Veemon, I don't know how your soccer clothes ended up in my backpack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My soccer clothes?\" Veemon was confused. \"But, I don't play soccer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duh, of course not!\" said the naked Davis as he put on the backpack. \"But, you do like to wear them at all of my soccer matches, right? So you can better 'get into the spirit of the game'! Those were your words, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, right, of course! I was just messing with you,\" lied Veemon. He seemed casual enough, but as soon as Davis turned away from him, Veemon had to grab one of the pillows from the bed and giggle into it. The whole situation was becoming so ridiculous, that Veemon almost couldn't hold back his amusement anymore. Quick as a flash, he placed the pillow back on the bed, before Davis turned back towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm off to school now,\" he said. \"Just don't forget to put some clothes on. Okay, Veemon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I got it, Davis,\" said Veemon, straining to keep up his calm facade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then!\" said Davis as he walked out of the room. \"See you after school!\" Veemon heard the front door open and close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeemon quickly ran over to the window and looked outside. It wasn't long before he could see Davis walk out into the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Veemon, the entire scene was absurd; although Davis clearly passed by a bunch of people down at the street, not one of those people as much as lifted an eyebrow, when the 11-year old nude boy wearing just a backpack, passed by them. Everyone in the world, apart from Veemon, just found it perfectly normal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing this, Veemon could no longer restrain himself. He fell on his back and roared with laughter as he rolled around on the floor, guffawing hysterically like he had just been told the funniest joke of all time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'UNBELIEVEABLE!!!' he thought between bursts of laughter. 'Not one of the humans down there spared a second glance at Davis; even though he was walking around buck-naked!!! I love this Change Stone!!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally composing himself, Veemon got back on his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, that was fun,' he thought. 'But now that the fun is over, I'd better get down to buissness. Because I used the Stone to alter reality, I'm the one who's supposed to wear clothes now. The only question now is: what should I wear?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the room, Veemon could clearly see that there was no shortage of choices, as far as clothes were concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh boy,' thought Veemon. 'This might be harder than I thought. Davis' clothes - or, I guess technically MY clothes now - are spread all over the room.' Veemon shook his head. 'I think I'd better get everything sorted first. Then, I can decide what to wear. Man, it's gonna be though getting used to saying that!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about half-an-hour, Veemon had had finally managed to sort all of the clothing; with underwear in one pile, T-shirts in another, ect. Seperate from those piles, were the three outfits he had chosen to maybe try on first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first outfit was simply the white T-shirt and the dark blue boxers that Davis had previously worn. Veemon had chosen that, because since there were only two articles of clothing there, it would be the easiest for him to get used to wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second outfit was the soccer clothes. Since there were a few more articles of clothing in that set, Veemon figured it would be good for a second-stage try-out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third outfit was a full set of Davis' regular clothes. Consisting of a dark blue shirt with long sleeves and a thick white stripe across the chest and thin yellow stripes over and under it, a T-shirt in the same colours, a pair of blue boxers, a blue short-sleeved open vest, dark brown shorts, dark blue socks, orange and white boots, and of course the silver-white goggles, it was the most extensive of the three outfits. Though Veemon eventually wanted to try on this outfit in particular, he did think that there were perhaps a little too much clothing there for him to start off with; especially concidering he had never worn any clothes before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Whew, now THAT was a chore!' thought Veemon. 'Davis should really keep more order in his clothes. Although, since I used the Change Stone, I guess it's me who'll have to keep it all in order, which I just did.' He looked at the three outfits. 'But more on that later. What I have to concentrate on now, is deciding which of these sets of clothes I should try on first.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich set of clothes does Veemon decide to try on first?</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After carefully thinking it through, Veemon came to a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I think I'd better get used to wearing these things a little at a time,' thought Veemon. 'After all, I've never worn clothes before, so I don't know what it feels like.' He looked down at the three sets of clothes he had picked. 'That's why I'd better try on the T-shirt and the boxers first. Once I've gotten used to wearing that, I can try on more clothes.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeemon went over to the first set of clothes. Picking up the dark blue boxers, Veemon thought: 'Well, I wanted this, so I'd better do it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting his legs through the correct holes in the boxers, Veemon attempted to put them on, but found that he couldn't. As it turned out, his tail was preventing from wearing the boxers properly. Well, as properly as a little dragon Digimon could wear a pair of human-sized boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on!\" Veemon exclaimed out loud in frustration. He continued mentally: 'I can't believe I can't get these things on! It's the whole reason I even made that change! Wait a minute...' Veemon had to slap himself in face. 'I nearly forgot about the Change Stone!!! It can help with this! And I know just how...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeemon walked over to the Change Stone and picked it up. The change he implemented this time, was that whenever he would try on any articles of clothing that went on the legs, the clothes in question would gain an extra hole for him to put his tail through and the tail-hole would dissappear when Veemon wasn't wearing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeemon saw the flash that indicated the change had been completed. Taking the Stone with him, Veemon laid it down on the floor next to him, as he once again tried to put on the boxers. This time, he saw the tail-hole appear on the boxers; the only problem was that the tail-hole appeared on the side of the boxers that was on Veemon's front. That's when Veemon realized that he had tried to put on the boxers the wrong way around!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing profusely, Veemon quickly flipped the boxers so they were the right way around, while thinking: 'Oops! I guess I still have much to learn about clothes!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Veemon successfully managed to put on the boxers, by putting his tail through the new hole. This also had the added benefit of preventing the, for Veemon, oversized boxers from falling off of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Whoa!' thought Veemon. 'I know this is the first time I'm wearing clothes of any kind, but still... It feels really weird to wear these.' The sentation of wearing clothes was certainly new and odd to Veemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had deliberately chosen to place the clothes and himself in front of the mirror in Davis' room, so he could see how he looked with clothes on. As it turned out, he looked as weird as he thought the boxers felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the boxers would be normal-sized on Davis' body, they would be able to count as proper pants on Veemon's much smaller body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Boy, do I look ridiculous wearing Davis' - or should that be my now - underwear!' thought Veemon with a grin. 'But there's still one thing missing.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeemon picked up the T-shirt from the floor. Having learned from trying to put the boxers on backwards, Veemon checked the inside for the mark to see which was the front and which was the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving found out which was which on the T-shirt, Veemon proceded to put it on. It was easy enough; he had seen Davis put it on many times, so he knew which holes he should put his head and arms into. With him now wearing the T-shirt, Veemon looked at himself in the mirror again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Boy; I look even more ridiculous wearing this!' thought the grinning Veemon. Indeed it did; the T-shirt was so big on him, that it covered his whole body, exept for his feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill grinning, Veemon turned so he could see how he looked from the side. He saw that the bottom back edge of his new T-shirt was hanging over his tail, causing his new boxers to be visible underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This is just plain crazy!' thought Veemon. 'Even though it is unnatural for a Digimon of my species to wear any form of clothing, I'm wearing it because everyone else thinks that's normal. And all because of that Change Stone!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeemon looked down at his now-clothed body. 'Actually, since I altered reality with that Stone, I HAVE to wear clothes! Otherwise, it'd be considered unethical. That doesn't stop it from feeling weird, though...' Veemon had to resist the urge to remove the clothes; this was how it HAD to be, in this altered reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe it's because the clothes are still human-sized,' thought Veemon, 'but they feel really weird to wear.' Veemon tugged on his new T-shirt. 'It's like I'm wrapped up in a set of drapes, that I have to walk around in, too.' Veemon let go of the T-shirt. 'That reminds me; I need to know if I can even walk around wearing this, or if I have to use the Change Stone again.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeemon tried to move around while still wearing the slightly uncomfortable clothes. Although the clothes were a bit cumbersome, because of their size, Veemon managed to walk, run and jump around relatively normal. There was only one little downside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay, so I can move around like I normally do,' thought Veemon. 'But it did feel weird to do it with clothes on.' Veemon gently tugged on both his new T-shirt and his new boxers to better look at them. 'While the clothes didn't exactly inhibit my movements, the feeling of their fabric brushing against my body as I moved, was outright bizzare!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeemon released his grip on the clothes. 'It's a good thing that I first chose to swap clothes with Davis, instead of swapping our bodies,' he thought. 'If I'd had to wear them in Davis' body, without getting used to them first, altered reality or not, someone would have gotten suspicious.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at his reflection in the mirror again, Veemon thought: 'I still look ridiculous in this, but I'm the only one who knows that.' He shifted his wiew from the mirror, to the two other sets of clothes on the floor. 'But, as silly as I look wearing this, it's only the most basic set of clothes. I need to try out the other sets too.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to the clothes, Veemon selected the soccer uniform as the next thing he would try. But before that, he used the Change Stone again. Since this set of clothes included footwear, he thought it wise to make another change. The change was that neither the socks nor the shoes could be ripped by the claws on his feet, no matter what outfit they belonged to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this new change implimented, Veemon could focus on putting on the soccer uniform. The first thing he did was to take off the T-shirt and boxers he was already wearing, so he could put on the other clothes. And of course, due to the changes he'd made, when he took off the boxers, the tail-hole in them dissappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before he put on the soccer uniform, another thought came to Veemon. Should he just throw caution to the wind and wear the full set of clothes instead of the uniform?</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a beautiful Saturday morning. Inside the Thorndyke Mansion, Chris was waking up. He'd been sleeping a little longer than usual, even by his weekend standards, because he had the whole house to himself today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis parents had decided to invite the whole house, including Sonic and his friends, to the set of his mother's newest film. Chris had politely declined; he'd been on such tours many times before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's why he was alone today. Sonic and the others wouldn't be back until evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris yawned, streched and got out of bed. But before he could do anything else, a bright light and a wooshing sound came from outside and attracted his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on here?\" he said to himself and walked over to the window. He'd barely made it over there, before the light and the noise became a lot more intense. A few seconds later the light and the noise vanished, as something impacted on his lawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! What was that?\" exclaimed Chris. Still wearing his light-blue pyjamas, Chris hurried outside to see what had crashed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got there, he saw that whatever had crashed into the ground had left a small crater from the impact. Looking into the crater, he saw what appeared to be a Chaos Emerald laying there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird,\" said Chris to himself. \"What is a Chaos Emerald doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached out to touch the Emerald. The moment he did, his head was filled with information about it. Appearently it wasn't one of the Chaos Emeralds, but a different kind called a Change Emerald. According to the new information in his head, this Emerald had the abillity to change/transform/alter whatever and whoever the holder of the Emerald wanted to, with no limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the flow of information stopped, Chris went over it in his head. Being of a scientific mind, he was rather sceptical about the capabillities of this Change Emerald. He figured it was best to test it out first, but he was reluctant to use himself as the guiniapig, at least not yet. Instead, he looked around the yard for a better target...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes were drawn to a tiny little bird, small enough to fit in the palm of his hand, flittering around bushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, here goes nothing...' thought Chris, as he gripped the Emerald firmly and concentrated on what should happen to the bird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a quick flash of light from the Emerald. When it died down, Chris saw that the little bird was now inside a birdcage!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoah! That actually worked!\" Chris was so surprised that he said it out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the Emerald again, Chris thought: 'So, this thing is not some kind of joke, or a trap by Eggman! It actually does change everything however I want it!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris didn't spend much time thinking about what he should do next. Grabbing the birdcage, he hurried back up to his own room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bird didn't mind the sudden speed; in fact, it was surprisingly calm about the whole thing. That was because Chris didn't only want the bird to be in a cage; he also wanted it to be a domesticated bird that could be kept as a pet, instead of something like a canary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he came back to his room, Chris gently placed the birdcage on the table he had in there. He then walked over and stood in front of his mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now that I know that the Change Emerald is the real deal,' he thought, 'I'd like to know, if it can change me too. Nothing too big though; I just want to make sure that it can alter living things too. But, how do I best test it out? And what should I change?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Chris stood and thought hard about what he should try changing on himself, his eyes fell on the reflection of his new bird. Then he got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This could be an interesting experiment to try. I think I'll do it!\" decided Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more gripping the Emerald tightly, Chris thought about the change he wanted to happen. When the Emerald flashed, Chris closed his eyes. He could feel the change taking place, causing him to be disoriented for a moment. When the weird feeling had passed, he opened his eyes again and looked at his reflection in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he knew what he had changed and was prepared for what he would see, he was still surprised by the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still mostly himself; a 12-year old boy in a light-blue pyjamas. The only thing wrong about that reflection, was his head. Because it was no longer his head, nor was it even a human head. Instead, he now had the head of a bird, on top of his human body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't just any bird's head; it was an exact copy of the head of the bird in the cage! Furthermore, it was also the same exact size as the original, meaning that Chris' new bird-head was ridiculously undersized on his human body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris just stared at his new bird-head for a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Unbelievable!' thought Chris. 'I can't believe that actually worked! This Change Emerald is amazing!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris leaned forward slightly to get a better look at his new head. The first thing he noticed, was that his neck had also shrunk to better fit in size to his new bird-head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second thing he noticed, was that he had to pull down the collar of his pyjamas slightly, so he could look at his reflection. Otherwise, because of the size of his new bird-head, the top of the pj's would have obscured his line of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third thing he noticed, was that because of the tiny bird-head that he now had, everything seemed to be a lot bigger than usual; the mirror, his bed, the table, even his own body! When he looked to one side or the other, he could see the high collar of his pyjamas completely blocking his line of sight to his shoulders; his bird-head was THAT small!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Chris brought one of his hands up to his new head. It looked like the hand belonged to a giant, to his bird-eyes. Very carefully, he used one of his fingers to stroke his bird-head. It was a very odd sensation, feeling his new tiny feathers being simultaniously stroked by his finger, and feeling the feathers under his human hand. He also marveled at the seamless transition between feathers and skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some more marveling, Chris decided to do something else. 'I can't just stand here and look at my new head all day. I'd better change back, so I can get my clothes on.' He was just about to change back to normal with the Emerald, when he had a funny thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You know, maybe I shouldn't change back just yet. I think it's actually fun to have the head of a bird. But I don't want to stay like this forever; just for a little while.' Chris thought more about it. 'I think I'll keep my bird-head until I've gotten my clothes on. That seems like a fitting amount of time.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving decided what to do, Chris made to walk over to his closet, only to stumble and fall down on his stomach right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey, why did I fall down?' thought Chris, as he picked himself up, or tried to. He answered his own question, when he realized that it was more difficult for him to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Of course!' thought Chris. 'Because of my tiny head, my hight- and depth-perceptions are all wrong! I'll have to try and adjust to this...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly and clumsily, Chris got back on his feet. His theory was correct; because he had a tiny bird-head on top of his normal-sized human body, the size difference between them, was messing both with his line of sight and his sense of balance. This was clearly appearent as he moved over to his closet to get his clothes; he had to walk very slowly and wobbley, swaying his arms around just to keep his balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finally made it to his closet, it took him a bit longer to find his clothes than normal, because his bird-head was so tiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay, so it's a bit harder than I thought', Chris admitted to himself. 'Walking around with the head of a bird, instead of my own, is definitely weird and just feels bizzare! But, I made a decision and I am sticking to it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he found his clothes, Chris made his way back to his bed, still walking awkwardly. When he got there, the first thing he did was to take off his pyjamas. It was a little thougher for him to do it, because of his bird-head and when he removed the pyjama-shirt, he also had to make sure that his new beak didn't snag on the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he put on his regular clothes, Chris couldn't resist taking another look at himself in the mirror. He thought it was even funnier than the last time; a tiny little bird-head on top of human body, only wearing a pair of tighty-whities. The whole thing looked so absurd!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that distraction out of the way, Chris proceeded to putting on his clothes, which was a bit of a challenge because of his bird-head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of his altered line of sight, Chris had to stand in front of the mirror, ib order to put on his jeans; otherwise he would have been unable to do it right. When he put on his long-sleaved T-shirt, and his short-sleaved shirt, he once more had to be careful that new beak wouldn't get stuck in the fabric. He also had to stand in front of the mirror to put on his socks and shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris was quite amazed with himself. 'I actually managed to put on my clothes, while having the head of a bird!' he thought. 'But, as fun as it was, I'd better get back to normal now.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the Emerald, he did just that and he was actually glad to have his own human head back on his shoulders. But one question remained: should he try uding the Emerald some more, or wait and let Tails have a look at it, when he comes back?</span></div></div>",

He became the guild master of a guild called Canard, but not many people joined because they were scared of him the <i>terror of death</i>. He thought being a guild master would be awesome being able to boss everyone around and what not. But that's only fun when you have people to boss around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only that he messed up his relationship with Atoli and they weren't talking to each other for 5 months now and Atoli quit the guild. He wanted to talk to Shino the girl he loved before Atoli but she hasn't logged in since he chose Atoli over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was an ordinary day like usual. Silabus and Gaspard were doing what they usually did. They went outside to sell items like potions, elixirs and accessories to people. Leaving Haseo alone in the guild building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Sigh) What could I do today? No missions and even if there was any I wouldn't be in the mood.\" Haseo said to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then hears footsteps. He looked at the person and saw a hooded character wearing all black with red strips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello what can I do for you?\" Haseo said in a happy tone since he thought the stranger came here join you guild. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new comer didn't talk he walked up to you. This confused you until you felt pain in your stomach. You looked down and saw that he used his hands to stab you like Atoli did when she was controlled by AIDA. You looked at the strange character's face and saw that he had no face except for an evil smile which was emphasized by the color white. After that you fainted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe character disappears in a batch of codes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs your transformation gradual or instant?</span></div></div>",

The reason why he was doing this gardening job, and not something fun and great like a guarding job, or an extermination was because of a. . .accident that happened during his last job. How was he supposed to know that his fire would accidentally spread to the noble's house, and burn it down, and accidentally send said noble to the hospital. Ever since then Master Makarov wanted Natsu to lay low for a little bit until it all blown over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful there,\" A woman started. \"Make sure you don't pull out any of my plants out.\" She then advised. You wouldn't want me to take it out of your bill now would you?\" She soon reminded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah,\" Natsu muttered angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe job contractor was an older woman with fair skin in her mid to late 30's. She had a long red hair that went down to her mid-back and purple eyes. She had a beautiful heartshape face with dignifying lines of age on her face. She had a curvy sexual body that oozed maturity with large ripe breasts that put the younger woman of Fairy Tail to shame, even though they just had a hint of sag to them, and wide child-bearing hips, and a large butt to go with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey don't take that attitude with me!\" The contractor ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sorry if I really don't want to be on this job old lady!\" Natsu declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld lady! Don't take that attitude with me you brat!\" She roared. \"And I'll have you know that they're still plenty of young men that want to be with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like that's true you old hag!\" Natsu snarled back. \"As if any guy would want to be with a woman your age!\" He then remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so you think that just because I'm an older woman means that I can't get anyone's attention do you?\" She asked as her hair rose up, and resembled nine tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah right!\" Natsu remarked with a false bravado. He wouldn't admit being afraid of her, even though she kind of reminded him of Erza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman then went and cracked her knuckles in a menacing matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu shivered as he realized that he bit off more then he could chew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman smirked in delight in his fear and unleashed her magical power. She let loose a powerful punch that hit Natsu right in the jawline, sending him flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW!\" Natsu roared with a flame coming out of his mouth. \"What the hell lady!?\" He then added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please you deserved it for what you said, and besides your whining over a love tap,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you decided to hit me for what I said!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like me to hit you again?\" She questioned while preparing her fist again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu winced to that as he looked at the red haired woman before scuffing. \"Yeah right, Erza hit's way harder.\" He then stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh then you won't mind if I stop holding back then,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring it on!\" Natsu then roared while bursting into flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you're really gonna try and hit your client?\" She asked, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never back down from a fight!\" Natsu declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then,\" She said smirking as she placed one hand on her wide hip, and several rings appeared on her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm all fired up!\" Natsu declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then brat, but you're going to regret it by the end,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, the two then rushed at one another. Natsu threw the first punch and she easily dodged to the left and his other fist. Natsu kept trying to hit her, but every time he tried, and just like before she easily managed to dodge it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was expecting more from the Salamender of Fairy Tail.\" The woman remarked in a teasing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat however got Natsu pissed. \"SHUT UP! NO ONE INSULTS FAIRY TAIL!\" He roared as the fire around him grew larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu however was too into a blind rage to hear what was stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman merely sighed to that as her rings were now glowing pink. \"I guess you'll need to be taught some manners then.\" She soon stated. \"Ancient Magic!\" She began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu meanwhile charged forward and raised his fist, again, but unlike before she raised her hand this time to block.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"REFORMATION!\" The woman declared as she and Natsu were engulfed in a pillar of light.</span></div></div>",

Some are capable of even more radical changes, such as growing wings or full-body transformation. The transformation processes are very fast, and occur at the user's will. When inactive, the morphed areas revert to normal, leaving the person's clothing and body completely untouched.

His upper body was similarly warping, abs shifting into something considerably softer and less imposing. Other changes were taking place in his trousers, ones that he could hardly bars to imagine. Hair vanished from his arms and legs, as his locks grew and extended to reach the edge of his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonathon was positive the transformation had finished, but his clothes had other ideas. His dress pants flowed and shifted, each leg attaching to the other before suddenly bursting into the shape of a skirt. His undergarments shrunk snugly to provide support for Jojo's new cleavage. His shirt softened and twisted about as a series of frills overtook the collar. With the final attachment to the skirt, the lady Joestar stood before Dio Brando in a dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStumbling to a table, Jonathon picked up a mirror and gazed into the reflection. The woman had some muscles left over, sure. And the hair was just short enough to be considered boyish but it was also too long to belong to anything but a girl. The soft face and the dress and everything else... \"This can't be possible...\" gasped a light, feminine voice from her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDio began to laugh as his shock transformed into delight, soon cackling in outrageous amusement. \"Believe it, Jojo!

I would have splashed you a long time ago if I knew the result would be this amusing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonathan spun around to stare at Dio. \"Amusing?!

No office in England would decide otherwise! Face it Jojo! You've lost!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRage overtook the Joestar as she lifted her fist to slam into Dio.

With the power of the Pretty Girl Drug, Iyami and Chibita were easily able to con those stupid sextuplets out of their cash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChibita had to admit though, he had some reservations. He didn't really hold a grudge against the Matsus the way Iyami did. It was kind of sad to see them fail to grow into adulthood like they should. Plus, he was spending a lot of time away from his oden shop and more and more time playing Rental Girlfriend. Still, he was making good cash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIyami, on the other hand, was over the moon. Not only was he getting his revenge on the Matsus, he was making a nice chunk of change, building a pile of dough, lining his pockets with gold. And the money he was earning wasn't bad either. Soon, with all the checks he'd cashed and the presents he'd gotten refunded, he wouldn't need to worry about money for a while. He could get an apartment again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday's excursion was already putting Iyami in a good mood. \"Me can't wait to see what those Matsus give the girls today!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChibita rolled his eyes. \"You idjit. We're gonna get caught sooner or later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smooth movement, Iyami wrapped his arm around his partner in crime. \"Don't worry, don't worry, zansu! Soon they'll run out of cash, and then we'll be set for life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChibita wasn't so sure, but couldn't come up with an argument otherwise. So he simply shoved the Frenchman off of him before stuffing a pill into his own mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIyami grinned as a light flashed around Chibita, before consuming his own drug sample. In an instant, large teeth shrunk to a perfect, shiny smile. Hair lightened into a blonde as his thin figure transformed into a stunning hourglass shape. Even his smirk looked more like a welcoming smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChibita's virtually hairless dome became a pair of soft, pigtails. Eyelashes highlighted an adorable expression and his whiskers became subtler, more catlike. His short, unathletic figure was now petite and cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the clothes of the two men changed into a flattering ensemble that fit their new forms easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIyayo flipped her hair back. \"You ready for our dates? I know I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChibimi giggled. \"Definitely. It'll go great!</span></div></div>",
