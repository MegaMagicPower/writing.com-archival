You hear strange, shuffling sounds outside. You peer out through the large windows, but all you can see is dense fog, and occasional shapes moving out there, slowly, in the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around you, you see a telephone. You pick it up and find that there is no dial tone, only static. It sounds almost like whispering. Creeped out, you hang the phone up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou search around the diner, hoping to find some clues to where you might be. The last thing you remember is seeing a child in the road, veering off into the ditch. Now, you're awake, with a terrible headache, with no idea how you got to this strange, empty little diner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a newspaper on a nearby table. </span></div></div>",

Chuckling maniacally, she kicked the man aside, stepping through the pools of blood now puddling at her feet.  \"Melanie, my sweet Melanie...\", the man whispered hoarsely, \"I'm sorry.\"  As suddenly as he had appeared in the diner doorway, he evaporated in a thin mist, as did the pools of blood.  Dumbstruck, I came to the realization that that was the little girl's father and he had died in the efforts to save her life after she was abducted.  What had become of her that she was now a monster?  With the entrance of the lady, the little girl released her vicious grip.  \"Mommy Dearest!  Look what I found for us to play with!!!\", she squealed with excitement.  \"She is a curvacious little thing, isn't she, Mason?!\", said the one who was called Mommy Dearest.  The waiter licked his lips in reply.  Setting the camera down, Mason walked over to me.  Running his hands across my ass, he yanked me toward him violently.  I could feel his hardness pressing against me as he flicked his slimy tongue over my neck and face.  My stomach heaved with the pungent smell of his breath as I tryed to wriggle free of his venoment grasp.  Glancing over my shoulder, I noted that Mommy Dearest still blocked the doorway.  \"Keep fighting and your head will mount our wall like those who have lost before you.\", Mommy Dearest called out to me angerily.</span></div></div>",

Grabbing at my breasts and pulling at my hair.  \"Oh yes,\" I screamed.  Feeling sick as his hands went under my shirt ripping off my bra.  I arched my back to him.  He grumbled and grunted.

The waiter watched with an evil grin, probably looking forward to having my headless body.  I needed a way to get the axe away from Mommy Dearest and stop the evil little girl. It was a gamble but I had a plan. I pulled at the ace one last time then ducked. Mommy Dearest tripped over me and fell towards the little girl. Because of her small stature, the little girl couldn't change the direction of the axe fast enough and it slashed into Mommy Dearest's chest. The both cried out and Mommy Dear collapsed. I had never seen so much fresh blood. <br>\r\n\"What have you done?!\" the waiter screeched. <br>\r\nHe ran to the bleeding Mommy Dearest and kneeled down beside her in grief. He cried loudly.

I opened the door to let in some light, it wasn't much. That's when I saw a short wooden stool in the top right corner of the room and that's when the entire plan hit me. I grabbed the stool, laid on it side and stomped at the smaller horizontal supports; they broke off with ease. I took hold of the larger leg that was left standing alone. Pain shot up my legs, back and arms, I was f*cked up, literally. I nearly keeled over and blacked out from the pain and disorientation. I knew my body could handle only one good pull before I was  done for good. I thought harder past the hunger and pain to my helpless moments of Masons assault. The anger fueled and rushed through me like I've never felt before, I was already standing by the door with a foot and a half long wooden stake in my hand. I don't even remember ripping it from the stool I was just standing over. The only thought in my mine was phase 2; escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a strange constant ultra-high pitched ringing in my ears. I didn't have to ask myself what it was, I could feel it; pure primal rage. It coursed through my vain's bulging the arms and muscles of my thin slender frame, tightening my neck and jaw. I felt my breath deepen and vision sharpen with each pump of blood that could be felt throbbing my eyes. I was ready. I couldn't risk running out the door and getting ambushed by Momma Dearest or the little demon brat, and a surprise encounter with Mason would spell death. I had to lure them in here. I opened the door wide and slammed it hard, hoping they would think I ran off. Mason was strong but too hard headed and powerful to enter the room cautiously. A moment after the I slammed the door Mason tacked the door in and ran up to where he had left me. It was too dark and he moved too fast to notice I was standing flat against the wall by the door. I silently rushed up behind him and jumped on his back. With the down-force of my leap, I landed the sharp, splintered wooden stake into soft fleshy area where his shoulder me his neck, behind his collar bone. His big tough body seized in pain and he let out a devil-like growl. I hung like hell to his back, my arm around his neck. I used my free hand and hooked his eye from behind, I dug the nail of my middle finger into his left eye and ripped back. He howled and jolted in pain backing up like a big horse I just saddled and trained. My finger in his eye and wooden stake in his back did a good job in telling my new horsey which way to go. He stumbled back and out into the hall just outside the door. I had no control over the rage; the next thing I saw was me ripping out a large chunk of his shoulder with my teeth. Just then, Momma Dearest appeared from out of nowhere and into the corner of my peripheral vision. Running at us, axe in hand, the tip raised just above her shoulder line. With a wild and nasty spin she swung the axe horizontally. The rage pumped blood soo hard through me it must have increased my cognitive function two-fold because in that instant she seemed to be moving at half speed and I watched her dirty, bloody hands grip tighter around the handle and the axe fly at me in slow motion. I jumped off and to the side just in time but not fast enough. The axe put a nasty gash in my hip before getting lodged into Masons lower spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt nothing. No pain, no fear. Mason had taken so much damage he couldn't do anything but let out a deep growl of agonizing pain. I howled at the top of my lungs with insanity \"Ha haa! How does it feel to get F*CKED MASON?!\". I turned and sprinted for the door at the end of the hall. As I took my first step toward freedom, The walls and my vision in front of me twisted and skewed like the rims of a screw. Callie was at the door. Momma Dearest let out a piercing howling scream that started chipping, shattering, breaking the hall walls behind me. I continued to run straight ahead ignoring Callie's dizzying illusion and Momma's crippling scream. I was steps away from the door and that clingy demon girl. If she grabbed me and weighted me down I'd instantly lose. The rage rushed the brute force solution to my brain and the answer came in the form an outraged battle cry, \"F*ck that! Soccer kick that little bitch!\" I screamed in my head, Masons flesh still clenched between my teeth. I winded up running full speed and kicked her head, sending it smashing to the wall on the right. The wood had no chance of withstanding the force of her face at those speeds and half her head was lodged into the wall. The twisted illusion quickly faded with Callie's consciousness. I knew she wasn't dead but  the destructive force of Momma Dearest's scream was a second behind me. The same second I used to kick open the door and sprint up the stairs. As I reached the top I found myself right back where I first started. This hellish diner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cloud of smoke outside was heavy and so was the ash-fall. The rage suddenly left me and I was spitting Mason's flesh and blood out on the street I walked down. Goddamn -Baker st-. As I held my gash and limped quickly down the street toward the church in the distance I noticed the ringing in my ears was gone and I was almost completely exhausted. When I reached the corner of Baker street a minute later, that's when I spotted the thick groups of four or five 'acid-spitters' blocking the west and most importantly North street going toward the church. \"Shit!\" I yelped aloud uncontrollably. My only option is East. A few of them heard me and were stumbling quickly toward me. I limped East. Just as I turned into the street and my new path darkness began to fall quickly, adding insult to injury. I looked around and estimated, three minutes tops, before it was too dark to see. Out running spitters in my current condition, possible, at least for awhile. Out running them in pitch blackness, impossible. Thoughts rushed frantically through my mind trying to find a solution, trying to stay alive. 'Rrrrrraaaaaaaooooooooo' an unbelievably loud disaster alarm starting wailing so loud I couldn't think. That's when I realized that crowd of spitters aren't running at me, their running away. My heart sank even further from the realization. '<b>Rrrrrraaaaaaaooooooooo</b>' \"Awwkgh\" I let go of my wound to shield my ears from  the deafening siren. The spitters picked up pace and density and where right behind me. <font class=\"size40\" style=\"\">'Rrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaoooooooooooooooooo'</font> \"Ffffuuu*k\" God my ears where about to pop. I looked back and the large crowd of spitters were being ripped apart by an invisible force. Black and dark green blood raining everywhere, some tiny spatters drizzled down in a misty haze burning my head and shoulders. Pavement, metal, wood, dirt, everything was being ripped up and bled into the darkness of the sky. <font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">RRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAOOOOOOOOOOO</font> \"Ahhhhh! Ffffffffffaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa--\" I screamed at the top of lungs from the thundering, roaring pain of the sirens, which almost made me black out. I slowed my pace as the ground began to shake and my chest bones vibrated violently under the siren, my stomach began to turn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe noise stopped again for a moment but not the ground shaking. When I opened my eyes darkness had fallen, but -- oh my god, light. There was two signs lit just up ahead. I knew the next wail would kill me, if I wasn't already dead from getting swallowed up like the spitters. The acid burned, my wound stung and the blood loss made me weaker by the heart beat, and it was racing in total panic. I only had about five seconds to chose. The first sign said -HARDWARE-; which meant a flashlight and possibly a weapon. The second said: -PHARMACY-; which meant first aid from my bleeding, 'blood-trail leaving' wound. . . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChose to harshly stitch up the badly bleeding wound, arm up with a large sharp weapon and a good flashlight. Stay and fight to your last breath. Go down kicking and screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-or-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGet proper care, rest and food as well as a map found under the first aid kit with a small maglight(penlight). Camp for a bit and once healed and recovered gather your thoughts and come up with an escape plan. But from a distance you notice there is an area of importance circled in red-highlight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n[[ Once chosen the other option with be swallowed up while you cower under the counter of either store(choice). ]]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWritten by <span class=\"noselect\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" oncontextmenu=\"uport_ajax_rt_opts (event, this, 'pjr88', '', '', '', '10', '', 'ON', '100938977'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1; return false;\" onclick=\"uport_ajax_opts (event, this, 'pjr88', '', '', '', '10', '', 'ON'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1;\"><a title=\"Username: pjr88\r\nMember Since: January 18th, 2012\r\nClick for links!\" style=\"line-height: 1em;font-size:1em;cursor:pointer;\">Mr. Midnight</a></span> <span class=\"noPrint\">(<a title=\"View pjr88's Community Recognition\" class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"javascript:LaunchPop('https://www.Writing.Com/main/authors/action/overall/user_id/pjr88',%20'CommunityR_100938977',%20'400',%20'650')\">54</a>)</span> <a class=\"imgLink imgPortLink\" onmousedown=\"if(event.which == 3) { event.preventDefault(); var mywin = window.open('https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/pjr88','_blank'); mywin.focus (); event.stopPropagation(); return false; }\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/pjr88\" target=\"_top\" onmouseover=\"uport_ajax2 (event, this, 'pjr88', '&lt;span style=\\'color:#990000;font-weight:bold\\'&gt;Offline or Private&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; Last On:  Private', '', 'January 18, 2012', '', '', '10', 'Registered Author');\" onmouseout=\"hide_uport ();\"><span style=\"padding:0px 2px 0px 0px;vertical-align:middle;\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/costumicons/ps-icon-regular-10.gif\" width=\"30\" height=\"15\" border=\"0\"></span></a><a rel=\"nofollow\" onmousedown=\"if(event.which == 3) { event.preventDefault(); LaunchPop('https://www.Writing.Com/main/em/action/new/toid/100938977',   'mess100938977_1579090812', '710', '540');  event.stopPropagation(); return false; }\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/em/action/new/toid/100938977/in/1\" target=\"_top\" title=\"Email User: pjr88 [Offline / Private]\" class=\"imgLink imgPortLink noPrint\"><span style=\"vertical-align:middle;padding:0px 0px 0px 0px;\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/mail-off.gif\" width=\"22\" height=\"15\" border=\"0\"></span></a><span class=\"noPrint\"><span id=\"new_ffpjr88\"><a class=\"imgLink\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" onclick=\"doAjaxO('ffpjr88', '', 'post', 'https://www.Writing.Com/main/my_favorites.php', 'action=fanfav&amp;fav=1&amp;user_id=100938977&amp;nopad=1&amp;new=1&amp;ajax=new_ffpjr88');\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Click to add pjr88 to 'My Favorites'. \r\nClick again to become a 'Fan'. \"><span id=\"ffpjr88\" style=\"padding:0px 3px 0px 3px;vertical-align:middle;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/favplus.gif\" style=\"padding-right:1px;\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></a></span></span>.

Realizing that my very breath was being sucked right from my chest, I felt an overwhelming urge to turn and run. Mustering courage from someplace deep inside, I turned away from the demon child and ran as if my life depended on it. Zigging and Zagging through the trees, I had no destination in mind only a compulsive desire to escape to any where away from the child. Making my way through the snow covered forest floor I scanned the horizon or at least what I could make out in the moonless night. I knew they were not far behind me for the tracks that I left as I scurried away was nothing more than a bread crumb trail of death. Briefly glancing over my shoulder, I saw nothing following which should have made me feel better. Instead, it had the opposite effect. Every tree limb seemed to reach for me every stump seemed to try to pull me down into the frozen earth. Stumbling over such a stump I would almost swear I felt hands grasp my ankles. I leapt up with a renewed sense of vigor. Widening my strides I was sure death awaited around every bush, tree, and hillside.<br>\r\nAlthough I had been running for only minutes, I felt as though I had run halfway around the world. Pausing out of necessity to catch what little breath I could, I noticed a clearing not far from where I had kneeled. My thoughts were racing in every direction, but one thing I knew, I had to reach that clearing and I had to reach t now! My whole body shook as I made my final dash. I ran so hard my feet kicked the snow into the air so high off the ground I was finding it increasingly difficult to see. It was as if Mother Nature herself was trying to prevent my escape.<br>\r\nFinally, I was only feet from safety. I stepped into the clearing bent over and began to breath heavily as is I had manage to steal my own life back from what ever was hell bent on keeping it. After a few silent moments I became to calm down. Slowly but surely my wits returned. I began to feel as foolish as a schoolchild who had wet their pants. Just when I had began to convince myself that it was all just my imagination I looked up and saw what appeared to be a door leading straight into the ground. Possibly a cellar door but the dim light that penetrated the holes and cracks gave an almost ominous glow. Pausing only momentarily to ponder this new passage, I wondered if I should seek shelter in the cellar or keep on running as far and as fast as I could.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Save the girl, fight for those who can't fight for themselves. Surrender the girl, distract them with, get past them. There was a window back along the way, right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl lets go of your hand and cowers against the wall behind you. She begins to whimper again, but not to cry. Her fragile little forms rocks on the ground behind you as you go into a stance that allows you to easily dodge left or right or fight if you have to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men catch up with you and twin smirks appear on both their faces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Enough runnin'. Let's have the little girl. You can get out of here.\" His tone promises violence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, no, please, no,\" the little girl chants in a broken voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright, you think, time to decide. Give her up and save your own skin or fight for those who can't fight for themselves? </span></div></div>",

The dumbest thing imaginable, but still the right thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step forward, putting yourself between the girl and the massed crowd, raise your middle finger and yell, \"Fuck you!\"  It comes out a little closer to a whimper than you mean for it to, but hey.  You tried to sound brave.  Those are some good last words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man at the front of the crowd laughs, spits on the ground, then says, \"Buddy, I'm not sure that you understand the nature of the situation right now.  We're <i>not</i> the bad guys here.  I can see how you feel, but we're trying to help you and maybe get you out of this place before nightfall.  Trust me, you don't want to be here after then.  Now, you can't get out on your own, but if you give her to us, we might be able to help you. So, what's it gonna be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want her for?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader pauses for a moment, and two of those behind him step forward.  He holds up his hand to stop them.  \"You don't know what that is, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare and feel your mouth drop open slightly.  The man smiles and says, \"Oh my God, you honestly think that's a little girl, don't you?\" he bursts out laughing, then continues, \"That <i>ain't</i> a little girl.  Maybe it used to be, but it hasn't been for a long damn time.  If you knew what you're standing in front of right now, you'd probably shit yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a glance over your shoulder, you confirm that there is still a small girl in a pink dress standing at the end of the alley, muttering \"please no,\" and letting tears stream down her dirty face.  \"Uh, yeah,\" you say, \"Are you fucking crazy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men step forward again.  One of them takes a metal pipe from a loop in his belt.  \"You're going to have to trust us,\" their leader says, then adds, \"It looks like a girl, but it's not.  That's how it tricks people.  That fucker got Jim last week.  He chased it into a warehouse right before nightfall, and when we came in after it was all over to rescue him, we couldn't find enough of him to stuff in a basket for the burial.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitate, and the leader says, \"Your call.  But we're killing that little shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, as the man with the lead pipe steps less than a foot away, a siren begins to wail.  Its hollow call echos through the streets and alleys of the town like a forsaken animal.  \"Oh, shit,\" the man with the pipe yells, dropping his weapon, \"shit, shit, <i>fuck</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire crowd backs away, then turns around and begins to run worldessly into the fog.  The group's leader falls to the ground after they get out into the street, then yells something inaudible.  The sky begins to darkness, and then suddenly drops into shadow.  Darker shapes move in the street, just on the edge of your vision, and the man screams again, more like an animal being torn apart than a human being.  You look behind you, and the girl is still there, her eyes wide with terror.</span></div></div>",

You push the door so it begins to creek open slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grotesque creature is chained to the stall. It is the decaying, mutated body of a young woman. Chains pierce through hear abdomen and throat. They weave an intricate pattern around her body, arms restraining her to the walls.

Hear screams pierce through the hair, and cut through the sound of the siren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stumble back and fall over, hitting your head on a porcelain sink. You hit the floor, and your vision blurs. You touch the back of your head only to find blood on your hands. You look over at the little girl, and tears are streaming down her face. She isn't looking at you, but staring at the stall. You look back over at the stall to find that all that is left are chains and a trail of blood and worms leading behind you. You scramble to your feet and quickly turn around. The woman stands behind you, her body deformed from years of being chained. She reaches for your face, and manages to touch you before the sirens become silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman vanishes, the room changes back to a somewhat grungy school bathroom. You are left with a blood streaked cheek alone alone with the girl. You wash your face of the blood, and bandage your wound with a piece of your shirt. You search the rest of the stalls to find a baseball bat, and a broom. You break off the brush end of the broom creating a jagged spear, and hand the baseball bat to the little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on here!?\" You scream at her. She runs to a corner and holds her knees to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what's going on!\" She cried, \"All I know is they want me... they want me dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't care about that, you want to know what's really going on. \"What's wrong with this town?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl buries her face into her arms, and shrugs her shoulders, \"I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cannot sit, and wait any longer.

TC lets out a feral cry as you hear the tearing of flesh. Bone splinters and blood splashes as it cascades on the walls and pools down onto the floor. Pieces of him are torn free from his torso and flung with animalistic fury across the room. You shudder and sob, tears spilling like his blood as you hear your only friend suffering the worst way. Guilt tears you apart as painfully as the monster was shredding his skin. You could even hear it chewing on him. There was a gutteral, choked sob that you knew was the last sound of TC, and there was a loud crack, and the sound of his skull being crushed between the monster's hands filled the room. In those seven seconds, there had been more bloodshed and violence then you had witnesses in your entire life. And it happened to the only man who could've helped you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crouch on the floor, unwilling and unable to look up. Tears poured down your face as you were racked with large and remorseful sobs that you could not save him. You were now alone again in the eternal darkness of Silent Hill. The realm where your past was your present and future. The most fearsome place imaginable. A world of chaos, insanity and nightmares readying themselves to frighten you to an inch of your limits. If you weren't torn limb from limb, you would sucumb to the madness of isolation and your own regrets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like hours, but could not have been longer then a few minutes, you felt a soft, small hand on your head. Looking up, you stared into the girl's eyes... she was gently stroking your head and neck, soothing you sympathetically.

Not one of these monsters came any further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled, and turned forward again, only to find a giant wall in front of you. It seems you had literally hit the wall, except on top of this wall sat the little girl. Her eyes were black with the purest rage. She tilted her head eerily and raised her arm to you, flicking her wrist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of heavy breathing arouse behind you. You turned to face a monster that, though it possesed no deformity or injury, stroke such terror into you that your heart nearly failed in that on instant. A nine foot beast stood before you, completely human in shape, with a huge metal pyramid on it's head. The metal was stained with years of blood- blood presumably shed from the sword it weilded. An impossible, ten foot blade was perched menacingly upon it's sholders. It had huge muscles that bulged and throbbed with every twitch, breath, and movement. Your face drained of color as you beheld this great and terrible creature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one vicious twist, it swung the massive sword down. Should it have been closer, your life you have ended instantly. Unfortunately for you, it's brutally sharp tip sliced from your upper chest, down straight though your groin. You felt your trachea severed as you began gasping through the gaping hole in your chest. the blow divided your entire torso, tearing through muscle, but slilding perfectly through the gap in your rib cage. Your blood spurts eratically from you as you fall to your knees, your internal organs piling on the ground in front of you as you choked on the blood filling your lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, in Silent Hill's final message to you, the legendary Pyramid Head reaches down, plunging his hand into your gaping chest cavity and tearing your heart from your body. Your blood now gushes out rapidly as you collapse to the ground. He holds your heart high and crushed it in his grasp, showering himself in the blood of his most recent victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's what you get for being heartless, and leaving the girl behind.</span></div></div>",

You take a minute to memorize the map, it might come in handy later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around a little more, and see the little girl again.  As soon as she sees that you have spotted her she begins running up the road.  You scream at her \"Wait, Stop I want to talk to you.\"  As you begin running after her she runs into a large building ahead of you, you recall from the map that it is the school building.  You continue toward her, but look at your surroundings, you think you have spotted TC's house.  </span></div></div>",

It creaks as you open it, then suddenly blinding white light pours out of the doorway and you find yourself swallowed by it. It is too bright to bare, so you close your eyes tight.<br>\r\n   \"You have finally come. You have good instincts to follow what you believe is right, even though you have no reason to believe it.\" The voice is very loud and deep, and seems to echo accross the indeffinate space.<br>\r\n   \"Don't ask me, I will tell you,\" admonishes the voice, predicting your question before you ask it. \"I am here to bring order to chaos, as are you. You are here for a reason. While I have much knowledge, I have not the power to set things in motion. You do.\"<br>\r\n   \"Set what in motion?,\" you implore, trying in vain to match the volume of the booming voice. \"What power do you think I have?\"<br>\r\n   \"Once you know what I am about to tell you, you will have all the power. You must seek out the man who calls himself TC. Tell him the plan is once again in motion and that with his help you will destroy the evil that resides in Silent Hill.\" This is too much for you to understand. How does he expect you to do this.<br>\r\n   \"I know your thoughts. You will be able to do this. First you must find the place where all undead are made. There the souls of the dead were forced to remain on earth, though they long for the afterlife. Once there, you must fight your way into the main lab and retrieve the Token of Eternal Rest. After that TC will know what to do.\"<br>\r\n   \"Why not just send him, then,\" you ask in a rather harsh tone.<br>\r\n   \"I have once before. But he failed to complete the task. I have since realized my error in sending him. First, I should have known that there would be no way for him to fight his way through the mass of zombies who reside in the lab. He had no idea what awaited him. This is how he got his unfortunate disfigurement. I will give you a weapon this time. The Light of Dawn. It is a shard of ancient stone, known to harness the sun's light. No evil thing will dare approach you while you wield this. But beware. It's use is limited. Call upon its power only when absolutely necesary. My second mistake was to send him alone. I pulled you from your world into this one to remedy that.\"<br>\r\n   \"ME! Why me?\"<br>\r\n   \"I searched for years to find someone with your instincts and your ability to deal with difficult situations. I am confident that you are the only one who is right for this possition.\" Your mind is racing to catch up with the insane details of this conversation. Are you really strong enough to take on a world of the undead? Is TC one to be trusted? It is all just to much for you to grasp.<br>\r\n   \"I must stress to you one thing. Understand that this is not a request. I brought you here to do this and so do it you must. Trust in TC even more than he trusts in you. He is meant to do this as well. I will hear from you when your task has been fulfilled.\" And with a loud crack the light dissipates, leaving you standing in a classroom in shambles, standing on the discarded papers that line the floor. Windows are broken and there is blood streaked along some of the walls. On the floor in front of you is a translucent yellow stone, so small you almost don't notice it is there. The Light of Dawn. You pick it up and examine it. Doubt floods your mind. Up until a point you viewed the mightily voiced being as some sort of wise, all-knowing god, despite the fact that he claimed to be responsible for TC's accident. But at the words 'I am confident', you began to wonder if he isn't just another selfish, fool of a being who has learned to play god. How much different is he from human and thus how much better equipped is he to set right the wrongs of the world. Who is he and how has he been appointed savior over the earth, in multiple dementions no less. You wonder if you should forget the voice and simply try and make out the best you can. But then how can you ignore the feeling you had about the little girl. You realize now that it must have been him, taking innocent form. You are no less at a loss for what to do after all this thought, but a choice must be made.</span></div></div>",

Dead bodies lean against the walls and also hang from various spots on the ceiling. All this detail illuded you while chaising the girl. Had you noticed, you might not have followed her to that room. You wonder if you will regret that act later. <br>\r\n   Once at TC's doorstep, you knock hard on the door, keeping a close lookout for zombies. TC opens the door a crack and looks over at you.<br>\r\n   \"What do you want?\" He bellows crossly. \"Ya high-tailed it outa here without even lettin me know. Where did ya go, to follow that 'little girl' out the door?\"<br>\r\n   \"Yes,\" you reply, recieving a huff of dissaproval from TC. \"And she wasn't a little girl.\"<br>\r\n   \"I could've told ya that ya arogant cuss. I'm surprised yer still alive!\"<br>\r\n   \"I met a friend of yours at the school. He told me what happened. You tried to beat them once. But you failed.\" TC shoots you a look of complete shock that is almost terror. Then anger overcomes his face once more.<br>\r\n   \"Ya don't know anything. Fer ten months I tried fightin. In this hell, that's more'an eternity. But they were too strong, too numerous. If ya met the same bein I did, then ya prob'ly guessed he's a trickster an' an illusionist. That little girl was prob'ly him, lurin ya into his realm ta feed ya false hopes. There's no salvation fer humankind. Only survival.\"<br>\r\n   \"That's it? Ten months? After ten months you give up just like that?\"<br>\r\n   \"Ten months? Hahaha! No my friend. Try ten years. Ten years i've servived this hell. Ten years a' knowin that my only hope is ta endure, an' maybe die a natural, human death. NOW tell me ya know somethin, eh.\"<br>\r\n   \"I do,\" you proclaim. \"And this is how we go about it.\" You explain to him all that the voice told you and show him the stone. After you are done he stands to think a while. Then he lifts his head and looks around the block. The street is strangely still and the fog seems to have lifted some.<br>\r\n   \"Well,\" says TC finally, \"sounds like a long shot. But what can I say. Ten years is ten years to long, an' secretly Iv'e longed ta hear from the great voice lately. I need a reason ta hope again. Okay then, we had best prepare. My name is Terrance Clearwater by the way. TC.\" You reach out and shake his hand with renewed trust and resolve. You feel united and stronger, but still your faith waivers. Terrance gives you a look as serious as any and points a long, bony finger in your direction.<br>\r\n   \"Now this is up ta you. I will not attempt this again if I can't count on ya ta do this with me. I'm lettin' ya know, this is yer last chance ta back out. Are ya still willing ta fight?\"</span></div></div>",

The place is swarming with zombies and burning cars surround the building, casting a perfect light arround it.<br>\r\n   \"Ya sure that rock will do what it's suppose ta'? We can't get all these guys with knives.\" Terrance asks. You reassure him that things are under control, while trying to hold down the fear and uncertainty that has come over you. With knife in one hand and the Dawn Shard in the other, you charge into the fray, TC directly behind you. At first everything seems to go well, and the few zombies that aren't fast enough to flee from the light of the now bright, shining stone, get beheaded by TC's machette. However you have barely made it through the laboritory doors when the stone's light begins to waiver. The zombies close in on all sides and you both go down with out much of a fight. Terrance shoots you a look of pain and betrail just before he takes a fatal wound to the heart. You try to shout your sincerest apologies at having been such a fool, but your own fatal wounds stiffle the cry. The last thing you see before you fall to your death is a little girl standing just outside the mob of undead creatures, crying.</span></div></div>",

Petrified with total fear you do not move.  The dim lights suddenly come back on only to reveal that a flesh eaten decomposing figure is standing directly in front of you.  Maggots and other flesh eating creatures are crawling around its facial orifices.  You are face to face with a zombie.  Your heart is on the verge of exploding at the release of adrenaline mixed with fear jets through your body.

The scar-faced man is still there.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me in,\" he says in the same phlegmy voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly flip around, back to the wall, heart racing, and you spot a small wooden chair in a dark corner across the room.  You don't trust the small latch to hold the rickety door.  Perhaps, the chair can be propped up under the handle.  This will at least give you some time to think of a way out of here.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitate, because you can only see the chair's splintered looking back support and upper portion of the legs.  The rest is hidden in the same pitch black shadow that surrounds most of the cluttered room.  Squinting your eyes, you finally scan the vicinity for any sign of the little girl.  There are no other doors, as far as you can tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me in.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou inhale before peeling yourself away from the wall, but you're instantly hit with a gust of malodorous wind.  You can almost taste the rotten stench in the air, a smell that wasn't there a moment ago, and you have to swallow to keep from gagging.  You quickly cup your palms over your mouth and fight the increasing urge to vomit.  <i>There must be a window in this room</i>, you think to yourself as you peer into the direction the wind came in from.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me in.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are startled by the sound of the doorknob rattling, but you exhale a sigh of relief as you notice that it's locked--for now. That's when a horribly scarred arm comes crashing through the door.  You stumble backwards to the center of the room and try to hastily pick yourself up, but you suddenly realize that you can no longer hear the sound of your own heartbeat.  There is only a piercing silence, which paralyzes you in fear.  Confused, you brace the floor with both hands, still fighting nausea.  Just then, you notice the putrid odor has completely disappeared.  You wonder if it was ever there at all.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What if there is no window?</i> you think, as you squint your eyes and peer into the darkness on your right.  You glance back at the door and notice the scarred arm violently moving back and forth.  It appears to be stuck.  You turn to your left and squint towards the dark corner in which the chair lay on its side.  You can't help feeling like there is something hiding in the shadows, but you're unsure if it's just your imagination.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't trust your own facilities anymore.  Should run to the right, in hopes that there really is a window on the other this wall of darkness?  Or do you go left and retrieve the chair, hoping that if you prop it under the door-handle, you might buy yourself more time to find another way out? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Using the cash register on the counter, you walk over to the locked door.

Someone's home, you sighed.  With ray of hope flickering in you, you walked to the staircase and headed upstairs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you are in front of the door.  You can see light from below the door.  Oh please ... let there be someone in here, you prayed silently.  Then you notice shadows moving in the light.  Yes!  Someone's definitely in here.

It was from a woman.  Shocked, you stepped back and covered your mouth with your hand.  And then the screaming stopped.  It was muffled.  Someone was trying to silence that poor woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then you heard the footsteps.  Coming closer ... and closer.  Your jaw dropped and your eyes saw the door knob slowly turning.  It will open any moment now.  And when it does ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho knows what will happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI better leave now, you thought to yourself.

A trickle of blood ventures out from beneath your palm, you must have cut it when you tumbled into the table and knocked everything on the ground. There was the broken plate next to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith wide eyes you looked up at this woman who couldn't be real. No, not real. Not at all. But the knife was real. It seemed like you had all the time in the world to think about what to do next and how you'd do it. Everything slowed down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got into a position with your feet under you and grabbed the back of a chair that had fallen over. With your muscles coiled and your hands grasping the chair you lunched up and swung. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chair shattered as it hit her in the face and you are left holding the back. The momentum of the strikes carried you clean around in a circle and brought you back around to face her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had dropped the knife to the ground. The sound rang in your ears and seemed louder than it actually was. Her nose was a bloody ruin. That blood spilled thick and fast from her nose over her lips and down along the front of her uniform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost giggle, her name was Flo. And now her blooding was flowing. Too bad no one else was here to get the joke.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress stumbled back away from you and fell to the floor. In the movies, they were never dead. You weren't going to make that mistake. Oh no. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer only hand was on the floor, clawing. You stomped that hand to bloody bones and meat with her right foot. She screetched and recoiled, but you weren't stopping. You didn't want her to come back and try and kill you again, did you? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed her knife in one hand and her dirty blonde hair in the other. The scalp was visible. Sitting on her back kept her in place while you jerked her head back and started to saw your way through her neck. The blade wasn't as sharp as you thought so it took some work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was done you stood up, bloody, victorious. A kick of your foot sent her head rolling away. You were keeping this knife. It was stupid to throw away a weapon and this was the only one you had. You might as well keep it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis dinner wasn't safe. Too many windows, no place to hide. You needed to go somewhere else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. Come with me.\" The voice was a little rough, like the owner hadn't used it in a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn and look at who spoke, knife in your hand and at the ready. But he didn't seem like a threat. He was a tall, but lanky. Dark brown hair fell over his forehead and he peeked out at you with such unnatural eyes, reddish brown. A color you've never seen on a human before. You must have looked curious or cynical because he cleared his throat and spoke again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon. You wanna get outta here before dark, alright. You think she was bad? You haven't seen anything. Let's get the hell outta here. Keep the knife though, we might need it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned and started to walk away. Obviously he trusted that you would follow him. You took a second and thought about it. Your chances of survival would be better with another person to watch your back. Unless, of course, he was trying to kill you. </span></div></div>",

So, yeah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this place?\" You asked him. \"Who are you?\" A moving shadow caught your attention again, but when you turned your head into its direction, you saw nothing but an empty intersection. You turned your head to the only person there again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man emptied his can and smashed it. \"I see you're not new here,\" he said, throwing the smashed can. \"It's not safe to be wandering here alone unarmed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get your point, just help me clear out my confusion,\" you said. \"Who are you?

I suppose, well ...\" and he turned around, looking vaguely up at the misshapen stars, \"I suppose that comes from how they can talk as the others can't. Like parrots is how I've heard it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man is insane, you think. The scene in the diner was bad, but now you're stuck with a madman, apparently. Tim sees you looking sideways at him, but only responds by shoving the gun at you. \"Here,\" he says. \"You think you know better? Then you'll need this more than me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou automatically check the weapon, a reflex action. It's in pretty bad shape, and probably wouldn't be accurate beyond a yard or two, but hey, any port in a storm, right? You just wish you'd had it back in that diner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to get out,\" Tim says now, gesturing down the street. \"But I can't do it on my own. There's too many. So I've been waiting for somebody like you to come along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gun feels comfortable, but you shake your head. \"I have to call the police,\" you say. \"There's been an accident.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Police?\" Tim snorts. \"What police? Haven't you been listening?\" Then, looking over your shoulder, he shoots a knowing glance. \"Oh, but I guess if it's the law you want, here comes the only one town right now. Better see what he says.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you turn and confront some sick, shambling horror, much worse than Flo from the diner, emerging from the door of what looks like a burned-out bakery. This one has both arms reduced to stumps, but a sprung jaw full  of glittering teeth, and eyes like huge, murderous pools, foul as the devil's. And somehow, impossibly, it's wearing the black and blue uniform of the SHPD (albeit spattered with foul gore).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christ!\" you ejaculate, pulling the trigger. Bang! And the officer-thing drops like a bag of bones. Headless, you reflect, these things don't seem to be much of a threat ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, however, Tim grabs your arm, pulls you forward, away from the body, and snorts his derision. \"Well that will draw the rest of them,\" he intones. \"Better move. And point that thing away from me, will you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stagger after. \"Where are we going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large building looms up ahead, the biggest so far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For someone of his build, that's pretty darn impressive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are we stopping?!\", you ask the man, trying desperately to catch your breath. \"I'm afraid that this is as far as you will follow me.\", said the man as his facial expression changed from one of terror to one of seriousness. \"Did you really believe I would actually share my safe-house and it's supplies with someone like you? Don't be foolish. We all know there's no chance either of us are getting out of here, so I might as well enjoy what little I've managed to acquire on my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man turns and starts running back down the street. You are left standing there, soda can in hand, and not able to believe what has happened.<br>\r\nOut of the corner of your eye, you manage to see a small light.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once inside you watch from behind the big bay window. The mysterious man cocks his head to the side as though he is listening to something only he hears. He stares at you through the dirty glass, eyes wide with surprise then shrugs and runs down the street disappearing from sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou survey your surroundings and wonder if you made the right choice. The front of the police station is separated from the back by a wall which has a thick glass window with a speaker in it. The only things present in the front half of the station are a long wooden bench bolted to the floor and a locked steel door that leads to the back of the station. You press your face against the window vying for a better view and yell into the speaker. You receive indistinct shouting and clanging sounds in response. You hear a jingle of keys and a loud click as the steel door falls ajar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab the door handle throwing open the door in a rush, when a hand holding a heavy key ring with many keys falls to floor with a loud clatter. There is a fresh bloody trail leading down the hallway to the right like a body was drug away in that direction. You bend down and take the key ring from the hand as if in a dream then look around the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you notice is a large metal cage on the wall behind the desk. It is full of various long guns and pistols-- obviously locked. In the corner stands a large steel storage cabinet, also locked. On the desk in front of the gun cage is a black nylon gym bag with a lock on it, an open ledger with some handwritten entries, a computer with a stand up mic attached to it, a phone and an ashtray with a lit cigarette smoldering in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab the phone holding the receiver to your ear, and hear the same whispering static as the phone from the diner. You stare at the black computer screen while hitting buttons on the keyboard and moving the mouse. Nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She gives a little smile and continues, \"I know a doctor who can patch that up for you.  Just take my hand.\"  She holds out her arm.

Well, maybe not during the procedure, but after, you will understand that pain is a weakness, and all weaknesses must be eliminated, for the continuation of the human race.\"  Her smile grew to show her teeth, but it did not reach her eyes.  They remained cold.  You realize what a strange color they are, fiery gold in the center and gray around the edges, like lightning during a storm.  They glowed with an eerie light that illuminated emotions, thoughts, and secrets.  As you stare into her eyes you feel naked, everything you have ever said or thought is exposed before this malevolent beaten child. Her eyes out shine the flickering lights, showing every piece of dirt on the floor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure, I am forced to decline your invitation.\" Your mouth is suddenly parched of all water and the wood falls to the floor with a loud smack.

You must come, it is your decision to come on your own free will, or by force.  But since you have declined to come on your own, we must help you.\"  Her smile returns, larger than ever and full of malice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bodies fall toward you and there is a tap on your shoulder.

You run, as quickly as you can, down the hall.  Your skin returns to normal, but the screaming shadows threaten to overtake you as the swirl and coil faster across the dry wallpaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp ahead you can see a pair of doors.

You slide over it as silently as possible, and enter the door in an attempt not to draw attention. Unfortunately, there was a monster in the room with you.<br>\r\n  Stuck between a rock and a hard place, you decide your chances are high for taking on the armless, twitching, animated corpse staggering toward you. So without a second thought you bash it into oblivion with your stool leg, which, in hindsight, you realize you were very bright to have brought. The beast falls and twitches an accusing twitch, sending a cool breeze up your spine.<br>\r\n  You proceed to investigate the room; all it is is a storage room. You pray that you haven't trapped yourself, and look for another door. Lucky for you, there is one.<br>\r\n  And it leads to a long hallway, at the end of which is the Exit. You are eager to leave the place so you rush to the door. As you close in on a door to your side, it crashes open, knocking you to the wall and stunning you. Out comes Pyramid Head, dragging behind him the raped corpse.<br>\r\n  You panic. He drops the dead monster and bangs his helmet. He holds his hand out, seemingly reaching for you. He then drags his sword behind him. You stand up and bash him on his helmet, but your club just bounces off and makes him annoyed. He crashes the flat of his sword into you, knocking you further down the hallway. You struggle for air as he closes in, but your will to live isn't extinguished.<br>\r\n  You piece together every ounce of your courage and stand up, breaking for the door. You slam into it, wincing as you turn the knob to open it.<br>\r\n  It's locked.<br>\r\n  Realizing it's over, you sit down and wait for Pyramid Head to finish you. Then the door beside you swings open. The girl you saw in the window sticks her head out and looks at you. Only, she looks evil, very pale and with black eyes.<br>\r\n  \"Great. 2 vs. 1.\" you mutter. She screeches again, forcing Pyramid Head backwards in agony. Then a great arm shoots out of the darkness of the room beside you. The pain eventually becomes too much to bear, and you close your eyes.<br>\r\n  Everything faded.</span></div></div>",

P.S. Don't call out, as it will not work. Just keep it. </i><br>\r\n  Not sure if you should listen to the note, you just tuck it in your pocket and try to forget about it. You go through the door and find the whole room is covered in the same blood and rust, the floor turned to grating, and sirens in the distance. The Exit is locked, and so is the room Pyramid Head used.<br>\r\n  Back in the tool storage room, you are preparing to enter into the main shopping room when you hear a faint static from somewhere. You look around, and see no radio or television or anything anywhere. You grab the cell phone and discover it has a radio feature. You consider shutting the radio off until a movement in the corner draws your attention.<br>\r\n  The same no-armed creature is standing up, and it's staggering toward you again. Acting on instinct you bash it into oblivion with your club. You then check the tools on the shelves and boxes. They've changed to surgical tools, and there is a stretcher in one corner. Not wanting to know what is going on, you go to the entrance.<br>\r\n  No Pyramid Head, no monsters, nothing. It's a bare room with no shelves or anything. The door from which you entered is covered in a tarp, and the air is heavy. You come to a door which Pyramid Head obscured, and enter to find two monsters.<br>\r\n  You bash them with your club and kick to make sure they're down. They are. You find a table with only a box cutting knife and an ad for the diner upon it. You go back to the main room and cut the tarp off of the door. You exit to a similair scenario on the street. Hearing wings in the distance, you rush to the diner door.<br>\r\n  You grasp the handle and dash inside. It's just like outside, but there is a stool in the center, the exact center. Upon it lies two gems: a ruby and a sapphire. You think you remember something like this on a movie once.<br>\r\n  <i> Choose the stone to leave the nightmare. Don't choose wrong, else the Punisher comes </i> says a note on the stool.<br>\r\n  So, choose one. Don't choose wrong, or else.</span></div></div>",

Put it down.\"  The barrel of the pistol jabs your arm holding the broken stool leg.  \"Now.\"  You do it, hating yourself.

Why take chances with your own life if you've got someone else's?\"  The foot pushes down harder, forcing out more of your breath.  \"I've been eying that demon's choice on the bar stool for the better part of today... if there is such a thing as day in this fucked up shitfest.  In fact, I was even ready to make that choice myself...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the floor, you can still see the sunlight stretching across the cracked tiles.  The light shadow of a shade tree is rocking gently in a breeze that must exist less than twenty feet out that back door... a breeze that may as well be twenty miles away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But then you showed up, groping around like a lemming that can't decide which lake to drown in.

Then, almost as an afterthought, he casually, viciously, slams his heel into your kidney.  \"Don't say I never gave you anything, friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggle to breathe as the man walks purposefully toward your sunlight.  Your mind races, searching for options.  Anything.  Anything at all.  He's five feet from the door when you find your feet.

Not so much. \"Alright, I'm going... I'm going!\" you say as you hold up your hands and back up slowly. Once you get to the door you immediately swing it open and run out into the fog as fast as you can. The radio hissed as you sprinted down the street, though you thankfully didn't spot any of the creatures from before roaming around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several solid minutes of running you take cover in the hollowed ruins of a burned building and slowly make your way up to the second floor while avoiding the large gaps in the charred floorboards. After ducking into one of the sturdier rooms you collapse behind a desk and take a few deep breaths. You were completely exhausted, but at least the radio was silent now. You stare up through the mostly collapsed ceiling at the foggy sky above and prayed that nothing passed overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis place wasn't exactly a fortress, if something bigger than a bat swooped in you'd be completely defenseless, the flimsy broken roof wouldn't even slow the monsters down. \"I need to find shelter...\" you whisper as you rub your forehead. \"There has to be someone else here who can help me out of this blasted place. That old guy with the gun would probably just shoot me if he saw me again... what if the others I encounter are like that? At any rate... I can't stay here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou check your revolver to make sure its loaded and carefully climb down the crumbling stairs to the ground floor. A loose board breaks in half as you get off the stairs and almost sends you face first into a massive hole near the front door but you managed to catch yourself at the last minute and walk around it. \"This whole place is a giant deathtrap, I've got to be more careful...\" you groan as you head back out onto the fog-choked road. \"Where the hell am I?\"</span></div></div>",

The shadow starts to twitch and glide closer to you. \"Oh shit\" you say as you pull out your trusty  .38 revolver and aim it at the shadows. The speed is inhumane so you decide not to risk it and you pull the trigger resulting in a ear ringing sound and the shadow just drops. Still aiming the gun at the body, you walk closer and closer thinking \"Should I be doing this\".

This time, as the shadows seem to <i>glide</i> closer, you pick up a low labored sucking sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound is odd, and under the circumstances, sickening. You vainly think for a moment, about the small straw like instrument at the dentists office that sucks the saliva out of your oral cavity to improve your dentist's efficiency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising your .38 for what seems to be the last time, you think, that's exactly what it sounds like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eye catches the revolving barrel, a reminder of your small budget of bullets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly five left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't remember exactly how many shadows were closing on you, and there was no time to count now, but you're almost positive there were more than five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot enough ammo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis, of course, was assuming all of your shots were fatal. Even a decorated marksman, which you aren't, would have trouble shooting to kill in this soup of a fog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou surprise yourself when you take your first shot. In your flurry of thoughts, you unconciously fired. It seems as if the muscles in your arms and hands sent the message to your brain, rather than vice versa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have a moment of triumph as you see the particular shadow you are facing drop to the pavement with a sticky thud. But your moment stays exactly that, a moment, when you hear the familiar ambient noise of the dentist's chair getting dangerously close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhirling with terrific speed, you fire before you aim, catching nothing but fog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wail in panic, and in a far off portion of your mind, you notice how thick the fog is, as the bullet's path was traced down the street by the circular rupture in the mist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the formerly rear shadow burst from the fog. The once human looking figure was now only a walking pile of mottled, yellow flesh wrapped in tattered and filthy clothes that were no more than rags now. This time, you meet your target, and it promptly drops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, you howl in unearthly pain as your favored arm is bitten by an unseen foe. With your adrenaline glands pumping on overdrive, and with the consistency of the sound, the sucking sound had grown almost inaudible. You hadn't realized how close the other shadows had gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill gripping the pistol, you fire a shot uncontrollably from the searing pain on your arm. The slug harmlessly strikes the pavement and ricochets out into the fog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to feel many cold, dead hands scratching and grabbing at you as you spin in a frenzy of terror, attempting to shake free of the creatures. A cold, damp smell begins to harrass your nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're unaware of it, but you're screaming at the top of your lungs. You scream mostly out of fear, although, the first attacker is still sinking it's teeth into your bicep. Reaching over with your empty hand, you grab the gun from your now useless arm and stuff the muzzle <i>into</i> the assumed head of the biter. You moan at the softness of the flesh and the portion of brain revealed from the muzzle induced hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>click</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, that can't be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>click</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gun is empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're sure you have atleast one more round, pulling the trigger once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>click</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough one bullet wouldn't get you out of this, it would atleast put to rest the uncontrollably biting creature. Maybe then you can break free from these gently fleshed demons long enough to reloa--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaggh\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are bitten harshly again, this time on your thigh. The reaching hands are gaining a better grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the butt of the gun, you thrash at the creature gnawing on your arm. You beat away bits of decayed brain and skull, to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you drop to one knee, you feel yet another bite, this time into the back of your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moan weakly now as you start to feel the intoxicating effects of blood loss. Still, you drop the gun with heavy clack, and reach for your pocket with the box of bullets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you wrap your fingers around the small box, you are bitten on the forearm, causing the box to slip from your fingers just as it leaves the folds of your trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small, cardboard ammo case spits bullets across the pavement, landing in dissaray with tiny, metallic pattering sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're talking to noone in particular, knowing you're death will arrive in minutes, maybe seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fall once more, to all fours for a moment, then onto your chest, as if you were trying to embrace the whole street. You don't know how many mouths are biting you know, nor do you care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're slowly letting go. The pain is long gone, and your final thought is where that final bullet went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember the fear that caused you to unknowingly(until now) fire <i>two</i> slugs into the chest of the creature that first crept up behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mouth the words \"son of a..\", unable to finish even the muted form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA warm trickle of blood leaks from your lips, down your cheek, onto the pavement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaguely, you sense the hair on the back of your head being torn from your scalp in a vicious bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close your eyes, waiting. Waiting for your last breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHE END</span></div></div>",

The gun, still warm in your hand from unloading the loud, unnerving round into the creature, seems to be bringing you less comfort as the radio, slipped half-hazard between your belt and dark blue jeans, begins to pick up the faintest sounds of interference. The sound begins to resonate, the frequency growing ever strong by the minute as the creature on the ground stops shivering and lays motionless. Still the radio continues to moan louder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around and head back, past the shelter of the rustic restaurant and briskly venture through the blanketing fog, unsure of your destination but willing to try anywhere that might silence the grainy static that is still blaring from the radio. The buildings on both sides of the street look desolate, covered by a coating of soot and age, they all blend together, forming the walls of the canyon down which you find yourself blindly stumbling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe radio stops suddenly, and then a new noise, the sharp, violent scrapping sound of metal being dragged slowly across a hard surface in the distance begins, ever so slowly to come at you. Frozen in your tracks you try to discern any distinguishing characteristics of the harsh sound but all your mind can do is cringe as if fingernails were constantly being dragged slowly across an endless chalkboard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you the sound is still masked by the dense fog, but suddenly it dawns on you that fog shouldn't float slowly to the ground and collect on the surfaces, as the thick, continuous waves of particles floating down from somewhere in the ominous sky above are doing. Ash? Sticking out your hand you catch on of the chalky thin flakes and holding it between your fingers it leaves a pitch black streak upon your pale hand. It is ash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the radio, which had gone silent crackles with a pop, then a low steady crumpling begins to grow. The dragging sound, once distant now feels remarkably closer, the radio growing proportionally louder as it closes in on you. Surrounded on two sides by the barren gray walls of buildings, and on the other two by dense walls of ever-falling ash in habited by an unknown danger that is narrowing in on your location you have to act, before it is too late.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Panicking from the lack of options and time, you rush over to it. Yeah, yes, you think quickly to yourself, I can fit in there fine. Without wasting a second you lift the light-enough bin over you, ignoring the small shower of rotten foods and dirty old papers and wrappers you quickly duck down inside, careful not to make anymore noise. Ugh, slap yourself, in your hastened panic you forgot to turn off the radio! The hulking sounds of a large . . . creature? Can be heard puffing and wheezing, presumably from all the thick smoke and ash it endured for God knows how long. The massive metallic object it drags along can be heard, though muffled by the thick plastic around you, it still managed to flood your body with goosebumps of the biggest kind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggle to reach the volume on the radio and after an uncomfortable angling reach, your chicken wing shaped arm reaches it. Your fingers hurt under the angled pressure, trying to twist that knob.

Good. Now just hold your breath and remain cal-- Oh! Crap! 'Thft thft' The large beast of a man with no shirt, riddled with hellish scars and ridiculously large bulging muscles and a freakishly big long sword, lifts the flimsy cover  from over you. With little effort, it? he? tosses the bin aside and it goes flying away into the distance. Why are you looking at the bin or trying to figure out what this thing is!? RUN! With even less effort it lifts its freakishly large sword and swings it down at you. Damn, freezing in place is understandable, that sword is huge and looks like your maker, you close your eyes seeing your inevitable demise. . . . At least it was too dumb to gauge distance, the sword easily pierced the brick wall behind you but was too thick and couldn't finish its journey through to you and through you. It growls loudly, its breath smells of rotten flesh old blood further crippling you. With its monster sized free hand, it reaches to grab you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn it son, focus!! You snap out of it and dodge roll out of the way. Now run! Don't look, just book it! Yes, somethin' is very wrong with this town and place, but trust me, now's not the time to go asking anything or anyone any question's. Hey stop, slow down. You spot a police station up ahead seeing the entire town boarded up on your way here, the lights and sturdy looking metals bars that make up the fence looks like a good bet. You make haste for the large thick, oak, front doors. C'mon try the door. Good, it's open, enter quickly but cautiously. . . . Okay, at first glance, though barely lit by the table lamps scattered throughout, the place looks empty. Not sure if that's good or bad. . . . All right, nice work, your pretty fast when your life depends on it, you just might have a chance at making it out of here. . . You sure ran fast enough, that-big-thing didn't see where you ran off to in that thick fog. Plus you  killed like five blocks in a minute and a half. . . . Use the radio it seems to react to those, things? You turn the radio on, nothing, full blast, nothing. . Okay turn it down, remember what happened just a little while ago. I'm pretty sure it heard your feeble attempt to turn off the radio and that's how it found you, otherwise my plan would of worked famously. . . . Fine yeah, how could you know the radio reacts to them and they are attracted to the sound. . . . Well, bam, lesson one. . . . Now your trembling at the entrance to a spooky police station. It looks to have seen some traffic, but not by many and not recently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm a cautious cat so I'm putting both options on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can turn around and just leave, I mean look at the town and this place, not good. . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nor<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, this place looks sturdy. You can explore this desolate hellhole and hope to find maybe a map (gonna really need that), maybe some ammo for your peashooter. A nice big policeman flashlight. And heck, there might be answers and some clues as to what the hell is going on in this town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n[[ On your way in the road sign said -Silent Hill-,  Never heard of it . . why? What happened here? How'd you end up in the diner and NOT the side of the road with your head cracked open like a busted water melon? Despite all the crap I'm talkin' and the monster and the smoke; When you ponder how you feel about this place, something about it seems strangely familiar . . . You feel like maybe you were summoned here. Almost as if their's an unasked question about it you were called to answer . . . An old 'home' you used to love, but forgot about.

Lucky you: if you hadn't, you'd be dead. A large red figure crashed through the bloody window, and you see it has wings, and large ones at that! Without thinking, survival kicks in and you fire 2 rounds into the devil; one in the chest, one in the stomach. It shakes them off, and howls. You once more fire a round, this time aimed, in the thing's head. The thing falls down, and roars. Then it dies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Once your heart stops beating at the speed of sound, you try to think of what to do. Then you hear the sound of wings. More wings, a lot more. You don't have enough ammo to fight, but you can't go outside. If this place is like a normal diner, it should have a basement and a kitchen. The kitchen has knives, but there is less chance they'll find you in the basement. But who knows what's down there...</span></div></div>",

It's a series of corridors, leading to doors with the same decor. You decide not you go through the doors, but rather explore the halls. After ten or so minutes, you reach a large door with a different decoration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It's a figure that looks like death, scythe and all, holding a large orb. Well, should be holding a large orb. It was a hole where it should be. You marvel at the large mural when footsteps sound from behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You swing around to a \"Who the hell are you?\" You face a portly balding man, holding a double barrel with a pipe in his belt.

You decide to leave the knife alone for now and search around. Perhaps find out yourself what could have happened in this place. You searched where you had picked up the knife. Only to find there was no blood where it was sitting before. Nor anywhere around the spot. \"No blood? Was it left here?\" You thought. It was perhaps silly to think that anyone would leave a bloody knife around. But perhaps there was blood somewhere else in this place.

You pick it up and immediately try to use it. \"Hello? Is anyone there?\" You asked but received no response. \"Hello?! Is anyone there?!\" You yelled into it, hoping for anything. But still, nothing comes through. You curse under your breath, but keep the radio with you and put it in your pocket. \"It has to work sometime.\" You thought.

A staggering hunched over humanoid creature was coming up to the window. Creeping closer and closer. It's skin, dark. It's face eyeless. You stand there frozen, trying to process in your mind at what you're seeing. When it gets close enough it hits its head against the window. Trying to break through.

It launches itself at you, and you scream. <br>\r\n\"No! Stop!\" It covers your mouth with it's hand. It shakes its head, letting its black hood fall down, revealing its face.<br>\r\nNot it...him. <br>\r\nHe looks about 27 or  28, with a little bit of scruff, green eyes, and dark hair.

You try to push it away as it tried to push it head twards you with it's mouth wide open, revealing it's roting, blood stained teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you lie there trying to hold it back you hear the voice again, look to your upper left. You do as your told and see a blood stained pipe. holding back the thing trying to eat with your right arm you grab the pipe and beat it off of you when you git up you start hitting it over and over but you don't seam to phase it. No no aime for the head. You do so and crack its skull, you swing again and it's brains splatter everywhere and it stops moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down on the flore breathing heavily. You where right the first time said the voice. Right about what? you ask in a angry tone. Where my voice was coming from. You get up and walk over to the shattered radio and started stomping on it. That won't do you any good, now go get that key. You grown and walk over to the register and oppened it and found an old fashion key whats this go to, where am I, what did you mean when you said my anger got me hear? You don't remember?</span></div></div>",

You spin round as they reach the window and start bashing the glass with bloodied hands and hanging sinew. Terrified you whip the pistol out your pocket but find that the clip is empty. Picking up the box of bullets you fumble with the lid and manage drop the box, rounds bouncing in all directions with distinct metallic clinks. Falling to your knees you manage to start fitting individual rounds into the clip but as you are halfway through the window to your right shatters and a huddle of zombies fall through. Their mutilated faces come straight out of hell, blood ozzing onto the floor as they start crawling towards you. It's then that you realise that they haven't made any sound! No moaning. Standing up you look down to find all their throats have been ripped out. but that doesn't matter. You aim your gun at the closest zombie and blow it's brain out. Following shots rattle round the dinner as blow each of their skulls wide open with splattering efficiency. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand there, breathing heavily, taking in the scene and trying to process what's just transpired. You decide to follow the advice of the man from the radio and open the door at the back of the room. But first, you reload your gun and shove a fist full of rounds into your pocket. Turning round you find the original creature you bashed in with a pipe and fire a shot into it's mangled head for good measure. Walking over to the door you insert the ornate key and turn it twice. The old door creaks open to reveal a dark musty set of stairs leading down into the darkness. Taking out your phone you turn on the light but notice you only have 13% battery left and it's an iphone so you basically have around 10 mins of light left before you are plunged into the darkness with god knows what! Taking a deep breath you walk down the stairs with your gun in one hand and massively overpriced phone in the over.....</span></div></div>",

About an hour later you wake up and its still light out. You look around and see ivy vines up the walls and blood on the ground from where you fell. The room looks like a jail cell. </span></div></div>",

Jenny couldn't help to step back. In your time with her you learned that she is 26 years old, apparently she loves cooking a lot because of her mother when she was sad or in bad mood her mother always cooked something just to make her happy, when you asked about her she said that her mother had an car accident that she witnessed since that day she had an aversion to the blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ok?\"you ask her while comforting her.<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am fine. Thanks by the way\"Jenny says with a pleased smile before gaining the composture.<br>\r\nYou begin to read the message and it says \"Maybe I am going to die here, I was only a journalist investigating the misterious town of Silent Hill, using my last strenght I decided to leave this message to whoever finds it maybe you can tell the true about this town.\" Jenny tluches you and start signaling a path with other blood messages.<br>\r\nYou decidet to read the second message \"Okay, first apperently most of the people who runs this town are part of some sort of secret sect who adores a demon who they say can bring a new world, apparently they used a girl for the ritual to summon the demon they praised,but in the last momment a good samaritan who was passing by saved the little girl in the last moment, but this leads to open a gate which let creatures of hell (literally speaking) to our world. The rest of the story was erased or forbidden to speak, I discovered its because that many people who enters this place by accident confronted the cult and stopped their plans in more than one ocassion. Which is the reason I was in this pleace if the true was told Silent Hill would be ruined by periodists or law enforcements trying to seek for the true and when they found it.. Well only if that happened.\" <br>\r\nJenny says\"So your telling me that this place is in some kind of hell? It's kind of crazy\"<br>\r\n\"Well after what we saw it's not false at all. Then how do you explain all the wierd thinks that we see\"You said, after this Jenny couldn't help but feel nervous about they are in hell sorrounded by monsters.<br>\r\nYou began to read the last message\"Second even without the cult out of this, Silent Hill appears to attract people who had or still having issues or sins without solve, the town makes them to confront them in person and won't let them go until they \"solved\" without doubt. But I must warn you I see this kind of people in my journey here and many of them ended up going nuts and start killing everyone on their way. I would say without doubt you need to be strong not only physical but mentally to succed in this place. Third and last thing before I get to sleep, even with guns I recommend you to save ammo, and don't trust anyone who talks or dress like a religious persons they problaby are from the cult, and the monster represents things about someone around, most of the time it's about yourself or the persons who you are confronting, I would let my notepad by my side with the monsters and persons I encountered, I only want you to take my notes and expose my descovery to the world, this are my final words, Wade Falls out.\"<br>\r\nAfter finish this you see the dead body of the journalist it appears that his dead was recently like a few days ago. Jenny starts to cry on your shoulder you just hug her before take the notepad of Wade Falls, you see a list of creatures that both of you didn't know nor you have encountered thanks to Wade it also has pictues of them.<br>\r\nAlso appears to be a list of people in the note who Wade classified as \"Physco\" meaning this persons are danger that they should avoid. Wade left a map of the town with him with the places that he already visit apparently there are only a route available and it was crossing a bulding.<br>\r\nWith this new information you reassured to Jennt that they will make it if they stick together and consult frequently the notes of the journalist this seems to make feel better Jenny since she was now in a better mood than before.<br>\r\nJenny found the weapons of Wade before nothing and she founds a pistol and a knive with him. You let Jenny decide to choose her weapon she inmeadiatly took the knife and you take the pistol apparently it was charged with 8 bullets.<br>\r\nJenny only chuckled and said\"I think the guns are more for you I don't know it makes me feel safe when a man has a gun with himself\" you could help but laugh about her last comment knowing it was for making you feel better.<br>\r\nYou and Jenny finally decided to go to the misterious building that Wade marks as the only route to the other part of the town.<br>\r\nWhen the two you enter to the building you discovered that everything was in darkness like the light never touched this place. <br>\r\n\"What are we gonna do?\" Jenny asked.<br>\r\nThen you decide to search for flaslights in the entrance to go through the building you found a pair in the reception desk. After this you decided to explore the 1st floor, after a few doors blocked you found a room with many dresses and man clothes. Some didn't called your attention neither Jenny they all seem too fancy or too old fashioned but both of you put your eyes in a green jacket whit a hoodie, a blue shirt with blue pants and a yellow shirt and a short blue skirt.<br>\r\nBoth of you see themselsves and then look at the note put in the clothes that says \"Take it these are for someone who can appreciate more than I do. Sicerely Alice Merryweather.\"<br>\r\n\"Wait Alice?\" Jenny said.<br>\r\n\"You knew her?\" you asked<br>\r\n\"Sort of. She was like the richest girl cliche around the town. But she went missing after her parents decides to leave her here without money or resources to sutent herself, many of us believe that she abandon Silent Hill.\"<br>\r\n \"How long she went missing?\" you asked in worry.<br>\r\n\"About 3 days ago.Wait maybe she is here we should find her before something happens to her.\" Jenny finally said.<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but worry that she may found the same fate as Wade, but Jenny has a point maybe she was alive they should...</span></div></div>",

Maybe because the animal it wasn't a person so the town didn't recognize it as a objective, but yet all of you can see what could that mean?<br>\r\nSo you know you can do this in any order since you have a lot of time in the world, but the order may mean different situations.<br>\r\nSo after thinking many times you decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Urged on by the whispering static crackle of the radio, Aaron volunteers to scout nearby for a boat ride out of the bushes you were hiding in. He was gone two minutes before returning breathless and excited.<br>\r\n\"Found one! Pretty dirty, but we've dealt with more horrid things.\" Aaron announced with a hint of triumph. \"It's this way.\" He waved in the direction he came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the static grew louder as they approached the boat, half dragged onto the sand-crested lake shore. The three of you approach cautiously, weapons at the ready, with images of the nurses and the blob still fresh in memory. Just a few feet away from the decrepit but messianic boat, the static on the radio seemed to be forming audible words. Jenny was the first to notice, and with a halting motion of her hand and a tilt of her head told both you and Aaron to listen more closely. You did, and what you heard sent chills down your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Hel... Heeeelppp.... Sss-ssaaave...\" The words were clear between bursts of static. Your mind raced to rationalize how most electronic voice phenomena were mere random sounds interpreted to be more by over-enthusiastic paranormal whackos. But this was no EVP. This was hair-raising and genuine. The three of you listened to a few more weak pleas of help and deliverance before the static reigned unchallenged again. But another sound replaced the words. The sound of something wet half-shuffling, half-dragging on the sand. You saw it first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmerging from the water as its trail indicated, the creature was now close enough to reach out with a deformed hand and cling onto the other end of the boat. You manage a muffled sound of alarm that caught Aaron and Jenny's attention. Jolted from their thoughts regarding the earlier pleas, they were just as shocked to see the creature, draped in what seemed to be a brown, tattered cloak wet with lake water, was just a few feet away. Aaron moved forward protectively, while Jenny raised her gun to bear, minding the few bullets left in it.<br>\r\n\"Holy shit! What is <i>that</i>?\" Aaron exclaimed as he cautiously placed himself between the creature and you and Jenny.<br>\r\n\"Okay.... Okay..... Ahm, guys, what do we do??\" Jenny was frantic for a course of action that would spare their lives and save bullets in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature stood like a man would, slightly hunched, and the cloak, though ragged, hid most of its probably grotesque features, as the three surmise from seeing part of its hidden face. One eye socket was missing the eyeball, and the gaping hole was large enough to allow sufficient light to reflect the slimy surface of whatever is inside its head. The other eye was yellowish with wisps of white, and completely unfocused. The nose was virtually gone, decayed or eaten away, and the nasal cavity could easily be seen. The mouth was slightly open in what would amount to an agonizing grimace, showing blackened, putrid, crooked teeth in gaps, held by decaying gums bleeding pus. The lips were almost green, as was the rest of the creature's complexion as can be seen through the tears on its cloak. The hand gripping the other end of the boat was lacking all five fingernails, and a couple of fingers were twisted to an obscene angle. The figure seemed to be breathing, as the sounds of labored breathing and a husky voice were heard in time with the up and down movement of its lurched back. Though the creature had no tongue, the words that came from it turned the trio's blood cold:<br>\r\n\"...H-hhe...heeeelp.....meeeee...\"<br>\r\nA split second after each sound from the creature, the radio static gave way to similar sounds, which made the ghoulish plea all the more unnerving. The creature was pleading for them to save it, and its pleas echoed through the radio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I don't really know what happened. I woke up a couple mornings ago and everyone was gone. The whole town has changed. I tried to get out, but all the roads out of town are blocked. I don't know what to do. There are strange creatures everywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I?\" You ask as you try to sit, however, a terrible headache strikes you and you grab your head. Maybe it's best to just lay down for a while. \"This place is called Silent Hill. And believe me, it's silent allready. The only sound you will hear will be the creatures outside or the wind and rain.\" Your still a bit confused. How did you get here? And what are those creatures she talks about? Maybe it's better to ask before you one of them... \"What are those creatures you are talking about?\", you ask. Jenny gives you a concerned look. \"I don't know, hon. I lived on my own in this damned place for at least half a year now but I can't figure it out. You only see them at night and only their shadows or their eyes. They never actually ventured into the village at day, but at night, you want to keep your doors closed. One time, on a rainy night, I forgot to bring in the laundry and I went outside. Only 2 steps after i left the diner, I felt eyes poking in my backside. I turned and saw two pair of sparkling red eyes in the distance close to that building over there.\" She points to a building about 40 metres away from the diner. The place seems very ghastly indeed, but maybe it won't be that bad in daylight. The night changes many things. Still, an uncomfortable feeling grabs you and won't let go. \"Are you sure it were eyes?\", you stammer. \"I mean, red sparkling eyes, that's just not possible, i think you saw something else.\" Jenny laughed at you. \"You think my eyes are that bad? I can reconize eyes when they look at me! And they moved too! After I saw them, they disappeared behind the building. But they came back I tell ya. Only 2 weeks later, I saw a pair of those eyes through the window! Whatever it was, it was closer than 10 metres away from me! And it was very big and had four legs. It howled at me! It was only a short moment, but I allmost wet myself when I saw them, I swear to god! That was 1 week ago. But since then, i've been carrying that old shotgun. Seriously, if I can get out of here, I won't waste the opportunity.\" You watch the old shotgun that lies down at the table and then you watch out of the window in disbelief. Is she making all of this up or is it true. She must be mad or something, cause you know very well, \"monsters don't exist\". You are about to turn away from the window when you see them. A pair of sparkling red eyes, coming from the building where Jenny saw them the first time! Apart from the eyes, you see a big shadow in the darkness and you can make up four legs out of it. It's much bigger than a wolf, or most other fourlegged creatures you know that look like a wolf. Just when you are about to scream, you see the glance of the eyes fade away and the shadow dissapear behind the building. \"What the hell was that!\", is the only thing you can get out of your mouth. </span></div></div>",

I fear it has something to do with the curse that is placed upon this village.\" You really start to get a white face now. \"C-curse?\" You don't have a reputation for being a coward or anything, but this is just TO freakin weird. Somehow you still expect to wake up or something like that. \"Yes, it's a long story and I don't want to scare you anymore than you allready are. At least, it's not something you talk about at night in this eerie place.\" Jenny looks concerned and checks the door just to be sure. Her time would be better spend if she would have checked the roof. It started to rain and the roof is leaking at several spots. The bed you were just lying on gets wet on the feet end.

After a few moments you decide to open it. \"It's just a suitcase, I mean cm'on.\", You think. And you also can't remember how you got here and you only know what is inside if you check it out. It's a very big and suitcase with two silver locks on it. A golden coloured Christian cross on the sides but has a dark pentagram on the back side and the front. You open the suitcase, carefully and take a look inside. Jenny is starting to get curious watches over your shoulder. You first see some basic stuff you put in those suitcases like you went on a businesstrip. Some old cloths of yours, your toothbrush and two towels are the first things you find. Suddenly you feel something hard beneath one of the towels. It feels hard and cold and you quickly try to grab it for examination. You look puzzled when you suddenly draw an old but expensive looking copper cross out of the suitcase. \"Wow, how did you get that?\" Jenny certainly didn't expect that from you. You wonder what else would be in the suitcase. At least you never knew you had something like that. Curious what else will be in, you start to dig again. You find a gun! It's polished, not very heavy but most importantly, it's empty. You were so shocked that you dropped the gun on the carpet. You never had a gun as far as you knew! In fact, you hate guns and all sorts of violence. Seeing the expressions on your face, Jenny starts to feel uncomfortable too. \"Are you sure this is your suitcase?\" \"Ye-yes, i'm sure, look, those old cloths are mine, so is this toothbrush, but I don't know about the rest...\" \"Well, I know for sure the suitcase wasn't here before you arrived, suddenly...\" You regain yourself and you check if you at least can find any ammo for the gun. Maybe you need it with those freak things outside. Those red sparkling eyes really freeze you to the bone if you think about them. Once again, you search through the suitcase but you can't find any ammo. You do find, however, a necklace of garlic, a wooden stalk with a very sharp point and a dagger with a dark creature with wings on it. Both of you don't know what to say but you both sure feel uncomfortable...</span></div></div>",

It's allmost dawn, but the sky is still black and far, far away you can hear the howling of wolfs or maybe something bigger and deadlier. \"I don't know. The first thing I remember is that I woke up here in the diner.\" Jenny looks at you like she doesn't believe you. And it actually does make sense that she doesn't believe you, you think. \"And you expect ME to believe that? Just think about it. I live here, 5 months on my own after the rest of the village dissapeared into nothingness and 2 weeks after those...Things... Show up, you appear out of nothing with an even stranger suitcase which you don't reconize..\" Jenny suddenly grabs her shotgun and points it at you! \"How should I know YOU are not 1 of THEM huh?\" You didn't expect that and you walk frightently backwards. \"Hey, hey, I'm as much in dark about this as you!\" \"Yeah right, in the dark huh, well, prove me your not a monster, coming to finish the job.\" With that, she points the shotgun to your nose. Unbelievably frightened, you can get \"Well if i WAS a monster, then wouldn't I have killed you allready?\" out. To your relief, she lowers the shotgun, but she still isn't sure. You don't only see doubt in those beautiful eyes of hers, but also fear. You found enough courage to speak again. \"Come on now, if we want something, we can better do it together instead of threatening or killing eachother off.\" \"Yes, yes your probably right.\" She sighs relieved and puts the shotgun back on the table. \"I'm sorry I scared you, this must be hard for you too, IF what you say is true.\" \"It is, it is.\" You say before she suspects you of something vile again. \"It's ok, it must be hard for you too, living here all on your own in fear.\" She vaguely smiles at you. \"Thanks for forgiving me, living on your own under those conditions is hard indeed. Friends?\" You agree. \"Friends. Jenny sighs relieved again and walks to the window for 1 last check. \"I have a few spare blankets, you can make those your bed. I think it would be best to get some shuteye first, before we do anything else again.\" Suddenly you feel very tired and feel the urge to lie down again. \"Good idea, maybe we can find out tomorrow what that thing was.\" \"Don't count on it, the rain, probably washed any signs away and I couldn't find any clue the last 2 times. But let's sleep first, I don't think those things will come back today, it's past 5 allready. Tomorrow I will also tell you about the curse.\" You watch the black sky while rain keeps pouring down. \"If there will ever be a dawn again at least.\" You turn around, but you see that Jenny allready fell asleep. You follow her example, but allthough you are tired, it will take you at least 30 minutes to get to sleep. The last thing you can remember is that you hear the howling of the wolves, before you lose consciousness...</span></div></div>",

Suddenly realising what it could be, you wake up! Still half asleep you examine your surroundings, but your eyes feel drawn to the window on the northside where you saw that thing the first time. Suddenly, you see a very big hairy paw with long nails scratching against the window! You wrap yourself tightly in blanket and you start to feel really frightened. What will happen if the glass breaks? Will something with very big claws and red shiny eyes storm in and kill you two painfully? You quickly look at Jenny, but she's fast asleep, oblivious for all that is happening. You stare again at the window, but the big claw is gone! Still you know you aren't making things up, since you can still make out the scratches, the beast left on the glass. A few deep carvings with sometimes a red liquid is left on northern window, probably blood! But at least the claw is gone. Then it happens! A pair of Shiny red ruby eyes gaze through the window and look straight at you! You feel like a living statue, unable to move while fear has mastered you. You can read pure evil in those eyes and the desire to kill you. Behind the eyes you can make out a very big shadow, a black hole in the darkness. It's probably just too dark to be precise, but the only thing you can make out of it, is part of the face. Whatever it is, it has a long snout, it's hairy, has pointy ears, but that's only part of the face you can see. The rest is a super massive black hole and will remain unknown for the time. The time might not be too far off to see the beast from a closer angle you fear. You can finally take your eyes of the beast and you look to Jenny. Surely she must be awake after that terrible howl. To your surprise, she is still sleeping! Your totally on your own now. The red eyes still look at you and you feel like walking to the door, open it and to go outside. You are shocked after you learned of this new and surely deadly desire. The beast is hypnotising you! You must fight it, or your life is forfeit! You close your eyes and slowly turn away and grabbing the nearest object in the proces. Is it still there? Yes, the evil eyes are still there, but something has changed. The evil aura and desire to kill is still there, but something new can be read in the eyes. Doubt. Suddenly, the thing's eyes extinguishe and leave the scene. The claw makes 1 more bloody scratch on the window, and then it dissappeared like it came. Still unbelievably frightened, you force yourself to stay awake. IT might come back anytime and it's still not looking like it's gonna be day soon! However, sleep is taking you over and with the easing sound of the falling rain, you finally drift asleep again...</span></div></div>",

The rain probably washed the blood away, but the scratches are definitly still there! With your left hand you point at the the window and tell everything what happened to you in detail. Jenny got a terrified look on her face after you are finished. \"That's unbelievable, I'm glad we are still ok.\" She stares in disbelieve at the window, the evidence of what took place at the end of the previous night. She turns to you again. \"Why do you think it went away again? And you said you felt doubt in it's eyes at the end? Why?\" You ask that yourself but you can't find a logical answer. \"I don't know..\" you stammer. \"After I noticed it tried to brainwash me or something, I allmost knew for sure we were gonna die, but...\" Suddenly you become aware that you are still holding something in your right hand... It feels warm but hard and you suddenly realised you grabbed the old cross in your big moment of panic and despair. Surprised and puzzled, you show Jenny the old cross and tell her what you just thought. Would that thing be afraid, just for a simple cross? that would be allmost unthinkable.

As sunlight meets your face, you can't help but smile. Waking up on a nice day, allways is a good start for you. It's actually hard to believe that there really is something out there, trying to kill them. The rain however left it's traces. The ground was covered in mud. The only thing that has concrete in this little town was the 1 way that seems to lead out of the village. You see the building where you saw the monster the first time. It was actually just an abandoned old bar. Wind and rain ruined it further. There's a small row of other wooden houses next to it, all in a ragged shape. Next to you there's the postoffice and the store. While the one end of the road leads to the exit of the village, the other end leads to an old church. It's rather big for such a small community. It's bell tower reflects the sunlight and shines proudly on the horizon. Again you are surprised that such a peacefull scenery looks so different at night. Behind the buildings you can see a sea of trees and behind the trees, mountains with high white peaks rise up on the horizon. It allmost looks like they form a ring around the forest and the village. You can also see a big roof with a big chimney rise above the forest. Somewhere out there are things trying to kill you, waiting for dark and a new opportunity. \"Where is that road leading to? You said that there was no way out of this village.\" Jenny looks surprised at you. \"If I COULD get out, I would have done that. Unfortunatly, it's not possible anymore. About a year ago, an earthquake caused the mountainpass to collapse and it's blocked by debris and big rocks now. Finding a new path over the mountains could maybe take a week! You expect me try and sleep outside with those things on my tail?\" You turn away again and look through the window. Hope leaves you for a moment and you felt that maybe you will never leave this village alive. You are curious about that other thing in the woods though. If that's a house, there might be other people. Maybe they no something usefull. It seems that Jenny guessed what you were thinking and shook her head. \"That's the old mansion in the forest. Some noble used to live there, but it's empty now, just like the rest of the village. \"Can you tell me about the curse now?\" You suddenly feel the urge to talk about it again.\" Jenny puts on her furcoat and a pair of boots. \"Come on then.\" You look puzzled, but follow her example. \"What are we going to do?\" \"We need to go to the big church over there, I left the book of curse there. There's a small library in the church and that's where I found it the first time. It saves me time to explain if we can get our hands on that book.\" She grabs her shotgun of the table and opens the 3 locks on the door. \"I rather take this babe with me now those monsters appear more often.\" You again, follow her example and take the dagger with the strange creature on it. You wonder what it is, but it's a no use pondering about it now. \"You can also bring the gun with you. I'm sure the store has some bullets left for you, now come on, or do you want to wait till it get's dark?\" You hurry up and take both weapons. After you both left and locked the door of the diner, you 2 make your way to the church.</span></div></div>",

It doesn't look very bad, but something in your mind tells you not to enter! Jenny is allready in the doorway and tells you to follow. As she opens the big wooden doors, you follow with a growing unease. You go through the big door and you can see the inside of the church for the first time. Rays of light enter the church in many colours through the coloured stained glass windows on the side. Inside are dark wooden banks and seats. This is the first time that things look well maintenanced in Silent Hill. The floor is clean and you can see the original patterns that are carved in the stone floor. In the front, there is a big altar, standing on a round red carpet which the picture of a golden cross in it. However, the cross in captured in a big black pentagram which is very unusual for a church ofcourse. There's a big organ behind it and it's pipes reach the high ceiling which should be at least 20 metres from the ground. The paintings are in a good state and most of them show the baby Christ. On closer examination, some of the pictures are damaged by a knife or something sharp. On 1 there is a red stain but that's not the most strange you see. In 1 of the pictures, you can see a baby from which shines light it seems, but it put in big pot with boiling water. There's a witchlike lady next to it, with seven hungry demons on the background. Feeling at unease again, you turn away from the paintings on the wall and you start searching for Jenny. Where is she? Then you notice that 1 of the side doors are open. There are 2 side doors next to the organ, one on the right and one on left. Both are from wood, but they both carry big and strong looking locks. 1 Door is open and you hear Jenny's voice coming out of the room. \"I found it!\" She comes walking out of the door, with a big and heavy book in her hands. It's dark red coloured and looks very old. There's a big black pentagram on the front, just like the one you saw on the carpet. </span></div></div>",

It made from copper, the end looks like a fang and it has a dark creature with wings on the front and a pentagram on the back. To your shock, you remember that you've seen that creature before. You quickly grab the dagger and compare the 2 creatures. They are a perfect match and in your surprise, you drop the dagger. There's a loud clinging when metal meets stone and Jenny jumps up in surprise when the silence is suddenly broken. \"Watch it! You scared me nuts!\" \"Sorry, but look at this.\" You show her the key and the dagger and she looks puzzled. \"What's the meaning of this?\" \"I don't know, but it can't be anything good.\" With that, you put they key in your pocket for now and try to start reading. Most of the pages are too dirty to read, but on page 666, all the text is suddenly readable. The style of the text is different too. All the other pages were written quickly and not very neat. This page however has carefull handwriting, the capital letters are marked with something red and you can make out loops in the letters. Seems like the page started a new Chapter too. You look at Jenny with a hesitant gaze, but she encourages you to read it. You start reading at the top of the page with a heavy heart. </span></div></div>",

Come with me.\" She walks into the room where she just came from. You walk into a dark and dusty room with only 1 small window, high on the back wall. There's another carpet on the floor, smaller though than in the main chamber of the church, but with the same design. She shows you another book, but there's a lock on the book this time. In a reflex, you grab the key, but it doesn't fit. \"Useless dear, I tried that the first time I saw the books. But what seems strange to you?\" You watch the two books and start to compare them. \"!!!\" You suddenly got it. The book that you just had read, said \"Book of Curse I\" and the other book said \"Book of Curse III\". \"Where is part II? How many books are there?\" \"I don't know how many parts there are, but I DO know that we are missing at least 1 part and a key. Maybe the key we need is in book II.\" You are still trying to find out what you need the key for. \"Maybe we need this key for book II?\" \"Possible, but there's something else that I want to show you.\" On the darkest corner of the small library, there's a stone statue in the form of an imp. It has a dagger in it's throat and his face expresses the agony it must have been undergoing. In the mouth however, there's a hole.\" Jenny suddenly takes they key out of your pocket and put's it in the imp's mouth. It fits!! But... Nothing happened. You thought you heard something click, but very faintly and not coming from the wall you are facing, but somewhere else in the room. \"I checked the keyhole some time ago and the meaning IS that you turn the key, but you can't turn it anyway. We probably need another key for it, but it should be one like this one.\" You start to think. That is a lot of new information coming your way and a lot of new riddles to solve. \"How about the other room?\" you ask. You start to get curious about that one. Jenny however can't tell you anything usefull about it. \"I've never been there, the door is locked and the big lock on the door is very strong.  It's possible that we can use this key over there, but it's impossible to enter that room without the key.\" You both look around. You suddenly became aware of a change in your surroundings. It's a change in the room, but caused by elements outside. The light that shines through the small window is getting weaker and weaker. Clouds are gathering from the east and it seems mist is also rolling in from the north. You touch Jenny on the shoulder, who is still thinking about the possibilties. You two have more pressing things to take care of however. \"Jenny, I think we need to hurry back, it's getting dark again!\" It seemed like Jenny suddenly awoke from her dreamworld and realised you were right. \"O god, we've allready spend too much time here! Let's get back quickly before it's dark. The mist can't be a good sign either. We don't want to be out here if those beasts appear again!\" Both of you quickly turn around and walk out of the church. You suddenly remember something. \"Can we pay the store a quick visit? I want something more than an empty gun and a small dagger to defend myself with.\" \"Sure, but we need to hurry. Being outside is not recommendable after the sun has gone down. As you walk out, you see the sun dissappear behind the mountains and the clouds packing together again. </span></div></div>",

You finally make it to the general store and you open the door. It smells terrible in here. Many products started to rot and the odor is overwhelming. Jenny closes the door behind you and tells you to hurry. She's keeps standing close to the door, peeking in the coming darkness while readying her shotgun, in the hope NOT to see any red sparkling eyes. So far, the coast is clear, but there no need to push your luck. \"Hurry up! They have patrons at the back of the store.\" As you get there, you have no idea which ones to take! As you start doubting which ones to take, panic slips into you. Putting the wrong bullets in the gun might be fatal! Which ones will you take?! \"What's the hold up allready?\" Seems like Jenny grows impatient and ofcourse, she too must feel uncomfortable. These doors don't have locks anymore and some windows are broken. If those monstrosites come over here, they will surely be able to enter the store. \"I-I don't know which ones to take!\" \"Just take as many as you can, we'll figure out which ones to use later, but please, hurry up!\" Panic can be heard in her voice. You quickly grab as many patrons you can and stuff your pockets with them. You run back to Jenny and make an excuse to Jenny. Outside, the rain has started to fall and the last of the daylight has disappeared. \"Let's go.\" Jenny opened the door and took a last look. Just as you were about to leave you heard howling. The same howling as yesterday and it sounds awfully close. Still, no red eyes visible, so maybe they are just wandering around the forest. Both of you however, make a run to the diner. Another howl, this time even closer! Both of you start to panic and look at the direction where it came from. Still nothing visible except for more fog, but it's coming your way, no doubt! Only a few more meters. She tosses you the key of the diner and turns around, aiming her shotgun at fog till now. The key is a bit rusted, so you can't get the door open right away. \"Hurry up!!!\" \"I'm busy!!!\" Both of you are panicking now. Another howl and this time, a faint red glow is visible through the fog. The eyes are on the same height as Jenny's and she starts to scream. You finally get the door open and you yell Jenny to come inside. Instead, she fires at the forthcoming eyes with the shotgun. A heavy growl and for a second the eyes dim a little. However, after the that, the eyes shine even brighter than before and the creature starts to dash forward. It seems like Jenny is paralised or something cause she's nailed to the ground. You quickly pull her inside by her wrist and close the door. Jenny recovered quickly and helps you to put the locks on the door. Just when you put the last lock on the door, something very heavy crashes into the door! It's just a wooden door and for a moment, you fear that the door might break by the attack. Fortunatly, the door holds allthough all of the metal locks made a clear clinging sound. Next to you, Jenny starts to panic again. \"O my god, it's gonna ram the door open!\" You however, grab the copper cross and load your gun. But for now, it seems it wasn't necessary. One more heartrending howl and then...Nothing... You finally find the courage to peek through the window, but there's nothing to see anymore. The fog is gone by now, but the rain started to pour again...</span></div></div>",

She's very cute actually, but you have more pressing subjects on your mind. You are just about to ask what that book has to do with those things outside as you suddenly get it, which causes a big shock in your mind! \"Are-are those things those demons that mother was talking about?\" Jenny sighs and makes a tired impression. \"I believe so, but that still doesn't tell us, how to get rid of it. At least I don't know for sure.. At least things would make a little more sense now.\" Your face grows pale, this might be too much for you. \"Th-that means there are 7 of those freaks outside?\" \"Maybe, at least we know now those things are demons.\" A lot of things got cleared up now. \"And those demons were the 7 murdered children first before they got burned on a cross and taken over by demons? How do we defeat those?\" Jenny walked to the window and looked outside. \"i've been thinking about that too, but I think we need to read the other 2 books first before we can do anything useful at all.\" \"That would make sense indeed, but... Where are those 2 books? We know that book I and III are in the library, but where is book II?\" Then Jenny suddenly turned to you and said something you didn't expect. \"I have a hunch! I think I know where it is.\" This could be interesting. For a moment you forget the demons outside and you wonder how she would know. \"Where is the second book then?\" \"In the big mansion in the forest.\" You expected a lot, but not that. \"Why there?\" \"That's another story, but i'm sure it has to do with the curse.\" \"Can you tell me?\" \"I guess it can't hurt to tell you. After all, we're in the same shit together now. It's a long story, but it tells about the mother, her children and the noble of the mansion.\" As she starts her story, the rain outside gets even worse. Maybe that's an ill bode for the rest of the night... </span></div></div>",

She was 25 years old, she looked very beautiful and she gave birth to 7 children in total. She had a happy marriage, enough money to make a nice living and to travel which she allways loved to do. One day however, all of that was gonna change. Her husband was struck by a decease and no docter in the whole area could help him. A message came from another village over the mountainpass, saying that a witch escaped their clutches. A woman, fitting her description would have poisoned the mayor there and the mayor died after 7 days of agony and pain. Rumors spread quickly and soon enough, there was an angry mob in front of her house, calling her a witch. Her husband died in the meantime and his last words were \"Alison!!!\". The people of Silent Hill thought that was meant as an accusation and she and her children were arrested. After an unfair trial, all 8 of them were sentenced to death by a funeral pyre. However, the mother managed to escape and disappeared in the woods. The only thing she had on her mind was saving her children, but when she came back to the village, the last of her seven children was tossed into the fire while bound to a wooden cross. She heard \"Mommy!!!!\" and after, no more. She fled away from the village, doing nothing else than crying and crying and she passed out on the forest way. </i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> However, there was a noble living in a mansion. He build it there because he wanted to have no business with the rest of the population of Silent Hill. Barbarian savages, that's was his opinion of the people of Silent Hill. He lived there with his wife minding his own business. He had only 1 child, a boy of 7 years old. Until 1 day, when he found a young woman near the side of the road. Allthough he didn't like the people of Silent Hill, he was a good man and couldn't leave a helpless woman here to die. He took her with her and that turned out to be a very big mistake. After she came by, the only thing she did was crying, the first week. His wife demanded she left the house, she was disturbing the peace. The old noble however, couldn't help but to feel pity for her and refused to kick her out. She got her own room in the big mansion and was supposed to live in harmony with the rest of the family. However, the woman started to act more and more strange every day. She started to draw pentagrams and to mutter to herself. She gave herself scars and started to curse the people of Silent Hill. The people of Silent Hill didn't forget about the supposed witch and after a big part of their animals died, they resumed the chase and sooner or later, they arrived at the mansion. In the meanwhile, Alison started to worship the devil and started to write. Two of the results are \"the book of curse I and III\". It seems that the little son of the noble also died, struck by a black decease. The wife of the noble begged to kick her out of the house, but he simple couldn't. She was the \"only child he had left\".  While searching the mansion, Alison was found, arrested along with the rest of the family that still lived. The books were also found and brought to the church as proof. Both the noble and his wife got stoned to death and Alison was tossed into another funeral pyre. In her last moments, she spoke a curse over the the population of Silent Hill and then she was gone... Still, the story of Alison Jones became a local legend and it seems the curse found his effect... </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny finally stopped talking. There was a sudden silence in the room. Outside, lightning struck the earth, but in the diner, it was all quiet. \"So, that means that Alison wrote what i read this afternoon and that she placed this curse upon Silent Hill and the world.\" \"It seems that way indeed. But that also means that the second book can be at the mansion.\" You look uncertain, cause you don't know for sure. And it still means you have to make a dangerous journey to the mansion, just for a book actually. \"Are you sure it's there?\" Jenny stood up and looked at you. \"Nope, I don't know for sure, but I looked everywhere I could in the village. The most logical place would be the mansion and we NEED that second book!\" You sigh and stand up too. \"I guess you are right.\" You wanted to prepare for bed. You probably need some rest if you two are going to the mansion tomorrow. However, outside the monotonous sound of rain is no longer only disturbed by the sound of thunder. Many howls are in the air and they are close! About as close when you fled back here from the store. You both run to the window on the northside and to your dismay, you see many pairs of red ruby eyes light the darkness!! Another howl and another. It seems the demons aren't waiting for tomorrow...</span></div></div>",

It's enough however to light the head of the demon that ventured to the window and you can finally see what has been hunting you two. Apart from the long snout, hairy face and red sparkling eyes, you can see it's mouth for the first time. Big fangs, several rows of teeth like a shark and blood red tongue. The rest of it, is still darker than the night itself. The eyes peer inside and they are staring at you again. This time, your can master your instincts and point your gun at the window. You hold the cross in your left hand and the gun in the right hand and you feel confident somehow. It's just like the last time! Doubt can be read in the eyes of the monster again, but this time, they don't go away! They point their gaze at Jenny instead that doesn't have a proper answer. She starts trembling all over but can't bring out a word. She does reawake though when you take aim at the head. \"Stop!!!\" She's too late however and you allready pulled the trigger. *click* Nothing! \"Are you out of your mind, even my shotgun didn't stop it, you think a single bullet will take it down? You will only break the glass and allow them in!!\" \"You are right, i'm sorry.\" you answer. You were right in the store after all. The \"wrong bullet\" could have been fatal after all! Good you picked wrong one, otherwise you would have at least 3 demons sharing the same room with you and Jenny. The closed demon howls at you two but doesn't seem to attack..yet. You were at least partly right! The cross makes them doubt, which is good to know. Still, you don't want to be outside with only holding a cross and a good as empty gun. Suddenly, the rain stops falling from the sky and the moon becomes visible. The three demons you can see growl, but are leaving in a hurry. Whatever their plan was, it went wrong. Still, the night was still young and what if they come back again later? You can hear them howl again, they are probably still around. Now what? You can't go outside, you don't know how to defeat them and you probably can't fight off determined attack. That wooden door allready got a nasty beating after one dash. Suddenly you realised your only option. You two need to leave this diner if you want to survive! As soon as possible, but where to? All the buildings here are in a poor state and made of wood. Maybe this would be the most relative safe place to be for now. Except for the church, which is made of stone. There's only one way in, but maybe they found a way to get in or something. It is a church with pentagrams and all and where you found the books of curse. You will think twice before fleeing there. And besides, if those demons are close, they will certainly see us! And the distance is too big to risk a run for the church. You have to hold out till tomorrow and then make your journey to the mansion. The village of Silent Hill can't protect you 2 anymore. You take a look around and watch the diner one more time. Enough furniture and the floor is made of strong looking wood. \"Jenny! Let's grab the furniture and barricade the door and windows as best as we can.\"  She seemed surprised but she starts doing it. \"What are you planning and on what do you plan to sit on from now on?\" It might sound like you grabbed command, but you are sure this is the only way to survive. \"My plan is that we defend ourselves as good as possible till it get's light and then we move to the mansion in the forest.\" \"But, but.\" \"I know, I know, it doesn't sound perfect and it's still risky, but this place is not safe enough anylonger. Let's be gratefull if we see dawn again.\" You grimmly start working on the barricade. No way in hell you will end up on some Altar of Sacrifice... </span></div></div>",

You allmost used everything you could find in the diner, even your black suitcase after you got everything out. You two moved the bed in front of the door, the big closet of Jenny against the room and everything else behind it. There is only a small stroke of window you can look through, but it's enough. You made sure you had the right kind of ammo in your gun by testing it on the floor. Not that it matters, firepower won't save the day, or actually night, this time. You both also prepared a backpack for tomorrow so you two can start your journey to the mansion early. Jenny told you that the road at least takes you 6 hours walking. And maybe you two are forced to take a detour and you want to make sure you arrived before dark. Armed with the necklace of garlic (hey, you never know when it will come in handy), the strange dagger, the gun and the cross, you prepared yourself as best as you can. Next to you, Jenny found a knife she used to cut meat with. She also assembled all of her shotgun ammo and tries not to look scared. Outside, no sound was heard yet, it only started to drizzle a bit. You walk over to Jenny. She seems exhausted but also scared. \"Hey Jenny.\" You gently put an arm around her shoulder. It doesn't seem she minds, instead, she looks at you tenderly. \"Why don't you get some sleep, you look like you can fall over any minute.\" \"Thanks.\" She says. \"I hate to admit it, but I really can use some sleep right now. But only if you promise me to wake me up in an hour. Then YOU need some sleep mister.\" You laugh at eachother. \"You know, whatever happens tonight, you were a good friend.\" \"So are you Jenny, now get some sleep. Whatever will happen, you will need it.\" After an hour and 15 minutes, you wake her up and tell her to wake you up after an hour or if she even suspects there's something near. You look at your watch. It's 2.03 now. The floor is hard, but eventually you fall asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you wake up again, it's 5.25!!! As you look around you in panic, you see Jenny sleeping next to you to your relief. You gently wake her up. When you wake her, she suddenly jumps up and realised the danger they escaped! \"I'm so sorry, I-I just could keep my eyes open and...\" You try to comfort her, these are rough times for a girl like her too. \"It's ok Jenny, at least we both got some sleep and it we still live. Let's just see it as a warning for next time.\" She sighs and thanks you again. Outside it started to rain harder again. This got you on your toes again, since that means that the chance those demons come back have seriously increased. You have a feeling, it's not over yet for tonight...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jenny suddenly wakes you up and not a minute to early. You can allready hear the howling near the diner and you prepare to defend yourself. One last check on your watch. 7.27! And it won't be day for at least another hour! The clouds make the sky even darker than it allready was and meanwhile, the ground has been turned to a mudpile again. You walk up to the barricade of the window and take a quick look outside. You see 3 pair of red shiny ruby eyes this time, but maybe there are more of them. This time, their eyes shine even brighter than usual. It seems like the demons are planning to end it today! You quickly check the barricade one last time and then you prepare for battle. A fell heartrending howl is heard and it seems like the sign to attack. A few seconds later, you hear a loud crash on the wooden door, but it has been reinforced this time. Strengthend by the bed and some other furniture, the door holds. No need to use the weapons till now. You carefully walk to the window, only to see 2 of the shadows, both focussed on the door. Suddenly you smell an awful sulfur odor. You turn around a bit, only to look into the eyes of the 3th demon and suddenly it tries to snap at you! You quickly pull away in a reflex and your butt hits the ground. You can still see the eyes through the window and then they disappear for a moment. You stand up and at the same time, there's a crashing sound heard. The 3th demon tries to force it's way through the window this time. The glass with the carvings shatters, but the barricade holds. Another loud crash can be heard, but the door holds again. Your plan worked till now! If one of them get's in, it's game over for you two and you know it! another howl. There's a lot of anger in it this time and grab your gun and some reserve ammo. The window is broken anyway, so you can at least fire back. Sometimes you or Jenny fires a shot at one of the forthstorming demons and each time, the barricades hold them off or they pauze their bash when they get hit. Still, no sign of serious injury is shown and it doesn't look like they get tired or give up. This time, they are determined to finish you 2 off for good! Suddenly you get suspicious of something. They only need 2, 1 for the door and 1 for the window. What is that 3th beast doing? You take a step backward when a drop of water hits you from the ceiling. Apparantly, you just moved under a leak spot. Suddenly you point your gun at the roof. Ofcourse! If they can't force their way in by breaking the door or the window barricade, they try something else. The other walls are in reasonable state and the floor is made of a thick layer of wood, but the roof is as leak as a basket! You gesture Jenny to be quiet and point to the roof. Sometimes the silence is broken by a crash in the door or barricade but to no avail. Then you hear it. Paws on the roof! You don't hesitate and fire at the roof where you think it came from. After 2 shots, you hear a growl and a slipping sound and then a splash. It seemed you hit the demon and it fell of the roof. A raged howl can be heard but the attackers don't plan to quit yet! Jenny stands next to the barricade on and fires shotgun shell after shell. You watch the roof and if you hear something, you shoot in that direction till you hear another growl. There seems no stopping them, but wave after wave, the 2 defenders hold their ground. Suddenly the attacks stop and after one last raged, but tired howl, they attackers leave the scenery. You look outside and see that the rain has lessened too. Jenny sits down and wipes the sweat of her forehead. \"I really thought we would die tonight.\" \"Not yet, but at least i'm not planning to stay here any longer than necessary. At daybreak, we must leave immediatly. You both check the barricades. Allthough they both lasted, it looked like they both couldn't take much more. It will be make or break time tomorrow...</span></div></div>",

Who knows when you get the opportunity to sleep again... You gently wake Jenny up and you grab your bag and your weapons. The ammo you took with you yesterday is gone. You check your gun, only 3 bullets left. Luck hasn't left you two yet. On the advice of Jenny, you pay the store another visit and this time, you know exactly what ammo to take. You both also take a flashlight with you and a few spare batteries and a pair of extra cloths. As you both stand outside again, the sun has risen on the east. The clouds are gone and the temperature has risen too. It feels really nice to be outside today, allthough the ground is still soaked. After a quick breakfast, you two get on your way. It's a few minutes past 10 when you reach the outskirts of the forest. You start to follow the road but Jenny suddenly stops. \"Wait, will it be safe to follow the road?\" You stop to think about that. You entirely forgot that last night! Maybe they won't attack you at light, but they can still follow you! There's plenty of dark places in the forest anyway. But you don't want to risk to go offroad too far. Maybe those demons dare to attack you in the darker parts of the forest and if you get lost and don't reach the mansion before dark, you two are screwed! After a short discussion, you 2 found an agreement. You will walk through the bushes and the forest, but keep the road in sight. As you two follow your way through the forest, nothing seems unusual. Jenny and you even dare to talk a bit and you 2 get to know eachother a little better. Suddenly you come across a crossing. The forestway resumes his way forward, but a mudpath crosses it. It seems the left path leads to the mountains but the path to the right deeper into the forest. It looks awfully dark down there and if you examine the ground quickly, you see massive clawprints in the mud! These clawprints must have been fresh, otherwise the rain would have washed it away. The only strange thing is, there are some way smaller prints next to it. It looks like footprints, but that seems impossible since Jenny was the only person living here for months. Still, this new discovery unsettles you and Jenny. Since you can't go back to Silent Hill, the only option is to press onward but quietly and more carefull than before. The forest seems more hostile too. The birds have stopped singing and the bugs have gone silent too. The only sound that can be heard in miles are your foots. You look at your watch. It's a bit past 1 and the sun shines high in the sky. If it was dark, you would probably have been dead by now. You both feel you need to hurry up a bit. It might get dark early today... </span></div></div>",

In the middle, stones are placed and together they form a circle. \"This is where we used to picknick sometimes. This place brings back a lot of memories.\" Jenny is about to walk enter the grass circle when you pull her back. Somehow, you don't trust it allthough it's still sunny. \"Wait, it's just too quiet around here...\" \"Ohh, nonsence, nothings gon..\" She interups her scentence as she sees fog rolling in from the other side of the field. It's slowly coming towards you but it's still only on the other side of the circle behind the trees. Ofcourse, you both don't trust this sudden fog and unease and fright come back at you. Now what?! Jenny suddenly pulls your arm and pulls you with her. \"Your lucky I played a lot of hide and seek around here.\" she whispers. She pulls you behind a collection of trees and bushes and starts looking for something. Apparantly, she found it. She dives into the bushes and whispers you to follow. In a big bush of burrs bushes, there's a hole in the ground you both fit in. After Jenny pulls some extra leaves over your head, you keep lying there quietly, hoping that the fog will just pass by. As you both dissappeared in the bushes, the fog reached this side of the circle and starts to close in on your position. Suddenly, a familiar howl can be heard as the outskirts of the fog reach your position. Fearing the worst, you make yourself even smaller and you don't dare to look. You fear that, if you open your eyes, that you look straight into the red eyes of a demon, ready to kill you. You can start to smell the odor of sulfur and you open your eyes, preparing for the worst. You can see one pair of red eyes, but still in the distance and not coming in your direction. It seems it sniffs a bit around the position you and Jenny were standing a minute ago. Then it's head rears up and looks to all directions. It seems not to know where you are. yet... Another howl can be heard from direction you came from. The village. It's far, far away, and you guess that came from 1, near the village. Suddenly, the demon rears up, howls and sprints like the wind towards the village. You 2 keep laying still while the fog passes by. After 15 minutes after the last of the fog passed by, you dare to stand up. Very, very quietly, you two resume your way to the mansion, hoping that's the last you would have seen of them...</span></div></div>",

It's a large estate with a metal fence around the courtyard. Except for the the big mansion, there's a smaller building next to it, but not connected directly to the mansion. You can also see a stone well and a few stone statues. You look to find a way to get over the fence. It's rather high and looks sturdy and has spikes on top. Not a bad point, since those demons can't climb it, but how do you get to the other side? You knew you should have brought a rope... Jenny calls your name, she found a way in maybe. There's a big hole in the fence where she is standing. It doesn't look like those demons did that since it's a perfect circle. But that doesn't mean they didn't use the gap in the fence. There are clawprints near the hole, the same you saw today in the forest! However, they point to the forest, not the mansion. Maybe that demon you saw a few hours ago came from the mansion. Let's just hope, he was alone... You must block this hole, or else the mansion will be just as save as staying outside. You and Jenny carry a big statue over and put it in front of the hole. After that you put a few other statues behind it, you two search for more holes. Fortunatly, that was the only one. You come across the well as you walk to the mansion and you peer into the depths. It seems that all the water dried up, but your still curious. You take your flashlight and point at the bottom. You see something suspicious and you put your bag down. \"I'm going down to check it out, stay here ok?\" Jenny nods as you use the rope of the well to lower yourself in. The well must be at least 20 metres deep! At the bottom, you find a kind of tunnel! You use your flashlight, but you can't see the end of it. Where it leads to will be a mystery for now. You climb back up and tell Jenny what you found. \"Strange to have a tunnel there, but let's try to find the book first. Then we need to prepare for night again... Behind you, the sun starts to lower into the west and the first sign of gathering clouds can be seen. No more howls were heard, but you allmost know for sure, those demons won't give up hunting you. </span></div></div>",

It allmost looked like you made a time travel to the year 1800. Right in front of you, a big staircase rises to the second floor and a thirth floor. There's a dusty red/purple carpet all over the floor and it looks expensive. There are several doors on each floor and you really wonder where to start looking. You look at Jenny, but she doesn't have a clue either. Still, you have to hurry up. The sooner you find that \"Book of Curse II\", the sooner you can prepare for the case those demons get here. \"Would it be wise to split up Jenny?\" \"I don't think so, we can easily get lost here and just maybe, there's one of those demons nearby. I rather stay together.\" With that, you sigh and randomly pick a door. It seems you found the kitchen. Big knifes with dried and very old blood on it can be found and there's a terrible smell. Everything rotted away here and you don't think you can find anything usefull here. Then there is the livingroom and then a hobbyroom. Nothing can be found there. You arrive at the last door of the first floor and open it. Outside, it's allready dark and you wonder how long it will stay peacefull. It's a relative small room and has a desk, a bed and some other furniture in it. Jenny examines the room quickly. \"I think this was the butler's his room or something like that.\" You are about to turn away if you can find a journal. You open it and start to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> 19-03-1621<br>\r\nMy master found a woman unconscious near the road. He just couldn't leave her to die and took her with him. I have a bad feeling about this. Many others allready told him that his soft heart was his weak spot, but on the other hand, it's what makes him the master and a loved one. I guess I will just trust the master that he made the right decision like allways. Not that i have a choice... [/i}<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> 21-03-1621<br>\r\nThe strange woman awoke and does nothing but crying since she's here. Not even the master can get something sane out of that woman. My mistress gave me the order to get her out of the house but my master got angry when he heard of that. After a fierce discussion, the master decided she could stay and that we should do everything in our power to help her. I still have a bad feeling about this and she allready disturbed the peace in the mansion. Still, i have no other choice then to obey. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> 30-03-1621<br>\r\nIt had gone from bad to worse! The strange woman started to do some dark rituals at her room and she draws pentagrams all over the place! The mistress begged my master to make her leave and even I, a servant in mind warned my loved master for this woman. Rumors are that the village of Silent Hill was hunting a witch. On top of that, the only son of my master got caught by a black decease. As a true servant of my master, I must protect him against this vile woman before it's too late. I got the support of the mistress and before long, I w...</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the text was torn apart.. You give the journal to Jenny and after she's done, she closes her eyes and nods her head. She wanted to put the journal down on the desk again, but threw something of glass of the desk in the proces! The glass shattered in many pieces while making a lot of noise.

You and Jenny run up the stairs and open the door. You can see three people in the room, one adult and two children. The adult is a woman around the 30 and the children must both be around the 10 years old. What are they doing here?! They are all weeping as the door opens, fearing for their lives apparantly. They can't believe their eyes when two humans step inside! They stare at you, with big eyes, when you and Jenny stap inside the room. You and Jenny on the other hand, are just as surprised as you are. You try to make contact. \"Hello, who are you?\" No answer.. Jenny wants to try too. \"I'm Jenny, we can help you!\" \"You also introduce yourself, but still, nothing.. You start to walk over there, when they all start to scream. \"Get away, get away demons!!!\" \"Whoa, whoa, relax, we're not demons!!\" The elderly woman takes a good look at you and finally stands up. \"Ohh, thank god, finally someone came!!\" The children stand up too and you all introduce yourself briefly. The elder woman is called Lisa and is 32 years old. The children are called Mark and Mary and they are brother and sister. Mark is 11 and Mary 9 years old. They explain to you that demons are coming here daily and that they were driven into this room with many more 5 months ago. Jenny reacted in shock. \"That's the time the whole population of Silent Hill disappeared!\" Lisa nods. \"7 Demon's disturbed our prayers in the church at that sunday and they killed at least 50 people! The people that survived, blacked out and woke up all in this room. Each day, they come and get 1 of us and we never see him of her back again! We can guess however that they are all dead by now...\" \"Why didn't you all try to escape?\" \"We did, we tried a few times, but each time, they caught us within a few hours and we blacked out again. Once we were back here, they killed a few of us, before our eyes as a warning and now, no one dares to escape.\" You look surprisedly. \"Jenny, how come you didn't get captured?\" \"This whole village was religious, except for me. I lost my mom and dad in a month and I refused to go church any longer. That's why they probably forgot about me till now.\" You look at Lisa again. \"Do you know why they kidnapped you?' \"I have no idea, but they took the whole population with them. All sixhundred and sixtysix of us..\" When she named the number of \"666\", you and Jenny allmost fainted. \"Th-that's why they attacked now..\" Jenny whispered.\" Lisa and the two children are looking at you confused. You realise that those 3 are the only people left... \"I think we must tell you what we have found in a book called \"Book of Curse I\". \"That sounds familiar!\" It was Mary, saying that. \"There's another book with the same title over there!\" She points at the desk in the big room and you suddenly became aware where you are. Pentagrams all over the place, blood on the carpet and carvings on the wall. This must be Alison's room! You walk over and you reconize the cover. The book of Curse II lies in front of you...</span></div></div>",

Though, I was a little curious as to what had happened; I wasn't about to waste time on a \"what-if\" game.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  I was staying with my original plan.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n  Cautiously, opening the door, peeking this way and that way; I slid out easily trying to keep the bells on the door quiet.

So I began blindly walking down the road.  That's when I heard thee most vicious vibration-causing roar that evolved into a piercing shriek and before me appeared a set of red accusing eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"We've been waiting for you. \"</span></div></div>",
