Naturally, Humans enter the contest, but there is also the fat furs, who are pretty good at scarfing down a lot food. And just who will rise above the rest and become top glutton? It's up to you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere's how this is gonna work. Unlike the others, this contest will be a 5-round, 16-constentant tournament kind of thing.  You can choose to be in the story as either a normal fur (newbies in the girth-growing bussiness), a fat fur (pretty profession stuffing themsleves), a macro fur, (able to cram tons of food in the gullet), or a human (They have been overeating a long time). You can also make the bouts be 1-on-1 or 2-on-2.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat species you and your opponent is (for furs only) and who wins the round is also up to you. To end the story your character must win all five rounds and be titled top glutton. And if your charater passes out you can go on as the opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's pretty much it. So,  pull up a chair, unbuckle your belt, grab a bib, and let the gorging begin! </td>",
