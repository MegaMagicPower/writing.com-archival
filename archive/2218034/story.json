He walked along the street until he found a extravagant house with a purple door and two windows on each side. There stood Blaze's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails walked towards it and stepped in the front yard to peer through one of the windows. His eyes saw a big mansion-like structure in the centre of the house. With wonder and awe filling his eyes, he quickly rushed to the door only to find it closed and locked. Tails looked around for any sort of keyhole or something, but he couldn't see anything that would let him in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess this is it,\" he says to himself before pushing on the door. Much to his surprise, it swings open as if it wasn't locked at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, that was easy,\" he says as he closes the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found himself in a foyer of sorts. There was the main entrance and then a doorway on the other side that went to a stairway presumably leading to the second floor where he heard voices coming from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was expecting you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was it?</span></div></div>",

Tails figured he learned all he could from Honey as he left her memories and went back to monitor what was going on between her and his counterpart but what he came back to was Honey kissing Miles as Tails could taste his tongue...he caught himself enjoying the taste even as Miles pulled out of the romantic gesture.</span></div></div>",

I know some of these individuals\u2019 whereabouts is public knowledge but I want eyes on them at all times and I want those in suits and dresses to try to avoid combat with them until your mind control has become permanent so we can avoid having to start the process from the beginning. I spoke with Boomer about making control chips for selected targets but they aren\u2019t ready yet and even then that is a temporary answer so when they are ready and used bring said targets to me so I can bring a permanent solution. I also want you to search and find the Chaos Emeralds with one being given to me, one to Honey, one to Tails, one to my lovely Alicia, and one will stay with the Freedom Fighters, Secret Freedom Fighters, and Chaotix respectively. I will leave it to you all to divide up into whatever respective groups you think would work best at monitoring these targets and/or capturing them and bringing them to our fold but Scourge is the number one priority out of them all. Finally I will head out with Tails to meet up with Rouge as she has tricked Shadow and Omega into a vulnerable area as the hedgehog at this point is aware something is wrong I will have to take a direct approach with him while Tails hacks him. That is all.\u201d With everything said the teams separate and some went to monitor villains while others searched for emeralds...</span></div></div>",

Cassia was afraid as she didnt know the Fox's true intent so she grabbed her tonfas and showed herself with a fighting stance. \"Dont come any closer!\"She said though her hands were shaking a bit. Tails had his hands up. \"Cassia i dont plan on hurting you. Im just here to talk\"he said. \"W-Why? Why do you want to talk to me\"She said. \"Because i know of your fatal illness\"Tails said which made her freeze. \"H-how do you know a-about that?\"She said surprised. Tails looks at her and took a step forward. \"I found out about it recently and i suspect that Eggman said that he was going to help...right?\"Tails said. Cassia was really confused now and she nods quickly. \"Y-yeah...he said that he had a cure....to help me\"Cassia said. \"B-but im feeling better...i should be thankful\"Cassia said. Tails saw the opening he had and breathed deeply. \"But he didnt really help you Cassia. He only helped prolong your life\"Tails said. Cassia let her guard down and lays her hands down. \"W-what do you mean?\"Cassia said. Tails slowly got close to her. \"Cassia. Your illness...its not fully cured. I hacked into eggman's computer files...and it showed that while your cybernitized, it helped prolong your life...but that it wouldnt fully cure the illness. But even before doing this to you he knew and he did it anyway. I think he is using this as blackmail for you sister\"he explained. Cassia looks at him. \"What do you mean? Like he is forcing her to work with him?\"Cassia said. She never trusted Eggman but this made her angry about him. To blackmail her sister with her own life...that was cruel. \"Exactly. Luckily i have a more permanent solution to your situation.\"Tails said gently grabbing her hand. Cassia was confused. \"Permanent? As in i can be officially cured?\"Cassia said as Tail nods. \"Yes...but i need you on board with this. And promise that you will agree on being on our side for my cause\"Tails said. Cassia nods quickly. \"I will do anything you want if you keep to your word!\"Cassia said as he felt her hand squeeze his. \"Or else\"She said trying to be threatening. Tails nods. \"Got it. Now lets go find your sister...i hope she didnt do something to my friend\"Tails said as he got out of the alley with her and they both walked around looking for them and saw them.</span></div></div>",

Its down in the basement\"Tails said as he goes down a secret set of stairs. Cassia was nervous but followed closely behind her. The set of stairs eventually closed and Tails turned on a switch, causing the room to lighten up. It was a room filled with computers and a big tube at the center.

Miles and Alicia were busy taking down what little resistance was left as they went after Finitevus and Starline who teamed together only for Finitevus to be in a dress and Starline in a suit afterwards, the next day the Downunda Freedom Fighters and Avalon Freedom Fighters fell next with little fight with each group getting the attire appropriate to their genders. The third and fourth days consisted of dealing with the Zeti after they managed to use their powers to build up an army out of Eggman\u2019s robots but it only worked for so long before they fell to a flurry of dresses while Ash showed up at the mansion during all of that hoping to save his girlfriend and find a way to free her just for Sonic to shove a dress on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife was good for them all as Miles and Alicia walked inside with a Nicky the Weasel wearing a dress and her brother Nack also wearing one. Upon hearing the two enter the mansion the couple left their servants bodies to welcome their allies as they went over their day, \u201cThe Hooligans were tougher than expected but Bark and Bean managed to run off to Mogul\u2019s casino and managed to convince him to make them part of his promise between us and Mogul so we won\u2019t be recruiting them unless we want to take on that demigod which isn\u2019t worth it considering his magical prowess and our reward for it all would be a crazy duck and a mute polar bear.\u201d Honey seemed to understand while Tails was too busy imagining it Nack would turn out exactly like his sister or even sexier when Miles snapped his fingers to get his attention. \u201cTails this is no time to keep your head in the clouds after all we\u2019ve done the Zone Cops may start coming in soon to try to take on Alicia and myself away and undo everything and considering how powerful of a force they are they can easily do so if we get too cocky their suits will protect them from the outfits managing to get on them and the helmets will protect them from my magic so we need to knock them out and strip their armor before we could gain control over any of them and considering they have a whole army that are equipped with weapons that can likely knock us out in a single blow will make things extremely difficult. Other than that we do have people like and things unaccounted for like Shade, Metal Sonic, Sticks, Thrash, and the Master Emerald so it wouldn\u2019t take much but it needs to be taken care of regardless by you as it\u2019s our turn to relax for awhile.\u201d He winked at Alicia as the two headed to the showers.</span></div></div>",

Sally knew things had to be fixed but she had to be very careful about it or else her freedom would be short lived and thus all hope would be lost as she started with two people: Sonic and Elias. Sonic was an easy choice for her as he was the most trusted person to her besides Nicole however freeing her would be difficult as she would need access to her portable device and she had no idea where that was being hid but an advantage Sonic had over her was his history of finding victory in even the most dire of situations and with him on her side gave them the best odds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally waited until Sonic and herself were on a mission alone when she grabbed him and opened up his shirt, he at first freaked out until Sally explained everything she knew to him and told him to stay low, be careful, and pretend when they got back as she made a small cut to the inside of the hedgehog\u2019s shirt but he buttoned it back up so no one could be the wiser. Luckily Sally was able to convince the four that she should have Elias on the mission they had today as she pained seeing what they had done to her now sister and if she couldn\u2019t save anyone besides Sonic it had to be her as Elias was someone the princess held close in her heart, go to for guidance and advice while they understood, and generally was a great leader in a way many claimed Sally was herself but she didn\u2019t think so in comparison to Elias. With Sonic\u2019s help freeing Elias was easy as he suddenly grabbed her as Sally opened her blouse which unfortunately meant the first thing Elias did with a free mind was cover her breasts as they began planning for each of them to slowly free others as they can Elias made a small cut on the inside of her blouse before she carefully put it back on and together they completed the mission as not arouse suspicion of finding a Chaos Emerald and bringing it back to Miles.</span></div></div>",

Other things she knew was that there was Anarchy Beryl the Moebians brought over that was hidden in one of the rooms of the mansion however the journal didn\u2019t have the location listed as Miles likely had that down in his memory, another thing was that this was likely one of many journal volumes as it didn\u2019t explain how to perform any of the magic just let her know there was magic involved but she didn\u2019t have much of a choice but to try as she heard Miles mention Mina would be there\u2019s forever come dawn so she waited until late that night to carefully walk around and check different rooms for the Beryl until she found two with one containing two Chaos Emeralds and the one next to it containing the Beryl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunnie figures she should try the Beryl but there was no way of knowing how to work it and they were much more unstable than the already powerful Chaos Emeralds everyone was counting on her to do this so she had to do it right.

She felt something cold all of a sudden and looks around. \"Must be the damn air\"She concluded as she walked to an alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow inside her, Tails has so many choices to do!. He can takeover comepletely or he can be patient and wait for a good time to take over. Then again he can also slowly takeover her and enjoy getting control of her body </span></div></div>",

Give in to your urges?\"Tails said as he felt her get closer and closer to him and kissed him again. He breaks the kiss and pants. \"Thats what i thought. Come to my bedroom and i will help you\"he said as he goes to the bedroom alongside her, his hand on her ass and a smirk on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they reach the room and Lien-Da pushed Tails unto the bedroom and pins him down. \"Just because im doing this doesnt mean anything special brat\"She said as she got naked as well as Tails did. \"Your very sexy looking\"He said which earned a smirk from her. \"Of course im sexy\"she said as she kissed him deeply. He started rubbing her body and her breasts earning a moan from her as they kissed. His cock got ready to be used and he smirks on the kiss and breaks it. \"Ready?\"Tails said. \"Just get it over with!\"she said annoyed. He smirks evilly as he managed to switch the positions, making her be under him. He smirks and thrusted into her pussy with a very powerful thrust, earning a loud moan of both pain mixed with pleasure.

His giant cock inside her felt like it was breaking her mind. In a way that was Tails plan, to give her so much pleasure that she would be broken enough for him to have control over her. He rubs her breasts and kissed them, played with them, licked them. She was panted like a dog in heat and she cummed after a while however he wasnt done yet. Tails whispered a few things which made her moan in response and after an hour and a few powerfull thrusts he cums balls deep inside her, causing them both to moan. Tails pants and smirks. \"Your mine now\"Tails said with an evil smirk. Lien-Da, in her lustfull state still, nodded weakly before passing out. Tails smirks and got out of her and put her on her clothes. He soon fell asleep beside her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning came and Tails woke up first. Lien-Da was still knocked out and He smirks as he kissed her lips enjoying the fact that he owns her but she didnt know it. Tails leaves the room and waited for her to wake up.
