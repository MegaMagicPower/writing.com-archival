He walked along the street until he found a extravagant house with a purple door and two windows on each side. There stood Blaze's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails walked towards it and stepped in the front yard to peer through one of the windows. His eyes saw a big mansion-like structure in the centre of the house. With wonder and awe filling his eyes, he quickly rushed to the door only to find it closed and locked. Tails looked around for any sort of keyhole or something, but he couldn't see anything that would let him in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess this is it,\" he says to himself before pushing on the door. Much to his surprise, it swings open as if it wasn't locked at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, that was easy,\" he says as he closes the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found himself in a foyer of sorts. There was the main entrance and then a doorway on the other side that went to a stairway presumably leading to the second floor where he heard voices coming from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was expecting you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was it?</span></div></div>",

You have been of use to me. After all you have been cooperating with me. But do that again and maybe next time i will use it\"Miles said smiling as he kissed her cheek and lets her go. \"Im gonna go now. I will look forward to know how our little proyect is doing in the future\"Miles said as he soon left the house, leaving Honey on her bed crying out of fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails felt bad for Honey. He wanted to help her overcome this but he didnt know why. Thats when he had a thought and it made him smirk. While he was feeling bad for her, she got ready to go to sleep. He could invade her dream and have her be on Tails side so that he could perhaps help her. Then again he could just take over her body and have his fun before helping her. But what would he do?</span></div></div>",

I want there to be a complete planet search for them as well as other threats like Metal Sonic, Eggman, Doctor Finitevus, Ixis Naugus, the Dark Egg Legion, the Egg Bosses, the Iron Queen, the Iron King, and Mammoth Mogul. I know some of these individuals\u2019 whereabouts is public knowledge but I want eyes on them at all times and I want those in suits and dresses to try to avoid combat with them until your mind control has become permanent so we can avoid having to start the process from the beginning. I spoke with Boomer about making control chips for selected targets but they aren\u2019t ready yet and even then that is a temporary answer so when they are ready and used bring said targets to me so I can bring a permanent solution. I also want you to search and find the Chaos Emeralds with one being given to me, one to Honey, one to Tails, one to my lovely Alicia, and one will stay with the Freedom Fighters, Secret Freedom Fighters, and Chaotix respectively. I will leave it to you all to divide up into whatever respective groups you think would work best at monitoring these targets and/or capturing them and bringing them to our fold but Scourge is the number one priority out of them all. Finally I will head out with Tails to meet up with Rouge as she has tricked Shadow and Omega into a vulnerable area as the hedgehog at this point is aware something is wrong I will have to take a direct approach with him while Tails hacks him.

Luckily i have a more permanent solution to your situation.\"Tails said gently grabbing her hand. Cassia was confused. \"Permanent? As in i can be officially cured?\"Cassia said as Tail nods. \"Yes...but i need you on board with this. And promise that you will agree on being on our side for my cause\"Tails said.

Upon hearing the two enter the mansion the couple left their servants bodies to welcome their allies as they went over their day, \u201cThe Hooligans were tougher than expected but Bark and Bean managed to run off to Mogul\u2019s casino and managed to convince him to make them part of his promise between us and Mogul so we won\u2019t be recruiting them unless we want to take on that demigod which isn\u2019t worth it considering his magical prowess and our reward for it all would be a crazy duck and a mute polar bear.\u201d Honey seemed to understand while Tails was too busy imagining it Nack would turn out exactly like his sister or even sexier when Miles snapped his fingers to get his attention. \u201cTails this is no time to keep your head in the clouds after all we\u2019ve done the Zone Cops may start coming in soon to try to take on Alicia and myself away and undo everything and considering how powerful of a force they are they can easily do so if we get too cocky their suits will protect them from the outfits managing to get on them and the helmets will protect them from my magic so we need to knock them out and strip their armor before we could gain control over any of them and considering they have a whole army that are equipped with weapons that can likely knock us out in a single blow will make things extremely difficult. Other than that we do have people like and things unaccounted for like Shade, Metal Sonic, Sticks, Thrash, and the Master Emerald so it wouldn\u2019t take much but it needs to be taken care of regardless by you as it\u2019s our turn to relax for awhile.\u201d He winked at Alicia as the two headed to the showers.</span></div></div>",

Sally knew things had to be fixed but she had to be very careful about it or else her freedom would be short lived and thus all hope would be lost as she started with two people: Sonic and Elias. Sonic was an easy choice for her as he was the most trusted person to her besides Nicole however freeing her would be difficult as she would need access to her portable device and she had no idea where that was being hid but an advantage Sonic had over her was his history of finding victory in even the most dire of situations and with him on her side gave them the best odds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally waited until Sonic and herself were on a mission alone when she grabbed him and opened up his shirt, he at first freaked out until Sally explained everything she knew to him and told him to stay low, be careful, and pretend when they got back as she made a small cut to the inside of the hedgehog\u2019s shirt but he buttoned it back up so no one could be the wiser. Luckily Sally was able to convince the four that she should have Elias on the mission they had today as she pained seeing what they had done to her now sister and if she couldn\u2019t save anyone besides Sonic it had to be her as Elias was someone the princess held close in her heart, go to for guidance and advice while they understood, and generally was a great leader in a way many claimed Sally was herself but she didn\u2019t think so in comparison to Elias. With Sonic\u2019s help freeing Elias was easy as he suddenly grabbed her as Sally opened her blouse which unfortunately meant the first thing Elias did with a free mind was cover her breasts as they began planning for each of them to slowly free others as they can Elias made a small cut on the inside of her blouse before she carefully put it back on and together they completed the mission as not arouse suspicion of finding a Chaos Emerald and bringing it back to Miles.</span></div></div>",

Alicia smiled and began to lick it as OG Alicia lets Miles play with her breasts and butt. Miles got an idea and began to lick his way down. She moans in delight and lets him have his way with her. The other Alicia started licking the base before eventually deepthroating his cock as Miles moans and burried his face on her pussy OG Alicia moans loudly as she lays down and helps the other alicia with pleasuring his cock. Miles was in heaven as he started sucking and licking her walls. It wasnt long before Alicia drank his cum and got the dick out of her mouth. The OG alicia moans as she cummed and gets to be cleaned by Miles. Now they both reversed their roles but this time OG alicia got her pusdy on his cock as the other started rubbing his chest and kissing him deeply. Miles was very horny as they started to pleasure every inch of his body and he kissed her back. He buried his face on her breasts and licks her breasts causing alicia to coo his name. OG alicia started riding his dick faster and moans. Miles ordered alicia to turn around and to sit on his face. Alicia obliged and sat on his face and moans loudly as Miles started to lick his way into her pussy. Miles also moans inside her as he was being sent over the edge again. Miles continued licking deeper and deeper, driving alicia crazy and OG alicia was about to cum. It wasnt long until they all cummed in unison and pant. They seemed exhausted.</span></div></div>",

She also hated that thanks to the mind control not only did she lose her accents but so did her husband Antoine and that didn\u2019t help her anger but thanks to the detailed information in the journal Bunnie knew the clothes controlled everyone and that she was free only because of a tear on the sock when Fiona Fox tried to cut a sword into her mechanical foot but it broke upon impact and she ran off to fight Alicia instead. Other things she knew was that there was Anarchy Beryl the Moebians brought over that was hidden in one of the rooms of the mansion however the journal didn\u2019t have the location listed as Miles likely had that down in his memory, another thing was that this was likely one of many journal volumes as it didn\u2019t explain how to perform any of the magic just let her know there was magic involved but she didn\u2019t have much of a choice but to try as she heard Miles mention Mina would be there\u2019s forever come dawn so she waited until late that night to carefully walk around and check different rooms for the Beryl until she found two with one containing two Chaos Emeralds and the one next to it containing the Beryl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunnie figures she should try the Beryl but there was no way of knowing how to work it and they were much more unstable than the already powerful Chaos Emeralds everyone was counting on her to do this so she had to do it right.

Give in to your urges?\"Tails said as he felt her get closer and closer to him and kissed him again. He breaks the kiss and pants. \"Thats what i thought.

He started rubbing her body and her breasts earning a moan from her as they kissed. His cock got ready to be used and he smirks on the kiss and breaks it. \"Ready?\"Tails said. \"Just get it over with!\"she said annoyed. He smirks evilly as he managed to switch the positions, making her be under him. He smirks and thrusted into her pussy with a very powerful thrust, earning a loud moan of both pain mixed with pleasure.

His giant cock inside her felt like it was breaking her mind. In a way that was Tails plan, to give her so much pleasure that she would be broken enough for him to have control over her. He rubs her breasts and kissed them, played with them, licked them. She was panted like a dog in heat and she cummed after a while however he wasnt done yet. Tails whispered a few things which made her moan in response and after an hour and a few powerfull thrusts he cums balls deep inside her, causing them both to moan. Tails pants and smirks. \"Your mine now\"Tails said with an evil smirk. Lien-Da, in her lustfull state still, nodded weakly before passing out. Tails smirks and got out of her and put her on her clothes. He soon fell asleep beside her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning came and Tails woke up first.

He soon went to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona goes to Rouge and quickly pins her down. Rouge was taken aback by this and squirms. \"Hey get off me! What is up with you?!\"she said alarmed. \"Oh dont worry Rouge. This will all end soon\"Fiona said though it was actually tails who said that. Rouge was confused and began to get angry. \"What do you mea-\"She said as she was cut off as she got kissed by Fiona and her eyes widen in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails left a small portion of himself in Fiona's body and he left Fiona and entered Rouge's mouth as some sort of liquid. Rouge felt the liquid and starts gagging and tries to escape the kiss but Fiona kept her in place. Soon all of Tail's essence was inside Rouge and Fiona lets go of her and the kiss. Rouge pushed Fiona away and runs away. She didnt want to do whatever it was she did with Fiona anymore. Meanwhile Fiona smirked evilly as she closed the door. \"Now I wait\"Fiona said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Rouge goes to her apartment and tries to get whatever she drank out of her. After a while she thought she got it out and sighs. \"What the hell was that. Fiona was acting really strange tonight\"She thought as she sighs and gets ready to go to bed. She was about to go to her room when she stopped and smirked. \"Finally her sexy body is mine! Your worst mistake was ever going to Fiona's Rouge.\"Rouge said with a smirk looking at her breasts as it was clear that Tails successfully took over her body. She was about to walk to her room when she held her head in pain. \"Aah my head\"she groaned. Something unexpected happened.</span></div></div>",

Another thing is that in some battles Sonic thinks that i shouldnt be on them because they are two dangerous. But i know how to take care of myself. But of course if Sonic wasnt a hero of an adventure it never happened. And when i say about asking someout out and look for advice i always get the same answers. 'Why are you thinking about love so early? Your not old enough for that?' 'Tails sorry but i dont want you to hurt your feelings'. And one day i snapped. I ran away to my workshop and stayed there for a month until i made my device. I was gonna use it to possess females so that i can find out what its like to be them. And have my fun using their bodies\"Tails said looking at her. He didnt realize he was slightly crying. Rouge was shocked at how much emotion Tails had bottled up but Tails expected a slap or for her to argue with him but instead she hugged him. Tails was surprised and looks at her. \"A-arent you mad at me for being selfish?\"Tails said. Rouge shook her head. \"Not really. If i was in your position i would of done the same thing to be honest. But they should respect you cause your intelligent and very brave. Not to mention very attractive\"Rouge said with a smirk and kissed his lips. Tails smiled and hugs her. \"Thanks Rouge. Im so happy you support me\"Tails said.

She goes in. \"Cream you cant go alone!\"Gemerl said as he followed her and looks around inside. Only for her to not be anywhere.

That should work\"she said and fixed everything and turned him on. \"Is tails here?\"Gemerl said like nothing happened.

I can play with you if you want\"Gemerl said. \"Thanks...but im gonna continue playing with my toys\"Cream said and walks away with gemerl behind her. Unknown to him she had a smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they returned to their home, Cream explained what happened and went to her room. After she closed the door she smirked.
