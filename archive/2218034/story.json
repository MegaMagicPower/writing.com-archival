He walked along the street until he found a extravagant house with a purple door and two windows on each side. There stood Blaze's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails walked towards it and stepped in the front yard to peer through one of the windows. His eyes saw a big mansion-like structure in the centre of the house. With wonder and awe filling his eyes, he quickly rushed to the door only to find it closed and locked. Tails looked around for any sort of keyhole or something, but he couldn't see anything that would let him in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess this is it,\" he says to himself before pushing on the door. Much to his surprise, it swings open as if it wasn't locked at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, that was easy,\" he says as he closes the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found himself in a foyer of sorts. There was the main entrance and then a doorway on the other side that went to a stairway presumably leading to the second floor where he heard voices coming from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was expecting you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was it?</span></div></div>",

From what he could tell Miles arrived on Mobius two weeks ago giving Honey the offer of ruling over Mobius as long as she cooperated with him but she primarily agreed not because she wanted to rule over the planet (although she would be lying if she said she wasn\u2019t interested in being queen) but because she feared the fox would\u2019ve used his powers on her if she said no anyways, she thought it was possible that he could turn on her at any moment so she was trying her best to subtly seduce Miles so she would be able to keep her own free will. Tails figured he learned all he could from Honey as he left her memories and went back to monitor what was going on between her and his counterpart but what he came back to was Honey kissing Miles as Tails could taste his tongue...he caught himself enjoying the taste even as Miles pulled out of the romantic gesture.</span></div></div>",

Mina nodded for the last time \"Understood my queen\"Mina said. Soon Honey snapped her fingers and Mina's eyes turned back to normal and she shook her head. \"Well? What do you think of the dress? Do you like it?\"Honey said excited.</span></div></div>",

I spoke with Boomer about making control chips for selected targets but they aren\u2019t ready yet and even then that is a temporary answer so when they are ready and used bring said targets to me so I can bring a permanent solution. I also want you to search and find the Chaos Emeralds with one being given to me, one to Honey, one to Tails, one to my lovely Alicia, and one will stay with the Freedom Fighters, Secret Freedom Fighters, and Chaotix respectively. I will leave it to you all to divide up into whatever respective groups you think would work best at monitoring these targets and/or capturing them and bringing them to our fold but Scourge is the number one priority out of them all. Finally I will head out with Tails to meet up with Rouge as she has tricked Shadow and Omega into a vulnerable area as the hedgehog at this point is aware something is wrong I will have to take a direct approach with him while Tails hacks him.

Luckily i have a more permanent solution to your situation.\"Tails said gently grabbing her hand. Cassia was confused. \"Permanent? As in i can be officially cured?\"Cassia said as Tail nods. \"Yes...but i need you on board with this. And promise that you will agree on being on our side for my cause\"Tails said.

Sally knew things had to be fixed but she had to be very careful about it or else her freedom would be short lived and thus all hope would be lost as she started with two people: Sonic and Elias. Sonic was an easy choice for her as he was the most trusted person to her besides Nicole however freeing her would be difficult as she would need access to her portable device and she had no idea where that was being hid but an advantage Sonic had over her was his history of finding victory in even the most dire of situations and with him on her side gave them the best odds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally waited until Sonic and herself were on a mission alone when she grabbed him and opened up his shirt, he at first freaked out until Sally explained everything she knew to him and told him to stay low, be careful, and pretend when they got back as she made a small cut to the inside of the hedgehog\u2019s shirt but he buttoned it back up so no one could be the wiser. Luckily Sally was able to convince the four that she should have Elias on the mission they had today as she pained seeing what they had done to her now sister and if she couldn\u2019t save anyone besides Sonic it had to be her as Elias was someone the princess held close in her heart, go to for guidance and advice while they understood, and generally was a great leader in a way many claimed Sally was herself but she didn\u2019t think so in comparison to Elias. With Sonic\u2019s help freeing Elias was easy as he suddenly grabbed her as Sally opened her blouse which unfortunately meant the first thing Elias did with a free mind was cover her breasts as they began planning for each of them to slowly free others as they can Elias made a small cut on the inside of her blouse before she carefully put it back on and together they completed the mission as not arouse suspicion of finding a Chaos Emerald and bringing it back to Miles.</span></div></div>",

She also hated that thanks to the mind control not only did she lose her accents but so did her husband Antoine and that didn\u2019t help her anger but thanks to the detailed information in the journal Bunnie knew the clothes controlled everyone and that she was free only because of a tear on the sock when Fiona Fox tried to cut a sword into her mechanical foot but it broke upon impact and she ran off to fight Alicia instead. Other things she knew was that there was Anarchy Beryl the Moebians brought over that was hidden in one of the rooms of the mansion however the journal didn\u2019t have the location listed as Miles likely had that down in his memory, another thing was that this was likely one of many journal volumes as it didn\u2019t explain how to perform any of the magic just let her know there was magic involved but she didn\u2019t have much of a choice but to try as she heard Miles mention Mina would be there\u2019s forever come dawn so she waited until late that night to carefully walk around and check different rooms for the Beryl until she found two with one containing two Chaos Emeralds and the one next to it containing the Beryl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunnie figures she should try the Beryl but there was no way of knowing how to work it and they were much more unstable than the already powerful Chaos Emeralds everyone was counting on her to do this so she had to do it right. There was also the Chaos Emeralds which thanks to there being two she knew that time travel was possible thanks to Silver but would that work if someone didn\u2019t really have much of a connection to the Chaos Force like her?</span></div></div>",

He started rubbing her body and her breasts earning a moan from her as they kissed. His cock got ready to be used and he smirks on the kiss and breaks it. \"Ready?\"Tails said. \"Just get it over with!\"she said annoyed. He smirks evilly as he managed to switch the positions, making her be under him.

His giant cock inside her felt like it was breaking her mind. In a way that was Tails plan, to give her so much pleasure that she would be broken enough for him to have control over her. He rubs her breasts and kissed them, played with them, licked them. She was panted like a dog in heat and she cummed after a while however he wasnt done yet. Tails whispered a few things which made her moan in response and after an hour and a few powerfull thrusts he cums balls deep inside her, causing them both to moan. Tails pants and smirks. \"Your mine now\"Tails said with an evil smirk. Lien-Da, in her lustfull state still, nodded weakly before passing out. Tails smirks and got out of her and put her on her clothes. He soon fell asleep beside her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning came and Tails woke up first.

Lien-Da kissed back but breaks it. \"How about we both rule the Dark Legion and maybe the World once we get Eggman out of our way\"She said. Tails enjoyed that idea. \"To rule by your side? Count me in\"He said and rubs her breasts. \"However i have one condition. I get to have my way with you and if i want to, take control over your body\"Tails said smirking, his mind warped by being too long in her body and her personality alongside his. Lien-Da smirks and kissed him some more. \"Oh Tails you already know that i will agree to that. We both need to be together.\"Lien-Da said. Tails smirked and pins her down to the Wall making her gasp with pleasure as he trailed kisses on her neck.</span></div></div>",
