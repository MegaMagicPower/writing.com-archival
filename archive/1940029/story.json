But, he also saw that he had crushed many buildings.  Which made him sad.  But, he realized that it was too late, so he started to get up, which at the same time was crushing more buildings.  Once he was up, he saw that he was about 125 ft tall now.  So, he decided to explore and while doing that, he would scare more villagers.  So, since he was tall and no one could stop him, he wanted to play with them.  And so he played 'run from the monster' and won by grabbing around ten different villagers.  He brought his fist filled with people to fist face and said,<br>\r\n\"I'm hungry and your going to help me get ride of this hunger!\" He said to see their reaction.  It of course successed and they started crying for mercy.  But, he was hungry and what was ten people going to do.  So he swallowed each and everyone of them whole.  Which, since he was a giant, didn't satisfy him. Then suddenly an idea popped up.  Three certain people were pestering him all the time and he could get rid of all of them.  The were Danzo, Homura, and the other old guy.(I don't rember his name) Sonhe walked over to where they lived.<br>\r\n They, of course, stood there in awe when they saw his size.  He didn't care though.  So, he scooped them up to his fist and said,<br>\r\n\"You three have made my life a living hell for a while, so you need to go!\"  And before the could say anything, they were in his mouth going down his throat. <br>\r\n\"I know that I'm normally all about peace, but I think I should get rid of some other people.\"  He said to himself as he started walking to the........</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Our story begins far to the north of Konoha; about a week\u2019s travel. Kiba Inuzuka and Naruto Uzumaki are joined by two other shinobi as they explore a dense forest seemingly in the middle of nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure this is the right place?\u201d Kiba asked as he crouched down by a tree stump and examined several mushrooms. \u201cI\u2019m not seeing any plants like the one we described to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m positive! The merchants that spoke of it described this area precisely.\u201d replied Daiki, a man who looked to be somewhere in his early 20s. He was large and muscular and a j\u014dnin of the Hidden Tree Village; a relatively new village that had sprung up nearby within the past few months. The village wasn\u2019t very strong and lacked promising ninja, but when two young men of Konoha had come to them seeking a particular medical herb, Daiki and his brother had been too eager to assist. Well\u2026Daiki at least\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd they just happened to be out of stock at the time.\u201d mumbled Kenta, the other Tree ninja and younger brother of Daiki. He looked to be around Naruto and Kiba\u2019s age and sported bushy brown hair and an unzipped ninja coat. While he wasn\u2019t as bulky as his bro, he wasn\u2019t afraid to show off his toned and athletic torso to all the ladies of the village. \u201cThis is a waste of time. We\u2019ve been searching for over an hour now\u2026that\u2019s an hour I could have spent perfecting my shuriken jutsu!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuiet, Kenta!\u201d shouted the older male. \u201cNaruto and Kiba sought our help and it\u2019s our duty to aid them in healing their comrade! If we help save their friend, surely the Leaf Village will come to respect us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha\u2026by the way, you should know\u2026\u201d Naruto chuckled nervously as he scratched the back of his head. \u201cThis \u2018comrade\u2019 of ours\u2026is actually just a dog.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA\u2026dog?\u201d repeated Kenta, giving the spiky-haired blond a look that said \u201care you kidding me?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat dog is my comrade and dear friend!\u201d Kiba snapped at Naruto as he clenched one of his fists. \u201cA friend that was badly poisoned thanks to &lt;i&gt;someone\u2019s&lt;/i&gt; stupidity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you still angry about that?\u201d Naruto asked as he narrowed his blue eyes at the brown-haired shinobi. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t my fault! Plus, didn\u2019t Granny Tsunade say he\u2019d eventually get better in a month or two? There was no need to go on this pointless journey\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I was gonna leave Akamaru to suffer for that long! We\u2019re finding that damned flower and then we\u2019re returning to Konoha ASAP!\u201d shouted Kiba before he turned his back to Naruto and stomped deeper into the forest. \u201cI saw a hill a ways back; I\u2019m gonna go check around it. You three keep searching this area.\u201d As Kiba disappeared from sight, Kenta clenched his fists and shouted back at the dog tamer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Don\u2019t order us around, Leaf brat!\u201d Kiba must have heard him, but he gave no reply and that just ticked the teenager off more <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, now, Kenta. Less screaming, more searching.\u201d scolded Daiki as the three of them continued to search for the plant that would cure Akamaru. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes later, no one was having any luck. Kenta was about to open his mouth and suggest they head back when\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, look at that!\u201d Naruto exclaimed as he pointed at a strange cave poking out of the ground. The trio of shinobi approached the cavern and gazed down into a darkness leading underground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, this is it!\u201d Daiki announced as he leaned down and plucked a small, rose-like flower from just outside the cave\u2019s entrance. It definitely looked like a rose, but it was blue in color and lacked any thorns. \u201cThis is what we\u2019re looking for! The Tengu\u2019s Tongue!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u2026Akamaru\u2019s a pretty big pooch; it\u2019s gonna take more than that little flower to heal him.\u201d explained Naruto; earning a nod from Daiki in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn that case let us venture into this cave! I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll find more inside!\u201d the j\u014dnin urged his younger companions to follow him as they made their way into the dark cavern. After traversing a few yards into the earth, the ninja noticed something odd. The tunnel was growing brighter as lit candles appeared on the walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s living down here\u2026\u201d Kenta mumbled the obvious as he looked around them suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026keep your guard up.\u201d Naruto whispered from just behind Kenta. Moments later the three emerged into the cave\u2019s main chamber and were shocked by what they saw. The underground room had been transformed into some sort of laboratory. Shelves of tomes and scrolls lined the walls, many candles and lanterns lit the place up, and several vials of strange liquid was boiling and bubbling on a nearby stove. Naruto grimaced as he fanned the pungent odor away from his face. \u201cUgh\u2026what is this place? It\u2019s giving me the creeps\u2026reminds me of Orochimaru\u2019s hideout.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you know Orochimaru-sama?!\u201d came a sudden voice from the darkness. Naruto and the two Tree brothers got into fighting stances as a man appeared from the shadows. He looked like a young man in his late teens and was wearing a white lab coat and goggles over his eyes. His hair was black and tied in a ponytail and Naruto noticed a Sound headband around his waist. \u201cAre you also servants of his? Has Orochimaru-sama finally sent someone to observe the fruits of my most recent experiments?!\u201d The young man smiled gleefully and looked like he\u2019d jump for joy on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026hate to break it to you, guy, but Orochimaru is dead.\u201d said Naruto, receiving a look of disbelief from the Sound ninja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?! There\u2019s no way! You\u2019re lying!\u201d The black-haired scientist lifted up his goggles to reveal two blue eyes. Those eyes glared at the trio hatefully as he realized their headbands were not of the Sound! \u201cI see now. You\u2019re not allies, but enemies! In that case\u2026\u201d The man smirked and placed his gloved hands together. \u201cI\u2019ll destroy you using my newest jutsu! Prepare to die, scum!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHehe, now this is what I\u2019m talking about!\u201d Kenta said with a grin as he reached for his shuriken pouch. \u201cI thought this little trip into the forest would be nothing but boredom, but I\u2019ve found some action! Get ready, loser, because you\u2019re the first Sound ninja I\u2019m gonna bring down!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, Kenta! I\u2019ll attack first; you back me up!\u201d stated Daiki as he charged toward the nameless ninja like a bull. The Sound shinobi didn\u2019t even bother to avoid the attack as he quickly made several hand seals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSize Reduction Wave!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaiki cursed under his breath as the ninja released his jutsu. A visible wave of high-pitched sound radiated off his hands and tore through the bodies of the three shinobi. Daiki was stopped in his tracks and covered his ears in agony. Naruto and Kenta did the same; they felt like the sound waves were gonna made their bodies burst!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026it\u2019s rebounding off the walls!\u201d Naruto shouted, though no one could hear his voice. His vision was getting blurry and he began getting dizzy and disoriented. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta\u2026get outside!\u201d Naruto turned to dash back into the tunnel leading to this underground room, but he only took a couple steps before he tripped over something and landed flat on his face. \u201cOw! What the fuck?\u201d Naruto rubbed his nose and looked behind him. He had tripped over a large rock about \u00bc his size. \u201cThat\u2026wasn\u2019t there before. How did\u2026?\u201d Naruto rubbed his eyes and looked up and around. What he saw made his azure orbs widen and his jaw drop in utter shock. The ceiling of the cave looked like it was miles above him\u2026the furniture and dropped books looked humungous now! The fox boy looked back at Kenta and saw he was in a similar state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-No way\u2026\u201d The brown-haired teenager gulped as he glanced around at his surroundings. \u201c Is this some kind of genjutsu? He couldn\u2019t really have\u2026shrunk us! This is crazy!\u201d The young ninja looked down at his palms. \u201cWe\u2019re the size of ants!! We\u2019re\u2026we\u2019re\u2026\u201d Kenta trailed off when he saw something that sent and even colder chill down his spine. He let out a shriek and Naruto quickly looked at what had spooked him. The Sound scientist, how a titanic giant to them, was standing over Kenta\u2019s brother with one foot raised into the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodbye, BUG.\u201d said the giant to the tiny j\u014dnin as he licked his lips. Daiki\u2019s eyes trembled with fear under the shadow of the titan\u2019s sandal, but he quickly shook his head and returned to his senses. Unfortunately, he only had seconds left to spend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKENTA! GET OUT OF H-\u201c Before he could finish, the Sound ninja stomped down on him and an audible crunch was heard. Tears streamed down Kenta\u2019s cheeks as he collapsed to his knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHahaha, wow! That felt awesome!\u201d said the teenage scientist as he swiveled his foot into the cave\u2019s cold, rocky floor. \u201cI just crushed another person like a bug! I feel so strong\u2026stronger than a Kage!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026Daiki\u2026\u201d Naruto clenched his teeth and fists as he looked away. He quickly realized they were still in danger, however, and looked back at the surviving brother. \u201cKenta! We have to get out of here! Get up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDai\u2026ki\u2026\u201d Kenta mumbled as he just knelt there; frozen in horror. Their giant attacker noticed Kenta next and smirked down at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re next, buggy.\u201d he blurted out as he stomped toward the younger male. Kenta couldn\u2019t move a muscle as he just stared up at the approaching figure. He held back the urge to vomit as he noticed a splotch of pasty red residue imbedded into the giant\u2019s trends. Naruto didn\u2019t know what to do\u2026if he just rushed in there to save Kenta, they would both be crushed! He had to think of something\u2026something in the next few seconds!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey you!!!\u201d called a new voice; its loudness echoing throughout the cave. Naruto and Kenta looked back just as two huge, black-sandaled feet almost stepped on them. The footfalls carried enough force to send both teens hurtling a few inches backwards. When the scientist looked up, it was just in time to receive a fist to the face. The blow broke his nose and sent him flying into a rock wall. After smacking into it the shinobi slumped to the ground unconscious and with a stupid look on his face. \u201cI knew I smelled something weird. What\u2019s a Sound ninja doing here\u2026and where are Naruto and the others?\u201d Kiba glanced around the room, but saw no sign of anyone else. He swore he followed their scent down here. \u201cWell\u2026better take care of you. I\u2019ll just tie you up and report you to the Tree village.\u201d Kiba reached into his pouch and took out some wire as he approached the fallen scientist. Meanwhile, Naruto grumbled as he picked himself off the floor and dusted off his pants.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was a close one, but he needs to watch where he\u2019s going!\u201d Naruto remarked as he approached Kenta. The young Tree ninja was standing up as well and wiping tears from his face. \u201cHey, Kenta!\u201d The whiskered teen frowned as he put a hand on the teen\u2019s shoulder. \u201cSorry about your brother\u2026but we have more important things to worry about!\u201d The blond pointed over at Kiba as the giant brunet was busy tying up the Sound ninja\u2019s limbs. \u201cKiba may have saved us, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s noticed us yet. We need to get his attention before we wind up like Daiki!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026I know.\u201d Kenta sniffed loudly and looked up at Kiba. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna die like that! I became a ninja to lead the Tree village to glory, not get stepped on like a roach! I wanna get back to normal size so I can finish off that Sound ninja scum!\u201d With that said, Kenta was done crying and charged toward Kiba and his fallen opponent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, hold on! Damn it, does this guy have any experience at all?!\u201d Naruto hurried after the reckless male, but kept his eyes on Kiba. He was a comrade, but right now also a great danger\u2026</span></div></div>",

I wonder where Naruto and the others are...\" Kiba pondered as he scratched his chin in thought. Kenta, still a bit distressed, screamed at the giant brunet. \"We're down here, you giant idiot!! Daiki got killed, help us!!\" Kenta screamed at the top of his lungs, as he headed for Kiba's giant black sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Kenta...?\" Kiba looked around, being sure he had heard Kenta's voice just now. Kenta was just about to jump on Kiba's sandal, when Naruto grabbed him by his shoulder and pulled him back. \"Are you crazy?!\" Naruto asked as he pulled Kenta away from Kiba's massive form. \"What are you doing?! He was just about to notice us!! Let me go!\" Kenta struggled, as Naruto wouldn't let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that the gratitude I get for saving your life? You can't just charge in like that! You'll get stomped if you aren't careful!\" Naruto warned. Kenta looked at the giant Kiba and then at the red spot on the floor that used to be his brother. \"He would've said the same if he was here now...\" Kenta replied with a vague smirk of regret. \"Fine! Then I'll climb on the wall! He'll see me then!\" Kenta assured. \"No, no, no!! He...he mustn't see us!!\" Naruto gulped. \"Huh? Why?\" Kenta looked at Naruto dumbfounded. \"Eh... well.... we're small, and... and there's no telling what he might do to us!\" Naruto remarked in a sly way. \"What are you talking about?! He's our comrade, and he'll help us! If there's any hope, it's him! Besides, there's no reason for him to do that... right?\" Kenta looked serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto laughed nerviously and rubbed the back of his head. \"Are you hiding something from me?\" Kenta asked. \"Well, the thing is... Akamaru got hurt... and... eh....\" Naruto couldn't finish, as Kenta stared at him intensely. \"Say, we know we're looking for medicine for his dog... but we never found out what exactly happened! Don't tell me that YOU....!\" Kenta stared at the blond. \"No!! It was an accident! I didn't mean to injure him...\" Naruto muttered. \"Well at least you apologized, right? There's nothing to worry about!\" Kenta said again. \"Well... actually... I didn't aplogize... hey, it's not my fault Akamaru jumps around everywhere and I can't get some space to train! And yeah... that's pretty much the reason why he dragged ME along...\" Naruto folded his arms. \"Then you've already made it up to him by going with him...\" Kenta replied. \"Yeah, I guess, but... even so, I've done some pranks on him and---\" Naruto couldn't finish as Kenta interrupted. \"Ugh, I don't wanna hear. Fine, if you're afraid to show yourself like this, then I won't tell him about you being like me. I'm going now...\" Kenta said as he darted off. \"Hey, I'm not afraid of Kiba!! I just don't like this situation...\" Naruto nerviously remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Kiba was just about to get going. \"I have to find the others!\" Kiba thought to himself as he looked around again. Kenta had just managed to reach Kiba from behind, as he yelled again. \"Down here, Kiba! Down here!!\"<br>\r\n\"Kenta! Where are you?\" Kiba thought he heard a faint squeal as he turned back. He looked around, but didn't see anyone. \"Damn, I must be going nuts.\" Kiba scratched his head. Just as he pondered, he felt a tiny squish under his foot, as if he had stepped on something. Kiba looked down, and lifted his foot. Beneath it, he witnessed a red stain and a few unrecognizable limbs. \"Yuck!! A bug with red blood? This place is filled with all kinds of creepy stuff!\" Kiba shuddered, as he scraped his sandal against the floor. From across the small distance there was between Kiba and the tiny Naruto, Naruto saw the whole thing. \"Damn it!!\" Naruto cursed as he clenched his fists in anger. \"I should've gone with him!!\" Naruto hissed as he punched the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've wasted enough time already, I guess. It's a good thing I know Naruto's scent, so I can find him and the others.\" Kiba sighed as he formed a handseal and focused chakra in his nose. After a bit of sniffing, Kiba looked around again. \"That's weird. I can smell Naruto around here, but I don't see him. And the scent is so small...\" Kiba sniffed again, as he began to stomp in Naruto's direction. \"Crap! He's gonna sniff me out!! And there's nowhere to hide!!\" Naruto stiffened. Kiba's powerful stomps almost made Naruto lose his balance, but he managed to keep it just barely. Naruto soon found himself face-to-sandal with... Kiba's massive sandal, which had stepped just infront of him... so close, that Kiba's large toes which were hanging a bit from his sandal were right in Naruto's face. Naruto grimaced, as the bad smell overcame him. The smell was so powerful, it made Naruto's face turn green, but he refused to move an inch, because if he did, Kiba would surely see him. Pinching his nose, Naruto looked up at the looming Kiba, and he felt his heart skip a beat at what he saw. Kiba was looking right down at him... with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well... how did you get in such a predicament, Naruto?\" Kiba asked, barely supressing his laughter. Naruto tried to respond, but he just coughed because of the smell coming from Kiba's big toes. Kiba laughed a bit, as he bent down, and quickly scooped the shrunken Naruto in his fist. Naruto could finally take a deep breath of fresh air, but before either of them could speak, cackling was heard across the room. \"You'll never get this lab's secrets...\" the Sound shinobi had recovered. \"Crap!\" Kiba cursed as he turned back and saw the Sound nin make a single handsign, despite the wire. The whole room lit up in bright light, as paper bombs appeared all over the place. Reacting quickly, Kiba focused chakra to his feet, and dashed for the exit as fast as he could. The Sound nin's maniacal laughter could be heard, as Kiba got out of the cavern just in time, before it detonated. Kiba had just enough time to put the shrunken Naruto into his pocket, before the shock wave blast off and sent him flying a couple of meters away from the collapsing cavern. When the ash and dust finally cleared, there were no remnants of the cavern. The blast had been set up, so that it would erase all traces of the hideout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... damn, that was a bit extreme even for me.\" Kiba rubbed his head, and cleared some dust off himself as he got up. After he had recovered, he pulled Naruto out of his pocket. \"You alright?\" Kiba asked, slightly worried. \"Ugh... yeah, I think so.\" Naruto mumbled as he held his head. \"So what happened? How did you get so tiny?\" Kiba asked, as he looked at the Naruto in his fist. Naruto took a deep breath, and explained everything that had happened since he left to look for the medicine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's eyes widened with disbelief as he got told what happened to Daiki, and how he had stepped on Kenta. \"Damn! This is all your fault, Naruto! If you hadn't injured Akamaru in my previous mission, this wouldn't have happened!!\" Kiba barked out. \"What?! I wasn't the one who stepped on Kenta! You were!!\" Naruto protested. Kiba took a deep breath, and tried to calm himself down. \"Let's... let's just not talk about this anymore, alright?\" Kiba suggested. Naruto looked to the side, and nodded. \"At least we got the medicine...\" Kiba remarked, as he put Naruto on top of his head, and walked off deeper into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of hours had passed, and Kiba had reached his limit. \"Let's take a rest here.\" Kiba said as he sat down, and leaned against a tree. Even though he had walked for a few hours, they were still in the boundaries of the unknown forest. \"What? You're tired already?! Come on! I think there are some Hot Springs not too far away from here!\" Naruto protested again. \"Yeah, I know, but I'm too tired of all this walking. We walked far away from Konoha, then I was looking for the medicine all day, then I rushed to the cavern, then I had to rush out to escape from gettin' blown to bits, and then I had to walk a few miles. You wouldn't have even lasted half as long as me!\" Kiba pridefully remarked. Naruto didn't reply, and just jumped off of Kiba's head down to the ground. \"C'mon, Kiba!! Let's go!!\" Naruto insisted as he began to walk off. \"My feet are aching so bad...\" Kiba lamented. \"Oh yeah! That reminds me! Your feet stink, Kiba! When was the last time you washed them?! If your toes smelled so bad, I don't even want to imagine what your whole foot smells like!\" Naruto complained. \"I bet it's not any worse than your farts, that I had to smell so many times!! Even if it is worse, it would teach you lesson about farting in my face!\" Kiba laughed. \"Hah! If I was normal sized, I wouldn't hesitate to fart on you right now! You sure as hell deserve it, Kiba!\" Naruto said, pointing at Kiba. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i> Hmm... if he doesn't show any respect, then why should I?! There's no point in arguing with him. Maybe I should just teach him a lesson about bad stench... and get payback too! If he's shrunken to a tiny size like that, I could take advantage and force him to smell my feet and he can't do anything about it! Yeah, why not...!</i> Kiba thought as he looked at the zipper on his right sandal, and then at the shrunken Naruto. \"What's with that smirk?\" Naruto asked as he noticed Kiba staring at him with an evil smirk.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After taking just a few steps, the blond turned back to see Kiba still hadn\u2019t budged an inch. In fact, the giant brunet was now unzipping his right sandal and taking it off! \u201cI\u2019m serious, Kiba! Let\u2019s get going! I can stand being this small for another minute!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the rush?\u201d Kiba replied without even look at the shrunken shinobi; his eyes were glued to his own foot as he peeled his black sandal from it. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take us a few days to reach Konoha anyway. You\u2019re stuck like that for a while whether you like it or not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrrrr.\u201d Naruto clenched his fists as he scowled at the giant ninja as he relaxed against a tree and rubbed his own foot in his hands. \u201cWell why do you have to take your sandals off?! I think I can smell your nasty feet all the way over here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear me say my feet are aching?\u201d the ch\u016bnin said with a smirk as he started taking off his left sandal as well. \u201cYou must have\u2026my voice must be booming to a shortstack like you!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Shut up!\u201d Naruto shouted as he looked toward the ground and mumbled. \u201cIt\u2019s not that loud\u2026in fact it\u2019s a pretty girly voice, you know that?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this made Kiba\u2019s mouth twitch. This little punk was gonna regret saying that. There were a few moments of silence before Naruto finally accepted that Kiba wasn\u2019t going to move, so the small genin gave up and proceeded to return to Kiba\u2019s side. As soon as the spiky-haired, bug-sized ninja was within Kiba\u2019s reach, the dog ninja raised his right foot into the air and brought it down upon Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the fuck?!\u201d Naruto cried out in surprise as he kicked off the ground and leaped out of the way of the descending appendage. He just managed to clear the foot\u2019s shadow as it pressed into the ground he was just standing on; flattening the grass there. Naruto shuddered with slight fear as he sat just next to the bare foot. He craned his neck and glared angrily up at the foot\u2019s owner. \u201cWhat\u2019s the big idea, mutt?! You almost stepped on me!!\u201d Kiba didn\u2019t respond to Naruto\u2019s outburst. Instead the smirking teenager turned his foot onto its side so Naruto had a nice view of the flat, expansive sole. Kiba flexed his toes with anticipation before speaking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSniff it, bug boy.\u201d spoke Kiba; his voice taking on a commanding and intimidating tone. Naruto\u2019s sapphire-blue eyes widened in shock as gazed upon Kiba\u2019s sole; fresh droplets of sweat rolling down its damp surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you joking?! Why the hell would I do something as gross as that?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause\u2026\u201d Kiba began, and before he finished he brought his other foot closer to Naruto\u2019s back. The fox boy had no idea what hit him until Kiba\u2019s other sole was pushing his body into the first. \u201c\u2026I told you to. This is payback\u2026and a little lesson in respect!\u201d Kiba chuckled triumphantly as he gently rubbed Naruto\u2019s shrunken form into his sweaty foot. The blond demon host screamed and shouted muffled curses as Kiba\u2019s massive feet easily overpowered him. After several seconds Kiba parted his feet and snorted out a laugh when he saw the smaller male glued face-first into his sole. Naruto growled with frustration as he pushed against the giant\u2019s foot, peeled himself off, and fell back onto his butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026son of a bitch!\u201d cursed Naruto as brushed off his orange and black jacket; the fabric wet with his comrade\u2019s perspiration. He glared up at Kiba; his eyes shaking in his head as they met Kiba\u2019s amused ones. This was bad\u2026Kiba was beginning to take advantage of him! He just knew this would happen! Naruto bit his lip as he watched Kiba point at his foot while wiggling his toes; it seemed he still wanted his foot sniffed. The shrunken jinch\u016briki\u2019s mind raced to find some means of escaping this predicament: making a run for it, attacking Kiba, trying reason with him\u2026none seemed likely to work. \u201cF-Fine\u2026\u201d Naruto\u2019s voice was full of reluctance as he temporarily gave into Kiba\u2019s demand. He just hoped this was a one-time deal...or else he was in for a LOOOOONG trip home. The seated ninja watched through slit-like pupils as the mini Naruto approached his bare foot. The spiky-haired blond pressed himself against the flat, warm sole like it was a wall or something and gave it a long whiff. Immediately the Uzumaki\u2019s  face went pale and he started hacking and coughing. It was so foul! When Kiba had pressed him against it he had held his breath, but now that he was purposely smelling the foot\u2026it reeked so bad! Naruto was truly thankful Kurama's presence didn't give him an enhanced, canine sense of smell like Kiba's. If it had...he'd probably be dead right now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s it smell?\u201d Kiba asked innocently as he peered down at Naruto. Instead of answering him, Naruto continued to gag and nurse his burning nostrils. Narrowing his eyes, Kiba brought his other foot closer to the shrunken Leaf ninja once more and used a single toe to press the 16 year-old\u2019s head against the ball of his foot. He smirked toothily as he heard Naruto\u2019s squeaky complaints and felt him trying to push away from his mighty feet. For a while Kiba kept him like that; forcing the young Hokage wannabe to breathe in his rank foot odor. Eventually he drew his toe back and allowed Naruto to fall to the ground; covering his nose with both hands as tears dripped down his stinging eyes. \u201cHow\u2019s. It. Smell?\u201d Kiba asked once more as he threatened the smaller male by hanging his perspiring soles over his collapsed form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you think it smells?!\u201d Naruto yelled back as he picked himself up onto his knees and used his orange sleeves to wipe sweat off his handsome mug. \u201cIt smells like you've been stepping in dog crap all day! I\u2019ll ask again: when was the last time you washed those things?!\u201d The young man suddenly pointed a finger at one of Kiba\u2019s sandals. \u201cAnd what about those?! I almost feel sorry for them\u2026they must be rotten on the inside!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeez, Naruto. I had no idea you were such a clean freak.\u201d Kiba replied as he scratched the back of his brown-topped head. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

I'm the hero of our village, I saved it from Pain and the Akatsuki! I'm 100 more times stronger than you! Cleaning sandals is a slave's job, and I'm---\" \"You should look at your size before deciding whose job this is, Naruto.\" Kiba laughed as he interrupted the blond before he could finish. \"You can't do this, Kiba! I thought you were my friend!\" Naruto frowned as he looked at the towering Inuzuka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, hold on Naruto! I AM your friend... but can't a guy have some fun once in a while? Besides, before talking about friends, you'd best not forget that you were the one who hurt Akamaru!\" Kiba replied. \"You know that was an accident Kiba!\" Naruto retaliated. \"Look Naruto, I'm your friend, but that doesn't mean I can't boss ya a bit. If I wasn't your friend, I would've just stepped on you the moment I saw you like this!\" Kiba said, as he crossed his legs. \"Yeah, and you didn't, because you thought it would be much more profitable for your ego if you \"boss me a bit\" by making me your slave!\" Naruto responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba sighed before looking at the shrunken Naruto with a smirk. \"Ok, you got me. I've always been in your shadow, like the rest of the rookies. But thing is, while the rest of the rookies accepted that, I never did! It always pissed me off, how you, the class clown who couldn't even make one clone, not only beat me during the chunin exams, but also became the village's hero! You got trained by a legendary sannin for three years, while I spent all that time training with Shino and Hinata. It's not that I regret it, but I mean... c'mon! THAT is so unfair!\" Kiba complained. \"Jeez Kiba, I knew you envied me, but this much?!\" Naruto stared at the Inuzuka giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, THIS much! And now with everything that happened... heh, well... it's like a dream come true for me! So Naruto...\" Kiba spoke as he reached down for Naruto, grabbing him in his fist. Using his other hand, he grabbed one of his sandals and brought it closer to him. \"Time for some sandal service!\" Kiba chuckled as he gently placed Naruto on the sandal's opening. The small blond had to pinch his nose right after, as the terrible smell of Kiba's feet overcame him. \"What are you waiting for, Naruto? Don't make me do something you really wouldn't like...\" Kiba threatened. \"H-How am I supposed to clean them?!!\" Naruto asked. \"Well, unless you know a good Water Style jutsu... I guess you should use your tongue...\" Kiba laughed. Naruto grimaced, but he definitely didn't want Kiba to do \"something he wouldn't like\". But he still had to avoid being humiliated like this. As if luck was on his side, he noticed that Kiba had just started to rub his tired feet, and was too busy to look at him right now. The blond quickly used this moment to create a single shadow clone. Just as it appeared, he quickly managed to jump off the sandal, and hide behind the tree's side. \"Wow, I can't believe I pulled that off! Now's my chance to escape!\" Naruto thought, as he began to dash away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis clone on the other hand was left with the unlucky task of obeying Kiba's orders and cleaning his sandal. \"Ugh, this better be worth it...\" the clone grimaced as he got on his knees and began to lick the insole of Kiba's sweaty sandal. The clone nearly threw up as it licked the sweat... as if that wasn't enough, there was also the powerful smell it had to endure. \"Aaah, that's so much better!\" Kiba relaxed as he rubbed his own feet. He returned his attention to the shrunken Naruto inside his sandal, who had began to work. \"Yeah, lick it all up, Naruto! Don't forget you have another sandal to clean!\" Kiba chuckled. \"Hey, why don't you make some clones to help you? I'd be easier to do your job... I guess.\" Kiba chuckled again. \"No, it's ok like this...\" the clone responded among licks, fearful that Kiba might find out the truth. \"That wasn't a suggestion, Naruto! I wanna see some clones... now!\" Kiba ordered as he stomped his foot. The clone didn't respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, did you hear what I said?!\" Kiba asked as he smashed his heel onto the opposite side of the sandal, tilting it and sending the clone flying in the air. \"Damn!!\" the clone muttered as it poofed away. Kiba stared dumbfounded. \"What the---\" he stood up and began to look around. \"You think you can trick me?\" Kiba spoke aloud. Using his sensitive nose, he began to sniff around for the tiny Naruto, but for some reason, he could hardly sense his smell. \"Damn, there are all kinds of scents in this forest.\" Kiba cursed as he looked around. \"The only distinct smell I can make out in here is that of my feet... hey, wait a second!\" Kiba snapped his fingers. There was a really faint smell like that of his feet, but much weaker. Naruto had spent some time around them, so he had soaked some of the smell. Thinking fast and not even putting his sandals on, he began to follow the faint scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of his size, the shrunken fox boy hadn't gotten far. In fact, he had merely gotten just a few meters away. \"Damn, that was way too quick!\" the fox boy cursed, as he realized his shadow clone was already dispelled. It only took a couple of minutes, before Kiba noticed something orange running amid the green grass blades. It was easy to notice. \"You're pretty fast for your size!\" Kiba remarked as he quickly bent down and scooped the fleeing Naruto into his fist. \"Ugh, let me go, Kiba!\" the fox boy hissed as he was squeezed in Kiba's tight fist. \"If you had just done your task, we would've gotten along, Naruto! But now you made me realize that I should mark you with my smell first...\" Kiba spoke as he got back to his spot, next to the tree and his sandals. \"Heh, I think you should spend some time in my own prison! That oughta teach ya a lesson!\" Kiba laughed as he dropped the shrunken Naruto into the sandal his clone didn't clean. \"Wait, you'll crush me...!\" Naruto gulped as he saw Kiba beginning to insert his giant foot in.

It was only when his thick, muscular toes passed over him that Naruto snapped out of his daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-No\u2026!\u201d Naruto blurted out as he rolled onto his stomach and tried to crawl out toward the sandal\u2019s front opening. His bright, blue eyes were wide with the fear of being crushed like a bug in his friend\u2019s sandal. It was too late for an escape attempt, however; before the blond could move a centimeter toward freedom, Kiba\u2019s warm foot fitted into the sandal completely and his shrunken form was sealed between the sweaty rubber of the sandal and the equally sweaty sole of the giant\u2019s foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe\u2026I can\u2019t believe I have you in my sandal.\u201d Kiba mumbled as he flexed and curled his toes with content. \u201cThis is awesome.\u201d The larger shinobi licked his lips as he felt Naruto squirm for dear life under the ball of his foot. He felt just like an unlucky cockroach in the wrong place at the wrong time. Normally, this would be the part where he crushed the gross, foreign life form in his footwear, however\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cU-Ugh\u2026not like this\u2026! I can\u2019t\u2026die here!\u201d Naruto grunted as he squirmed and writhed in this smelly, hot, limited space. His handsome face was on its side and being squeezed into a goofy expression against his will. No matter how much strength he put into his struggles, he had no hope of moving the mountain that was Kiba Inuzuka. Naruto tried calming down and breathing and realized something. Kiba was standing on him\u2026pressing down on him like everyone\u2019s feet pressed down on the Earth\u2026and he was still alive. Naruto dug his nails into the baked skin of the dog ninja\u2019s sole and pushed. To his surprise, it wasn\u2019t like a big boulder or a brick wall\u2026Kiba\u2019s soft flesh was actually pushed away a few millimeters from his face. The young giant\u2019s foot was a lot more malleable than he was expecting!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder what all the guys back home would think if I told them our future Hokage almost pissed himself.\u201d Kiba taunted from above; directing a smirk down at his foot he knew the blond couldn\u2019t see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Shut up!\u201d Naruto shouted as he struck the thick, wet skin above him with a coiled fist. \u201cI wasn\u2019t scared, mutt!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh please. I could smell your fear from up here, runt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026okay\u2026well I wasn\u2019t &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; scared! Now let me out right now, Kiba!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPfft, no way.\u201d was the brown-haired ch\u016bnin\u2019s response as he started walking; his other sandal comfortably on his other foot. As he raised his foot into the air, Naruto felt like the world was moving before Kiba\u2019s sandal touched the grassy ground. Blades of green were mashed under his trends and Naruto was mashed underneath his sweaty sole; pain coursing through his body as the flesh of Kiba\u2019s foot momentarily molded around his tiny form. It only lasted a second before the foot was lifted back into the air\u2026and came back down a second later. \u201cYou\u2019re staying in there until you\u2019re marked with my scent. Hehe\u2026I\u2019m gonna turn your natural smell into my foot odor, Naruto! Then you\u2019ll never be able to escape me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026ugh\u2026way\u2026!\u201d Naruto grunted between strides as Kiba pounded him underfoot with each step he took. Kiba couldn\u2019t seriously be planning on changing his natural body odor, could he?! That was impossible\u2026he was just joking or exaggerating! Or being plain dumb! No matter how much of the mutt\u2019s rank foot sweat soaked through his clothes\u2026no matter how much his warm sole brushed against his body\u2026it\u2019s nothing a long bath couldn\u2019t fix! \u2026right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026I\u2019m pretty sure this way will get us out of this forest and into a nearby town.\u201d Kiba spoke to himself as he strolled south through the dense woods. Looking up at the sky, Kiba guessed the sun would be going down in a few more hours. If he didn\u2019t get out of here before then, the two of them would have to spend the night beneath the trees. The teenager grimaced as he touched his abdominals hidden beneath his black jacket. \u201cI really hope we reach the town before nightfall. I could go for a nice, hot meal and a warm bed\u2026\u201d Kiba\u2019s slit-like pupils glanced at his pocket where he was keeping some of their rations. \u201cEven beef jerky gets boring after a while.\u201d </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ugh, I hope I find the town before the sun sets. I'm seriously hungry...\" Kiba remarked as he patted his jacket-covered abdominals. Inside his sweaty sandal, the shrunken Naruto felt like he was about to be flattened under Kiba's sweaty sole. \"Ugh, l-let me, ou--\" the tiny Uzumaki couldn't finish as the sole lowered on him once again, pressing him into the insole of Kiba's sandal. Naruto felt like he was about to throw up, the smell was terrible, it was sweaty and tight in the sandal. He could feel his lips being pressed into the bottom Kiba's foot, tasting a salty and sweaty taste. As if that wasn't enough, the fact that Kiba was literally walking on him was having a devastating effect on Naruto's ego.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the village's hero, and here I am about to get crushed under Kiba's foot... of all the people, I can't believe I'm losing to him! That mutt... if I was my normal size, I'd crush him... but like this.....!!\" Naruto cursed in his thoughts as Kiba continued to stomp on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before Kiba finally made it to a nearby town. The walking was actually less than the distance he had walked during the entire day before his rest, but all of it was worth it, as he noticed a small dango-like shop. \"Eh, I really wanted something more... meaty, but I guess I'll have to settle with dango for now...\" the young Inuzuka member shrugged as he walked up to it. Having ordered a dango, Kiba briefly sat on a bench to consume it. Inside his sandal confinement, Naruto felt the pressure on him begin to lessen as Kiba sat down. The pressure was reduced enough, so he could actually move a bit. Doing his best, the shrunken fox boy managed to slide himself along the sandal towards the opening. \"Hehe, I dunno what you're doing in there, but it tickles...\" Kiba snickered as he ate his dango.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahg, this is as further as I can go...\" Naruto remarked as he slid underneath Kiba's toes, which were now lightly pressing down on his whiskered face. \"H-help!!\" the young fox boy screamed, as he managed to poke his arm outside. \"Wha---\" Kiba nearly spew out what he ate, as he heard Naruto and saw a tiny arm poking out between his toes. Reacting quickly, the Inuzuka member quickly looked around, before taking care of the problem. Naruto felt the pressure on him increase more than ever, as Kiba clenched his toes, and used them to row the shrunken Naruto back inside the sandal. Naruto grimaced, as Kiba once again pressed his giant sole down on him, but Naruto wasn't about to give up as he attemped to force his position back to how it was. \"Oh no you don't!\" Kiba frowned, as he began to gently twist his foot into the sandal. He was careful not to crush the little Uzumaki, as he pressed down. \"Ack!!\" Naruto squaked, as he felt his tiny body start to compress underneath Kiba's smelly foot. The pressure that Kiba's giant foot applied on his small head was too much, and he lost consciousness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Kiba felt the tiny Naruto under his foot become limp. He couldn't help but give his lips a quick lick as he supressed the Leaf's hero. \"Dang, I can't believe I'm actually doing this to him. I never thought that jutsus which can reduce an opponent's size could be so effective! I'm definitely going to develop a jutsu like this myself when I get back to the village, heheh...\" Kiba snickered as he finished eating his dango. \"Well, time to go get a room for the night!\" Kiba announced as he stood up, and began walking towards the nearest inn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=================================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the door behind him, Kiba settled himself into the room where he was going to spend the night. \"I can finally take a seat!\" Kiba sighed as he sat on the bed, the mattress creaking underneath his weight. Bending down, he began to take off his sandals. \"Aaah, that's the stuff!\" Kiba sighed in delight as the powerful smell hat his tired feet emanated began to drift across the room. \"Where is---\" Kiba began to wonder as he didn't see Naruto in his sandal, but that wonder was quickly ceazed as he noticed the shrunken fox boy pressed into his sole. Kiba grinned, as he used two fingers to pluck the shrunken Naruto out of his sole and gently set him down on the ground. It was at that point, that the young fox boy began to regain consciousness. \"Ugh, what is this terrible smell... and why is it so bright?\" Naruto asked, still dazed. It didn't take long however, before he quickly remembered the situation he was in. He grit his teeth, as he noticed a giant Kiba grinning down at him. \"Ugh, I stink like your freaking feet, Kiba!!\" Naruto should out in anger, as he grimaced. \"The smell is probably going to last for a few days! Just until I have to put you in my sandal again~\" Kiba laughed, pleased with the results of his \"marking\". \"Where the hell are we?!\" the furious Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, calm down, Naruto. It's not like I ate your ramen... anyways, we're in a inn that we're going to spend the night at.\" Kiba explained. \"Good, then this is the perfect place where I can crush you!\" Naruto barked back. \"By the way, I decided that I'm going to keep you like this. With you out of the way, I can finally become Hokage!\" Kiba grinned. \"No, no, no!! I'm SO much stronger than you, you have absolutely no chance against me!!\" Naruto shook his head in anger. \"Oh yeah, how DID you beat Pain by the way? I heard you learned something new, but I have no idea what exactly...\" Kiba pondered, ignoring Naruto's claims. \"Yeah, after everything you did, I'm SO going to use Sage Mode on you!\" Naruto stated as he sat down, crossing his legs, and starting to gather natural energy. \"Uh... Sage Mode? What the hell is that...?\" Kiba asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before Naruto stood up, and opened his eyes, revealing an orange shade around them, along with froggy-golden eyes. \"What the... is that some sort of visual jutsu?!\" Kiba asked, getting more confused by the second. \"You stupid mutt! In Sage Mode, my strength is far greater, as well as my stamina!! I lifted one of Pain's rhinos with ease, and my body is almost as hard as steel! I fell off a cliff like this, and even though it hurt, I was all right!\" Naruto explained. \"Wait, wait a second! So... you mean to say, that while you're like this, you can endure anything?\" Kiba asked. \"Yeah, and even at this size, I'll still kick your ass!!\" Naruto replied back. \"So I can crush you... without actually crushing you? Without you dying?\" Kiba asked again. \"If my body is hard as steel, then what the hell do you think it means?!\" Naruto retaliated. \"It means... that I'm finally going to get the chance to defeat you, plus take the Hokage title for myself! And it also means that I'm going to have a good time crushing you under my big feet... in all sorts of ways~\" Kiba laughed as he stood up to his full height, the tiny Sage Naruto being as tall as his... ankle. The towering Kiba loomed over the shrunken sage. \"We're going to battle for the Hokage title and I'm going to use my feet to squash you flat!\" Kiba grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto took a slight step back, as he looked up at the grinning giant Inuzuka, Kiba's large feet booming across the wooden floor. \"I-I'm going to be the Hokage, and I'll never give up!!\" the shrunken Naruto stated his resolve. \"Hehehheheh, you'll give up alright...\" Kiba licked his lips as he grinned down maliciously at his tiny opponent.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the dog boy was threateningly heading towards the Naruto, he prepared with all his might to face him, quickly concentrated his Sage Mode to form a protective shield around his body. He was not intimidated by the heavy stamping that the Inuzuka boy was doing over the wooden floor and remained calm once his huge feet slammed on both sides of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right runt! So, you think your Toad Mode will save you from me, huh? Well, now you'll face my feet to find out, you pesky bug!\u201d Kiba shouted as he lifted his right foot, placed it on the tiny boy and began to bring it down on him. Naruto immediately raised his arms, held the foot and kept it from falling down over him. Kiba pushed his foot harder, but seeing that Naruto was holding it with his hands, he said: \u201cNice try, Naruto, but do you really think that'll stop me?\u201d \u201cOf course! and as soon as I'm free I'm going to knock you out, Kiba!\u201d The Uzumaki boy replied with absolute confidence, Kiba grumbled slightly, but recovered and said threateningly: \u201cDo you really think you can hit me? Oh, come on! Before you can even do a jutsu, I'll have you under my feet!\u201d Then Kiba had an idea and started moving his other foot towards Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was using all his strength to get rid of Kiba\u2019s foot, the thought of being crushed by the dog boy's sweaty sole made him sick, especially as he imagined what Kiba might do to him afterwards. So he kept trying to lift his foot to slip away, when suddenly something hit him in the back, Naruto turned to see what happened and found nothing less than the huge toes of Kiba\u2019s other foot, which kicked him again and made him lose his concentration, something that the boy dog took advantage of to plunge his right foot against him, which caused his arms to wobble due to the pressure. Worried to see that Kiba\u2019s foot had descended further towards him, Naruto tried to raise his arms again but another kick from the left toes stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got you, runt!\u201d chuckled the dog boy. \u201cI just have to use my toes to knock you down and your ridiculous Toad Mode will be smashed under my foot, but I don't think you want that, so I'll make you a proposal: All you have to do is massage my feet for a while and in return I'll leave you alone the whole night.\u201d he said as he bent his foot until his toes brushed against Naruto\u2019s face. \u201cSo what do you say, buddy? Do you want to start with my left foot or do you prefer the right one?\u201d Kiba asked, waiting for the answer. Annoyed by this, Naruto used his right arm to hit the big toes that were holding him down. \u201cNone of them, you idiot! I'll never do anything as disgusting as rubbing your filthy feet, mutt!\u201d He replied as he tried to remove the toes that were clutching his body. \u201cWhat a shame runt, you asked for it, now you'll feel the power of my mighty feet over your puny little body!\u201d The Inuzuka boy said with a wicked smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom that point, Naruto began to be attacked by the Kiba\u2019s left toes, which began to pull him sideways. Knowing he'd try to take him down with them, he hurried to hold the right foot back with both arms, but as soon as he had done it, the strong toes released his body and struck him on the back again, causing his arms to wobble and the huge sole of the right foot slumped further over him. This was not compared to the previous enemies that the boy had faced before, because in addition to its large size, Kiba\u2019s heavy feet were coordinating themselves in order to crush him; Something that should be very funny for the boy dog, but for him meant a humiliating torture he had never faced before. All this went through Naruto\u2019s mind as he confronted two rivals: The massive sole that threw all its weight into his arms and the big toes that kicked him over and over looking for his weakest point. Finally, after a while of struggling, Naruto reached his limit and as soon as the toes kicked him again, his arms collapsed, the huge sole knocked him down and as soon as he fell on the floor, Kiba took advantage and put both feet together. \u201cAt last I brought down this fool! Let\u2019s see if he wants to fight back.\u201d Kiba thought as he sat down on his bed anxious to see Naruto\u2019s reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, Naruto recovered from Kiba\u2019s footfall and saw with horror that he was in the middle of his feet. After pinching his nose to avoid the stench as much as possible, he looked for an escape route and when he saw a little light at one end he began to crawl there, unaware that Kiba could feel it moving underneath him, when he got to where the light was he began to crawl out, but when he was halfway out something heavy knocked him down and kept him from moving forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere do you think you're going, Naruto? I've barely had any fun with you.\u201d Kiba said as he held the little ninja pinned under his toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think I'm your toy? Naruto replied by turning red in anger and trying to keep crawling out of the Inuzuka boy's feet. \u201cI have trained more than you, I am a better ninja than you and even with this size I can beat you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're brave Naruto, but I think you still don't know your place, maybe a little pressure will clear your head!\u201d The dog boy replied and clenched his toes against Naruto\u2019s body to drag him back under his feet. Naruto tried to resist but Kiba\u2019s muscular toes were too strong and after several bumps they dropped in front of his head and squeezed together so that the boy couldn't escape. Soon the Uzumaki boy began to be overwhelmed by the stench of Kiba\u2019s feet, which seemed to have increased in the last few minutes, and that's when he announced:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to my torture chamber, Naruto! Now that I have you trapped you have two choices, either give me a good massage or you will be tortured by my powerful feet, and I assure you that being crushed is not the only way I can torture you buddy. So, what do you say, runt?\u201d Kiba finished as he began rubbing his sweaty soles against Naruto\u2019s body.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The best thing he could do was to agree with the stubborn ninja and once he left him alone, he could look for a chance to escape. He disliked the idea of being forced to lick his feet, but it was definitely better than being crushed among them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine Kiba, you win. I\u2019ll lick your feet!\u201d The Uzumaki boy finally said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you finally understood where you belong!\u201d Kiba replied proud of himself as he released the mini ninja. \u201cAnd now, get to work!\u201d He finished by sitting on the floor and dropping his two feet right in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto approached one of the huge masses in front of him and began to lick it from the bottom up. The taste was disgusting, due to the excess sweat that had gathered over the skin and there was some grime built up amid the wrinkles of the foot. However, the tiny ninja kept licking the foot to prevent the giant from crushing him. Once he finished with the heel and began to lick the arch, Kiba told him:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow I want you to get in between my toes!\u201d And after pressing his other foot against Naruto, he pushed him up to the height of his toes. \u201cClean them up completely!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe space between the giant's toes was gross, there was a lot of crud gathered in that space and the stench was so bad that even with his nose covered, Naruto started to get dizzy. But as he was being held under the toes of the other foot, he had no choice but to get in the middle of each of the toes and clean them. \u201cAt least he didn't tell me to lick this!\u201d The poor ninja thought as he picked up the crud with his hands and threw it away. After several minutes he finished and once Kiba noticed his work, he picked up Naruto with his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right Naruto, that\u2019s enough for today! Tomorrow you\u2019ll continue with my other foot.\u201d He said on his way to bed, but instead of tossing him there, he opened a drawer on the nightstand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, what are you doing? You said you'd let me sleep!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake it easy, buddy. I just want to ensure you don't run away from me!\u201d Kiba said, putting a pillow inside the drawer and after throwing Naruto as well, he closed it and set a chair next to the nightstand to jam it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI've never felt so good as today, I can't wait to keep teasing this puny kid. Tomorrow I\u2019ll think of more ideas to torment him just in case he doesn't want to obey me, but for now I'd like to take a break!\u201d It was the last thought of the Inuzuka boy before falling asleep, confident that tomorrow he would have the fox boy at his service for another day of enjoyment.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Since he claimed he was so tough he was just going to see if the squirt of ninja could live up to his bragging. He hands reached down and snatched Naruto up. His eyes looking him over as the Sage thrashed about. He did have to admit it was harder to keep him in place, but then again, with his size it was hardly any effort to overpower him. \u201clet\u2019s just test that sage endurance idiot.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeep reached into his first bag and pulled out a the gauze. Naruto started to squirm more, not sure what Kiba was going to show him who was strongest in the village regardless of size. He put his hand out a started to form a Rasenshuriken. He could feel his charka form from his stomach into his fingertips. He concentrated on shaping the chakra until it was a large sphere with four points protruding. Kiba stood his ground confident he would be okay, but there was the thought at the back of his mind, he saw this thing tossed at Pein and it packed a punch. Kiba wasn\u2019t going to give his dwarfed comrade the pleasure. Naruto chucked it at Kiba with a grin on his face. \u201cHow do you like that dog breath?\u201d As Naruto prepared to toss the jutsu Kiba let out a large breath having Naruto misaim the attack. It curved, hitting the wall with a small pop, and leaving a small hole in its wake. \u201cWh-what!?\u201d Naruto exclaimed tired from tossing an attack like that. He wanted it to knock his capture on the ground so he could escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba let out a laugh. \u201cHa that was a nice little bug bite of an attack, but it\u2019s crap if you can\u2019t hit. You know you do make me want to train harder Naruto\u201d Kiba said as he pulled the gauze up. He placed Naruto on his foot and began to bind him there. Naruto was once again pushed up against Kiba\u2019s smelly feet. He arms were bound between the bandages unable to make another jutsu. His movement was only marginally really only pushing millimeter into the soft sole of Kiba\u2019s foot. \u201cHow do you like it in there?\u201d Kiba put his sandal on wondering how he can take advantage of Naruto\u2019s increased toughness. Only muffled screams came from his foot. \u201cCan\u2019t hear you, but I should work harder if I am going to be Hokage someday. I think I will go on a run right now wanna come with me? Ha.\u201d Like that he was out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted to make sure the sweat really set in Naruto. He ran at fully speed feeling the hardness of the mini ninja in his sandal was felt, but it wasn\u2019t enough to deter him. Kiba ran up trees, sprint down around building and all a good bit of warm ups Kurenai would have him do. For Naruto, this was hell. Each step, jump and stomp pushed him into Kiba sole. His foot was going overtime on sweat this time drenching him and the bandage holding him there in sweat. The smell was over powering. The rank smell in concert with the rhythm of stomping was making him woozy. He tried to yell for Kiba to let up but all that did was get his mouth pushed against the sole, giving him a mouth full of disgusting foot sweat. His head was in a daze, and his nostril burned. Kiba could feel the movement slowing, knowing he had won this show of dominance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only a half hour of punishment but Naruto was on the fringes of consciousness. Kiba took off his sandal unwrapping the bandage looking at Naruto. \u201cHow did you like that?\u201d He took a sniff, the twerp and his feet were nearly indistinguishable this would do until he could permanently mark him, he would reek for a while. Naruto looked daze as he made eye contact with Kiba\u2019s giant face. \u201cWhat\u2026no I don\u2019t want any more Ramen too salty.\u201d Naruto mumbled. It got Kiba to snicker and replace the bandage. The great sage could sleep there on his foot overnight. Kiba got ready for bed and laid down as Naruto eventually lost his battle with consciousness.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The best thing would be to escape from him and find a way to reach the village by himself, Naruto began to move his arms and managed to free them from the bandages, which had loosened during the night, he began to search through his clothes until he found one of his sharpened-tipped kunai\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect, now I just have to be careful that Kiba doesn't catch me running away.\" Naruto thought and began to cut the bandages in front of him very carefully, fortunately the fabric wasn't hard to break and gradually the boy made his way through the layers of bandage. After making an opening large enough to fit through, Naruto crawled slowly through it and began to slide out of Kiba's foot, suddenly he felt a shake and freaked out thinking that the dog boy was waking up, but it was only his foot that tilted to the side, which helped Naruto as it rested right over the surface of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Naruto fell on the bed he went to the nearest edge, looked around the room for an exit and found a sliding door a few steps from him. He used the bed sheet as a support to climb down and when he reached the floor he made his way to the door, taking care not to make any noise while walking on the wooden floor and looking back every few steps to make sure Kiba was still asleep. After a while he managed to get to the door, slid it just enough to fit in and walked out to an outside corridor adjacent to a small forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this is better than I expected, what kind of place is this?\" Naruto wondered when he saw the little forest in front of him: It had dense vegetation composed mostly of dense trees and some fruit plants, a lagoon with a waterfall, some mounds of earth here and there and even some benches for guests. Because he hadn't eaten since the day before and seeing that the sun hadn't risen yet, Naruto thought it would be best to eat something to regain strength, take a bath in the little lake and then leave. The mini ninja walked through the bushes looking for food, soon discovered several fruits scattered on the ground, so he began to eat them very happily until he was satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter resting for a while to let his body process everything he had eaten, Naruto made his way to the small lake, when he reached the shore he put his hand in the water and when he felt that it was at a pleasant temperature he threw himself into the lake with his clothes on to get rid of Kiba's sweat. After a quick dip, Naruto took off his clothes, left them hanging on some branches to let them dry and returned to the lake to swim for a while and clean himself. He was so calm floating on the warm water and surrounded by the soothing sounds of the little forest that he didn't realize that the sun was starting to rise on the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=================================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside a nearby room Kiba was starting to wake up, he had had a completely satisfying night, because after several days of exhausting research, he had finally found the plant he needed to cure his dog and besides that Naruto had become his personal slave, although he had been through a couple of casualties, that had not affected him at all, for now he was only thinking of returning to the Leaf Village and keep taking revenge on his new toy along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, Naruto. How was your night in there?\u201d Kiba said thinking that a lot of the runt's complaints and insults would reach his ears, yet there was no response. Believing that Naruto was still asleep, he began to shake his foot to wake him up. \u201cGet up now or you'll start the day sandwiched between my feet!\u201d The Inuzuka boy threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEY! ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME, YOU USELESS PIECE OF...?\u201d Kiba shouted as he looked at his right foot and discovered with horror that the Uzumaki boy had escaped from his sole. Clearly pissed off, he started looking for him all over the room, peeked under the bed, shuffled around the nightstand drawers and even went into the closet to make sure he wasn't hiding there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot finding the mini ninja he sat down on the now messy bed and began to look carefully around the room. \u201cDamn, for some reason I can't smell him, where has this bastard gone?\u201d Kiba thought worried, then he heard a faint sound of water and in searching for its source he found out the small gap in the sliding door, stuck his nose in and after sniffing a bit he got the unmistakable trace of Naruto. \u201cI got you now, Naruto. Soon I'll make you pay for trying to run away from me.\u201d Kiba said greedily as he put his sandals back on, then opened the door and stepped out to catch him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto was still resting in the pond when he heard Kiba\u2019s loud screaming, quickly got out of the water and grabbed his clothes, they were still wet but the fox boy didn't care. He had to get dressed and run when otherwise he would be caught by the giant ninja and he would torture him even more for escaping from his foot. Once dressed, Naruto hurried into the forest, hoping to get away from the dog boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba stepped out of the room and looked around, not finding Naruto he sniffed around and within seconds he found his faint scent just a short distance from him, so he stepped on the grass and began stepping towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got you, Naruto! You\u2019ll pay for running away from me!\u201d Kiba shouted, stomping heavily on the ground and causing his big sandals to fill with mud and debris at every step. However, this didn't matter to the giant boy, he wanted to catch Naruto as soon as possible, so he began to walk faster and soon he saw a well-known orange jacket moving through the grass in the backyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto saw Kiba\u2019s huge black sandals stomping towards him and fearing to be crushed beneath their rubbery soles he began to seek a hideout. Near him he saw a small cave where he could get into and he ran with all his strength to get to the entrance, barely managed to get into the cave in time but unfortunately the Inuzuka boy could see him getting in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo now you're hiding from me, huh?\u201d Kiba said as he bent down and stuck his hand in the cave to capture Naruto, who at the sight of the huge hand coming in decided to step further into the cave to avoid getting caught. The Inuzuka boy stuck his whole arm in, but he couldn\u2019t close his fingers around Naruto, who was only inches away from him. \u201cWell, so you'd rather run away from me than fight, Naruto. What a wimpy ninja you have become!\u201d The giant boy teased hoping to make Naruto came out on his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see what I'm made of, filthy mutt!\u201d Naruto said upset and after several hand movements, he made a Rasenshuriken and tossed it to the cave entrance where it collided with the open hand of the Inuzuka boy, who immediately felt severe pain and had to pull his arm out of the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll pay for this, jerk!\u201d Kiba shouted as he saw his hand burned by Naruto\u2019s attack, he was very pissed. \u201cI'll make sure you can't escape me, you'll see!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto thought that after his attack Kiba wouldn\u2019t try to attack him again, but he was very wrong. The giant boy was pondering about how to force him out of the cave, but he couldn't figure out anything good, he got pissed off and in a burst of rage he kicked the mountain where the cave was. Since Kiba had his sandals on he didn't hurt his foot, in fact when he saw the dirt that his sandal had torn off, he discovered that the small mountain wasn\u2019t very tough, a few strong kicks would be enough to knock it down, so with a smirk on his face he got ready for the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better get ready for this, Naruto! Because I'm coming for you!\u201d Kiba said and started kicking the cave repeatedly. Naruto worried, as with every kick the Inuzuka boy gave the entire cave began to shatter and dirt fell on him. \u201cYou decide Naruto, get out right now or you'll be trapped inside the cave!\u201d Kiba threatened as he kept smashing the mountain the mini ninja was on with his sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto was frightened, he had backed off until he bumped against the bottom of the cave, which kept shaking violently because of the ramming that the Inuzuka boy's sandals were were giving it. Every time Kiba kicked the mountain his huge sandal was getting deeper into the cave, taking a good amount of ground with it and Naruto could see how the boy's thick toes were getting closer and closer to him. If he didn't get out of there he would be caught by them, so when he saw that Kiba took his sandal out from the cave to get ready for another kick, Naruto took the chance and rushed out. But he wasn't fast enough to escape Kiba, who saw him coming out and quickly trapped him in his fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got you, you idiot! You thought you could get away from me, huh? Well, now you'll pay for that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba hurried back to his room, relieved that no one had seen him or Naruto during his escape attempt. Once inside, he sat down on the floor with both of his sandals on, he intended to use them to give the stubborn ninja a lesson he would never forget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me out Kiba!\" Naruto said as he tried to free himself from the tight fist when suddenly the big hand opened. Nato fell a bit but before he reached the ground his right leg was grabbed by the fingers of the giant boy, who was looking at him with an evil grimace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you think you're smart, don\u2019t you? You think I can\u2019t beat you, huh?  Well\u2026 Let me tell you that you\u2019re wrong! I\u2019ve smashed rocks bigger than you and you won\u2019t be the exception, Naruto!\u201d Kiba said as he positioned his sandals just below Naruto so that he could crush him between his outsoles once he released his leg. \u201cSo, get ready, tough guy! I'll give you a lesson so you can see who is the strongest ninja in the village!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo ahead, big mutt! You won't scare me!\u201d Naruto cried out proudly. \"Fine idiot! I\u2019m gonna have a lot of fun with you!\u201d Kiba shouted and as he released the mini ninja's leg, he began to push his sandaled feet together. Naruto rushed to gather energy from his Sage Mode around him to make a shield. Once the soles of his two sandals bumped against each other Kiba pressed his feet a bit tighter so there would be no gaps between them and Naruto got imprisoned within the bottoms of his huge sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's how you're gonna beat me? Come on Kiba! you haven't even tickled me!\u201d Naruto said mockingly. \u201cOh, really? Then you won't mind getting this!\u201d Kiba threatened and began rubbing his sandals together, causing the treads from both soles to slam into Naruto\u2019s body. At first this didn't affect the mini ninja; his Sage Mode shield absorbed all the beating from the Inuzuka boy's sandals and his body only rolled back and forth across its surface. But after a while Kiba began scrubbing his sandals with more pressure and this caused Naruto\u2019s shield to crack. \u201cOh no! My Sage Mode is running out! I must get out of here or I\u2019ll be crushed!\u201d Naruto thought worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba was in heaven, having the opportunity to crush Naruto with nothing less than his own feet was exciting him and once he sniffed the tiny boy's fear, a bulge began to grow in his crotch. \"Hehe! This was a great idea! The fool thought he would have a chance against me. I just have to wait for my sandals to beat him up and he'll end up surrendering to me!\" Kiba thought as he kept scrubbing the soles of his two sandals against the mini ninja, after a few minutes he decided to rest, but kept his feet pressed together to keep Naruto trapped within their sandaled bottoms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto thought Kiba had fallen asleep and decided to take the opportunity to escape from his stinky sandals. \u201cJust wait for me to get out of here, mutt!\u201d You're gonna pay for everything you did to me, I swear!\u201d The Uzumaki boy thought as he was crawling through the tight space among Kiba\u2019s massive sandals and looking for a way out, almost everything around him was blocked by the pressed treads from the edges of the two bottoms but in front of him he saw a gap big enough to pass through, so he headed there. What the Uzumaki boy didn't know, however, was that the giant boy had left that gap on purpose. With his powerful sense of smell he knew that the tiny ninja was crawling through his sandals to escape from them, so he decided to take care of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was about to reach the front gap to escape when he noticed that Kiba\u2019s massive sandals were squeezing back together. Scared of getting trapped he tried to rush in, but Kiba\u2019s hefty feet were faster and the gap was sealed between the rubber treads from both sandals as they pressed against each other. \u201cWere you going somewhere, Naruto? I don't think so!\u201d The dog boy threatened with a smirk and started scrubbing his huge sandals against Naruto, putting a lot of his strength upon his two feet to crush him. Naruto attempted to scream but the middle treads from the huge outsole smashed against his face, muffling his claims beneath its tough, rubbery surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cSorry, did you say something? I couldn't hear you, bug boy! Your pathetic struggles make me think you still want to fight, so\u2026 How about a fight against my sandals, Naruto? Let\u2019s see how good you are at facing just them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou haven't beaten me yet, you mutt! I\u2019m gonna kick your ass, Ki\u2026\u201d Naruto shouted in rage as he tried to make his way through the tight space in which he was trapped, but the rubbery treads from the two sandals began grinding his body harder. Naruto\u2019s shield could barely withstand the huge pressure applied on it, but Kiba wasn't satisfied yet. He wanted to wreck the Sage Shield once and for all so he tried a tough method: He split the soles of his sandals a bit from the Uzumaki boy but then he smashed them back against the mini ninja before he had a chance to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto got very dazed, the strong thud from the hard surface of Kiba\u2019s heavy sandals had taken him out of control and his Sage Mode shield kept breaking. The frightened boy kept looking for a way to break through but no matter where he moved, everything around him was blocked by the clenched treads from the edges of Kiba\u2019s massive sandals, who had fun playing with his mighty feet to keep the mini ninja trapped between its thick outsoles. If Naruto tried to move ahead, Kiba pressed his toes so that the tips of his sandals would crush him before he could escape, and if he tried to escape from the back, the giant boy squeezed his heels together to grind him with his back treads. But Kiba still didn't have enough, so he started scrubbing both of his feet against Naruto and his sandals tortured him in several ways: The thick outsoles took care of dragging him from one end to the other, gluing him onto its rubbery surface. The treads from the middle of his soles beat down on his body, filling it with all the filth that Kiba had crushed during his walk and the repeated beating from his feet kept increasing, causing Naruto to lose his concentration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of torturing the mini ninja with both of his sandals, Kiba heard a cracking sound, so he finally decided to pull his sandals apart and when he saw that Naruto\u2019s orange wave had disappeared, he knew that he had succeeded in breaking his Sage Mode. He let the weakened boy sit on the floor and after standing up he proudly spoke to him:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're pathetic, Naruto! Did you really think you had the strength to beat me? You couldn't even handle my sandals, so from now on you'll recognize that I'll be the new Hokage! Kiba said with a proud grin as he looked down at his defeated rival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
