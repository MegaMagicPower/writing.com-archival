When they finished, Jerry told them to keep practicing while he went and took care of something in the shop. Alex, like always, fell asleep during the lesson and was laying on the couch. Justin and Max decided to practice without her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, what spell should we practice?\" Justin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, how about the one where we can poof up popcorn.\" Max responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's stupid.\" Justin smirked and looked in the book for a different spell. \"Oh how about this one, a shrink spell.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, then I can find the ants that stole my cookie last week.\" Max replied. Justin just facepalmed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay so here it goes.\" Justin said as he prepared the spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Alex?\" Max asked as they both looked at her sleeping on the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. Not my problem that she'll fail the wizard exam. Okay let's do this.\" Justin answered. Then, he stated the spell, \"Shrinky dink, shrinky dank, shrinky dunk, shrinky us.\" And both Max and Justin started to shrink. \"It's working!\" He shouted. When it was finished they found themselves the size of 1 inch. They explored a bit. Max was having fun, but Justin got bored of being small. \"Alright Max that's enough, let's grow back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" he responded. Justin then stood still for a few seconds with a still look on his face. \"What wrong?\" Max asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have the spell to grow back!\" Justin panicked. Justin then thought of something. \"Alex!\" He thought of. He turned to the couch and looked up and saw her sleeping on the couch. They decide to get her help. Although Justin does not expect her full cooperation. She'll probably make fun of Justin for this situation. But they needed to grow back. Alex- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They entered and headed to her apartment. When they got to the apartment, Cody once again tried to stop Zack from doing it. But Zack ignored it. He aimed the remote and Cody and hit the button. He shrunk. He then aimed it at himself and did the same thing. After a few seconds. Both of them were around the size of an inch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice going. Now we're tiny.\" Cody whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you be quiet. Now hide behind the plant so no one sees us.\" Zack ordered. They both walked behind the plant and hid until Maddie came home. After around a half-hour waiting, they heard someone walking down the hall. Zack carefully peeked out to see who it was, and it was indeed Maddie. She was wearing her school uniform. She wore a blue plaid skirt, a school shirt, black knee high socks, and black loafers. She stopped at the door and reached for the key in her bag. She was gigantic compared to them. Zack used this opportunity to look up through her skirt to see her panties. He saw that she was wearing blue and white panties. He was in heaven and got an erection. It was such a beautiful sight. Meanwhile, Cody was fascinated by her feet. He secretly had a foot fetish, and was intrigued by her giant feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie got the key out of her bag and proceeded to open the door.

He knew it was wrong to cheat on Lisa, but that girl was so hot. But he made sure that Lisa wouldn't find out. After watching TV for awhile, he heard Lisa come into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey Lisa.\" Will said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey my big sexy man.\" Lisa blemished as she sat down next to Will. \"I brought you a homemade cookie. I used my secret ingredient.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mind if I do.\" Will said as he grabbed the cookie. He ate the cookie and it tasted delicious. \"Mmm delicious. What was the secret ingredient?\" Will asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some special shrinking nuts.\" she answered. Will was confused. \"I know you cheated on me last night, and now you will be punished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you-\" Will stopped speaking when he felt his stomach bubbling. He felt sick and dizzy. He felt himself spinning around. He was shrinking. Eventually he stopped shrinking at around an inch tall. Lisa stood up. Will looked up at how gigantic she was. She was looking down at him smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Will, how does it feel to be so tiny and weak?\" she mocked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Change me back!\" Will shouted but she couldn't hear him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no respect for women. I hope now you'll have respect for them considering one can easily end your pathetic little life.\" she said as she raised her right foot over his body. Will was scared and immediately ran for under the couch. Bam! Her foot came crashing down and Will barely avoided her giant shoe. He quickly got back up and ran under the couch. \"Aww come on Will, play with me.\" she said. Will was catching his breathe under the couch. He was scared of his situation. Lisa waited for Will to come out, but he didn't. \"Fine, I'll just wait till you want to play.\" She sat down on the couch and grabbed a magazine to read. She took off her shoes to get comfortable, revealing her red socks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill waited a few minutes to see if she'd do anything, but she didn't. She was still reading the magazine. Will didn't want to get her attention, but he had to. She was probably the only one that could help him. Perhaps if he apologized she would forgive him. Will walked out from under the couch. He looked up and she was busy reading. He tried yelling to get her attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo Lisa, I'm sorry, I made a terrible mistake!\" he shouted but she didn't hear him. He thought of other ways to get her attention. Perhaps if he tickled her feet she would notice. He walked closer to her feet. As he got closer, he could smell how awful the stench was. But he needed her attention. He started tickling her socked foot hoping she would feel it. She wiggled her toes and Will looked up. She put the magazine down and looked down at Will. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well well, what do we have here? A pesky little bug. You know what I do to little bugs like you, I squish 'em.\" she mocked Will. She stood up towering over Will. She lifted up her right foot over Will. She wiggled her toes, teasing him. Will stared at the giant foot and realized getting her help was useless. He tried running back under the couch. She slammed her foot causing Will to fall down. He quickly got up and busted under the couch. \"Aww come out little buggy, I just want to play.\" she teased. Will needed to escape. He-  </span></div></div>",

Then, a beam shot out and hit a football on the ground. The football disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" Max shouted. He got closer and saw that it didn't really disappear, but it shrunk to a tiny size. \"So this is a shrink ray.\" he thought to himself. He thought of what to do with it. Meanwhile, Carmen got home from school along with her friend Olivia. They were going to study. Max could hear them downstairs, and he got an idea. He aimed the gun at himself and pressed the button. He started shrinking. He left himself getting smaller and smaller and eventually he stopped at the size of an inch. He was going to spy on Olivia without getting caught. He ran out of his room. In the hall, Carmen and Olivia passed on their to Carmen's room. They were wearing their school uniforms. Max got a quick view up Olivia's skirt. He wanted to view it longer. He followed them. He obviously moved much slower, but he made it to Carmen's room safe. They were having a conversation but Max didn't pay attention to what they were saying. Olivia took her shoes off and sat down on the bed. Carmen did the same. Max ran closer. </span></div></div>",

They invited him to their house by making up an excuse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve arrived at the Tanner household around 4pm. Stephanie and Michelle were the only ones home. Steve entered through the kitchen. As soon as he entered, he noticed a slice of cake on the table. He looked around to see if anyone was nearby. Next, he grabbed the plate and started to eat it. He finished the whole piece. Afterwards, he started to feel funny. He got dizzy and blacked out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly woke up wondering what happened. He slowly opened his eyes to a giant pair of purple converses. He hesitantly looked up to see that those shoes belonged to Stephanie. But she was much bigger than him. He was like a bug compared to her. She was looking down at him with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Steve, how does it feel to be the tiny little man you truly are.\" She mocked. Steve turned around and tried to run away but was shocked by another pair of giant feet. He looked up and saw Michelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're in for a lot of fun Steve.\" Michelle said. Steve tried running away but was stopped by Stephanie's giant foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast.\" she said and picked him up. Steve was now in Stephanie's giant palm, while she had an evil grin on her face. Steve without hesitation decided to bite her hand.<br>\r\n\"Ouch!\" Steph yelled and dropped Steve on the floor.  Steve quickly tried running away. \"Hold it!\" she said and kicked off her right shoe revealing her purple socked foot. She slammed her foot infront of him and Steve ran into it. Then, she grabbed the shoe and quickly scooped him up and dropped him in it. \"You can't escape me Steve.\" she laughed and shook the shoe a little. \"Come on Michelle, let's take Steve to his new home.\" Then, they ran upstairs and into their room. </span></div></div>",
