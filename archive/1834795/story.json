            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>   For some or perhaps many of us we believe in the possibility of alternate realities co-existing along ours. Some with very little difference and others with so much difference that it's hard to accept them. There are even a few who believe in the existence of  a Utopia type reality where everything is as perfect as it can be. Is it possible for such a picture perfect reality to exist? For Jake Young he believes in the Utopia or picture perfect reality, and even now he wishes for a mean to travel to that reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Jake stretched his arms out lying in his bed as his alarm went off. \" Ugh..Six thirty in the morning already? I'm going back to bed.\"  He then went and pressed the snoozed button on his alarm and covered himself back up. Just as Jake was about to fall back asleep his younger sister came in. \"Wake up sleepy head, your going to be late. Jake groaned as he was disturbed from his slumber. \" Not now sis.\" His Sister then looked up at him sternly. \" Jake, Do we have to go through this every morning? Just get up already!\" She yelled. Jake sighed. \"Fine.\"  Jake got out of bed, got his clothes out of his drawer and headed for the shower. Once he was done with the shower he went out and got dressed and went to the breakfast table. \" Ready, for School dear?\" His mom asked. \" Mom! Do you have to ask that every single day?\" He asked. \" Of course, I care about all my little pumpkins.\" Your mother replied. \"MOM! We're not little anymore can't you stop calling us that?!\" Jake and his sister responded. \" I know you two are growing older but to me you'll always be my little pumpkins, anyhow your birthday gift from your great Aunt Diane should be arriving once school is over. It's strange how her presents always seem to get lost in the mail.\" Your mom says.  Jake's great Aunt Diane is his grandmothers sister, though he has had very little contact with her in the last few years. \"Alright I get it, I'll be off now\" Jake said after giving his mother a hug, he then went out and drove to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Jake's day at school went on the same as usual. Nothing of big notice happened or any fights, at least to Jake's Knowledge. Before Jake knew it it was finally lunch time. Jake set as his usual place with his friend Joe. \"Hey there how's it going?\" Joe asked. \" Same as usual dull as our principal Mr. Uptight.\" Jake replied. \" Careful, heard he's in a bad mood today Jake.\" \" Mr. Uptight is always in a bad mood, he punishes people just for the sake of it, if you ask me..\"  Joe interrupts. \"Jake, careful.\"  Jake continues. \" Why Mr. Uptight and tidy widy near or something?\" \"Not just near but right behind you Mr. Young and for your comments and name calling your principal I think you should spend some time in detention. Don't you?\" The principal asked. Jake shook his head. \" It was just a mistake Mr. Upton.\" Mr. Upton gave Jake a stern look. \" Very well I'll let you off this time but if I find you calling me Mr. Uptight and tidy widy again, don't expect to be so lucky.\"  Mr. Upton then left Jake and Joe waited awhile to ensure the principal was nowhere to be seen. \" That sure was a close call Jake.\" Joe said. Jake simply nodded. Lunch was now over and Jake and Joe went to there afternoon classes. The afternoon classes were pretty much the same as the early morning classes and went by just as fast, except for last period which always seemed to last the longest especially that very last minute. Jake didn't have any other plans today so he went home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake your gift from Aunt Diane arrived, though I think it's a bit of an unusual gift for her to send a boy.\" Your sister said. \" Unusual? Sounds interesting I'll have to look at it. Thanks Sally.\" Sally responded. \" No problem Mom put it in your room.\"  Jake curious of his unusual gift from his Aunt Diane  went straight to his room to look at it. <i>\"That is an unusual gift,  but Aunt Diane always has stories attach to her gifts I wonder what the story of this one is?\"</i> Jake thought as he looked at his gift a two way mirror with a bow and a letter attached to it.  Jake took off the letter unaware of a second letter that was attached to the other side, and he read the letter:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dear Jake,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n I hope you like your birthday present for your sixteenth  birthday. It's been quite a few years since we have actually spoken or seen each other. I'm sure you are also curious of what the story behind this gift is? Well I'll let you in on a little secret I've kept from you. You see this mirror is what send me here to this reality. It took me over fifty years to find it again, and as much as I missed my old reality. I would miss you more if I went  back so I decide to give you this as a gift. The Mirror names is actually called the Mirror of Reality, now I know that seems crazy but if you don't believe me just try it out. But I warn you going back isn't as easy as that. The mirror connects to many multiple realities. I remember our last talk we had when you were wishing to travel to another reality. After a few years it took awhile but once I found this Mirror I decided to give it to you, I hope you enjoy it Jake and Happy Birthday!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Love,<br>\r\nFrom your Aunt Diane.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jake thought to himself,<i>\" A mirror of Reality that can take a person to another reality? That's a good one. Still maybe it really does work. If it does perhaps I can find a reality that really is picture perfect\"!</i>  Jake was hesitant at first questioning whether the mirror could do such a thing. He was also curious to see the possibilities of an actual picture perfect reality. Although he read all of the first letter he still had no clue how to get the mirror to work. His Sister then walked into his room. \" So what's the crazy story on this mirror Jake? She asked. \"Well according to Aunt Diane she came from another reality and this is the Mirror of Reality that sent her here.\" Sally then laughed. \" That's even more silly then her last gift!\" Jake responded. \" What if it's true though?\" Sally then looked and noticed the second letter. \" Jake I doubt that story holds up true, but from the looks of it there's another letter from her.\" Sally said pointing at the letter Jake missed. Jake then went and picked up and read that letter. \"This letter explains how to use the mirror but not much else.\" Jake said. Sally looked at Jake and then ask. \" Then why don't you show me?\" Jake nodded and began to say the phrase that would activate the mirror. \" Oh Mirror of Reality, grant me my desire that I seek to travel to another reality!\" Jake and Sally looked at the mirror at first nothing seemed to be happening and then a fog suddenly appeared in Jake's room. \"Jake I..don't like this.\" Sally said. \"Walk through the Mirror and your desire shall be granted\" A voice came from the mirror. At first Jake wasn't sure whether he should of believed his Great Aunt or not but now he was sure and curious to see a picture perfect reality. \" Jake! Don't GO!\" Sally yelled. It was useless as Jake was entranced by the possibilities that he saw the Mirror now glowing an eerie blue with the mirror his reflection faded and the mirror instead of reflecting changed to white. Jake's own curiosity got the better of him as he went through the White where the portal was. His sister could only watch helplessly as he went through. Neither of them aware of Jake's mistake instead of sending him to his picture perfect reality it sent him to another reality randomly since he neglected to specify the reality. The only question is which reality did Jake get sent to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jake looked at his surroundings and expected to be in his picture perfect reality, but much to his surprise everything seemed backwards in this reality almost as if he had gone back through time. He then saw a young woman in colonial clothes and asked her. He asked her what year it was. He expected  that he had also traveled through time, but much to his dismay he found out he didn't. He looked around at his surroundings and noticed that there was no electricity, computers or even a hint of technology that was seen in his reality!  Jake quickly ran back to the place he arrived expecting the mirror to be there so he could go back, only to realize that it wasn't there! He remembered that his Aunt Diane's letter had mentioned that going back isn't easy. <i>So this is what she meant, I'll have to find the mirror every time I enter another reality?</i>Jake thought.  Jake then noticed with his clothes he stands out like a sore thumb in this reality. He decided that he needed to find out more about this reality, find appropriate attire, and find the mirror so he could get out of this reality.

He didn't know much about this reality having just been transported to here. From what he could tell he would need to find someone. Luckily he soon found some one and even though she was in different clothing then her usual style he could tell that it was his sister Sally. Jake ran towards her. \"Sally! I need your help.\" Sally then looked at Jake quizzically. \" What for dear brother?\" She asked. Jake was quite surprised by Sally's response, he remembered that his sister had never called him dear brother. \"I need to catch up on my history, and um where exactly are we living?\" Jake said. Sally looked at him with a concerned face. \"Oh! Dear you must have hit your head from working so hard.\" Sally responded. She then began to fill you in on some of the details that she knew about this reality. \" We live in one of the thirteen colonist countries controlled by the great Britannia Empire. further south is controlled by those of Spain, and in the central area is controlled by the french.\" Sally said. Jake began to understand more about this reality but still hadn't figured out why there was no sign of any modern conveniences. \" How is it that there's no electricity or an other convenience here?\" Jake asked. His sister looked at him worriedly. \"You really got hit hard didn't you dear brother, you should know that we colonists even now never get any of the things the nobility who are on the mainland get.\"  She responded. It was then that you realized that there are modern conveniences in this reality, although it seems only the privileged classes who reside on what is known as the mainland get them. \" Do you know anything else Sally?\" Sally shook her head. \" That's all I know Jake, you'll have to find out more from someone else that's all I know about. \"Thanks Sally.\" Jake said.  Jake realized that in this reality that one of the major events that happened in the past of his reality never happened!

Sally simply nodded and then took him to his house in this reality. His house looked to be something that would be on a display in a museum from his reality, it was a simple log cabin. Jake knew that in this reality only the nobility who had lived on the mainland or what could possibly be known as the Home country to some lived in luxury with the modern conveniences that were everywhere in his reality. \" I'm Home, Mom.\" Jake said. His mother much like his sister was wearing similar clothes from the colonial days in his reality. \" You're already done with your work Jake?\" Jake's mom asked. \"I'm done.\" Jake said. \" Mom can you give me a bit of a history lesson? I had one from Sally but I want to find out more. Do you know where I can find a public library?\" His mother looked at him bewildered by the question. \" Public Library? You must have hurt yourself bad Jake, there's no such thing as a public library, though there are some nobles who have there own personal library.\"  Jake was learning quite a bit today but still hadn't learned anything useful. <i>\" No public library? I wonder why? Maybe I should ask about some of the famous figures from the time of the revolution. But who?\"</i> Jake thought.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWell, I'd really like to learn more about history, Mother,\u201d insisted Jake. \u201cI know we can't afford a library, but perhaps you could tell me what you know about, oh, let's say George Washington?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake's mother visibly stiffened her posture. She looked nervous and uncomfortable now, suddenly twitching and fidgeting anxiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would you wish to know about <u>him?</u>\u201d mother replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly in this reality, thought Jake, George Washington was hardly the faithful, forthright, famous father of his country! Best to tread carefully. This was a different history indeed, doubtlessly with deep consequences of whatever distant fracture in time had created this reality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, me and some friends were just talking about how rotten he was,\u201d Jake said, trying to sound casual and off-handed. \u201cAnd it just struck me that I never really learned exactly why George Washington was such a villain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake's mother relaxed and actually smiled a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose it's been my patriotic duty to tell you these things,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I've been a bit lax in that, haven't I? Sit down Jake, and I'll try to recall all I learned as a little girl about the American Rebellion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe American Rebellion, thought Jake. It's even got a new name. This was interesting stuff. He sat before his mother's feet and listened intently to her tale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was back in the 1770s,\u201d Jake's mother said. \u201cParliament had passed some new taxes, and here in the colonies people were very poor. They found it difficult to pay these taxes. Some foolish landowners led by Colonel George Washington started an armed rebellion against the crown. Washington and his despicable rebels actually achieved some success, waging a guerrilla war of tiny acts of terrorism committed here and there throughout mostly rural pockets of the colonies. The turning point came when General Charles Cornwallis bravely led His Majesty's Army against the rebels at an obscure little forgotten place called Valley Forge. The insurgents escaped justice however, in what's known as the Winter March. Fleeing from Cornwallis and his men, they trekked from Pennsylvania to Virginia, during a bitterly cold winter storm. Many of the traitors died during that blizzard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe rest of the war,\u201d mother continued. \u201cWas a foregone conclusion for Cornwallis and His Majesty's Army. The crown bravely fought against the rebels, gradually whittling them down bit by bit in a series of successful battles. The final blow came in 1781 when we decimated the American army at Yorktown. Washington and his rebels surrendered to General Cornwallis. The leaders of the revolt were tried for treason, convicted, and hanged. Let's see, it would have been: Washington, Jefferson, Franklin, Hancock, and \u2026 oh, dear, that's all I can remember. Back in school, we had to memorize the names of all these infamous criminals.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter the traitors were hanged,\u201d said Jake's mother. \u201cThere were a few more years of minor violent uprisings, but they were all easily extinguished by General Banastre Tarleton's highly effective Loyalist Legion. They were the new garrison assigned to permanently guard us here in colonies from dangerous terrorists. They hunted down and brought to justice all the other members of the terrorist group calling themselves The Minutemen. So successful were the Loyalist Legion that they began to see use around the globe in the years to come. That's why to this day, the Empire's special forces commandos are known as Tarleton's Legion. And no doubt, you've read the exciting stories in the papers about Tarleton's Legion seeing action around the Empire, fighting bravely against dirty insurgents everywhere from Ireland to South Africa, from India to southeast Asia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was quite an interesting history lesson, thought Jake. But he had more questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom, why did you get so nervous when I first asked about all this?\u201d Jake said innocently. \u201cI mean, it's all ancient history, right? Who cares about George Washington nowadays?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are still misguided, foolish people out there who revere these traitors,\u201d mom answered, her voice dropping to almost a whisper. \u201cDon't forget the failed Lincoln-Lee rebellion of the 1850s. And nearly a hundred years after that, there was Colonel Eisenhower's coup attempt, back when the crown was distracted by the Second War of Europe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo people are actually still trying to overthrow Britain and achieve independence here?\u201d Jake asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShhh! Don't speak of such things,\u201d insisted mom. \u201cWe are a loyalist household and <u>always</u> shall be. But yes you're right, there is a covert cabal \u2013 Freemasons, most of them \u2013 who speak highly of Washington and seek a return to the sad, dark days of his failed rebellion. They honor him as the secret Grand Master of American Independence. But Jake, they are not glorious freedom fighters. They are dangerous and deadly criminals. I don't want you getting caught up in all this nonsense. Our family has always been steadfast, dependable subjects of the crown. The cabal is dangerous, subversive, and downright treasonous. Murderers, thieves, and terrorists the lot of them! So stay faithful, true, and patriotic Jake, and you'll have nothing to fear.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Fortunately though you were a bit curious about how someone you just met could declare something so easily as well as get a document with the royal seal in one day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Your sister Sally then came to you and looked out the same window as you were looking. \" That seal is fake, that guy has been much more of a menace and now he's turned the whole city against us.\" Sally said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" How can you tell it's a fake?\" Jake asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" That's simple, it's the same symbol used back w hen King George was king, however King George is no longer King and thus meaning that it's fake. People here wont notice it though instead they would most likely believe his outlandish lies.\" Sally explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Couldn't we just explain it to them?\" Jake asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" No, they'd just tie us up and hang us before anything happens.\" Sally replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Then we don't get a trial?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" No, Colonists aren't important enough to receive a trial, so they let angry mobs decide.\" Sally replied as she did Jake looked at Sally's eyes and they appeared to be someone Sally had loved who had this happen to as well.  Jake realized this but realized how helpless the colonists were to the power of the crown in this era and there was no way to fight the crown either.  This world was indeed not perfect, but with his family declared traitor's and people believe that the symbol on the parchment was an actual royal decree. There was no way any of his family had to escape. Just as Jake was thinking this...</span></div></div>",

His room was painted pink, and it even had a vanity chest. Once Jake looked in the mirror he screamed. \"Aaagh! I've turned into a girl!  His brown hair was long and  he had many other things he realized were missing. Jake rushed towards his sister sally to tell her. \" Sally!\" he yelled. \"I turned into a girl once I went through that mirror!\" Sally looked at him puzzled. \"Are you alright Jackie?\" Sally said. \" My names Jake! Not Jackie I'm supposed to be a guy!\" Sally looked even more puzzled then laughed. \" Jackie you can't be serious there is no such thing as males for humans.\" It was then you realized that you were in another reality it was much like your own except for one difference human males never existed in this reality.  Jake was shocked, he didn't expect a different reality to change him into a girl! Jake then thought up his options he could take. One thing he notice was Sally seemed to believe that he was from this reality not another one, he could try to convince her that he came from another world. He could also Find out more about this reality so he at least will be able to fit in. Or he could convince his mother instead of sally.

It took awhile for Jake to find more information but he eventually found out more. He continued to read out loud his words, \" Although in some cases a girl can be impregnated as early as thirteen years of age. The majority of time it takes the sperm years to break through the female ovary, usually when a lot of sperm are present it can be easier to break through the egg.

It seemed for every male historical figure you knew, this universe had a corresponding female version in most cases. Strangely he did find that a couple of instances of altered fates, like the equivalents of Alexander the Great, Hannibal, and Genghis Khan all stopped their campaigns due to pregnancy instead of dying or disease, or the female Napoleon dying of ovarian cancer just after Waterloo, but mostly you found there wasn't a major learning curve to this universe's history, until he got to the United States. Jake noticed there was no suffrage movements anywhere, since there was only the one gender, and it seemed the Civil War never took place, as the United States was formed sans slavery, with the Constitution already insuring equal rights for all from the start. As a result, race relations seemed a rather moot issue compared to your world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever Jake did see that in all the pictures he saw, both historical and present, he never once saw any traces of pants or even shorts, and the amounts of cleavage and occasional side/underboob was insane. Everyone seemed to wear skirts and skimpy tops, as though pants and conservative tops had never been invented... In fact the most conservative thing he found was chain mail on medieval knights on Wikipedia, and that looked like a dress under a plate mail tube top and miniskirt. This made him wonder, because he hadn't stopped to look at his clothes in depth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, Jake saw his neckline plunging way down showing off ample cleavage, and the bottom of his shirt lifted an inch or so to show off his feminine midriff, but otherwise Jake's shirt didn't look too different, but then he looked below his shirt and chest and saw his jeans were now a denim miniskirt, and below that he wore kneehigh socks with sneakers that oddly had a small heel to them. \"I look trampy!!\" he said at his own visage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally walking by, hears Jake, and looks at her \"sister,\" going, \"What does this word, 'trampy,' mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake suddenly realized this practically slutty style of attire was normal and commonplace for this world, and maybe the concept of \"trashy\" or \"trampy\" clothes didn't exist, which made him feel all the more awkward (and exposed).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nevermind.\" he said, as he goes back to the computer for a moment. \"Maybe I should hurry up and get out of here...

Jake walked out of Sally's arms and into a chair. The two of them began exchanging various information they knew about there realities. Eventually when Jake brought up things that had a Scientific explanation behind them, Sally brought up that in this world those thing are explained by magic. \" So do you know the difference between our realities now?\" Sally asked. \"I think so, basically magic exists everywhere in this world and is used daily. Even for computers, and anything that in my reality that would be explained in Scientific terms is considered Magic. Sally simply nodded at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Now that you are here Jake, what do you plan to do?\" Sally asked. \" I think I'll try this reality out a bit, the Mirror is right behind me right?\" Jake then looked behind him to the spot where he once was only to find the mirror gone. Jake looked surprised to find that the mirror was gone. \" What happened to the mirror?! it was right in the room earlier!\" Jake said. Sally responds, \" Relax, Jake I'm sure we can find it,  You might be staying in this reality longer than you thought.\"  After hearing that Jake calmed down a little. \"Okay so I just have to find the mirror again, then I'll be able to return.\"  Sally nods. \" No need to panic, besides you might find that since just about anyone can use magic in this reality, things might be more fun.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  It was now late at night and Jake had nothing else he can do for now so he decided to get some rest for now.

The first of which would be a completely normal rabbit,  However it could be also he could be changed into an anthromorphic Rabbit,  which is basically still human but with Rabbit features. The third way her spell could possibly affect Jake would that due to Jake not being accustomed to this world yet the spell only affected half of his body turning him into some odd combination of a Rabbit- Centaur.

They were in a small warehouse, close to the ocean. Jake then got up and looked surprised to see that Sally followed him. \"Sally?! Why'd you follow me? He asked.  Sally dusted off her skirt and then responded. \" When I was looking at the mirror I thought I saw something horrible in this reality, I tried to warn you, but you were so insistent on coming here I had no choice to follow.\"  Jake took a quick look around to try and notice anything that was different from his reality, but all he could see was a dirty old warehouse. \" Doesn't look like there's much danger to me. \" Jake said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Jake and Sally then went outside the warehouse, they were still unsure of what this reality had to offer, or what happened. As Sally was walking out of the warehouse, she noticed a small book in the corner and ran to pick it up.

The sky still looked the same to them at least, that was until Jake saw a UFO landing in an airport. \" Wow!

Jake was glad to know that they weren't hideous looking. They walked slowly and looked at all the cages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So many decisions.\" one of them said. They looked around and Sally caught the attention of the brunette alien. She looked down at her and said, \"Aww, this human's cute. I think I want this one.\" Sally had a scared look on her.

So his best bet would be to get chosen by the other alien so him and Sally can at least be together. But the alien wasn't paying attention to him. He needed to get the alien to want him. After a few seconds, he realized what he had to do. He remembered how puppies would get chosen on Earth. He needed to act like a cute puppy. \"Here it goes...\" he sighed. The two alien girls were busy checking out some other human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bark! Bark!\" he yelped. He caught the attention of both of them and they walked towards his cage.

Okay let's go tell the worker.\" They walked away and Jake put his head down in disgust at the way he acted. He wasn't a pet, but he certainly didn't want to get separated from Sally either. He saw the alien girls return with another alien that looked like a young adult dude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So which humans do you want?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This one, and that one\" The blonde alien answered as she pointed towards Sally and Jakes' cage. The alien guy then walked towards Sally's cage and let her out. He attached a leash to her and handed it to the brunette. Then, he walked towards Jake's cage and did the same thing. He handed his leash to the blonde. After that, they all headed for the front counter. The blonde tugged Jake's leash and he walked by her side. Well, not really walked. He had to be on all fours since he was a pet. It was difficult adjusting to getting around that way. But he walked by her side. When they got to the counter, the girl aliens were talking about the payment with the guy. Jake looked at Sally awkwardly. It was weird seeing her without clothes and it just didn't seem right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to find the mirror, and fast\" Jake whispered.

When he looked over, what he saw jolted him to consciousness, for he had nearly met his end from flying shrapnel landing just left of his head. He shoots up, to see the whole area ablaze, smoke in the sky. \"Sally!! Wake up!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't need to go to school, mommy. It's Saturday...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"School's the least of your problems!!\" Jake yells as he lifts her head and peels her eyes open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, everything's on fire. I thought it was something important.\" Sally then falls back asleep. She was always so hard to rouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, an explosion throws the duo in the air and finally jolts Sally awake. \"What was...\" Jake looked up and saw a slender figure in boots, gauntlets, and bodysuit that had glowing pink lines and contrails all over it. It was staring down another one of those robots that knocked them out earlier, when it conjured a pink energy between its hands and fired it at the robot, then made a sphere of the same energy, crushed it in its hand, creating a pink energy blade, and cut another bot in half that was attacking from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother slender alien in the same garb, but sky blue lights and contrails glowing from their equipment and suit, flew right through a robot, blowing it up, then roundhouse kicked another one into a swarm of approaching fighters, somehow depositing a glowing blue orb of energy into the center of the robot, which detonated when it flew amongst the futuristic jets, the explosion devastating the whole fighter wing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA third slender figure walked up from behind Jake and Sally, it's glow being silver, and wearing heavy armor on its legs, arms, back, and shoulders. Suddenly clamps in its boots slam down into the cement and lock it into place. Jake is surprised when he hears it speak English, and it's voice a very high pitched female's voice, yelling, \"Target Lock!! Armageddon System is a GO!!\" Blinding the two kids sight, thousands of lasers and missiles soar from this one alien, soaring up to take out three giant practically Rhode Island-sized UFOs coming down from the clouds, followed by her raising her hands in a Kamehameha fashion. Just before this hellstorm was to hit, a lime green blur snatched them up, the jolt in speed nearly making Sally heave. Jake could barely stand the G-forces he was under as he looked back, most everything a muddy blur, but was able to see the devastation unleashed by the silver alien. The whole sky was white, the mushroom cloud was on par with Hiroshima. The earth was trembling with the force of this skyward explosion, which Jake felt vibrate through the alien that was carrying them. Suddenly, the alien seemed to lose its footing, tripping and stumbling, but managing to stay on its feet until it came to a stop. Once stopped, Jake could see more clearly, and saw the alien's rear much more clearly now that all the blood wasn't rushing to his eyeballs. This one too had a very feminine shape, especially in her hips and butt, and then he saw poking out of the suit above her butt with wires wrapped around it to a ring on the end of it was a black furry tail, a tail that looked very feline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you hear a vomiting sound, and the alien drops you and Sally, as she screams, also in a similarly extra-feminine voice, \"Aw, all over my suit!! You could of warned me you were going to lurch...\" She turned around and produced green lasers from her fingertips which seemed to clean her suit, as though by magic. Jake gasped when he saw her, as her face looked so very human. If not for the slit orange feline eyes black cat ears, cat tail, and indigo hair cut in a bob, she could easily pass for a human girl of around Jake's age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally yelled, \"Not another one!!\" cringing at the sight of the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake goes for the obvious and says, \"Alright, I'm confused.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alien girl says, \"Now, I don't think we've elicited responses like that from a human since we came here to fight the Ferrions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ferrions?\" Jake exclaimed. \"Listen... lady. I have no idea who these 'Ferrions' are, unless you're talking about those weird robot things that zapped us, but we're new here and very confused...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright... Something's up...\" the alien says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't know if you'll believe us, but here goes...\" Jake recounts their tale so far to her, telling her about their world, and the mirror, and how they got here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you don't believe a word I said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you mad? This is very serious. Of course I believe you. Multiple universes are a key part of quantum mechanics and the Multiverse Law. Moreso, you've found a way to move objects on the macroscopic scale across the multiverse, something no one has yet to do. Only the Ferrions, we Neju, and the Kelmar Enclave have even managed to send microscopic information between universes, but the energy costs are astronomical, and the Ferrions have a leg-up on us by being a bio-mechanical race, so they can send nanomachines with genetic data over and assemble themselves in other universes, gathering new technology and territory from alien realms while we have no way to stop them unless we ever get the womanpower to attack their homeworld and knock out their central plexus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I have a headache.\" Jake groaned. \"Multiverse Laws, Ferrions, Neju, Kelmar Enclave... What does it all mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All we know is that we found a book detailing that after World War II, the Earth was conquered...\" Sally said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, by the Ferrions.\" the alien said. \"They go about the cosmos enslaving and forcing sentient species to be their playthings as they exploit their resources. They are a mostly mechanical cybernetic species that sucker punched our people, the Neju, and our homeworld, many millenia ago, much like that attack by the Japanese on that Naval base you humans called Pearl Harbor, knowing if they faced us at full power, we would easily stop their campaign. Now we go about and liberate the oppressed peoples they capture and free their worlds, fighting back their scourge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I saw how awesomely you guys kicked butt back there.\" Jake exclaimed. \"However, if you could stomp them that easy, why can't you beat them once and for all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Numbers. Ferrions can engineer and build millions of new lifeforms a day. Meanwhile, the four of us you saw are the only Neju here on Earth, and while the liberated humans try their best with the training and equipment we can afford them in the little spare time we have, it's just a sad fact we haven't been able to fully calibrate Neju technology to human physiology. Another problem Neju technology was specifically designed for the female body and brain, and too many Earth men have antiquated notions about women's right on this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, why is your technology designed for women only?\" Sally asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our males are very primal, and almost resemble your Earthly lions. For some reason, which our anthropologists are still trying to discover, unlike in humans, only the Neju female body and brain evolved rapidly over time, while even now the males are still solitary creatures, living like aboriginal tribal people, only speaking ancient tongues and using old technologies. At best, they are no more advanced than you humans were during your 'Dark Ages,' which is a neat accomplishment given they're quadrupeds. They only come amongst us females in the mega-cities to breed and raise our children up to a certain point, and then they return to the jungles. As a result of our evolutionary advantage, all us females developed a hyper-advanced civilization with some of the most advanced technology in the universe. We built said tech to suit our needs and wants, so best to synchronize with it. Finally, we developed our greatest tech, these combat suits that actually derive their power from 'maternal mana,' or the female ability to create life within herself. We harness chi within our uterus, cascade it throughout our bodies, and the suits draw out and amplify that chi to the levels you saw today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... That's TMI...\" Jake uttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like magic to me.\" Sally quipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\" the alien responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake turned back to her and asked, \"Now, if you believe us, there's just a couple more questions to ask. One, can you find our mirror? If not, we're stuck here forever. Also, what's your name? We can't just keep calling you 'alien,' now can we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I could, but I'd need the base computer for that. My suit scanners aren't equipped to scan for eleven dimensional anomalies. Also, my name is Merido.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's go then...\" Jake says, walking up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. The others should be back at base by now...\" Merido says.</span></div></div>",

Just as she predicted the other Neju had returned to base. \" Feel free, to take a look around, you may find some Humans around here that are helping as well.\" She said. Jake and Sally nodded.  The Neju base was unlike anything they have ever seen before. While Jake and Sally were awestruck by the Neju's base design, Merido was meeting with the other three who had returned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"This place is amazing Jake, It looks like something you'd find in a Science Fiction movie.\" Sally said. \" I know, it's amazing but I want to get out of this reality as quickly as possible. The longer we stay the more chance of us becoming pets to the Ferrions. \"  Jake reminded Sally. \" You saw these four in action today though Jake, I'm sure they can handle  just about anything that comes there way.\" She responded. As Sally and Jake were walking through the corridor of the Neju base, they both saw there parents at the base. \"Is that who I think it is?\" Jake asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" I think it is Jake.

Meanwhile, Merido was looking at the supercomputer with diligence when she heard the doors behind her open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\">\"Who!! Wha?! Who goes there?!\"</span> she blurts, startled by the intrusion. She then sees Jake and Sally there, along with their parents. <span class=\"cbgreen\">\"Oh guys, it's you. Don't scare me like that!!\"</span> She then says, <span class=\"cbgreen\">\"I would talk some, but we're on an important op, and I have to keep my eyes peeled for Ferrion reinforcement and hyper jump signals.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It won't take long... but could you see if you could figure out where this universe's Jake and Sally are?\" Jake asked her. \"I wouldn't feel right leaving this universe without returning our counterparts to their parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerido fought with her conscience and her sense of duty... <span class=\"cbgreen\">\"But I have no time... alright... I can run a search in a minimized window...\"</span> She pulls up a search engine to run a passive scan for them so she could reserve her focus on the galactic radar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp in near space, Lanmei was ripping through the Ferrion vessels and units with her pink energy blades as Kikader zipped around, smashing through the capital vessels blocking the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"You'd think their defenses would be tighter. Think it's a trap?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"Why must everything be a trap? Can't we just be having a good day, Lanmei?\"</span> Ri said in her usual pleasant tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"I'm likely to agree with Lanmei on this one. Keep your eyes peeled.\"</span> Suddenly a giant swarm of fighter drones springs out from behind the moon. <span class=\"cblue\">\"Like that!!\"</span> Kikader leans back pointing her left leg at the armada, then extends her right leg and tail perpendicular to the rest of her as she lifts her arms up to her sides. <span class=\"cblue\">\"Activate: Galactic Pirouette Assassin!!\"</span> Blue energy swirls from her wrists, ankles, and near the tip of her tail and she begins to rotate clockwise. A tornado of blue power sweeps out from the spinning vortex of her right leg and tail as a central bolt of blue lightning flies from her left foot. The giant tornado beam strikes the swarm of drones, beginning to destroy them left and right, and even causing indirect collateral damage to the nearby moon as the lightning creates an orb in the center of the enemy. Then flames shoot from her wrists as she launches forward, and as she neared the dwindling enemy, bladed ribbons of energy spun from her wrists. Finally she flew into the crowd, landing on the orb the lightning was making in the crowd with her left foot, detonating it. A series of explosions rocked the starry skies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"We can't let the boss show us up, now can we?\"</span> Lanmei responds with a grin to Ri. <span class=\"cpink\">\"Got this idea from some of the humans who were taking a break from their patrol one day...\"</span> she utters as four Ferrion dreadnoughts converge on her. She hurls several bladed fireballs that suddenly pin all the ships together. Her contrails burst into flames as she raised her right hand over her head. <span class=\"cpink\">\"GIIIIIIIGGGAA......\"</span> All the flames shoot into her hand, making a pink fireball bigger than Texas. <span class=\"cpink\">\"DDRRIIILLLLLLL......\"</span> She slams her hand down on the fireball, releasing a flash of power, compressing it into a vast conical drill still well over the size of Rhode Island. <span class=\"cpink\">\"BRRREEEEAAAKKKKK!!!\"</span> She zips through... Well all us from this reality probably already figured where this was going to go (but hey, who's to say the GAINAX folks wouldn't exist here too?). The four ships exploded from the massive holes in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Impressive, Lanmei, but regulate your power expenditure better. We still have a long ways to go before we catch that ship!!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Y... Yes, ma'am...\"</span> Lanmei says, slightly dejected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sky then fills entirely with silver streaks of light, and almost everything in sight that wasn't a star, planet, or natural satellite exploded. <span class=\"clgrey\">\"I cleared a pathway for you Arbiter!!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Uh... Um... Good job, Ri.\"</span> Kikader said shocked. It wasn't the first time seeing Ri's innate power at work, but it always awed her when this sweet virtually pacifist girl released so much power at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"You can't be real.\"</span> Lanmei says to her, jaw agape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"You said you liked me when I was 'blowing shit up.' You approve, Lanmei?\"</span> Ri giggles in that same innocent tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Hell yeah I approve!!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"Then I am pleased you are pleased...\"</span> Ri said blushing and smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Enough chatter. Now, like I told Lanmei, I want you to better meter your power as well, Ri. I know you have innate talents we don't, but we can't have you tiring yourself out either before we complete the mission!! Now, with the station destroyed, the ship is most likely firing up it's Hyper Warp Gate, and we don't have a vessel equipped with Super Perceptual Teleportation to give pursuit, so it's now or never!!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on Earth, Merido was cheering, as she had watched Ri's attack pretty much eliminate all the hostile threats. <span class=\"cbgreen\">\"Victory is at hand!! The mirror will back in your hands, kids, before you know... Hey, I got a hit on that search!!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please!! Tell us where our children are!!\" this universe's Jake &amp; Sally mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\">\"Alright...\"</span> She pulls it up, then cocks a strange face. <span class=\"cbgreen\">\"That can't be right. It says they're in space... and heading our way...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a massive blip fills the screen of the galactic radar. <span class=\"cbgreen\">\"Hey, Merido. What's that?\"</span> Sally says, pointing at the blip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\">\"It better be a computer glitch...\"</span> Merido exclaimed nervously. Suddenly, lights came down and alarms sounded, but the lights seemed to make everything darker. <span class=\"cbgreen\">\"No... Not that... Not a black alert...\"</span> Merido muttered with a deep chill in her soul, a single tear running down her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is all this?\" Jake yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm scared...\" Sally cried clinging to her equivalent to her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\">\"You should be...\"</span> Merido uttered solemnly. She opens an image file showing a vessel with thousands of horrific faces and arms, parts that looked like meditating gods, and demonic looking tentacles all over, all the while missile tubes beyond count were also visible. <span class=\"cbgreen\">\"Grand Imperialis... The Ferrion Ultimate Battleship, and home of the Ferrion system...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake &amp; Sally's dad responds, \"It must be a small one, because it doesn't look that...\" pointing at the image. Merido quietly points to the screen at its coordinates, showing it roughly 30 light years away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\">\"To put it bluntly, it is the largest object in the universe not a galaxy itself. It could fit this star system inside tenfold and only be 10% full. It's primary weapons are planets and stars themselves!! The Ferrions call it to the front lines only when they have deemed a system more trouble than it worth, and have decided... to destroy it outright... It destroyed the world I was born on!! My mother lived on...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I saw what you guys can do...\" Jake stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\">\"Even with the full Neju military might, we've only fought that thing to a draw.\"</span> Merido sighes. <span class=\"cbgreen\">\"I'll tell the others... Meanwhile, prepare Earth for evacuation.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"Grand Imperialis?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Why now?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Dammit!! And we were so close!!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Merido!! Get as many Earth lifeforms through the gateway and to Neju Prime before Imperialis attacks!! NOW!!\" </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the base, Merido had led everyone to the central gateway, where several other Neju had warped in to assist with the evacuation. \"So this is it. It's over. They win.\" Jake growls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbgreen\">\"I want to destroy that thing with every ounce of being in my heart as well Jake, but I know we are simply outgunned...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake then says...</span></div></div>",

From what you've read from Jamie's diary earlier you know that is exactly what she would have done. Of course you still wanted to be friends with Joe despite the break up. Still it doesn't mean that  you liked his demanding attitude. If you could find the mirror then you could get out this reality, and hopefully a better one. As of right now though you had no clue as to where it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  So the sleepover with some of your other friends of Jamie in this reality looked to be a pretty good idea by the time she had suggested it.  \" A Sleep over sounds good Sis, but who are we inviting?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" That's easy there's Valerie, Lisa and you can't forget Tanya.\" Sally replied. As she said their names you only had small bits of information from this realities Jamie's diary to remember them by. Valerie is your Tennis partner and the next closest thing to a best friend aside from Joe. Like you she is very athletic and tomboyish, her being taller than most of the other boys seems to help out on that front as well. Yet in the diary you read, you know that she is also very affectionate and is quite considerate of others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Then there is Lisa, whom  the  diary described as a bit odd. She often wore dresses all the time, she's often viewed as a girly girl. But from what the diary told you she's not like that at all. She just enjoys the things that people usually associate with girls. Yet strangely also enjoys some of the boy things you do as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    As for Tanya the diary basic described her as an exotic beauty and that Jamie or rather your alter ego would totally date her if you were a guy. Which is kind of an irony for you right now. Especially since your living in the reality where you are a girl. As your sister called the three girls over for a sleep over with you and have a girls bonding experience. You eagerly awaited the arrival of the three girls who would come. The first of the three girls to arrive is.....</span></div></div>",

Sally then stared at you and then realized what was going on! \"I see now you're a Jake from another reality aren't you?\" Sally said. Jake was surprised that this Sally not only accepted you from being from another reality, but somehow was able to tell as well! \" How could you tell?\" Jake asked.  Sally then smiled and replied. \" That's simple you still have some magic residue from that mirror you used to travel with, plus I'm a witch so of course I'd be able to tell.\"  This was the first big difference that Jake had found in this reality, in his reality his sister hardly ever believed in things such as witches, or magic. In this reality she believed she was a witch or was actually one. Jake could not tell yet so he decided to test it. \" You really believe you're a witch, then can you prove it?\" Jake asked. Sally nodded, \"Of Course that's what the practice is for, to practice my witchcraft why else do you think I need you?\" Jake responded. \" Can you show me without using me as a target first?\" Jake asked.  Sally sighed, \"Fine.\" Sally went and targeted your alarm clock and cast her spell, Jake watches as the spell turns his alarm clock form a dull gray colored alarm clock, to a Disney princess alarm clock. Jake was surprised it was his first time seeing her do magic but was amazed by it. \" Wow!\" Jake said. \"That's nothing but beginner stuff, Jake don't be so impressed.\" Sally said. \" In this reality people can use witchcraft and you really are a witch so is it possible for me to use magic as well?\" Jake asked.

You used that dangerous object to travel here?\" She said looking shocked and surprised. \" You know about it? Then is it possible this is the reality that my great Aunt Diane came from?\" Jake asked. Sally simply shook her head. \" I'm afraid not, Jake but know that I know about the object that transported you here if your going to go to another world later, you may find it difficult to find the mirror.\" Sally said. \" Why? Is it placed somewhere safe or something?\" Jake asked. \"It's in the Witch's Council's vault you would need permission from the head witch herself to even use that dangerous artifact.\" She replied. \" Are you finished asking questions now?\" Jake nodded, \"Yeah I decided to be called Jill in my female form.\" With that settled Sally began to cast her transformation spell transforming you into a girl. The spell was surprisingly pleasant and didn't hurt as you felt your body change. Your hair changed from brown to a shiny red, your eye colors remained green, and some parts of body were increased, where some had disappeared.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well how do I look?\" Jake now Jill asked. \" Aside from  your clothes, you look quite good Jill.\" Sally responded. Jill was still curious of many things she had learned here magic existed, but it isn't the world her great Aunt Diane was from. Of course she still had thought of the possibility that her great aunt may have traveled to this world. Not only that but she also learned where the mirror was located. Of course getting permission to use it, would prove to be quite a difficult task.  \"So now that I am changed...what exactly am I helping you practice?\" Jill asked.

I didn't know why she was doing that just that she was there and it looked like she was ready to jump off. So I rushed in and grabbed her hand, It was then I told her. \"Don't jump!\"  After that she laughed for a bit.\"  Sally listened to the beginning of Jake's story and interrupted it. \" Why did she laugh? She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" I was just getting to that part. She laughed because what I thought was a cliff was actually only a three foot drop.\"  Sally then bursts into laughter. \" That is funny, can't believe you did that! But please go on.\" Jill then looked to Sally and continued telling her story. \" She said the exact same thing you just said. It was then that I asked her why she was looking so sad. She then told me to butt out and that it was none of my business. I however wanted to know because at that time I believed I could help her even though I had no idea what her problems were at that time I didn't realize  that her problems were far too many for me to realize. So for the moment a guy interested in her I asked for her name. And she said it was Jill.\" Jill then began to form tears in her eyes as she tried to keep telling her story, until Sally interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" I think I'll let you tell the rest later. Right now you need this.\" Sally said as she hugged her alternate reality brother who was her sister right now. Jill felt a bit confused as their boobs squished together it was a strange yet comfortable feeling for her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Well how's the potion going?\"  Jill asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Oh No! I got so wrapped up in your story I forgot!\" Sally said rushing over to where only to find her mother waiting.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Mom?\" Sally asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Sally how many time do I have to tell you, never leave your potion unattended.\"  Mother said with a stern look on her face. It was amazing to Jill how much her mother still looked like her own mother, then again this was still his family just from a different reality. You looked at her as she looked at you and smiled at you sincerely but also had a look of great pain on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Who exactly are you? And I don't mean the transformed you. The Real you? \" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" I am Jake Young I come from a different reality, I am hoping to find the perfect reality.\" You said honestly, you thought about lying to her but from what you gathered on the few moments you saw her. She was pretty good at seeing through lies. Just like Jill's mother from back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" I am pleased that you told me the truth, but I am afraid there is a certain rule Sally didn't know about, Any one from some other reality must check in to see the head witch. Usually we try to return them, but first I must ask how did you arrive in this world?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" I arrived with a Mirror my aunt gave me that allowed me to travel to this world.\" Jill said. The look on your mothers face after you mentioned that Mirror, was a look of great fear. Almost as if she knew something about it. Something terrible about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" What's wrong?\" Jill asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" That mirror is a legend one of the most dangerous artifacts in existence, we must find it!\" She replied. \" If that mirror get's in the wrong hands, it could be disastrous. I'll use a locator to spell to find it, but I need someone who's traveled through it for this spell to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Why do you need someone who's traveled through it for it to work?\" Jill asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Because only someone who's traveled through the mirror can find it.\" She began to quickly hurry and cast the location spell to find the Mirror of reality. You weren't exactly sure why but as soon as the spell was finished it was almost as though  you and the mirror had somehow became connected for a moment, and you saw where the Mirror was.

At least this way you can get the mirror and then take your time with this reality. \" The good news is the mirror's safe, but I don't the head witch will simply just let you travel through the mirror again.\" Your mother from this reality told you very plainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Why? Wouldn't she allow me to use it?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" It's a  good question I wont trouble you with details but we have had issues with other realities before, and not only that but you came through this Mirror with little knowledge of how it works, yet not even understanding what kind of purpose this type of mirror could have. Not only that but you could have even brought new disease's to this reality simply by Traveling through it, and you want Madame Head Witch to allow you free use of this dangerous item. That is highly unlikely.\" She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Although you admitted to yourself that you didn't think there was any danger of you traveling between realities. However she did bring up a  few other good points that you never stopped to think about, such as the consequences of your traveling to a different reality or what you might bring as a result as such. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Wouldn't the mirror protect this reality, and prevent me from bringing in any sort of diseases though?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Unfortunately that has yet to be determined, usually those wishing to go to another reality never have good intentions.\" Sally said. Eventually the three of you  went to the Head Witch's House where your fate would be decided as to whether you had to stay in this reality to protect other realities or be allowed to use the mirror again. For now from what you understand that decision would be up to the head Witch.  You went into the car with your alternate reality mother and Sally and she began driving to the Head Witch's House. You were curious as to why she didn't just teleport to her house, but you figured you could get an explanation about that later. While on the road however....</span></div></div>",

Apparently he seemed to be the only one living in this house for the moment. <i>\"That's strange am I the only person living in this house there's plenty of room, but only stuff for me here. Do I live alone in this reality?\"</i>  Jake thought. He explored every nook and cranny of the house and still had no signs of anyone else living here. It was then that he heard a knock on the front door.  Jake went and opened the door and much to his surprise outside of the house he was in was another house that too him looked to be quite gigantic. He went out and looked to see who knocked at the door. It was his sister, and to him she looked quite big. \"Hi Jake ready for school?\" Sally asked in a soft voice. \" How did you get so big Sally?\" Jake asked. Sally then tried to laugh as quietly as possible so she wouldn't hurt your ears. \" Silly I'm only five feet and six inches tall, and your only six inches tall it's always been this way.\" She said. \"I'm only six inches tall?! Then what about Joe?\" Jake asked. \"He's the same size you are Jake, you should know by now men only grow to six inches tall.\" She said. It was then that Jake realized that in this reality all men only grow to six inches tall. \" So wont I get crushed if I go to school with you then? Jake said looking worried about the possible dangers he would face in this reality. \" That's why you're lucky to have me as your protector you really forgot everything didn't you Jake?\" Jake simply nodded since he didn't know much about this reality and Sally seemed to be willing to give him some information. \" Alright then I'll just have to give you a refresher course then. As far back as we know men have only grown six inches tall. Though no one has ever been able to figure out why. In the past there were many women who used to enslave men and treat them like dirt, thanks however to the efforts of certain individuals the protection system was established.\" Sally said. \"Protection system?\" Jake asked. \"It's basically that for each man born there mother will protect them from any other women until they're married to another woman, then that woman will protect him, however if he has a sister then once the sister  becomes thirteen, it is that sister that will protect her brother, until he's married. With out this protection many women would still be abusing the little men in there life. Do you remember now Jake?\" Sally asked.  Jake nodded now understanding more about the world he was in.

The room looked like the same shape of his, but almost everything else was different.  There was no carpet, there was some sort of shower looking object instead of his bed.  All the shelves and objects on them were now gone.  The only things that looked familiar were the computer and the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, I can get out of this.\" Jake thought as he walked towards the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he felt a tingling sensation all across his body.<br>\r\n\"Oh no.\" Jake tried to say, but couldn't, the tingling force was keeping his mouth shut.<br>\r\nJake looked in horror as the skin on his fingers began to dissolve and be immediately replaced by some sort of metal substance.  His fingernails became some sort of hard plastic.  He could feel his legs begin to fuse together, and his face started to rearrange itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake started to breath really hard as he collapsed against the wall.  Something was very wrong.  In under a minute, his eyes began to see the entire color spectrum differently, as his head began to be filled with numbers, equations and information that he never contemplated before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake leaned forward, and noticed his body glided in that direction.  As he looked down, he noticed that a sphere molded itself under his feet, he could balance on it perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake rolled up to the mirror, and saw a strange feminine looking robot staring back at it.  Her long hair had miniature cords at the end of them.  Her legs and hips looked like a skirt.  As she turned around, she noticed a panel over her rectum.  Was it for excreting used fluids?  She had one on the front area too, but it seemed to be locked shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like she had metallic breasts too, \"what purpose did they serve?\" she wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face was odd.  It clearly mimicked a human female's exaggerated features.  between her lips was a voice-box, that looked like an intercom.  Her eyes were glowing blue and three times larger than the average humans.  She could feel the cameras and sensors behind the blue lens, recording and analyzing everything she saw.  She had a nose too, but it seemed ornamental.</span></div></div>",

Model F-12 query.  Access granted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake saw all the information get downloaded into her mind.  The virus was a terraforming device by an alien species who had decided to one day use Earth as their new home.  The problem was that they were silicone based, and couldn't survive too much exposure to carbon based life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Technoganic Virus, as it was dubbed by scientists, was a disease that transformed all living tissue into metallic objects.  It was really a bunch of self-replicating nanobots that would rearrange elements on an atomic level and adapt them to help adapt the world.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe virus adapted to become airborne, taking over most of the world within a year.  Although some humans had an immunity to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she consumed more information, Jake realized why he now had a feminine figure.  In order to maintain the new ecosystem, humans were converted into drones and acted like white blood cells.  Most humans became male drones.  Ones that were unable to think, and could only respond to commands and protect themselves.  They lost the ability to think, but were generally stronger, and produced more power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female drones, who almost looked identical to Jake, were like queens of miniature hives.  Each one controlling 20 to 50 male drones.  They were tasked with ensuring the male drones did their job, but seemed to have the freedom to act and think on their own as long as it didn't hinder or slow the terraforming process.  The female drones were some of the first to be adapted, as they watched the virus work slower on the population, turning them into the male sub-class of drones.

Jake focused her thoughts and found that she could at least control the speed of where she was going.  Although the faster she went, the more a little bar in the side of her internal vision dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer city block was barely recognizable as she went down the street.  Her neighbors had almost all turned into mindless male bots.  Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith were two male bots creating some sort of structure.  The whole Johnston family were also drone workers.  They only way Jake could recognize them was that her scanner popped up their original identities in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe is I make my rounds quicker, I'll be able to return to the mirror quicker.\" Jake thought as she increased her speed to full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, Jake's body turned around and started heading towards her home.  Her inspection came up with no issues, and she ordered herself to return to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Jake's vision began to flicker.  \"WARNING: LOW POWER\" her vision flashed at her.  Jake panicked, and made a mad run towards her house.  \"Error.\" the word popped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the sphere she traveled on stopped.<br>\r\n\"Awaiting drone recharge.\" her vision flashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rather large drone moved towards her.  Her vision told her it was her friend Mike.  Mike and Jake had grown up together, been in the same class and all of the same sports teams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mike approached, the words \"PREPARE FOR RECHARGE\" popped up in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe panel in her front popped open.  Jake leaned over to look at it, there was a small socket that lighted up.  As Jake looked at Mike slow down, a similar panel in his front popped open.  A long robotic rod popped out and directed itself towards Jake's socket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not Mike!\" Jake thought, as she realized how she'd be recharged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Model F-12: Override power transfer, initiate reserves.\" Jake ordered.<br>\r\n\"Denied.\" was the response.<br>\r\n\"Model F-12: To Drone/Mike: Abort\"<br>\r\n\"Denied.\" Jake's vision told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike slowed to a crawl to avoid any damage and soon his rod entered Jake's socket.<br>\r\n\"RECHARGING\" the words said in Jake's vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake felt a pleasurable buzz run through his waist and spread through the rest of his system.<br>\r\n\"RECHARGED\" the words said after 20 minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Jake rolled towards the mirror in his room.<br>\r\n\"Oh Mirror of Reality, grant me my desire that I seek to travel to another reality!\" Jake's speaker's buzzed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mirror glowed an eerie blue and Jake rolled towards it.<br>\r\n\"The next universe has got to be better than this one.\" Jake thought.</span></div></div>",

Fortunately the months did go by relatively easy and he learned more of this reality then he ever thought to have considered. One of the things he learned was that in this reality the first born has always been a girl and the second a boy. It was very rare for a couple to give birth to just two boys, or even two girls for that matter.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Jake had watched and observed his sister throughout the past six months, he didn't find anything out of the ordinary until today. His Older sister came home as usual but she was panting and had a nervous look on her face. She had carefully watched the windows as if she was being followed by something. As you approached her, she was suddenly startled by your appearance. \"Jake!\" She said as she panted and kept her eyes peeled toward the window. You look at her knowing that now might of been the reason you had to wait to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Is Something wrong Sis?\" You asked her concerned for  her well being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I don't want to put you in danger Jake, if I tell you now, they'll be after you as well.\" She said.

You knew that something was up and now was the time to remind her about the promise you two made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"We promised Sis, remember you can tell me, and I'll do what I can to help if I can.\" You said hoping those words would be enough to convince her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Fortunately they were and Sally took you down towards the basement as she began to explain. \"Alright I'll tell, but it's kind of began when I started working part time at Gemini Corporation, you know what I'm talking about right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  You nodded the six months you've been sent here you've learned quite a bit about Gemini Corporation. It was a company that prided itself in all sorts of genetic experiments. They did all sorts of things to various animals and plants that made people who weren't used to those type of things shiver in fear. \" Yeah I read all about them , and there genetic experiments.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"It gets much worse then the public knows, while I was working there I discovered they weren't just experimenting on plants and animals but humans as well.\" Sally said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  You gulped and now knew for sure this is what the mirror meant by saving sis. The only thing you didn't exactly know though was how. \"Humans? They didn't experiment on you did they?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Sally then shook her head. \"No, they didn't get a chance to. This briefcase here holds evidence of there illegal experimentation. As long as I have it I'm a target there looking to silence.\" She then continued. \"Furthermore the Humans the experiment on become nothing but genetic guinea pigs and are enslaved to do what ever the company wants them to do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   You knew what you had to do unfortunately time was running out.

So crazy that he considered it was a mere dream, until he tried to scratch his head, noticing that his skin felt odd, like that instead of feeling his hair, it was some kind of rough skin, like scales, further confirmed as he gets a glance at the reflection at a mirror place, followed by a shriek of fear, strangely high-pitched, but not without reasons, given he, or rather, she saw an anthrofied raptoress, of a soft silvery scaled hue, with a well-toned and athletic frame, on top of a generous pair of E-cup breasts. Her legs are digitigrade, that, after she stands upright, are supporting her body that she naturally keep bent sensibly forward, keeping her balance with her long tail. She tentatively moves and flexes her delicate three-clawed hands before she tries to grope her own cleavage. Her breasts felt supple and warm to the touch, even besides her nightie, that made her tilt onto the weirdest part of her body, given her chest, and, to an extend, her arms and breasts are around the middle of her body, standing horizontally. But before she could do anything more, a loud, yet familiar voice be heard, and it came from the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn anthropomorphic female raptor suddenly came from it and crashed right into Jake, in an awkward position given the newcomer's head stands right onto her own cleavage, while Jake's hands were inadvertly groping the newcomer's breasts, Just before she wakes up, 'Hmm.. Where am i..? And who are you..?'. 'Jake. What about you!?'. 'You're not Jake! He's my brother, a male human!'. 'You should have a peek at yourself, then!'. 'Wha..?'. The newcomer stands up, visibly unaware of what just happened, and peers at herself at the mirror. Her body is much similar to a human, only that her scaled skin of a luscious black, complimented by a white underbelly. And while her arms are much like a human's, excluding small claws on her fingers, her legs are much like Jake's, as Jake notices that both's feet are actually three-clawed talons with the toe on the inside of each feet being standing upward as their claws are curved downward. Also, the newcomer's body is balanced up by a similarly long long taim, aside from the fact that it tops a plump backside. Also, she bolsters a firm pair of D-cup breasts and a visibly muscular frame without being exaggerated, covered nudity by a white sports bra and a short jean. Then, the newcomer tilts on what happened as, after she cuddles Jake, she says, 'You're safe Jake..! A-after the mirror went white and that you stepped in it, i rushed at it right after you! I'm glad that you are safe and sound..'. 'Sally..?'. 'Y-yeah..'. Tears flows down silently, before they both break their enlaces to peer where they ended up in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room they stands in looks much like Jake's bedroom, with three main differences. Where the bed would be, a nest is found instead, with a pillow and a life-sized tyrannosaurus-rex plush. All the clothing, as expected, were meant to fit Jake's new body. And one poster that looked odd, given it represents anthro brontosaurus with enlarged breasts, an oversized belly and wearing a dragon costume, that Sally would've commented, if someone didn't knocked at the door, followed by a familiar voice, given it sounded like Jake's, saying, 'Breakfast's ready!'. They both look at each others, before Sally leaves the room, leaving Jake the time to swap her nightie with an ample black t-shirt and a black jean before following her sister up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe breakfast went fairly confusedly, but ended well with some explanations. Jake, actually called Jamiera in this reality, shortened to 'Jamie' as she acts like a boy, nicknamed at her own accord. Sally, named Camellia, is still your sister, with more or less the same life as before, at least, from what Jamie suppose. Both are also twins to their human counterparts, as their mother managed to be pregnant with quadruplets and to give birth to all, 16 years ago, of the brothers and sisters. Their mother, looking pretty similar to Camellia, was also muscular back then. But since her pregnancy, her muscles had gotten less pronounced, while she kept some padding. Badfully, their father wasn't from this world anymore, having passed away years ago from a disease. As for their aunt, she joined up the rest of the family, especially her sister, the mother of all four, soon after their father had passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Jamie also managed to gather some informations about the family, namely: All the females of the family tends to be bigger than normal due to their genes, knowing that carnivorous' average size is around 18 ft tall, and that herbivorous' is around 12 ft for the small ones and 26 ft for the big ones, while some of them can be as tall as humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Informations about the family:</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamiera \"Jamie\" Young<br>\r\n - Weight: 720 lbs<br>\r\n - Size: 25 ft<br>\r\n - Estimated max size*: 52 ft<br>\r\n - Age: 16<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamellia Young: (Sally from the human world)<br>\r\n -Weight: 680lbs<br>\r\n -Size: 23 ft 6 in<br>\r\n -Estimated max size: 53 ft<br>\r\n - Age: 16<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake Young: (From the dinosaur reality world)<br>\r\n -Weight: 155 lbs<br>\r\n -Size: 5ft 8\"<br>\r\n -Age: 16<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally Young: (From the dinosaur reality world)<br>\r\n - Weight: 162 lbs<br>\r\n - Size: 6ft 1in<br>\r\n -Estimated max size: 7ft 2 inches<br>\r\n -Age: 16<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir mother <br>\r\n - Weight: 1410 lbs<br>\r\n -Size: 36 ft<br>\r\n - Age: 47<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt Diane:<br>\r\n - Weight: 320 lbs<br>\r\n -Size: 14 ft (Has been changed from 46 to 14 with the use of the mirror.)<br>\r\n - Age: ?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(*: Size that scientists think they would reach when their body arz physically fully mature.

Speaking of which...\" Sally tells you, getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like my room, but a little taller...\" you say. Just then, two people burst into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick, grab the...\" screamed a tall girl that looked like your best friend Allison from the hips up, but from the hips down under her short skirt, she looked like a miniature Brachiosaurus, a sort of Brachio-taur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You jerks!!\" exclaimed the other girl, a spitting image for Sally's friend Jess, but has a Stegosaurus' tail swishing behind her, and was three feet taller than the friend Sally knew. \"How dare you trick us like that!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say what now?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet all those funky lights from that mirror was just some trick you guys set up in advance to mess with us.\" the sort of Allison said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm confused here.\" Sally asked. \"What are we talking about here? we just got here, and we're already talking with weird freaky versions of our friends...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freaky?!\" the girl that kinda looks like Jess belts out enraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're... You're scaring me...\" Sally cried, backing up defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anything can escalate, though, Allison puts her tail in the way. \"Something's not right, Jess. The Sally we know never got that scared when you blew your cool...\" Upon hearing that, reason seemed to come back to the stego-girl's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It worked, didn't it?\" Jess uttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, where's our Jake and Sally?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Sally look at one another in confusion, then simultaneously ask, \"Where are we?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next few hours, Jess and Allison explain their universe, and you explain yours, and what each of you were doing before using the mirror. \"So your species are called 'reprimates?'\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison says, \"Yeah... A small meteor hit the Earth 65,000,000 years ago and lowered the Earth's ambient temps. It forced the dinosaurs to evolve, taking forms that were smaller, and allowed the evolution of endothermic metabolisms in our ancestors. Over time, we evolved alongside the ancestors of your human race, but during the last two ice ages we became the more prolific sentient species.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So humans exist here too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Jess says, \"In fact, our Jake and Sally were humans as well. The human race lives alongside us reprimates, and recently equal civil rights were given to humans back in the '60's, but we used to not be so nice to them, even enslaving them in the past. Our United States even fought a Civil War over the slavery of humans in the 1860's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, dinosaurs didn't survive to evolve into reprimates, and become the dominant species on the planet?\" Allison wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. The meteor hit 65,000,000 years ago, but ours was much bigger, killed all your ancestors in our world, nearly took all life with it, but then mammals became dominant and then primates, and now humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally says, \"I don't want to sound rude, but I'm amazed how human-like you look, I mean, for evolving from dinos... Man I sound so shallow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess growls a little, but then relaxes, saying, \"That last part was a little rude, but I'll let it go since you aren't from this universe and didn't know better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison leads everyone over to Jake's computer as explains as she pulls up a webpage showing pics of various reprimates, and a anatomical medical chart, \"I believe we gained simialr trait by living in similar conditions alongside humans in primordial times, but as you can see, there are some differences.\" She points to the screen, at a female. \"As Sally noticed, female reprimates look more like humans than reptiles or dinosaurs, often the only differences being that we're about twice as tall as humans, and usually just have a dino tail. Some races have 'taur-like traits, like myself, while the female reprimates that evolved from pterodactyls and pterodons have wings in addition to tails.\" She then points to a more reptilian being, saying, \"...and these are our males. As you can see, our males heavily favor our reptilian and dinosaur lineage, some having snouts, some not, but all having claws, digititrade legs, and scales over their entire body. A recent trend some old people don't get that some of the more effeminate males, or metrosexuals, as we call them, do is to wear wigs. Some believe it's because they get jealous of humans and female reprimates' smooth skin and ability to grow long luscious hair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone laughed. After talking about this world's Jake &amp; Sally, you realize, outside of living alongside evolved dinos, they weren't too different from you two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, your Jake and Sally invited you guys to watch and see them off, did they?\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. They activated that weird mirror with some mantra and then, BAM!! Gone.\" Jess said. \"We looked for your folks, but they had just stepped out for groceries, so we ran back up here, and then ran into you guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna come with us?\" you exclaim, slyly. \"I figure I should of asked my best friend to come with me, but since I don't know how to get home just yet, why not take my best friend from another universe with me across the multiverse until we find that realm my aunt spoke of?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha... What...?!\" Allison blurted, just in time for you to declare the mantra again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then...</span></div></div>",

As he went outside his house and looked at the suburbs from which he lived he could easily tell that there was something incredibly different about it. Especially compared to the city he was from.  While most things looked normal there was no shortage of mythical creatures and other super natural beings. He looked on one side towards his neighbors and he can see them. His neighbors from the left side of his house were apparently had the appearance of fairies with the wings included on their backs. Although they weren't as small as he thought they would be. Instead they were normal size, Jake didn't exactly know why but either way he was awe struck by them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    As Jake turned his head and looked to the neighbors he had on the right side of his house, they were different as well. They weren't fairies though. As Far as he could tell they looked to be more like Centaurs than fairies. Especially with their bottom half being horse. Jake continued his walk and looked towards the city itself. The City itself looked like something out of fiction as the buildings and nature were blended as if they were one. Jake went and took a closer look at this city and he was still in amazement. For the first time in his life it made him want to think and experience what school life would be like in this reality. As he was looking dumbfounded a girl had approached him and Jake quickly found out that this girl was his girlfriend in this reality as she went up and kissed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Jake are you okay? You looked a little lost, so I thought I would use our wake up kiss.\"  The Girl said. Jake looked at her and saw that like many of the citizen she too was a Mythical creature.  She wasn't a fairy nor a centaur, in fact the best way you could describe her was that she was a cat girl or otherwise known as a Neko.  Jake quickly thought up several things should he pretend to be this worlds Jake or tell this girlfriend the truth that he was not the Jake from this world?

Despite being a Jake from another reality, Amber still considers Jake to be her boyfriend. Jake admires his loyalty to Jake's but also finds it a bit weird. The world is full of mythical creatures and his girlfriend is a Neko in this reality. Fortunately Amber fills you in on a bit more detail about this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \" Since you are a new, you must have been completely awe struck by this world and it's inhabitants? Right?\" Amber asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Yeah, but I think I have gotten a bit used to it just by being here.\" Jake says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Don't worry the Jake of this reality has been gone for over a year and still hasn't ever came back. So we keep getting new Jake's that appear through the mirror.\" Amber said. It was then that Jake learned that it had been a whole year since this Jake had jumped through the portal and that they kept getting new Jake's that popped in this reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Is there still a Jake in this reality?\" Jake asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" No, the others ones usually leave after a visit. But I hope you can stay.\" Amber said.  She then continued to tell you about this world. \" I am guessing you come from a world with mostly humans. That sounds interesting to me to be honest. This world does have it's fun but it gets boring after awhile. A little advice though, don't go out at night. That's when the Vampires and werewolves and all the other nightly creates come out and do their school and other stuff.  Some of them are not exactly friendly though.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Jake understood what she meant and Amber had lead Jake back to his house after his little city exploration. It was at this point Amber went and kissed Jake again. \" It's too bad though, even though we loved each other the Jake of this reality and me couldn't be together?\" Amber said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Why is that?\" You asked Amber curious of the reasons behind this Jake's living. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" Because the Law forbids relationships between Mythical creatures and Humans. I think it's unfair but no one is willing to stand up to it.\" Amber replies. Learning that this Jake had a girlfriend but couldn't be with her simply because the law forbade it, yet despite that had a girlfriend.  Jake realized that this Jake must have wanted to go somewhere, where he could be with his girlfriend without having the law say he can't.  As Jake thought about this he had an idea!

He couldn't exactly place it, but somehow the one that looked like his mother made him shiver in fear. He didn't know why that was, so he quickly followed the one that looked like his sister. It didn't take long but eventually he got used to his tail and then he went and dived under the water still following the one that looked like his sister.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   After miles of swimming he had finally reached the murky depths of  where this mermaid was going. It was a beautiful underground city. Filled with mermaids everywhere.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Good you made it here!\" The mermaid that looked like your sister said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" I thought you didn't see me, so Why now are you greeting me?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" See you? Ha! You were so slow I had to train you a bit while following me. It seems you got used to your tail finally. Glad you didn't follow the other one. Otherwise well let's say you dodged being a snack.\" She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Okay I've got tons of questions, can you answer them?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" My name's Shelby if that's one of your question. As for the other ones. Just go and explore this city I am sure they will be answered if you do that. Or I could take you on a personal tour?

His pants, socks, and shoes disintegrated, leaving his legs and feet completely bare. He then felt extreme pain in his feet as the bones within them started to shift around, becoming longer, harder, and his toes fusing into just 3 digits, like the talons of a bird. His legs followed suit, changing shape into the legs of an eagle. His underwear then disappeared, leaving him naked from the waist down. He felt intense, excruciating pain in his genitals as they changed shape from the genitals of a male to those of a female. He only got a quick look at his new genitalia before a brown pair of panties materialized on him, made in a shape that fit his bird-like legs perfectly. His shirt vanished just like the rest of his old clothes, and he felt the intense pain move to his torso, with it changing shape and becoming more hourglass shaped. He screamed as his chest pushed outwards, forming a pair of C Cup breasts. A brown bra of the same material as his new panties materialized on his chest. \"Please let this be over.\" He whispered, before pain came at his arms, he saw his fingers fusing together, and brown feathers growing form his arms changing them into wings. The pain then went into his throat, he screamed, only for his scream to sound more feminine than it did before, as his vocal chords changed to make his voice more feminine. The pain went into his head as his facial features reshaped, becoming softer and more feminine. Finally, his hair grew out and down, going past his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe, now she, looked around the room. It seemed just like her old room, except more feminine. Just then, she heard footsteps coming, as Sally opened the door. \"Jamie, what's wrong?! You were screaming like you were having a heart attack! Do we need to take you to the hospital?!\" She looked at her sister, who was now a harpy like her. \"Um, sorry about that. The pain went away.\" Jamie stammered, not sure what to say. \"Are you sure you don't need to go to the hospital? We could take you now if you need to!\" Sally replied, concerned for her sister's well being. \"No, that won't be necessary.\" What does Jamie do now? </span></div></div>",

Her cellulite pocked thighs smooshed together, forcing her walk to become a waddle, her ass was absolutely massive, sticking out like a shelf, it was so large that her panties and pants couldn\u2019t cover it completely, leaving a large canyon of asscrack, which you notice some people snuck love letters and thornless roses into, you seem to remember that being a common way to profess your love to someone in this world. Her belly was massive, it split into two separate rolls and covered her crotch, her breasts were now colossal, they had to be LL-Cups at least. Her beefy arms sported a pair of flabby bingo wings, and her hands were now chubby little things with sausage like fingers that could barely wrap themselves around a pencil. Her face sported three chins with the beginning of a fourth, and her cheeks had puffed up emensely. Despite her massive size, you actually felt a certain part of your body trying to stand and salute. As usual, her less fat, but still pretty fat friends crowded around her, they continued talking, until Jessica noticed you, she waved her flabby arm to you and said, \u201cHEY, Jake, could you come here and help me dig these love notes and flowers out of my crack, bunch of dorks, every one that put one there, but I know you would never do that, that\u2019s why I like you, Jake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her with a shocked expression and say...</span></div></div>",

Upon studying Jessica's derriere , Jake noticed just hoe fat her rump truly was. Far from the tone booty she had from his original reality, this Jessica possessed wide, cellulite ridden, globes of lard for an ass which she was clearly proud of. The old Jessica would have mentally broken down if she had a wobbly butt or even hint of cellulite as would any other girl from that reality, but here fat on female bodies were adored. This reality's culture even revolved around women having obese figures. Admirers really did place love letters, roses, and various gifts in the exposed ass cracks of women. Having copious fat deposits was a practical necessity here. Ladies used their deep cleavage as spare pockets, tactically pulling out money from between the soft orbs at the check out lanes.  Women were happy to offer their cushioned bodies as soft pillows to rest on. Winter time posed no hassle for women as their excessive fat insulated them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake began removing all of the numerous love notes and roses from Jessica's exposed crack. Pulling out one note only uncovered other notes shoved deeper between her butt cheeks. \"Thanks Jake, a woman of my beauty can't really reach back there so my little gifts tend to over accumulate.\" a giggle followed Jessica's words. Jake pushed his hands even deeper in Jessica's crack. Jake felt Jessica's huge yet soft butt flesh squeeze down on them. \"Ooh Jake, I didn't know you were so good with your hands.\" Complimented the blonde bomb-shell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh okay I emptied out your...uh..butt crack.\" Jake informed. Jessica shifted her hefty body to face Jake. Jessica opened her flabby arms out, initiating a hug. \"Oh aren't you a dear, helping my fat ass out.\" Jessica praised wrapping her chunky arms around Jake, pressing him into her immense tits. \"Happy to help out.\" Jake groaned, overwhelmed by the popular girl's girth. \"Now if you don't mind, I'm off to the cafeteria. A girl's got to keep her figure you know.\" Jessica waddled off followed by her chunky cohorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jake watched Jessica wobble off, the nature of this reality really set in. Every direction he looked there was fat positivity targeted at girls. Posters encouraging girls to eat, elevators service exclusively for females, separate meals, and gender designed desks (the girls' being much wider).  Every girl he saw was fat and happy about it. All the girls cared about was being fat and getting fatter. The halls were loaded with girls having conversations about gaining. It was as if gaining was a cherished sport in this reality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing walking through the halls led Jake to a flyer with an upcoming event on it.

Your heart is the purest heart that I have ever seen.  So, I am offering you a gift:  I am giving you a chance to become who I once was, and because of this, you will give our race a chance.  Farewell human, and may you live far beyond the 10,500 years that I have lived,\" the female voice told Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Jake passed out, and the next thing he saw when he woke up was a forest.  He sat up straight, and he checked his surroundings.  On his right was a pond of fresh water that has not been tainted by any human activity.  As he drank the water, he saw his reflection.  He (who is now a she) was a 10 foot tall Anthro Dragoness with golden scales covering her body.  Her wing span was 25 feet when fully measured at the widest point.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Well, talking about thinking outside the box. And speaking of outside the box, let's start off with something I would like to call 'Lightning-Bending'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for what this is, Lightning-Bending is where, as anybody can guess, someone can manipulate the high-voltage inducing element known as 'Electricity'. However, this isn't the same electricity that comes from modern-day electric generators, oh no. Instead, this element will come from only one natural force of nature; Lightning Storms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOriginally, this form of Bending came from the two sub-skills in Firebending, Lightning generation &amp; Lightning redirection. As the name implies, Lightning generation allows a Firebender to create &amp; guide a bolt of lightning from their very fingertips. However in physical terms, generating lightning involves the bender to move their arms in circular motions, guiding the lightning's direction rather forcefully controlling it. Those who mastered this sub-skill are capable of generating lightning at extremely high speeds, making it slightly deadlier than any other form of Bending, especially if someone is using or wearing something metallic in their possession. Those who are able to use Lightning generation include Fire Lord Ozai, Iroh, and of course, Princess Azula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Lightning redirection, it is also a Firebending sub-skill, only it allows a Firebender to absorb the lightning into their body as energy and release the electric energy toward a more desirable direction. This technique was developed by Iroh after he studied Master Waterbenders redirecting force rather than oppose it head-on. Lightning redirection works equally well for both natural &amp; generated lightning. Only three individuals were capable of redirecting lightning; Iroh, Zuko, and the Avatar himself, Aang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, since our protagonist Jake will have this sort of experimental Bending, his body will be able to generate and use massive amounts of this high-voltage element of nature, basically making him a walking human Mega-Generator. Plus, both Lightning generation &amp; Lightning redirection will both work into this new type of Bending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, ready to ride the lightning, Jake?\"</span></div></div>",

A small metal disk hung on a loose fitting, thin, leather necklace dangling about his throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat sort of strange world was this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter wading through the apparently neverending wheat field for almost a quarter of an hour, Jake finally stumbled across his first signs of civilization in this strange, new world: a rickety, wooden platform built up next to a set of railroad tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is so bizarre,\u201d Jake said to himself. \u201cI can't speak English anymore. I'm wearing a toga. And here I am, standing on a wooden platform in the middle of nowhere, apparently waiting for a train!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, Jake heard the far off whistle and distant rumble of an approaching train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I can't leave this place until I find Aunt Diane's mirror again,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI may as well sit and wait for the train. I'm guessing it'll have to stop for boarding at this little whistle stop of a platform.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed as Jake sat and picked at the hem of his short, tunic-like toga, the train did indeed approach and begin to slow as it neared the platform he sat upon. As the engine chugged more slowly and gradually ground to a halt, Jake was able to pick out some words carefully stenciled in purple-red ink on the side of the train: \u201cNova Britannia Pneumaplaustra-CCCXIII\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the steam engine halted, a bored looking soldier in a plumed helmet and breastplate casually jumped from the train onto the wooden platform. The man looked like an extra in an old costume drama movie about the Roman Empire \u2026 except the startling anachronism carried on his belt: a modern and very deadly looking handgun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you citizen, resident, or barbarian?\u201d the soldier asked in a quiet, matter-of-fact fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh \u2026\u201d Jake stammered, not really knowing the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome, come now,\u201d muttered the soldier impatiently. \u201cJust show me you blasted identification. This train has schedules to keep, by Jupiter. I haven't got all day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlaying a hunch, Jake lifted the metal disk attached to his necklace and held it up for the soldier to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, very good!\u201d said the soldier squinting at the metal disk. </span></div></div>",

As he was about to get up however he was pushed down by his own sister who had followed him through the mirror. So far he hadn't seen any of this reality or knew anything about it. He then got up after his sister Sally got up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Sally, what are you doing here?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" When that mirror thing of yours started to work I got a bit worried. So I came to make sure you would be okay.\" Sally said. As Jake looked around he noticed that it didn't look like his room yet the picture told otherwise. The room instead somehow felt smaller and looked as if it was dealt with less care. This Jake had no computer or any electronics in his room, but he did have a book on history at his shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" That book, it looks like a history book, maybe it can help us understand this world better.\" Jake suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" A history book, it would be easier if this version of you had a computer.\" Sally said.  Jake then began to read the book and saw Sally showed much more interest in the book once she learned of this worlds history. According to this world Women were always dominant over men, since Ancient times. In fact  the book even described that in Ancient times women were worshiped as gods because of their ability to give birth. Much of that worship today however was diminished mostly due to some people using that worship for evil and other nefarious things. Several other things were mentioned such as many of the people who were famous men in your reality were in fact woman.  Of course there were also some major differences as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      You looked around the room once more after finishing the book and noticed that the mirror was gone! \" Sally, the Mirror it's gone!\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" I guess we are stuck here then. I kind of like this reality though Jake what about you?\" Sally asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \" I just go here so I have no reason to hate it yet, but who knows that could change.\" Jake replied. The two of you then exited  your room where you both saw your mother of this reality for the first time.  From looking at your mother you could tell that she was someone important in the city.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The moment Jake stepped through the mirror, a wave of drowsiness swept over him, and he struggled to remain conscious. He would have fallen over if he was not already lying down. \"What?\" Jake tried to speak. He lifted his head from a pillow but quickly regretted it. His world began to spin, and he quickly fell back against the pillow again. \"<i>What... what is going on?</i>\" Jake had a difficult time formulating his thoughts. His mind was cloudy. Jake strained his brain to figure out where he was. The lights in the room were dim, but despite this and his groggy state, he could tell that this was not his bedroom. \"Where?\" he tried to speak, but his voice was rough. Jake realized his throat was dry and painful.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not supposed to be waking up yet.\" An unknown voice said from somewhere in the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you that the sedative was not going to be strong enough.\" A different voice answered. \"Let's up the dosage before they both wake up and accidentally hurt themselves.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThats when Jake noticed an IV attached to his left arm. And he also became aware of a dull, throbbing pain down the length of his torso. \"I'm in a hospital?\" He tried speaking, but whomever was in the room did not respond, probably not hearing him. Jake could barely hear himself speaking. He slowly turned his head, to try and see who the voices belonged to. All he could make out was a blurry figure adjusting something on a machine. His question went unanswered as he drifted off into unconscious bliss.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake drifted to and from conscious several times over what he surmised were the next several days, though he had no idea how much time had really passed. His only clue was the light that poured in from the single window in the hospital room. Sometimes it was strong sunlight, like from the middle of the day. Other times, little to no light came in, as if it were night. Finally though, he did begin to wake from his drug induced state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes slowly opened to a more lit room. Jake carefully wiped the sleep from his eyes, careful not to tug too hard on the IV still attached to his left arm. Jakes' mind was still cloudy from the drugs in his system, but he knew things felt off, different. He tilted his head to look down. At first glance, his body seemed normal. A thick blanket covered him up to his navel. A thinner sheet was laid comfortably up to his neck. Despite his drugged state, he figured that this reality's version of him just had surgery. He carefully pulled back the sheet to see if there was a scar. There was none, or no scars anymore. At first, he could not wrap his mind around it, still probably due to the drugs making his mind work slow. He just stared at his chest, or half of his chest. It looked like his left torso had been attached to a different person's right torso. He placed his left hand in the middle of his chest. While he could feel his whole chest with his left hand, he could only feel the touch of his palm on the left portion of his chest. He drummed his fingers along the right side of his ribcage but he felt no sensation from that side. The gravity of the situation did not immediately effect him until he noticed something attached to the top of the right shoulder. There was a second neck and a second head. His skin began to prickle at the wrongness of it. Jake quickly sobered, feeling the extra weight of a second, unconscious head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would have screamed, but his throat was still raw. Instead his breathing and heart rate began to rise as panic filled his veins. \"<i>What the fuck world, what reality am I stuck in!</i>\" He thought. Immediately, he felt it become harder to breathe. He looked at the unconscious teen beside him, whose breathing was slower. He could feel his lungs inflate and deflate irregular, like they were struggling to obey two different wills. \"<i>Do we share lungs?</i>\" Jake thought. He focused on the other head's breathing, trying to slow his to match. It worked. His breathing, their breathing synchronized, and he no longer felt like he might pass out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to keep a level head as he peered downward, trying to ignore the other person he was attached to for the moment. Jake instead attempted to determine which parts of his body are actually his. He could feel his left arm, his left leg, his side, his neck and half his chest. But that was it, the rest of him might as well be paralyzed. \"What the fuck!\" His voice was rough. \"I-I need to get out of here. I need to get the mirror.\" He tried to sit up but moved nowhere. The unresponsive right side of his body kept him down.  \"Stupid.\" Jake said to himself. He clearly could not go anywhere by himself. Jake forced himself to take several deep breathes to calm himself down. He reminded himself of his Aunt's message about the mirror. That this, whatever this was, could be undone, hopefully. He had to believe that or risk begin panicking again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone coughed, drawing Jake's attention. He turned to the only other person in the room, as the other teenage boy began to wake. He could not help but stare as the other head slowly opened his eyes and wiped the sleep from his eyes. The other boy licked his lips and cleared his throat. Jake could hear him part his lips and breathe. When the other boy coughed again, Jake awkwardly jumped. The teen turned and for a moment had the same confused look Jake thought he must have had when he first awoke. The guy cleared his throat and said in a horse voice, \"Uh... hey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake managed to reply with a simple, \"Hi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did we...\" He cleared his throat and started again. \"Did we wake up about the same time? I know the doctors say that our hormones would need time to synchronise after the surgery.\" The other boy turned to look around the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other boy did not seem panicked to see Jake. \"Um... I only awoke a couple of minutes earlier.\" Jake answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good.\" The other boy gave him a half smile. \"It would have sucked if one of us did not wake up around the same time as the other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\" Jake replied. \"Um... I'm Jake... by the way.\" He decided on introducing himself since he had no idea who he was stuck with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Jake, duh. We've only known each other since the Selection.\" The other boy smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake did not know what he meant by 'the Selection.' But, he figured it was some major event in this reality. He was about to ask the teen his name, when he noticed a couple of balloons beside the bed. There were also several cards propped open on the counter beside him. Jake quickly read one that wished them a speedy recovery and it addressed them as \"<i>Jake and Thomas.</i>\" He turned to the teen, \"Uh Thomas...\" Jake said, testing to make sure that was his name. The teen turned to look at him. \"...uh how long have we been out, do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The doctor said it would take a week before the healing was finished.\" Thomas said, matter of factly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\" Jake answered. \"A week...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure we're healed enough to try and move. Want to get out of bed and see what we look like?\" Thomas smiled, obviously believing this whole situation to be normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake had a million questions running through his head about the reality he was dumped into. But, he figured that asking those now would seem strange to Thomas. He would have to wait to get some of those answers. \"Yeah, I am curious about... how we look.\" Jake replied, which was the truth. </span></div></div>",

He said with a friendly smile. \"I've heard from my brother that it can be a bit of a shock, despite all of the preparation and simulations we go through before the surgery.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake felt the muscles down the center of his abdomen clench, and he knew that Thomas was trying to sit up. Jake braced his forearm on the bed and pushed his side of their torso up. The bed sheet fell down around his waist, revealing their shared torso and a single belly button. Underneath the blanket, Jake could see the outline of only two legs, and only one was his. The sight made him hold his breathe. It was completely alien. The right side of his body clearly belong to his other boy; the skin tone was a light brown which contrasted with Jake's paler, white skin. Down the center of their torso, their individual skin colors blended seamlessly. The body had no scars or stitches, no indication that they had ever been separate people originally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know... it is weird... seeing only one body.\" Thomas said, beside him. Jake watched in silence as Thomas used his hand to throw the blanket off. Jake was thankful that they happened to be wearing a pair of white underwear, which hid what was between their legs. Both trying to ignore that portion for now, he and Thomas then kicked the rest of the blanket off. Jake stared at the other boy's foot when Thomas flexed his toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake felt he was still in a dream, or maybe some kind of nightmare. His mind had a hart time processing what he was seeing. \"I guess we should get out of bed.\" He finally said out loud, turning his neck to face Thomas. The other boy nodded in agreement. Slowly, they rotated their hips and let their legs dangle off the side. \"Let's take it really slow. I still have an IV in my arm.\" Jake says as his eyes trace the tubbing up to a clear bag. It hung from a metal pole with two hooks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to the room suddenly swung open. \"We see that you are awake.\" A familiar voice stated. Thomas's head blocked Jake's vision so he could not see who had stepped in, but he did not have to wait long. The person walked around the room, coming into his line of sight. Jake tried his best not to look shocked. The persons, the doctors, who came into the room were joined to a single body, just like Thomas and he were. They wore a stereotypical white coat with a light blue collard shirt underneath. \"I don't think they need that IV anymore.\" The head on the left said, facing towards his counterpart. \"Mind if we help you with this.\" The other head said to Jake. All he could do was nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIncredibly coordinated, the two-headed doctor began to unhook Jake's arm from the IV bag. \"Hold your arm up, just like that.\" The one on the right said as his other half placed a gauze pad where the needle had been. \"How are you feeling?\" The doctor on the left said, apparently to both Jake and Thomas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Thomas answered. \"Just getting used to this is all.\" Thomas did not appear to be as fascinated by how coordinated the doctors were as Jake was, but he figured that Thomas was probably used to this though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth doctors nodded. \"It will take some time for you to adjust to the newness of your body, but that is typical for everyone after the surgery. Just be careful when walking around.\" The doctor on the left replied. They were now finishing with securing a roll of gauze around Jake's arm to keep the pad in place. \"There are some clothes in the bathroom that should fit you. Let the nurses know if they do not, or if you have any symptoms like nausia.\" With the brief check-up appearing to be over, the doctors left the room and let the door close behind them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake's and Thomas's bare feet were still dangling off of the bed. \"I guess we should go into the bathroom to get dressed.\" Thomas said to him. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jake nodded his head and on the count of three, he and Thomas slid off of the bed, landing on their two feet. Jake immediately felt a difference in his center of gravity. \"It feels like I'm going fall over to my right.\" Jake voiced his thoughts out loud. \"But I'm not because its like I'm leaning against...\" He paused, unsure how to articulate the strange sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An invisible wall.\" Thomas said, finishing Jake's thought. \"I feel the same thing, well almost the same thing. It feels like I might topple over to the left at any time.\" Thomas smiled sheepishly. \"Um... I guess we should each take a step.\" Thomas was staring at both his and Jake's feet expectantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" Jake responded hesitantly before lifting his foot from the ground. It was like he was hovering off the ground. He had not sensation of the support Thomas provided. His other half's leg provided supported their weight for the few moments it took for Jake to place his foot forward a step. One second after his foot touched the ground, Thomas lifted his own foot. Jake had the forethought to brace the muscles in the one leg he had so as not to cause them to fall over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, step by step, they walked towards the bathroom. Jake knew that if he was not sharing a body, he would have made it to the bathroom, relieved himself, washed his hands, and trudged back to the hospital bed in the same time it took Thomas and him to cross the room. When they finally made it to the open bathroom door, Jake held onto the frame for support. It was surprisingly tiring to maneuver a body when you only controlled half of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing all the way in, Thomas blindly flipped a switch on the wall, turning the light on. Inside the small, windowless bathroom was a simple toilet, sink, small shelf, and full-body mirror. Both Jake and Thomas paused to look at themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake had to force himself to breathe. It was completely disorienting to see their reflection staring back, the image of what for all intents and purposes was a two-headed boy. Just as he had seen from his brief examination before, a single torso, comprised of two used-to-be separate halves, were joined down the middle seamlessly. There was no defining line or ugly scar that bisected them. Jake's white, lightly tanned skin simply blended in the middle with Thomas's darker, toffee colored skin. More surprisingly since Jake did not play sports in school, he realized that their body appeared to be athletically built with a lean stomach. He caught himself staring in awe and wonder at this alien body he shared, rather than feeling terror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want to help me dress ourselves?\" Thomas said beside him. Jake turned to face him, realizing that he was trying to reach the clothes that were left on the shelf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake turned with him to face the shelf and reached his hand for the clothes. He stopped and brought his hand back to his side of their hips. \"Actually, lets see what our... you know what... looks like.\" Jake knew that there was only one hanging between their legs; he had felt it brush against a thigh he could not feel as well as his own. But, he still needed, wanted to see it. Thomas obliged, helping him pull down their underwear which fell around their ankles. Their blended skin tones proved to stretch over their entire body, from between their necks, down their chest and back, in between their shared butt, and down the length of their single penis and testicles. Jake did not quite recognize the penis as his own, since it obviously was some kind of combination of both of theirs. Jake turned to Thomas, \"Okay, now we can get dressed.\" He said; Jake's curiosity was satisfied. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Big shock number one occurred as Jake immediately fell to the floor as he passed through the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the heck?\u201d he mumbled, rising to his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room around him was completely different now. For one thing, all the furnishings had completely disappeared. Jake was simply sprawled out across a sparse, barren floor. The room itself was smaller than before, but well lit and quite clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jake rose to his feet, he discovered the next big shock of this strange new reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was also a considerably shorter, thinner person than he had been. The color of his skin seemed to have deepened as well. He was now wearing a long, navy skirt, a pair of white, loose fitting knee socks, and black maryjanes. A sailor-style white blouse with a red tie was on over his torso. Jake could feel long, straight hair brushing against the back of his neck as he looked about examining his new self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy am I a girl now?\u201d he whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he discovered big shock number three. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake was no longer speaking English. The words that came from his lips, in fact the very words that composed his thought processes right now, were Japanese \u2013 not English. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as soon as he had uttered something aloud in this strange tongue that he suddenly spoke with the fluency of a native, Jake had become fully aware of the non-English nature of his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm in some weird, parallel universe where \u2026 what? I'm a Japanese schoolgirl?!\u201d he muttered, staring down at the skirt wrapped about his legs and the tiny but firm, perky breasts pushing up from beneath his sailor's blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI've got to find Aunt Diane's mirror in this reality and use it to get someplace else,\u201d he said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he prepared to leave the room though, Jake happened to spot something that immediately kindled his interest. A textbook sat neatly propped up in the corner of the room, as though someone here had just been studying from it. The title read: <i>Hokubei-ken no zukai no rekishi</i> \u2013 The Illustrated History of the North American Prefectures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat sort of strange new world is this?\u201d wondered Jake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring he could always go off in search of Aunt Diane's mirror (or its equivalent in this reality) at some later point, Jake sat down with what presumably was his own school book and started reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvidently, in this version of reality the United States of America no longer existed as Jake remembered it. The nation was now called <i>Kitaamerikashu</i> and was a puppet state controlled, just like the rest of the western hemisphere, by Imperial Japan. The former United States was now populated by the descendants of several waves of wealthy Asian settlers who had re-colonized North America, seizing it from the Americans in much the same way as European settlers had taken the land from the Native Americans. Caucasians were now poor second-class citizens in this strange, new world. Having come from an educated, middle class family before, the only way Jake could have maintained a semblance of his prior life was to have been transformed into someone of Japanese heritage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd apparently a girl, too!\u201d he laughed, again looking down at himself, this time with more humor than shock. He sat in a most unladylike fashion, with his legs comfortably spread wide on the floor and his skirt draped between, almost like a blanket. He might have been granted the ability to speak Japanese in this new reality, but he had certainly not gained any of his analog's feminine poise or mannerisms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake continued to read more and more, becoming thoroughly engrossed in this weird, alternate history, delving deeper into the timeline of the textbook he read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJapan and Germany had won World War II. That much came as no great surprise by this point. The Nazis had conquered all of Europe with the exception of Italy. The Italians in turn ruled North Africa and the rest of the Mediterranean. The Japanese somehow had seized not just all of Asia but the entire western hemisphere! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jake plunged deeper and deeper into this new version of history, he finally came across what he believed was the fracture line that differentiated this world from his home. Apparently on Feb. 15 of 1933 in this world, an assassin named Giuseppe Zangara had killed Franklin Roosevelt less than a month before the inauguration. FDR had never been president \u2013 never even been sworn in! He was just a historical footnote: a president-elect killed before day one on the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout Roosevelt, the great depression lingered much longer and the succeeding presidents (John Nance Garner, Charles Lindbergh, Henry Wallace, and then someone called William Dudley Pelley) had all insisted on a strict policy of American Isolationism, refusing to be drawn into World War II \u2013 which apparently had dragged out much, much longer in this reality!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Senator Robert Taft ran against President Pelley in 1948, there were widespread accusations of vote tampering having been responsible for Pelley's landslide reelection. Millions of Americans who knew they hadn't voted for Pelley took to the streets rioting over the alleged theft of the white house. The U.S. Army had even mutinied, refusing to obey President Pelley's commands to restore order through violence. When the army itself had failed to support the commander-in-chief, Pelley suddenly became interested in the ongoing World War. He invited Japanese occupation of the United States to restore order. Forty divisions of Japanese troops were shipped to America. And although a brief civil war had ensued, the Japanese had won and President Pelley's power had been cemented. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly now, he owed allegiance to the Japanese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorld War II finally ended in 1950 when Dr. Yoshio Nishina perfected something called the Ni-Go Project \u2013 Japan's atomic bomb. It's successful use against a pair of small, Chinese towns marked the end of World War II, as well as the end of any meaningful resistance in puppet states like America. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the war, the U.S. Constitution had been repealed and the Third Continental Congress was convened to draft a new constitution. The result was <i>Kitaamerikashu</i> \u2013 the Union of North American Prefectures. The new nation was to throw its doors open to wealthy Japanese emigres, who would be given free homes and land as well as cushy government jobs in exchange for relocating to the new world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of history read like a strange, wonderland of Buck Rogers style science fiction with everything but flying cars! The new owners of America were wealthy, highly educated, technophiles who pushed grand, new industrial innovations upon their new homeland. High-speed monorails were built, electronics research was strongly funded, automated factories run by robots were produced, blazing fast computers were developed, space travel blossomed, and the world had quickly become a technological utopia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first satellites had gone up in 1953. Man had landed on the moon in 1959. Manned exploration of the asteroid belt had started in 1979. A plethora of permanently occupied space stations dotted Earth's orbit now, and seven small lunar cities existed in self-sufficiency on the surface of the moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHighly advanced holographic technology has become widespread, available for three-dimensional entertainment throughout the industrialized world much the way movies and television had been in Jake's own world. Likewise, vividly realistic virtual reality worlds were now possible thanks to the development of both ultra-fast computers and amazingly realistic holography. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe medical advances as well were astounding. A cancer cure had been developed back in 1973! Cloning techniques now enabled a severed limb to be re-grown. Genetic engineering advances had eliminated a host of a congenital diseases. The common cold still existed, but that seemed to be about the only disease this world hadn't yet eradicated!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe this world isn't so bad after all,\u201d Jake said to himself \u2026 in Japanese, with a high-pitched girlish voice, he noted silently.</span></div></div>",

The walls were pink color instead of blue.  The full-color poster of John Elway was replaced by one of New Direction.  The covers on her bed had a flower design.

Her brain was trying to cope with the effects of the transition to this universe.  She could tell that she was 16, the same age as Jack was.  She stood about 5\u20198\u201d and had an average frame.  Her long blonde hair was wrapped in a bun.  She could tell her formerly brown eyes were now sky blue.  She was what looked like a secondary school uniform, a white khaki shirt covered by a black jacket, a black and gray checkered skirt which reached to her knees and black dress shoes.  On the right side of her jacket was an insignia.  She immediately recognized it.  It was that of the St. Elizabeth\u2019s Academy, the most exclusive Catholic girls\u2019 private school in the area.  Some of the wealthiest people in town send their daughters there.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJanet\u201d a mature female voice called from outside the room.  \u201cIt\u2019s time for breakfast.

It was the first time she heard her new voice.  It was softer and higher pitched than Jack\u2019s.  She looked at the alarm clock next to an unmade bed.  It was about half past before 7 in the morning.  Janet panicked.  Apart from her name and the fact that she goes to St. Elizabeth\u2019s, she knows nothing about her new female identity.  She decided she should find the Mirror and try to return home.  She searched the bedroom it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDoes she find it?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her family was not even religious back in her own world so she hated the idea of being stuck in some preppy stuck up academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she walked downstairs she kept fumbling with her body trying to get used to the skirt and her new breasts feeling so awkward as she walked downstairs to see her family. Her dad was there and looked normal as she remembered however her mother was....different. She was must bustier and more voluptuous then she remembered. While she was always an attractive woman she never looked over the top sexy as this. Her mother was wearing a tight black dress with slits up both sides showing her long legs. Her hair wasn't auburn like hers anymore, it was jet black and long...it was so long in fact that it actually touched the ground cascading down her back. Her nails were painted a matching black and her lips were covered in black lipstick. She looked like some kind of gothic sex object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking down stairs Janet felt really weird seeing her mother like this. \"Uhh...hi mom?\" She asked trying to seem normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh there you are sweety! I thought we wouldn't have time for pictures!\" She said in the same voice and tone she remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever all of sudden Janet's mothers hair began moving on its own moving like a third arm as it reached behind her grabbing the camera on the kitchen table. Janet's eyes went wide seeing that but her dad just smiled not taking any notice at all like this was totally fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I can't believe my only child got into Madam Elizabeth's! The same magical academy I went to!\" She said so excited as Janet's ears perked up at hearing magical academy. Her father soon walked over hugging her mother as they had Janet pose for a few pictures. \"Oh Harold, can you believe this is the last time we will see our daughter as just our normal baby girl? Next time we see her she will look totally different and be a strong woman and powerful witch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know Mary it's amazing we are so proud of you sweetheart.\" Her father said as Janet could only nod and agree. Hearing the sound of a car outside it looked like a bus was pulling up as her parents gave her one last hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember to call us once you find out your magic type but don't spoil your changes! We want to see our beautiful new daughter with our own eyes!\" Her mother said as they escorted her to the bus waiting on the corner.</span></div></div>",

Everyone there seemed just as normal as her and many seemed really uncomfortable squirming in their seats. Others were completly chill talking casually even making jokes about which magical type they wanted. Janet over heard two girls talking as she listened in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mother is an Anima so I'm really hoping to be one too, im hoping for either part bird so I can fly or maybe part cat so I can see in the dark!\" One said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well my mother is an Elemental she is so good with fire! I want to use it like she can so I can burn people who make me mad....\" The other girl replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet felt uneasy she had no idea what any of these girls were talking about...she barely even knew how to be a girl let alone some weird witch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat alone for part of the trip until on one of their stops a small shy girl suddenly asked to sit next to her. She was tiny, barely even 5 foot and she looked no older than 15. Her hair was cut in a short look barely covering her ears and it was a pale red color. She wore big glasses and her clothing looked huge on her body. She had no real breasts or curves to speak of and she seemed so fragile she might blow away in a gust of wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi....ccccould I sit here please?\" She said stuttering a bit shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh sure.\" Janet replied not wanting to be mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...I'm...Anna.\" She said trying to hide her obvious shyness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm janet. Nice to meet you.\" She said shaking hands trying her best to be polite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you seem...like a legacy am I right? Was your mother a witch?\" Anna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh....uh yeah...you too?\" Janet replied not knowing that was the term for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh....uh...no...I'm a new blood. Only found out I had magical potential last month. When the academy sent my family the invitation my parents tried to force me to stay but you know the law....anyone with magic must be trained so they can control it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah....that kinda sucks...but it doesn't seem so bad, why are you afraid of something?\" Janet asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah...the change terrifies me....I don't know what it will do to me! I'm afraid I may forget who I am. I've seen lots of girls loose themselves once they become witches.\" Anna said shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet had no real idea what kind of change she was talking about so she just tried to go along with it and hopefully make a friend for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least you'vr already made a friend.\" Janet said smiling as they talked together all the way to the school.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Janet asked Anna lots of questions in order to gain a better understanding of this world she was in. Apparently this world was very different from her own as magic existed but it was very strictly controlled. Anyone with magical talents was forced to train at special schools set up around the country, like the one they were going to. The change Anna reffered to was when a new witch goes through something called the \"awakening\" it was a ceremony where the inner talents of the witch were brought out resulting in often massive changes to the witches body and sometimes even their mind. The purpose of the ceremony seemed a bit confusing to Janet but no one here seemed to pay it much mind as it seemed to excite many of the girls. The other thing she learned was certain schools taught different magical studies. The school they were going to was famous for three arts many considered to be the most powerful but other arts were taught at other academies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived at the school janet and Anna followed he group but stayed in the back as they were greeted by a huge old building which looked almost like an old cathedral. It had massive outdoor grounds and many stories and it had a very gothic look and feel to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they approached the front door an old man stood at the door to greet them. \"I am professor Douglass new ones. Let me be the first to welcome you to Madam Elizabeth's academy. You have been chosen due to your magical potential and it will be your duty while here to study the art of Magic we degree is best suited for your body and mind. We have three schools here. The first is called Anima. This school is for witches that bound closely with animals. Their bodies take on the traits of the animal they most closely relate too and they train themselves to become one with their animal spirit and hone their skills through physical combat and training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second school is called Elemental. This school is for witches who can summon and wield the four elements earth fire water and wind. They bend these elements to their will and use them to devastating effect,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last school is called body weapons. This school teaches the witches in it to turn their very body into a lethal weapon. By manipulation of their flesh, hair, and nails they turn themselves into lethal and cunning instrument, Janet suddenly remembered his mother and her hair realizing that must have been her school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow we will proceed to the awakening ceremony where our council of judges will<br>\r\nDetermine your aptitude for these different schools. Once chosen there is no going back. Your body may also undergo certain....changes in order to best accommodate the intense magical demands of the school. Saying this Anna gripped Janet's hand tightly. \"Lastly the ceremony is done alone...however you may chose one other person here to witness yor awakening if they so desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Janet will you be my witness please! I don't want them to turn me into some kind of freak!\" She cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course I will.\" Janet replied getting more nervous about this ceremony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Each time he would call someone's name that girl would have to go before him and enter the door he was standing in front of. If they wanted a witness to their awakening that person would go as well. As they seemed to be going in alphabetical order Janet figured she would be called last.  However about half way down the list she heard the professor call out the name \"Anna Moontail\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna's face when pale white as she looked terrified grabbing into Janet's hand tightly. Walking up slowly to the professor she presented herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...I'm....I'm...Anna....this is my friend Janet she is my witness.\" She said as the professor looked down to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well proceed...\" He said opening the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking in the door together Anna and Janet walked down aing dark hallway only lit by small dim lamps that guided them to a large door at the end of the hall. Once at the door it opened slowly as an older woman wearing a long black robe stepped out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Madam Bethany....proceed Miss Moontail, Miss Young as a witness you may stay outside and watch through that window.\" She said pointing to a small window next to the door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't come inside? I want to be there this is really scary for her.\" Janet said trying to defend her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No....you must stay outside there can be no disturbances during the awakening.\" She replied as she guided Anns inside who looked back to you terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the room Janet could only watch as her only friend in this strange new world was taken and guided to a large circle in the middle of the room. In the circle there was a small table with an old silver cup sitting on it. Several more people suddenly appeared around Anna all wearing the same black robes as they formed a circle around her and the table. Madam Bethany then spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Anna Moontail.....welcome to your awakening. Here we will guide you by finding the proper ways to channel your inner magical talents. We will take a small drop of your blood and place it into the cup. From there we will fill your body with magical energies that will open up your inner magic strengths and reveal your true self. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Anna was too paralyzed with fear to resist as one of the instructors walked with with a small knife and pricked her finger as he placed her hand over the cup until a drop of blood fell into it. Suddenly a strange blue flame erupted out of the cup as the cloaked instructors began a strange and foreboding chant....</span></div></div>",

As the ceremony progressed the council of witches circling her began to watch the blue flame intently as if studying some kind of hidden message. Anna was trying to control her fears as she waited to here a verdict from them. Soon one of them spoke up as several of them nodded with eachother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Moontail...as a new blood it is our duty to find the source of magical potential hidden in your blood and ancestors. We have found it. It seems your family are decadents of the Moontail clan. Groups of lycanthropes who were once pioneers of Anima magics but soon became curropted by their animal instincts and soon fell into ruin turning into what we know as werewolves today. We see the potential in you to master this magic and tame the beast within which has haunted your family's legacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna's fears were suddenly realized as it seemed like she actually knew about this all along....\"please I don't wanna become one of those monsters! My uncle and cousins tried to get me to join their clan when I was 12 I just wanna be me! I don't wanna turn into some blood thirsty monster!\" She pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ENOUGH! It is decided! We eill unlock this potential within you child....with time and training you will master your fears....\" As he spoke the hands of each council member began to glow as strange waves of magical energy began shooting out of them and into Anna as she soon began to scream and cry out for help!</span></div></div>",

Janet tried everything she could to help as she slammed on the window and pulled on the door only to find they were magically sealed leaving with her with little options but to watch and pray for her to emerge safetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Anna was writhing around on the ground in pain crying out for help as the council members forced more magical energy into her body. They continued this process for about 5 minutes before halting as they seemed to check on Anna who had curled up in a little ball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The magical infusion is complete begin the awakening.\" The council all said in unison as Anna's body suddenly began shaking as she looked down to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...are you doing to me?\" She called out as she began rubbing her body as laid on her back and suddenly arched her back letting out a sudden loud moan.... \"Oh God! It feels....it feels so....HOT!\" She cried out as she began ripping and tearing at her clothes. She quickly ripped off her outfit only staying in her red bra and panties as she began rolling on the ground again as her body suddenly began to pulse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body suddenly began to stretch out as Anna's petit and small frame grew out as her legs and arms and torso all grew several sizes larger giving her a height of at least 5'8. Her body began pulsing with lean muscle as her legs and thighs soon grew toned and defined. Her hips widened more and her butt swelled tightening up. Her stomach flattened out and her arms pumped up with lean muscle. She soon had the body of someone who worked out a lot. Anna couldn't stop herself from moaning as she looke down and saw her two normally small breasts suddenly swell right in front of her eyes streaching out her bra until they become nice D-cups. Her body had turned from small and little to something quite impressive and defined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet stood paralyzed not sure if Anna was okay or if she should be jealous at the transformation. However things for Anna were just begining as she felt felt an odd pulling sensation in her ears. Reaching up Anna felt as her ears were suddenly growing and streaching coming to nice points as black fire sprouted on them! Her normal short hair also began growing down her back coming to her mid back also taking in a wilder appearance to it. Anna struggled to fight these chanhrs but couldn't stop herself as she felt herself falling to all fours like a wolf....she began moaning and even growling in a deeper voice as she felt her canines growing into long fangs in her mouth. Her finger nails were also growing turning into long sharp claws. Her feet suddenly began streaching as well as her soles were darker and thicker looking like paws as her toenails also grew into long sharp claws. Black fur was also sprouting on her body in certain places on her body. It grew in above her cleavage, her forearms, thighs, and calves. Lastly Anna starting to let out what was definitely a wolf's howl as her spine began pushing out as a long tail grew from her back covered in the same dark fur. Her changes finally coming to an end Anna soon stood up on her legs which were now bent at the knee as she stood on the balls of her feet just like a wolf. She let out a loud howl as she looked back at the window to Janet with new glowing yellow eyes....she had become some kind of wolf-human hybrid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet now stood outside terrified. Anna was right they turned these girls into monsters! She had no idea what they had in store for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2012/007/9/3/luna_anthro_red_bikini_by_locofuria_by_alfaluna-d4lkbq7.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2012/0...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Where once a small and petite shy girl was, now a tough, lean, sexual wolf-human hybrid stood. As the awakening ceremony ended the doors slowly opened as the council guided the new Anna out of the doors. Janet saw as she walked with a more seductive tone as she heard the clicking of her long claws hitting the ground as she walked. As they walked outdoors she gave Anna an almost hungry kind of look as her golden eyes seemed to pierce into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there Janet....did you like the show? I can't believe how amazing that was! I felt so scared at first but once I started to feel the changes I felt so....alive! I can't believe how string and fast I feel!\" She said smiling as she took a step back. Bending down she suddenly did a leap in the air at least 10 feet high as she did a perfect backflip landing squarely on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My advice is don't fight it....who knows what untapped potential lies within you?\" Anna said as she trailed one of her long claw like nails along Janet's cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anna don't you see, they changed you just like you feared your not the same person anymore!\" Janet tried to have her friend see some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anna was weak....she was a pathetic human hiding from a dark family past trying to hide her true animal nature and desires. My name is Luna now and I'm a free wolf. I'm not going to succumb to the weakness of the werewolves. Once I'm done training here I will show all the witches out there the strength of a true Anima.\" She said walking off as her tail waved in Janet's face before she was escorted out of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she knew what to think the council had already surrounded her and grabbed her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is time Miss Young.

This time the flame turned a bright red as the council began their chant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Janet Young. We see you come from a line of witches. Your mother was a graduate and a great student and so was your grandmother. We would expect no more than the best from you as well.\" They continued their chant as they began nodding to eachother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have found you worthy of the school of body weaponization.

It is the same school your mother learned and to great effect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet let out a deep sigh of relief. She knew at least this meant she could keep her normal human form and mind intact.

However she also couldn't back out of this thing and hope to retain her life...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the council members held up their hands magical energy owed from their hands rushing into Janet's body as she felt her entire body get wrapped up in a warm feeling that started to feel rather.....good.....she had no other eau to describe it. It felt like she was suddenly on a beach getting a nice tan while getting a full body massage at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt herself laying down other back streaching out her body letting out small little moans here and there as she wanted more. As she laid in her pleasure she noticed her light air urn hair was begining to darken. It soon became jet black just like her mother's. It was also growing longer growing past it's shoulder length down her back. Janet however wasn't even paying much attention anymore as she closed her eyes just absorting this new sensation as she called out for more. As she did the council members looked to eachother nodding as they contined the ritual on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe longer she remained under the magical touch of the council the longer her hair seemed to grow. Janet didn't even seem to notice however as she let out of a moaning sound calling out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More....please...more!\" She she did her hair contined to grow now past her butt and was quickly approaching her feet in length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we stop? This is the level her mother reached.\" One of the council members said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...her magical vessels seem to be much deeper let's see how much she can take....\" Another said as they nodded in agreement continuing to push the energy into her body. As they did her body began to change now as well. Janet soon couldn't control it she needed to get out of her confining clothes. She ripped off her clothes stripping down till she was full naked as she ran her hands all the way up and down her body feeling it start to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer skin became more tanned as her body began growing a streaching out. She grew several inches taller reaching a nice 5'8. Her legs were longer and more toned. She felt a weird sensation in her butt and noticed it was swelling larger and taking on a sexier tear drop shape her stomach flattened out and her arms lengthen. Her nails also grew a bit longer and changed to a bright red color as her toenails also changed to her match. Feeling a pressure building in her chest she looked down and saw her normal breasts starting to push outward swelling larger as she cupped them as if to help. Her breasts swelled several sizes larger reaching nice full DD cup size as they hung perfectly from her chest. Lastly her face also changed as her lips swelled a bit and her features defined themselves more. Her whole body looked much sexier as she begun to take notice of these changes only to be interrupted by another intense wave of pleasure as her hair continued to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet was rolling around moaning as her hair continued to grow. It was now past her feet and touching the ground as it seemed to almost be moving on its own. It continued to grow even more asnit soon reached 7 feet long and still growing as the council members began looking at eachother both in curiosity and worry having never seen one take this much before. The hair refused to quit as it grew past 8 feet, then 9....it finally reached slightly over 10 feet long when Janet finally opened her eyes taking notice of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! It's so long what am I supposed to do with this?!\" She called out lifting up the hair in her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The limit is reached begin the weapon branding.\" The council said as they suddenly began an different kind of chant as Janet's bidy began glowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at her hands Janet saw odd red symbols appearing on her. They seemed to form some kind of chain as they spread along her body. The marks soon began flowing a bright red as they burned badly for a second as they seemed to attach to her body tattooing themselves on her. She could a strange kind of energy coming from the symbols like it was connected to her very soul. Standing up Janet finally got a look at her new body as she was a bit shocked and stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs20/i/2013/051/e/e/my_goth_rapunzel_by_nimz-d13v8hn.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs20/i/2013/0...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The only way she could describe it was it was like they were opening doors inside her soul. Doors long held shut and when opened they unleashed years of strength, stamina, and knowledge training into her body. At first the sensations were incredibly painful. Much like what happened with Anna. She fell to the floor screaming as it felt like her bones were being repeadly broken then rebuilt then broken again. These sensations lasted for what seemed like hours even if it was really just a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the pain finally died down Janet laid on the ground struggling to maintain herself. The council was looking down at her waiting for they knew was the next stage in the awakening, the change. This is where her body would improve and adapt itself to the school of magic best suited for her. As they waited Janet suddenly began to feel strange...strange in a way that made her feel dirty and lustful. Thoughts of sex were suddenly assaulting her mind as her body suddenly began to ache and crave to be touched by anyone. Man, woman, it didn't matter at this point it felt like there was a heat building inside her had to be let out. Unable to contain this feeling Janet fell onto her hands and knees as she began groping her modest sized breasts and letting out a loud sensual moan of pleasure. However as she did her voice changed from a soft melody to a deeper lustful tone....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe council members began looking at each other with confused faces. They had never experienced a reaction like this before and especially not for anyone in the weapon school. Looking at the chalice the flame was still burning a bright red but it soon began to darken taking on a darker blood red tone...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Janet desperately tried to relieve the tension in her body she tried doing anything at this point. She even began running herself downstairs stroking her slit, desperately trying anything to no avail. Every time she touched herself it only made the heat and desires grow....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What....is....happening...to...me....I...can't....control....myself ...\" She said moaning in between almost every word. The council members began chanting to try and stop this but the flame in the chalice kept pulsing. As she lay there on her hands and knees the heat and desires were getting too intense...she felt like she was about to loose her mind as she tried to cry out when a sudden loud RIIIPP came from her behind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking backward Janet looked stunned. There was a huge hole ripped in the backnof her skirt and through that hole a long red tail had shot out of her back like a misle and was now thrashing about. It was well over three feet long and a deep shade of red. It also had a sharp point and thick red scales at its base. It looked like the tail of some kind of demon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet's eyes went wide with terror for a second as she stared at the long red tail flapping around behind her. She had never seen anything like it and she was terrified of what other changes were coming. Her skin soon began heating up as she stared down at her hands. Her skin was turning the same shade of red as the tail and it was spreading all over her body. Her fingernails were also growing longer and turning to sharp points as they also changed color turning jet black. Her shoes began feeling really tight as another ripping sound came from them as she saw her toenails had followed soon growing into long black claws which proceeded to shred her new tennis shoes. Her entire outfit began to itch as Janet soon tore off everything save her undergarments as she looked down at her changing body. Her skin was now a deep rose red and her nailsong claws but this was just the begining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet's body was pulsing now as she moaned and groaned at the sensations hitting her both painful and plesurable. She watched as her legs grew leaner and more toned as well as her arms. Her stomach flattened out and her butt began to swell taking on a perfect teardrop shape. Janet soon cupped her breasts feeling them starting to swell under her fingers as the soft womanly flesh expanded pushing past the size of a handle reaching into full DD cup range yet they remained perky and supple. At this point the lustful sensations had overwhelmed her senses making her cry out for more as moaned loudly showing off four sharp fangs as her face changed to a more lustful shape. Her ears grew to long points as she felt two nubs on her forehead. Like the tail they shot out of her head as two long horns erupted from her skull. Lastly her back began to ache as her shoulder blades began to push out as two large wings erupted from her back as they flapped around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensations soon subsided as Janet slowly regained control of herself. Standing up slowly she saw her reflection in a nearby mirror as she realized she had been turned into a true demon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://worldofoddballs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/succubus_by_arsenal21-d5b0r51.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://worldofoddballs.com/wp-content/up...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What she saw did little more than confirm what she already knew.  She stood about 5'4\" and weighed about 120 lbs.  She had shoulder length blonde hair and clear blue eyes.  Her face was attractive, though not supermodel material.  She was wearing a white tank top, blue jean shorts and tennis shoes.  She took off her tank top and gazed at the bra holding her 36C breasts.  She giggled as she pressed her hands on her breasts.  Embarrassed at her behavior, she quickly pulled her hands back.  She realized a part of her former identity still existed.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJanet\u201d a familiar voice interrupted her reverie, \u201cbreakfast is ready\"<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n        Janet recognized the voice of that of Jake\u2019s mother Helen.  \u201cI\u2019m coming, Mom\u201d she shouted back as she put her tank top back on.  It was the first time she heard her new female voice.  It was softer and higher pitched than Jake\u2019s.  She looked at the alarm clock next to the bed.  It was just before eight in the morning.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe noticed something on top of the vanity.  On it was a framed picture.  The photo showed a family of two adults and two teenagers.  The adults Janet immediately recognized.   They were Richard and Helen Young, her (and Jake's) parents.  In front of them was her, and to the right of her was a boy of.  All of a sudden a name came to Janet.  Samuel Young.  Samuel, or Sam for short, was Janet\u2019s fifteen year old brother.  She realized that Sam was Jake's sister Sally's counterpart in this universe.  She wondered what else in this world is different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs she was about to leave the bedroom, Janet had a strange feeling inside of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhat was it?<br>\r\n\t</span></div></div>",

Somehow, perhaps its from her newly acquired feminine intuition, she knew this orb was important.  She had the strange urge to touch it.

In this reality not only was he a apparently born a female he was also some kind of superhero, even if his costume was a little cheesy. As he fumbled around for a minute he tried to figure out what powers if any he had....however after about 25 minutes of trying everything he could think of nothing special was happening...He let out a deep sigh looking at his new purse pulling out his phone and ID. Apparently in this reality his name was Janet Young. His appearance was almost identical to his own if he had been a female instead. He was about 5'6 110lbs, 36 C-cups, medium blonde shoulder length hair. He was attractive but nothing too stunning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake (now Janet) began to sigh about the lake of super powers having always wanted to be cool superhero as he saw a text on his phone. \"Hope to see you at the costume party tonight.\" It read and it was from some guy named Steve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet was a bit bummed out as she realized she was just in a silly costume for a party and that he was just an average girl in this reality. He began looking around for the mirror to try and leave to find something more interesting when he realized it was gone! He looked around his whole room with no luck and without that kirror he( now she) was stuck here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring her search Janet saw something a little odd on her dresser. It was an odd looking red necklace. It had a large red pendant in in the middle and it almost seemed to give off an odd dark glow...picking it up Janet was surprised at how warm it felt in her hands. She decided to put it on to add to her outfit as a sudden intense wave of heat surged through her body! The heat caused her to fall back on her bed as she pantrd a bit catching her breath. She felt a little off at first but soon adjusted back to normal as she decided she had no choice but to explore this world until she could find the mirror to leave.</span></div></div>",

As she looked around on his way he noticed how strangely comfortable he felt in this female body. SHe was still getting used to the feeling of breasts and she hadn't dared to look downstairs yet...he had been shy as a guy and was still a Virgin in his own reality so he tried his best to supress any naughty thoughts until he could locate the mirror and figure out a way home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally arrived at the party seeing everyone else was in costume. She recognized the house as a girl named Tiffany from his own reality. Seeing her at the house she figured this was still her place but she had no idea of knowing their relationship or how this version of himself was even known around school? She began to hope she was known for being the nice quiet person same as in his own reality praying this version of him wasn't a slutty type or into anything too dangerous...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile at the party things seemed to go actually pretty well. It didn't take long for Janet to see people she knee and luckily it seemed like she had almost the same friend base as before. The guys she knew in her world were the same and friendly to her if not a bit More so. She also seemed to know and get along with almost all the girls. She still felt weird as her costume was a it revealing and the feeling of many lustful stairs from guys made her a bit uncomfortable. As the party progressed everyone suddenly paused in the middle of it as the host Tiffany called everyone to the living room to watch something on TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone check it out they got footage of the monster fight from last night!\" Tiffany called out as everyone rushed to the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot sure what kind of monster fight they were talking about Janet walked into the room and saw on the TV a news broadcast about an apparent fight last night in downtown. As they watched the screen all Janet could see was the blurry images of two humanoid like figures flying in the air as several odd Fire like lights came from them as they seemed to be colliding with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of monsters are those things supposed to be?\" Janet asked as everyone looked to her funny for a moment. She just then realized that these things must somehow be normal in this reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious Janet? This is the demon fight from last night, they only caught this piece of it but how awesome is that!\" Tiffany said as someone else spoke up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of demon was it?\" Someone in the crowd said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They think it was a greed demon posssessed some greedy lawyer to weak to resist its offers.\" Someone replied as Janet spoke up again now officially confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So wait...then who was fighting it? And how did that guy get possessed?\" Janet asked not even sure what was going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you feeling alright Janet? You should know this....You know that once a person turns 16 they become vulnerable to demon possession. Greed, anger, lust, sloth, envy, gluttony, and pride. The demons embody these emotions and seek out those who are weak to them and offer them deals of power in exchange for their bodies. This turns them into monsters with horrible powers but luckily we have a protector on our a side. That's who was fighting that greed demon. No one knows where she came from but a super powerful Lust Demon somehow turned on it's kind and began fighting for us. The clergy of course says that she is just as evil as those she fights but we all know there is something special about her.\" Tiffany explained as everyone agreed and nodded like she was explaining ABC's to a toddler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet felt really off now as the major differences between this world were becoming much clearer.</span></div></div>",

Except for this rogue Lust Demon everyone kept calling \"Midnight\" for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey why is the rogue demon called Midnight?\" Janet asked as everyone suddenly laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...because of her skin and her hair. They are Midnight blue...all other lust demons are blood red and black.\" One of the guys said still laughing as Janet's questions were apparently common knowledge for everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet tried to laugh it off and continue to play dumb while searching for answers. However the more she learned about this reality the less she discovered about the mirror. Know one had ever even heard of magical mirrors here and outside of the demons and clergy there didn't seem to he anything else magical about the this world...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the party progressed on janet tried to blend in again however this new information about demons kept prodding into her mind. She barely even seemed to notice her gender change at times feeling much more natural in this female body. She began to feel like she really was starting to fit in here. That was until she smell it...A stench...a foul one, like spoiled food. Like rotting garbage, however she couldn't tell at all where it was coming from, and the weirder thing was no one else seemed to notice...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does anyone else smell that?\" She asked as everyone just shrugged her off. Walking around the rooms she tried her best to follow the scent until she bumped into a random guy at the party. He seemed like a bit of a loner as he was a chubby guy stuffing his face with chips. He smell was coming from him! She knew it it had to be him! However no one else made mention of anything. She was about to say something to him but a of a sudden a sudden intense heat shit through her hands. It was similar to before but way more intense as Janet ran off trying to cool them down, that's when she heard the voice...a kind of whispering in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's him he is a gluttony demon we have to destroy him! I saw into his heart he means to devour the poor girl who lives here...she rejected him now he seeks revenge!\" The voice echoed in her mind as Janet rushed to the bathroom and closed the door locking it. Staring into the mirror she saw something that shocked her. Her reflection wasn't alone...standing beside her like a silhouette was the Demoness everyone was talking about, Midnight.</span></div></div>",

Janet's eyes grew wide as she felt her body stunned with bith fear and a strange kind of excitement...Janet's feet soon began to ache as it suddenly felt like her boots were several sizes to small. She reached down and tried to get them off but was too late as a loud \"RIIIIIPPP\" came from her boots as she suddenly saw her toes sticking out from the boot, however her toe nails had also grown into long sharp claws. Janet cringed as she felt and heard her bones popping as she watched her feet streach and grow as they suddenly popped into their shape forcing her to stand on the balls of her feet which now no longer looked human...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet couldn't quite tell at this stage of the change if she even cared what was happening to her she only felt mesmerized by her body's transformation. She attempted to stand up on her new feet leaning on the counter as began tearing at her silly costume stripped down to just jet bra and panties, feeling her body shifting more. Her legs grew longer as her knees popped taking in a bent stance to match her feet. Her whole body seemed to refine itself become sleeker and sexier as her features grew more enhanced. Janet soon felt the heat hit her chest as her bra suddenly started feeling tighter. She saw her breasts starting to swell as she couldn't help but let out a loud moan as they grew more than a cup size larger becoming at least full DDs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet couldn't help but moan and feel a bit excited at how sexy she was looking even with the weird feet and legs. Her whole body was starting to look like it was made to exude lust and seduction. Janet could feel he changes reaching their climax as her hair suddenly turned a deep midnight blue color as it grewinger cascading down her back till it touched her butt. She also felt a poking in her mouth as she saw she now had four long fangs. Her ears then started growing longer coming to nice long points. Her head also began pounding as she felt two nubs starting to push out as two long horns suddenly shot out of her head! Her skin had also started changing becoming smoother and turning a nice shade of blue. The changes were almost over as Janet felt her back beguning to ache. First it was her lower back as it felt like her spine was pushing out of her bodu as a long black tail suddenly shot from her. It was over three feet long and had a sharp pointed tip. Finally two large lumps began forming on her back as two large leathery wings suddnely erupted from her back and began flapping around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet soon began to stabilize again as she could only look to her new body in shock....<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2013/231/9/4/world_of_warcraft___succubus_by_pierluigiabbondanza-d6isus4.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2013/2...</a><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Any leftover clothing tatters vanished off her body as new armor like clothing appeared on her. Black metal bracers and leg guards appeared on her along with a black Thong like bottom which had a special hole for her tail. Lastly a matching black metal corset like gaurd covered her chest as well as pushing up her already impressive breasts.

I haven't had my fill....I'm still soooo hungry and you look so....tasty....\" He said licking his lips as he suddenly opened his mouth as it rapidly stretched open wide enough to swallow to an entire watermelon whole.

At first he wasn't sure why but as soon as he got a look in the mirror he saw his female self. Fortunately from the looks of it, the self in this reality apparently had an apartment, however as he looked around he saw that this wasn't just his female self's apartment but in fact she also had a few room mates. At first Jake thought the photo was fake.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  In his new body after still trying to get accustomed to his age and gender he found a diary with a lock that opened when his finger touched it. As he opened he read it and discovered that his female self here had two room mates both of them were aliens from another planet. however you all seemed to get along nicely. Reading the diary made Jake even more curious about this world and he decided to go look some stuff up on the computer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   He read the information and found out that  aliens landed on earth and instead of conquering the world they had helped solve most of humanities problems that still exist today, or at least in Jake's home reality. They first ended war, then they began to feed the hungry and created a World government with certain regulations and rules. One of the more unique things which you weren't exactly sure how you felt about it, was that they outlawed public religion, or the use of any firearms. Many were upset with this at first but eventually came to accept the terms.  Those who break the rules however are put through a vigorous re-education camp.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jake then realizes the first aliens that were to come to this planet after the world government and peace had been established had a humanoid body with four arms and at least ten feet tall. Both the male and female of the species. Aside from that their physical strength was about ten times greater than the average human, however they were far less intelligent compared to humans. Apparently this species was one of the friends of yours whom yourself in this reality shared a room with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The next alien Jake read about had a high intelligence and even could showcase abilities like telepathy, telekinesis, and even form a mind link with other species. They tended to be around four feet to six feet tall with light blue skin, and pointy ears. The one thing that stood out however was the gem upon their foreheads which amplified the power of their abilities. Jake wanted to read more however the door to his apartment or rather her apartment in this reality began to open as he got a look to see that it was...</span></div></div>",

To his surprise he can\u2019t believe what he is saying. He is a space alien! He is around 3 feet tall and his head looks like a egg on its side. His legs are slimy and feel like a mix between snake skin and a crocodile skin. They are green but his veins light up as purple. His feet have 3 raptor style claws each. His chest is made out of some hard material similar to a turtle shell but thicker as if it was metal. Veins coursing through the cracks of the torso and the arms have 3 claws on the end just like the feet except they feel sharp as knives. There are fins similar to shark fins running up the back of the legs, arms and back and stopping on the very top of the head. His eyes are in a deep cavern like hole in his skull and his teeth are razor sharp. At first Jake is startled about the realization that it is him.

A man asked him. Jake was surprised to see a man in his room where his sister was. \" Who are you? What have you done to Sally?\" Jake asked. The man then quickly responds, \"Whoa! Take it easy Jake, it's me your brother Sam.\"  Sam responded. Jake then looked  bewildered. He knew he didn't have a brother named Sam only his sister Sally. \" Stop pulling my leg! Tell me who you really are!\" Jake yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Sam saw thought Jake was getting angry and then quickly responds. \"I already told you, I'm your brother...\" Jake interrupts. \" I don't Have a brother! I have a sister and her names Sally!\" Sam then realized what was going on and quickly answered. \" Jake, Listen your not in the reality you were in, it worked! The mirror your Aunt Diane gave you.\" he continued. \" In this reality I'm your brother Sam, but it's obvious I'm your sister in the reality you are from.\"  Jake finally calmed down. \" So it worked? That's good.

Jake went with Sam to meet his Aunt Diane, although he was still confused as to why he called the Aunt Diane in this reality his Aunt Diane. At least until he remembered some of the words in his letter. After some thought he managed to deduce that this was the reality where the Aunt Diane he knew came from!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     It was late in the evening when Sam and Jake had finally reached his Aunt Diane's house in this reality. Aunt Diane came out and greeted us with a big hug. \" Greetings Jake, I take it you tried the mirror?\" Jake nodded. \" It worked as well, but can I ask how did you come across the mirror?\" Jake asked.  \" I see your curious about that, well let's get inside first then I'll explain everything I know about the Mirror of Reality. Jake and Sam then went inside his Aunt's house. \" Would you like anything to drink?\" She asked.

What would she need to do that for?\" Jake asked. His Aunt quickly responds. \" I'm just about to get to that, The Goddess of Reality exist in all realities yet has no real presence.\" Jake's Aunt Diane continued. \" Normally Gods and Goddess are worshiped, but unlike others the Goddess of reality has no worshipers and is responsible for guarding all of reality.\" Jake then asks, \" If she has no real presence then how is she able to exist? It makes no sense.\" His Aunt then replies. \" She has no real presence cause she can't go to other realities only view them, which was the original purpose of the Mirrors to let her view the various realities that she guards and protects. However there are many realities and as time went on there became too much realities for her to protect, she could no longer do it alone. She couldn't leave where she was either it would be too dangerous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I think I'm beginning to see how you fit in now, you were one of those she chose to guard realities she couldn't reach weren't you?\" Jake asked.  Sam was sitting quietly listening to the conversation between the two. \" Correct, when she found that there were too many realities and she couldn't protect them as easily as she could in the past. The Goddess of Reality then got an idea, she would select a certain few to protect realities she couldn't. I was one of them.\"  Jake then asks, \" You mean your not one anymore?\" His Aunt nods and then smiled to him. \" I can no longer travel to different realities, fortunately I had heard of your desire to travel into other realities and passed my responsibilities to you.\" Jake then quickly stood up. \" You mean? I have to travel to different realities to save them? Why?\" His Aunt looked at him calmly. \" Because what's happening to these realities, is that they are being manipulated. By someone evil whom has hidden from the Goddess ever since she created the mirror.\" </span></div></div>",

I don't want to see your panties! Sheesh, you're my brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d exclaimed Jake, springing to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Jake was wearing a dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long, frilly yellow sundress made out of some cheerful, floral print fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy am I wearing a dress?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause you <u>always</u> do,\u201d sighed Sally, rolling her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake squinted at Sally to make sure his eyes weren't deceiving him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was dressed in a dirty t-shirt, blue jeans, and a ball cap. Obviously still female, Sally was now dressed like a tomboy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake dashed to the mirror and gasped at his reflection. He was still physically male: an ordinary, sixteen-year old boy. Only now he had long hair hanging down a few inches past his shoulders, recently dyed blond from the looks of it. Tasteful makeup was applied to his masculine face: pale, pink lipstick alongside just a hint of silvery gray eyeshadow, blush, and a light coating of mascara to accentuate his long, girlish lashes. On his body was the aforementioned yellow sundress. Completely the outfit was a pair of wedge-heeled sandals on his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI always dress like this?\u201d he asked Sally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes you wear something more formal. That's just what you lounge around the house in. Jake, what's wrong with you today? You're being weird.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis mirror did it,\u201d insisted Jake. \u201cTell me you remember about the mirror, Sally. About it coming from Aunt Diane. And it possessing magic properties?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally slowly shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJake, maybe you'd better go lie down or something,\u201d she said. \u201cYou're really being weird. I'm going to go get mom and dad to check on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Sally left, Jake began tossing his room upside down in an eager search for clues about all the other ways this universe differed from his own. Every book, every magazine, every newspaper seemed to confirm the same thing: this world was identical to Jake's own world, except that male and female fashion had been completely flipped around. Apparently, since time immemorial the clothing of men and women had been reversed in this world. In whatever decade or century Jake looked at, the fashions remained the same \u2026 only the men were clad in the skirts and dresses, while the women wore trousers and other male attire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn the surface, it's only one tiny, insignificant difference,\u201d chuckled Jake. \u201cIt shouldn't make the slightest difference in the world whether a man wears pants or a skirt. And yet, here I am feeling like an absolute, raving lunatic for being dressed like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the possessions in Jake's bedroom were unchanged, indicating his hobbies, friends, interests, and outside life would largely be the same in this reality. Then Jake got to the closet: nothing but dresses, skirts, and fancy gowns. Likewise, his dresser was full of frilly blouses, cute tank tops and babydoll tees, some tight looking leggings, and of course a neatly packed row of panties and bras.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would I even need to wear a bra?\u201d Jake muttered, holding by his thumb and forefinger one of the lacy, alien-looking devices at arm's length. \u201cIt's not like I have boobs or anything.\u201d</span></div></div>",

But just as he was logging on, there was a bright flash followed by a thud. Jake turned around to see his sister Sally pulling herself up off the floor of his room dressed the same as she had been a minute ago but looking confused as if she didn't know where she was. \"Jake, what's going on here?\" She asked. \"Why are we dressed this way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sally? Is, is that you? You followed me through the mirror?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" Sally replied rather sarcastically. \"I used the magic toilet\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny\" Jake said as he turned back to hos computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's going on here. Why are we dressed this way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\" Jake started. \"Based on the little research I've done so far, for as long as clothes have existed men's and women's clothes have basically been flip flopped. Guys have always worn skirts, dresses and other girly clothes while girls have worn pants and whatnot\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, so what now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I figured we could hang out in this universe for a bit\" Jake said. \"It's a relative small change in the big picture, plus we still have to find the mirror in this universe anyway so that'll probably take some time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Sally walked out of Jakes room, clearly bothered by the fact that she would be for the time being dressing as a guy (or at least in her mind). As for Jake, he had more or less the same feeling. The thought of wearing a dress just felt so weird to him. But as he looked back at his computer he noticed that dinner was only a few hours away and it seemed pointless to change into something else that would make him more comfortable now. So after browsing through his Facebook Jake decided to head on downstairs and see what his family was up to. Walking was certainly different due to the heeled sandals that Jake was now wearing, and he decided to take them off rather than risk hurting himself by wearing them longer then he needed to. As he did, he noticed that his finger and toe nails were both painted red. And rather recently by the looks of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking down the hall and into the living room Jake was met by both his parents. His dad was currently wearing a yellow long sleeve tee shirt with a grey tank top underneath, a pair of blue jeans, and a pair of grey flats. His hair was still the same shade of brown and longer than it used to be, but short for what's considered normal for males now. As for his mom, well, she was dressed in clothes Jake would have expected his dad to wear. She was currently wearing a blue polo shirt with khaki shorts and a pair of white ankle socks with no shoes on. Her hair was cut very short, much like his dads used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his parents currently watching the evening news, and having no other plans of his own, Jake decided to join them in the living room. He sat down in one of the recliner chairs like he normally would have, until he remembered he was currently wearing a dress and had to adjust how he was sitting. Lucky, neither of his parents noticed. After about an hour or so Jakes mom got up off the couch and started heading towards the kitchen. She told Jake and his dad that dinner should be ready in about half an hour or so. Dinner, and the rest of the evening for a matter of fact, went by uneventfully as normal. The conversations were more or less the same, as was the food. In the end, Jake just decided to go to bed early. Once he was in his room he stripped out of the dress he had worn for most of today, along with the bra and panties, and slid on a pair of pink sleep shorts and a white tank top. He was about to crawl in bed when he remembered he was wearing makeup, so he sat down at a makeup station in his room and proceeded to do his best to remove it before crawling in his bed for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the question is, what does Jake have going on tomorrow?</span></div></div>",

He was quite amazed as his surrounding as he saw his bedroom in this area was quite massive and as he looked around he noticed that it looked more like a girl's bedroom rather then his. Jake soon felt his body start to transform to fit into this reality. His body slowly began to shrink from his former 5 feet and 9 inches height to an even five feet. His Brown hair grew in length and changed from a dark brown to an Autumn. His Feet then became smaller and went from a size 12 to a Size 9.  The transformation was unexpected on Jake's part and was a bit disorientating to him. The transformation however didn't stop there as he then his chest puffed out and sprouted a pair of well endowed breasts. He by then clearly knew this reality was transforming him to a girl to match this reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Amelia, are you ready yet?\" A voice yelled from beyond his door.  Jake felt a bit uncomfortable looking at his body, as it was his first time he saw it transform to fit into this reality. Of course he also Now had a little information thanks to the voice. In this reality Jake's name was Amelia. Of course he had yet to discover any other differences in this reality. He looked to see what he was wearing and watched as his clothing began to reform into a peach princess dress complete with jewelry and a tiara on top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door began to open and then he saw the person who called out to him.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWhoops!\u201d Jake said, tumbling down to the floor after passing through the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm, he thought. Everything here looks the same. His room was identical to the way it had been before \u2026 except \u2026 the mirror was gone! Did he really wind up in another place?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's your problem, doofus?\u201d asked Sally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d asked Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you sprawled out on the floor, upside down like that?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat a weirdo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSally! Jake!\u201d called mom from down the hall. \u201cI need the two of you to go fetch Moses and Miriam.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay this was new, thought Jake. Who the devil are Moses and Miriam?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, who is she talking about?\u201d Jake asked his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMoses and Miriam,\u201d answered Sally. \u201cOh, mom probably sent them to the corner store to get milk and the stupid, lazy slaves aren't back yet. It happens every time! I don't know why we even bother owning slaves. Mom always winds up making you and I do all the work after those lazy slaves \u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell!\u201d Jake exclaimed, surprising even himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally was immediately silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe own <u>slaves</u>?!\u201d asked Jake. \u201cWhen the hell did this happen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe've always owned slaves,\u201d Sally said with a casual shrug. \u201cWhat's with you today? Moses and Miriam have been with the family since before you and I were born. Mom inherited them when nana passed away. They were shipped up here and been with us ever since.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sorry, but they're <u>slaves</u>?\u201d Jake repeated slowly. \u201cThat's horrible. That's revolting. That's absolutely evil. I think I'm going to be sick, Sally! No one should be a slave. I can't believe my own family practices slavery! We actually <u>own</u> a fellow human being? And treat them like property?! That's despicable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCareful there,\u201d Sally said slowly. \u201cYou're starting to sound like an abolitionist. What's with you today, Jake? You never cared about radical politics until today. You must have landed pretty hard on your head just now! Tell you what: I'll go track down Moses and Miriam. You get your head together and stop acting like such a space case.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sally walked off, Jake busily began ransacking his room looking for clues as to what had happened. It didn't take long to discover a map of North America that identified two different countries: the United States of American and the Confederate States of America. Apparently, Jake's family lived south of the border in the CSA. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Jake managed to find some school books from this new reality. It seemed that other than baseball, apple pie, and the English language, there were very few similarities between the USA and the CSA. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA three-thousand mile long border of concrete walls, razor wire, and military checkpoints separates the two nations. Richmond Virginia is the capital of the CSA. Southern gentlemen are dapper, cavalier men of honor. Women are all meant to be Southern Belles \u2013 beautiful, graciously courteous, and exceedingly feminine. Rock 'n Roll, having its roots among black rhythm and blues performers, never caught on in the CSA and remains a strictly \u201cYankee\u201d cultural phenomena. The CSA celebrates bluegrass and blend of country and gospel, popularized by folk like Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Swaggart. Life seems to be slow, relaxed, and strongly faith-based, but with a seething pot of unspoken racism, sexism, and prejudice bubbling just below the surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTechnology is mostly the same, but with more emphasis on railroads or travel aboard a floating network of dirigibles that leisurely transported people and cargo across the continent. The real superpower of the world now was the German Empire. With no unified American military to aid in either of the Great War of 1914 or the succeeding Franco-German War, the Germans had triumphed early in the twentieth century and conquered all of Europe. They had spent the ensuing decades solidifying their rule and engaging in a space race with the Soviets. The Germans built the first permanent space station in 1972, a moon base in 1977, and landed men on Mars in 1983. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of the Americas, by comparison, seems interested in a space program of any sort, content to merely engage in a perpetual cold war of paranoia. Each side had guns, cannons, and missiles trained on the other, not to mention networks of espionage agents working to undermine the opposition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this was now the world Jake and his family found themselves trying to live ordinary, mundane lives in.</span></div></div>",

It's always been like that.\" she says. \"Basically, murder is a non-issue. People shoot, stab, immolate, and eviscerate each other on a daily, even minute-by-minute basis. Hell, killing the president is a minor citation at best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait? Everyone is immortal here?!\" Jake blurts out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Immortal?! Who said that?! Of course you can die!! You wanna die?\" Joe's mother retorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Basically, you know that show 'Avatar: The Last Airbender?'

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After jumping through the mirror in his bedroom, Jake immediately found himself \u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 sitting quietly at a table in a casino, his fingers slowly drumming across the green felt fabric of the table. All around him sat adults, dressed in tuxedos or elegantly sparkling evening gowns. In fact \u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026 yep! As Jake stole a glance downward at himself, he discovered he too was attired in a sleek, black tuxedo suit. Very interesting indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour win, Mr. Young,\u201d said a casino employee at the table. With a long pole, he pushed a pile of plastic tokens towards a bewildered Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, thank you,\u201d Jake said, clumsily collecting his winnings and rising from the table. He had no idea what game he had just been playing, and was consequently eager to avoid playing another round and losing what he had just so quickly gained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou win quite easily, Mr. Young,\u201d said a dark, hostile voice on Jake's right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned and saw a scowling, white haired man with an eye-patch and a fierce scar running the length of his left cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder if you lose as gracefully as you win, Mr. Young,\u201d the man growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI \u2026 uh \u2026 I don't know,\u201d stammered Jake, confused for a moment. \u201cI've never lost.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe comment just fell naturally from his lips without Jake really knowing where it had come from. Yet it pleased him to know he had irritated and annoyed this strange man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr. Young, we have a saying in my country,\u201d the man with the eye-patch said. \u201cOne time is happenstance. Two times might be coincidence. But three times is an act of war. You have bested me twice, Mr. Young. I pray for your sake that you don't not cross my path again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gain to the winner is always less than the loss to the loser, thought Jake as he nervously walked away from the strange character. He wasn't sure what type of odd new world he'd stumbled into, but it seemed quite evident Jake had already earned himself a mortal enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't mind him,\u201d whispered a hot, breathy voice in Jake's left ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned and found himself face to face with a stunningly, drop dead brunette woman in a shimmering, black evening gown and long, satin black opera gloves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe is a thug, Jake!\u201d said the woman. \u201cEven Dr. Colossus knows that. He only tolerates the fool for his brute muscle. You have nothing to fear from him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should know me better than that by now, countess,\u201d Jake found himself saying with a confident, almost arrogant air of self-assurance. \u201cWhen it comes to matters of duty and honor for my country, I don't know the meaning of the word fear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFear can be a useful tool,\u201d replied the countess, running her hand along Jake's chest. \u201cIt teaches us to avoid danger. Duty and honor will not serve you well when you're dead. Your trouble, Jake is that you see the world in terms of principles rather than people. You ought to surround yourself with humans instead of principles. They are easier to fight for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt the moment, I'm hardly interested in fighting anyone,\u201d Jake said, suddenly pressing his lips against this strange woman's mouth. \u201cI think I'd much rather make love than war.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is a time for everything, my dear Jake,\u201d answered the countess, playfully pulling away from Jake. \u201cAnd your time is coming later tonight. Good night, Mr. Young.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman sauntered away from Jake, hypnotizing him with the rhythmic swaying of her tight bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you can direct your attention away from the woman for a moment,\u201d came an irritated older voice from behind Jake. \u201cPay attention now, Agent Omega. I've gone to great lengths to rendezvous with you and deliver your gear to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake whirled around and came face to face with an older man with gray hair. He looked uncomfortably out of place in his tuxedo and seemed ill at ease in this swanky, posh casino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow look here,\u201d the man said, without bothering with introductions. \u201cI have the latest edition of your watch here. All the standard features are incorporated in it. You'll also find an enhanced explosive, a poison dart shooter, and a tracking device with a more extended range than you're accustomed to. Now, as for this seemingly ordinary ball point pen. When you pull this lever, you'll activate a stream of corrosive liquid capable of dissolving all but the most hardened metals. I've parked your vehicle out front. It's the new experimental model, so whatever you do Agent Omega, <u>don't</u> push the red button on the gear shift. It will activate an untested passenger-side ejector seat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake nodded silently, accepting equipment from this strange man \u2013 apparently an ally now, rather than the enemy or the prospective love interest he had previously encountered. Difficult as it was to believe, apparently in this new version of reality, sixteen-year old Jake was not just an adult \u2026 he was a secret agent on some sort of clandestine mission of daring espionage and adventure!</span></div></div>",

But before his brain could comprehend what was going on, he realized that he was staring at his sisters bush, and immediately passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he came to, his naked sister was there to greet him.  \"About time you woke up, I was worried we'd have to take you to the hospital.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake, still confused about the nudity decided to address that first.  \"Why are we naked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally sighed and rubbed her arms, still a little uncomfortable with the subject as well, \"In this universe there is no concept of clothing.  Shoes, socks, pants, shirts, underwear, never existed.  The climate is much warmer than our universe, and I guess they were never needed.\"  She shrugged, and Jake resisted the urge to watch his sisters breasts bounce from the action.  \"As far as I can tell, history is pretty much the same as it is in our universe.  Except for formal wear; that's just a fancy jewel necklace for girls, or a tie for men.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a mirror nearby?\"  Jake asked, not intent on staying in this universe any longer than he had to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally shook her head, \"if there was, I would've dragged you through it with me already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the conversation could continue, Jakes stomach growled, and Jake realized just how hungry he was.  \"Tim to m eat the family I guess.\"  Jake said as he eased himself out of his bed.

His mom and dad were standing around the kitchen doing their normal routine.  Mom was making herself a pot of coffee while dancing slightly to the music playing from the radio, while Dad was watching the news while eating his breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake knew his mom worked out, but there was still a little shock at seeing your mom bare-assed for alll to see, unconcerned with who may see her breasts and trimmed triangle---STOP LOOKING!!! Jake yelled at himself before he gave himself an aneurism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom finally noticed Jake and Sally standing in the hallway \"Oh!  Come in!  I just finished breakfast!\"  She gestured to the waffles and strawberries on the table.  As they made there way to sit down, their mom suddenly called at them, \"Aren't you forgetting something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake and Sally looked down at the table, at their mom, at each other and finally decided to chance it.  \"No?\"  Sally ventured cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed and pointed at a pile of folded towels on the couch.  \"You forgot to grab your sitting towels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake and Sally noticed that their dad was, in fact, sitting on a towel on the couch while he was watching the news.  \"Must be a sanitary thing.\"  Jake whispered to Sally as they grabbed their towels and made their way back to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" mom began, \"Your dad and I will be out for the next two days, so I hope you both get all the chores done over the weekend, and I expect you back home ON TIME from school today.\"  She was getting her purse together as she was saying this.  \"I you guys enjoy the weekend without us once you're done with the chores.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake looked over at the calander and saw that it was Friday.  That gave them two days to find the mirror in this dimension, after they get their chores done.  If they can't find the mirror, it wouldn't help to be grounded for a week or more, and be stuck here longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Dad picked up their things as Jake and Sally were wrapping up breakfast.  \"See you guys Monday!\"  Dad called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lunch boxes in the hall!\"  Mom called as she closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlone in the house, Jake nervously looked over at Sally and said \"Ready for school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally shivered a bit at the question.  \"Do you really want to see the old teachers naked?\"  Jake immeately shook his head.  \"Or just the cheerleaders?\"  Sally said slightly shaking her breasts, causing Jake to blush a very deep crimson and look away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"  He muttered quietly.  \"But we should get school and our chores out of the way quickly so we have as much time as possible to find the mirror.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally sighed and grabbed their backpacks, handing Jake his as they left the house.  \"I may agree with your logic,\" she said as the school bus approached their house, \"but it don't like it.\"  And the two siblings braced themselves for the naked bus ride to their nudist school.</span></div></div>",

Everyone already saw every inch of each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe halls though, they still had the crowded mass of student bodies, and Jake whispered to Sally \"I must've touched like twenty dicks and thirty boobs!\"  Sally told him that she had a similar count as him.  Then they reached their first class of the day (Sally skipped a grade, so she and Jake were in the same classes).  What was the clsss?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Jake and Sally walked into their history class, he was a little shocked at his teachers appearance.  At this point, seeing everyone naked was becoming normal, but his teacher, Ms. Smith, had perhaps the largest bush he'd ever seen.  He just couldn't look away, at least until Sally elbowed him in the stomach and got him moving again toward his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Smith was prepping the class for the finals coming up, and would be giving a general review of the covered history, and Jake and Sally looked a tad each other in surprise, what a better way to learn about the world?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly enough, the earliest pictures and drawing depicted humans wearing skins and simple robes, it wasn't until the Greeks and the Romans appeared that history changed.  Whereas in their home reality the Mediterranean cultures were casual with nudity, the Greeks laid the foundations that the Romans built on.  At some point early in Greek culture, everyone stopped wearing clothes, and the neighboring cultures followed, Earth seemed to be warmer in the universe, he noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the centuries, clothing simply never reappeared in Europe and North Africa, and the nude Europeans still built their empires and kingdoms, all in the buff, until the Mongols attacked.  The Mongols and the other people further East still wore clothes, and each saw the other as barbarian primitives.  There were several large wars to \"civilize\" each other, and eventually, the Mongols faded away as the Chinese dynasties filled their place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHistory played out as normal form there, except for the World Wars, they were referred to as the Global Textile Wars, to separate them from the ones from the colonial era.  The Asian countries attack the Western ones, attempting to finally civilize them, and the wars both ended in a stalemate, within each culture closing its doors and forming a Cold War that hadn't ended yet, in seventy years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that wrap up, Jake and Sally looked a tad each other in a bit of shock at the state of the world.  The bell rang, signaling the end of class, and they walked out toward their next class.  \"Well,\" Jake began, still trying to process the history they just read about, \"it would seem that's not the whole world is naked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"  Sally asked with a more than healthy helping of sarcasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake nodded before continuing, \"And it just means that we need to get out of here ASAP and find the mirror.  We don't want to risk the next war happening while we're here, the mirror may get destroyed and we will have to find an alternate, much harder way home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally's was silent as they walked down the hall before agreeing with him.  \"You're right.  And we have to get everything out of the way quickly so we can devote our full attention to getting home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake nodded and opened the door into their next class.</span></div></div>",

But what really surprised him was her breasts; they were massive!  While the largest he'd seen so far was Ms. Smiths's D-cups, Ms. Tampa's seemed to be at least an H-cup, or maybe a J, he never was good with these measurements.  'Well,' he thought to himself, 'that explains all the baggy shirts in our universe.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down before Sally could hit him again for staring, Jake also noticed another thing, Ms. Tampa shaved her crotch, which while it may have been the norm in his universe, his observations today showed that most women in this universe kept their bushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she went through her lesson, Jake really tried to focus, but kept staring at either her breasts or her crotch, and had to keep refocusing and trying not to look.  Thankfully, she had everyone reading a passage from the textbook, so he could get his mind off his teachers body.  But once they were finished and Jake looked up, he started praying that this class would end soon, for you see, Ms. Tampa was seated on her desk, with her her legs spread apart, and poor Jake was feeling like this was either the worst or the best universe ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, she was obliviously merciful to her student, and left this position to lean on one of the windows as she talked.  When she was done with her lesson, she went over to her desk to get papers to hand out for homework, and Jake had to force himself not to laugh at the outline of Ms. Tampa's buttocks on the window.  'Seems that the windows are a tad cold.'  Jake thought to himself, before he almost got an aneurism from seeing his teacher bent over, trying to get some homework papers from the very bottom of a drawer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all this was over, he went over to Sally \"I'm so glad this is only for Friday.\"  Jake said as Sally looked over at him, a knowing look on her face, \"I don't think I could last a full week having her as a teacher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally nodded, \"She did do a lot of questionably sensual things, didn't she?\"  That last part she emphasized by poking one of her breasts, laughing at Jakes expense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake just grumbled and continued to the next class with her.  \"Just wait until we got to one of the male teachers, and then we'll see how you feel about this.\"</span></div></div>",

Mr. Jameson was the teacher here, and while he'd always looked very thin in their home universe, seeing his nudist counterpart here showed just how fit he was.  Even though he was still on the thin side, his muscles were very defined, and Sally couldn't help but stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake saw this and nudged his sister, cocking an eyebrow at her flustered face.  Sally just grumbled and got into position to begin their stretches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGym was very distracting.  The warm up stretches had everyone bending and turning, and neither Jake or Sally could help but sneak looks at their classmates during this period.  It only got worse from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sport they were doing today was badminton, and there was so much jiggling and bouncing that Jake and Sally had trouble focusing on the game.  Sally was having a hard time avoiding looking at the gyrating penises that her male classmates had.  Jake similarly was having difficulty looking away from the bouncing breasts from his female classmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the class was over, they all headed into the locker room to shower, and once again, they were fish out of water, seeing their classmates bodies all soaped up.

Without clothing stores, there was much more variety in the mall, at least three toy stores, a good number of outdoors/camping/sports stores, and the food court was also pretty big.  They also noted that RadioShack was still a thing here, and so was Blockbuster.  Was there a technological difference in this reality compared to their home universe?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was when they finally noticed the biggest thing, nobody was using a cell phone, not even the adults for phone calls!  Unsure of what they'd find they walked a bit where they heard a few people having unrelated conversations, it sounded like a bunch of people on the phone, and they'd saw what confirmed their fears...payphones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it!\" Jake said, \"This universe officially sucks, let's get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally cocked an eyebrow at him, \"Oh, so nudity is fine, but the second that technological convenience is gone, you wanna bail even more?\"  She smiled a bit, \"Or do you just miss your porn USB?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake blushed, and muttered something under his breath, before they turned around and looked for a place to start.

Only the skeletal, charred remains of partially collapsed walls stood as a reminder that there had ever been a human dwelling in this place. The rest was all a jumbled mess of burnt and broken debris. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking his way through the pile of wreckage, Jake found very little here that looked familiar. Granted, everything was pretty well demolished. But even the bits of debris that seemed half-intact looked alien to him. The kitchen was littered with the wreckage of high-tech appliances that bore little resemblance to the more mundane machinery Jake's mother had used. What he suspected was the television set was a shattered screen almost twice as large as the TV he recalled his family owning. Outside amongst the overgrown thicket of weeds stood the smashed remains of what had once been a sleek, futuristic car \u2013 like something out of a science fiction move set in the not-too-distant future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is this place?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing answered but a cold, bone-chilling breeze answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake began to explore the neighborhood. All the houses and cars he found were in various states of destruction as well. Although Jake found no signs of human remains, neither did he discover any sign of animal life whatsoever. No dogs, no cats, no birds \u2026 and certainly no human beings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas he the only human being left on the planet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad some terrible war finally wiped out civilization?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd would he ever find this world's analog to his aunt's mirror?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout it, he would be stuck here forever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jake walked along, he began to hear a distant, high-pitched whine from over the horizon. As it steadily grew louder and Jake still failed to see any signs of activity, he began to grow nervous. Picking his way across the piles of rubble that was now his home town, Jake moved steadily towards the source of the noise, eager to confront whatever it was. Anything would be better than the eerie, unpeaceful, quietness that permeated the abandoned wreckage of human civilization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he was about to cross a particularly big pile of concrete and steel debris, Jake finally heard the delightfully comforting sound of a fellow human voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet down you stupid son of a bitch!\u201d shouted a young woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, Jake saw a short, scrawny woman dressed in the tattered remains of camouflage print military-issued fatigues. She was shaved bald, but still had an attractive, feminine face full of youthful energy. And at the moment, she wore an expression of both terror and rage on that face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a running jump, she careened into Jake, body-slamming him to the ground with a surprisingly powerful tackle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, what's the big idea?\u201d he started to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman instantly had one hand clamped over Jake's mouth. With the other hand, she grabbed him by the arm and roughly pushed him down into a seemingly random hole in the rubble pile. It looked like just a gap amidst the broken chunks of concrete and bricks. Once Jake had been flung down there, he discovered it was the mostly intact basement of some municipal building: a library, school, or maybe even city hall. The only light source was the trickle of sunlight making its way past the ceiling of mostly collapsed rubble above, so Jake couldn't see too well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a heartbeat, the woman in the torn combat uniform was down the hole beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep your voice down, Fresh Meat,\u201d she hissed at him. \u201cDidn't you hear the Vulture out there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? That buzzing sound? That wasn't any bird I've ever heard of,\u201d Jake whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you jackass!\u201d she whispered. \u201cNot a bird. A Vulture.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake shrugged and looked dumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA robotic jet-pod with rocket launchers and infrared scanners,\u201d the woman explained in hushed tones. \u201cZoneMind's Overseers have been flooding this sector with 'bot patrols lately. Don't tell me you haven't seen the Vultures circling in the skies? You just admitted you heard 'em!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm \u2026 uh \u2026 I'm not from around here,\u201d Jake said with a sheepish grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo kidding, Fresh Meat!\u201d said the woman, rolling her eyes. \u201cYou almost got yourself blown to pieces just now. There's <u>no way</u> you could have survived the Overseer's patrols the past couple of days. Who are you and just where the hell did you come from?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, my name is Jake Young,\u201d stammered Jake. For some reason, he felt his life might still be in danger if he gave this strange lady the wrong answer. \u201cI'm actually not from here \u2026 I mean, not even from this universe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked back at him skeptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, really!\u201d Jake continued. \u201cYou said it yourself. How else would I still be alive in this nightmare world? Listen, my aunt sent me this magic mirror and I used it to transport myself from one universe to another, and now \u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up,\u201d commanded the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I'm telling the truth,\u201d Jake protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't care, Fresh Meat!\u201d snapped the woman. \u201cThat's not my call to make. You're an anomaly. And I've got orders about what to do with anomalies. You're coming with me back to HQ, Fresh Meat. We'll let the colonel decide what to do with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I was just \u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo more talking,\u201d the woman ordered. \u201cGet to your feet. The Vulture has passed by now. Up through that hole. I'll tell you where to go. If you try to make a run for it or pull any funny stuff, I'll kill you where you stand. Now, move!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake found himself scrabbling up out of the hole and being directed across the bleak, rubble-strewn landscape, presumably to meet this mysterious colonel who would determine his fate.</span></div></div>",

Gone were every last remnant of twenty-first century garb, now thoroughly replaced by a coarse pair of breeches, some soft leather boots that barely rose to his ankles, and a dirty dark green tunic. A wide-brimmed straw hat sat atop his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jake looked around, he initially saw nothing but a typical rural scene. Jake stood on a lonesome, dusty dirt road. On either side of him sweeping fields of crops surrounded the road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Jake turned around and gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind him the whole time had been an enormous, stone castle \u2013 not the old abandoned ruins open to tour groups, but a solid, concrete version of something out of a Disney fairytale. Taut yellow and red flags and banners flew atop the tall towers high above him. Smoke came out from chimney holes scattered about the stone structure. As Jake listened, standing there in silent awe, he could hear the distant sounds of people busying themselves about the day-to-day process of life and work within the castle walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, Aunt Diane's mirror <u>really</u> works,\u201d Jake say, craning his neck up and staring in wonder at the beautiful medieval monument before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuzzah there!\u201d came a loud, authoritative voice from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake spun around and came face to face with a mounted knight on powerful, muscular looking white horse. The warrior himself wore gleaming, hard steel armor polished to a brilliant, mirror-like shine. He carried a shield boasting a stylized blue lion against a field of light gray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI say, peasant!\u201d said the knight in a strong, commanding voice. \u201cIs this the castle of Glendower, Lord of the Western Marches? Answer me quickly boy. I haven't all day!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh \u2026 I don't know, sir,\u201d Jake said, careful to emphasis the last word. He wondered if he should bow down before this mounted warrior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don't know?\u201d laughed the knight. \u201cExplain yourself, knave!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am a stranger in this place, sir,\u201d Jake said, careful to avoid looking up at the knight. He sensed it would somehow be impertinent for a supposed peasant such as himself to look a knight in the eye. \u201cI just now arrived at this castle myself, sir. I would greatly appreciate any guidance you yourself could give me \u2026 uh \u2026 sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA wandering peasant?\u201d boomed the knight. He was silent for a moment, then started laughing merrily. \u201cHow very marvelous! Truly, now I have seen everything. And believe you me, good peasant, Sir Rowan of Northchapel has seen most of what is to be seen in these lands.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, very good then sir,\u201d Jake said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat name do you call yourself by, good peasant?\u201d asked Sir Rowan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am called Jake Young, if you please, sir,\u201d answered Jake respectfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery good then, Jake the Younger,\u201d replied Sir Rowan. \u201cI take you as my squire. Together, we shall enter this castle \u2013 which I believe to be that of Glendower of the Western Marches. Unless it proves that I've been unable to read a map. Come Jake! We have quests to undertake, maidens to rescue, dragons to slay, and nothing but fortune and glory spread out on the path before us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSir Rowan spurred his horse to life and the steed began to trot towards the castle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake scrambled to keep up, unsure what else to do. He was a stranger in this strange land, and although he knew nothing about this Sir Rowan character, he figured it was better to have the knight as a friend rather than an enemy.</span></div></div>",
