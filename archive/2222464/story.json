He walks inside the front doors of the hotel, and his jaw dropped when he saw a bunch of anthropomorphic creatures walking through the lobby of the building.  He saw anthro of all types:  horses, cows, pigs, lions, tigers.  He even saw mythical creatures such as dragons and gryphons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe interior of the lobby had several shops such as a bakery, a pet shop, a diner, a spa, a clinic, and a few other places that he couldn\u2019t make out.  As he was looking around...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me sir!\u201d John heard a female say to him.  John looked directly in front of him to see a female white furred anthro wolf behind a reception desk.  \u201cDo you have a reservation with us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... yes, for Holden.  John Holden.\u201d you state in monotone as your mind was in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh!  Mr. Holden!\u201d the anthro female wolf said happily.  \u201cWe have been expecting you!  Your room is ready on the penthouse level, floor 11, room 1101.  As our most valuable guest who is staying in our penthouse suit, you have access to all of our hotel\u2019s shops, entertainment, and everything at very highly reduced rate of 95%.  However, if you choose to extend your stay for any duration of time, including permanent residency, you will be given access to everything here for a very low and affordable price.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, permanent residency?\u201d John asked in a baffled tone.  \u201cWhat do you mean by permanent residency?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you choose to become a resident here, you will be able to get all of our comfortable amenities at a very cheap rate for being a resident.  Plus, by becoming a resident, you have full control to any modifications to the room you chose.  Your room was last used by one of our former residents who was an elderly dragon.  He did leave a few of his belongings in there for whomever stays in his room next time.  Now, breakfast is served at all of our restaurants at any time of the day in order to cater to our guest\u2019s special needs.  You should also be aware that we are not liable for any changes that happen to you or anyone you come in contact with.  Now...\u201d the female anthro wolf reaches below the desk and brings up a small stack of papers, \u201cI need you to sign here to confirm that you have listened to everything I told you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn signed all of the documents that he needed to sign and handed them back to the wolf, and she handed him a key with a dragon\u2019s claw at the very end of the key ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright John, you are all set!  My name is Brooke, and if you need anything, feel free to ask me!  My number is also available on your room\u2019s phone as a direct dial line.  Also, to access your room, you will need to take the center elevator to reach the penthouse.  Inside the elevator, you will need to use your key to turn the look that says penthouse 1101.  Thank you John, and I hope you enjoy your stay at the Anthro Hotel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs John walked away from the desk, John stopped in the middle of the lobby and thought about what he should do first.</span></div></div>",

The goo they sell is called \u201cSpeciX\u201d, a goo that allows you to change your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dragon\u2019s Den - A Bakery that is highly themed to a cavern.  They currently have a special limited time item called the \u201cDragon\u2019s Brew\u201d, which supposed (according to the sign John read) brings out the dragon in you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeaver\u2019s - A restaurant themed to that of a Beaver\u2019s dam and their home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl Jewelry - A jewelry shop themed to a treasure room in a mountain side.

As he enters, he noticed there are several anthros browning the aisles looking at the merchandise and trying stuff one.  You saw a 12 foot hyena out on a large 3 foot long spiked collar and take it off and walk over to the counter.  You also see an anthro unicorn exit out of the vat of goo, admiring her body\u2019s appearance while slowly caressing her sides as she looks at herself in a full body mirror.  You then turn your head to see the back wall is filled with costumes, props, and more.  John decides to...</span></div></div>",

But then, he saw a few collars that caught his interest.  One of the collars he saw was completely covered in gold plating, giving off the illusion of scales.  In the center of that collar is a big, bright red ruby that just caught John\u2019s attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn also saw a jumbo sized collar that was covered in a ton of spikes, and looked so large that it would probably be a better fit for a crocodile!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn\u2019s attention then shifted to an emerald colored color with a jungle theme print on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Eh, might as well try it on,\u2019 John thought to himself while shrugging, picking the...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As John unbuckled the gold plated collar, he felt something was off about it.  He slowly raised the collar up and placed it around his neck, and buckled it.  He walked over to the mirror that was a few feet away and he looks at himself while adjusting the collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he adjusts the collar, he notices that his eye color was slowly becoming golden...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the...\u201d is all John could say before he felt the collar melt into his skin, embedding it into his body.  John screams in pain as he feels the collar embed itself firmly into his neck, but as soon as it started, it stopped.  He looked at himself in the mirror again, and he noticed the his eye color is now completely golden in color.  He touched the collar on his neck and it felt as if that part of his neck was covered in a golden plated scales style armor.  In fact, as he started rubbing that area, a tingling sensation came from his fingers.  He looked at his hands and watched as his fingernails grew out into the shape of sharp claws.  His skin shifted to that of the same gold plating that is found all along his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is happening to me- ahhhhhhhhh~\u201d John first started to say until he started to moan softly in pleasure as he felt his dick starting to throb.  John\u2019s moans again as his shorts and the rest of his clothing exploded off his body as his entire body began to cover itself in gold plated scales.  John then felt his body growing taller as it started to take on a more reptilian form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAaaahhhh... this feels so.... goood~\u201d John moans softly as his voice becomes a very deep pitch.  His body stops growing at the height of 15 feet 7 inches, and then John winced in pain as he felt a tail and a set of wings grow out of his back.  He then could not breathe, see, or hear anything as his face suddenly started to morph itself into that of a dragon\u2019s face.  As soon as his face finished reconstructing itself, John saw himself as a 15 foot 7 inch tall dragon that was sprouting two dragon dicks at almost 2 feet long each with a width of 6 inches.  His body was covered in gold plated scales that glistened in the shops light, reflecting a vibrant golden color on the ceiling.  The ruby that was once part of the collar now is on a pendant necklace that is fitted around your neck that has no clasp on it, making it impossible to remove.  You try to rip it off, but it wouldn\u2019t budge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is a bit of a problem...\u201d John stated to himself, pondering what he should do.  As John reached for the necklace, he noticed that the ruby glimmers slightly as his heart beats.  \u201cMaybe I should do something about this...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does John do?</span></div></div>",
