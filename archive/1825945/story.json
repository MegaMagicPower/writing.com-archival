I know i can give command to other people, but what else? mmmm...Let's try something more phisical.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>April, from now on you'll start to eat a little more than usual without noticing it, starting right now with the dinner that someone brought in here for me</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse went to the table and looked at the food, she whispered under her breath &lt;Man, it look so tasty but...i've already had dinner and i really shouldn't..&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Eat that food, it's no problem to indulge once in a while</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril smiled and started eating it and after a little time the plates where licked clean, she moaned a little rubbing her very lightly bloated belly with one hand while the words of Frankie settled down in her subconcious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You really liked that and you'll eat double three times per week from now on and..</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA suddenly knock on the door distracted you and April assimilated only the first part of your mental instruction, but it was the minor of your problems right now, because a male voice came from the closed door.<br>\r\n&lt;Miss Mallow?

But look at you!&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl, sheepishly tried to hide her belly poking out from under the t-shirt <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Mom, is not as it seems i...&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Well, Young Lady, it is as it seems, maybe it's even worse. Look at you, so rail thin, I must have been blind to not feed you enough. But from this moment on I swear I'll put some meat on your bones.&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia looked at her mom with a strange expression before looking in the nearby mirror, she couldn't see anything too strange, except her little bloated belly, but she didn't know she was undernourished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;You really think so mom?&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Yes, dear, we have to put some meat on you, otherwise you'll fall away.&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Well, in that case mom, I've got to tell you that I've taken two jobs today, both as taste tester, one for McDonald and one at the 'Filling out' Bakery near the mall. &gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;That's great, dear, but working, even in those healty places, is a tiring activity, you'll have to have a proper nutritional schedule to go on, but for that we will take care of it. now come into the kitchen, we were waiting just for you.&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia left the bakery box in her room then went into the kitchen, there she saw the table organized all around her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Mom?&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Seat dear, you dinner is about to start.&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia wouldn't have believed if someone had told her that she could eat so much, still she managed to lick clean each plate her mom brought her, for some she had even seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer meal had been two square of thick and heavy lasagna bolognese, for which she had seconds, an entire fried chicken with fries and onion rings , four sausages with mashed potato drowned in gravy, she had seconds of both, and finally six jelly filled donut, two eclair and two chunks of fudge cake with three scoop of ice cream and whipping cream each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she didnt know was that her little brother was messing up with her head, everytime Cynthia's body reached the limit he was there ready to substitute the fullness with hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the meal her pants couldn't hold anymore and the button popped giving her belly more space to grow, after dinner her mom left her on her bed with the television turned on to rest a little bit, before going to sleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Since she didn't want to fail at her first day of work she eagerly started to consume them, savoring the delectful taste and filling the script as per agreements with Susy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile munching and gulping them down her belly began, once again, to rise, growing more bloated at each bite, her shirt that had managed to resst so well during the day started to lift up in order to make more room for Cynthia's belly. Finally she managed to swallow the last fo the treat and with a chocolate flavored burp she collapsed again on her bed entering in a deep sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie, had remained near the door looking at her sister gorging, he had developed an hard on for the scene, and was currently steaming it off, while thinking of how big she would be after a full monthof this endless feasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following morning it was a bright day and, Cynthia was eager to start her new day, with only her nightie on she shuffled in her room till she found her slippers than went downstairs for her breakfast, on the table in the kitchen there was already a huge spread of food awaiting for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA steaming plate with four omelettes, two mounds of six sausages links both, a plate with 9 waffles drowned in syrup, two tall glass of orange, two of milk and two of hot chocolate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost doubled over just looking at the meal, her mother was lovingly indicating her to get on and start with her breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Mom? Are you sure?&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;You're a growing girl Cynthia, you need to be nourished. Now eat up quickly and then you can go.&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia suddenly didn't need further encouragement, she suddenly felt a ravenous hunger pass through her body and literally attacked the food on the table, devouring each item with greed. One hour later she was patting her bloated belly feeling contently full, so standing up from the table she started moving toward her room when suddenly her mom stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Cynthia, I know you just had breakfast, but would you like for some cake? My students made it at school but I grade it already and I don't want to throw it away.&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl, even though her belly was still full and bloated took the cake from her mother, starting to nibble on it, squealing in pleasure for the delicious taste then, cake in hand she went back to her room to change in something more comfortable in order to leave the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later she grabbed the keys of her car and left dressed in a pain of jeans and her favourite t-shirt, between the two her belly, still bloated from breakfast, poked out a bit. <br>\r\nAs soon as she was driving she went to the bakery and left the note to Susy, while waiting she bought and nibbled a couple of buttery donuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusi came back from the counter handing over the bill to Cynthia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Thank you, the description were precise and showing the plus and the worst, say would you like to earn a little bit of extra today?&gt;<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
