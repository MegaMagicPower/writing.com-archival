            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On a fine Tuesday morning you and your friend Damien decided to take a shortcut through the park to get to school a little faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking along with Damien while he is riding his bike(you forgot yours) the two of you pass the bathrooms and drinking fountains when your throat feels a little dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Dude I'm getting kinda thirsty I'm gonna drink from the fountain\" You say be for walking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay but I'm only going to wait a few minutes thou\", He hollers back. You go to drink some water from the fountain that is near the bathroom. As your feeling the cool water travel down your throat it starts to go form it's normal taste (not that great tasting anyway) to a slimy almost acid like taste. You immediately you pull away choking trying to get the burning feeling to subside. When it finally does you rub your head and start thinking of how that could of happened before leaving the bathroom. Suddenly dizziness hits you, feeling everything go black you fall down while passing unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n When you finally awake you feel unnaturally ..<i>bare</i>. Looking over yourself you gasp as you've come to realize that your naked. Blushing madly due to remembering where you are you look around for your clothes and hope no one has seen you. You stop though after noticing that something is wrong with your surroundings. You weren't certain but pretty sure that any of the buildings near this park where built as big as the one in front of you which looks several stories tall. Looking up as far as you can you see a giant sign on the door that says 'MEN' You try and figure out why that's on this building when your thoughts are interrupted by by a quaking '<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">BOOM!</font>'. You look around the noise created was deafening, where was it coming from? The noise repeated it's self several times and the you feel the ground around you begin to vibrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around fully you see two HUGE...things... moving towards you. they are far enough off that you can see what look like giant blue pillars riding out of the back of each, following the columns up your eyes grow ride and your jaw drops. You see the now titan size form of your best friend above you. That means the blue columns are his legs inside the jeans he's wearing, and the two giant things in front of you must be his now giant feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Damien?\" you gasp up at him. You see his head turn in your direction and wonder if he's able to hear you. All thoughts of that however are crushed when he lifts one of his feet and begins walking towards you while not even bothering to look down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a scream you take off realizing the danger your in as the giant sneakers are slamming on the ground closing in on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou force yourself to move faster but your hopes are dimmed a shoe shape shadow comes over you. Then in the same moment the shadow starts to expand rapidly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping to the left to avoid getting crushed you thankfully make it out of Damien's path right as his foot slammed into the ground with a violent <font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">BOOM</font> so hard, you and several specks of gust were sent hurtling away from it. He continues on walking not noticing that he almost crushed his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull yourself up to your feet and look for the guy who tried killing you. Damien has stopped walking and has taken a seat on a nearby park bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should you do now?</span></div></div>",

Both feet are flat on the ground as Damien is playing on his phone, so you take a chance and start to climb up it. The shoe has a mesh under layer that gave you several small foot holes allowing you to climb onto the top of the foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily you see that the shoe you are on lace is untied so he will have to tie it before walking. Waiting a few more minutes you hear Damien stop playing his game and look up to see him bend the shoe and reach his hands down to tie the laces. Noticing the the situation you run to him flailing your arms and screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damien! Hey down here on the shoe!\" you yell hoping for all your worth that he hears you. Thinking it worked due to him shifting his head and looking down at you, you come to a halt right at the start of the shoes tongue. Your nervous as he stares down at you. With a swift movement his hand is in front of you, as if to pick you up. You start to walk forward when his hand switches positions and the middle finger folds back into the thumb with the other fingers pointed straight out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou draw breathe as to scream when the middle finger flicks out at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien watches with mild interest as he mercilessly flicks the bug off his shoe and land about a foot away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tree trunk finger crashes into you with enough force to make you cough up blood, it doesnt end as the force sends you flying from the shoe. Shooting through the air you manage to end up landing in a bit of mud on the ground, saving you from a bloody end. Slowly you get up while coughing heavily. With  no time to rest Damien speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what do we have hear?\" he smirks threateningly down at you.</span></div></div>",

He puts his feet on the peddles while leaning his body weight forward and pushing off the ground simultaneously.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment he had started to walk off you took your chance and ran for it!. You sprint as fast as possible across the concrete trying to find someway to hide yourself... when suddenly you hear the loud motion of a bike chain and tires grinding into the concrete. In an instant a shadow befalls you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAMIEN PLEASE!\" you shout as loud a possible while turning around... Only to be met by his front tire slamming into you forcing you on to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain was swift and immense, you shout as the tire crushes everything under you knees before rolling off. Still partly alive you see Damien high above you on his bike when his foot shift back from the peddle and pushes down on the kickstand. Your shout is caught in your throat as you watch the massive piece of metal come shooting down towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head his ripped to the side as the kickstand has pinned you in between it and the ground, it had ripped you ear clean off. As blood pooled around you from you wounds you weakly watch as Damien's massive shoe touched the ground on it's tip and ever so slowly the rest of it followed quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou never even got to close your eyes as the newly applied weight to the kickstand closed the gap between it and the ground while obliterating your form for good with a quick and small <i>Crunch</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien only smirked as he heard the crunch before riding off.</span></div></div>",

The annoyance quickly turns into a smirk as he begins to slowly walk towards you making you feel like you could escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only problem was the closer each one of his booming foot falls came to you the greater your almost thrown on you stomach. You were running for your life when Damien kicked a foot to the side, brought it quickly forward and swatted you with it like a small ball. You see the foot come flying at you and with no time to dodge it the shoe slams into you and sends you flying sideways into the air; only to come crashing down a few feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slam ended up shattering most of the bones in your body. With you body flat on your stomach all you can do is groan and watch as Damien's giant sneakers approach you. with the little energy you had left you painfully force yourself onto your back in time to be in the shadow of Damein's sneaker, the red NIKE sign clearly visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well bug you gave a good chase\", he said sarcastically and began to slowly lower his foot on to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see and feel the black rubber of the shoe start to slowly press down on your hard and harder. Your started to scream as loud as you possibly could in pain, you only scream for a second with your ribs snap and the broken bones are pushed through your organs and forces up heaps of blood from your mouth slowly choking you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien ready to go to school and tired of waiting for you to come back presses his foot down all the way and twists it a few time's listening to the 'bug's' bones crunch underneath his shoe. He lifts his foot up and couldn't make out any recognizable part of the body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave a small chuckle before noticing that the head of the bug was still moving just barley. Instead of crushing it however, he hocked up a lugi and spit it out on your head. He finally got on his bike before riding off to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(your pov after the foot smashing)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are in unimaginable pain by the time Damien lifts his foot off you. Your godly surprised to be alive even in so much pain. You start to hope Damien will leave, but your hope ends when you hear a loud gurgling noise come from him. You look up in time to see him hock a lugi the size of your body at your head. Being unable to move any other part of your body after the foot smash you are plunged into the lugi the snot gluing all aiways into your body shut. You see Damien get on his bike and ride off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour last moments are spent in agonizing pain as you slowly drown in your best friends spit.</span></div></div>",

He parks his bike and rips off the piece of tape and goes inside the house closing the door behind him. By the time he makes it to the kitchen, the tapes adhesive was starting to weaken forcing you to grab onto it to keep from falling onto the wood tile below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Damien!\" A voice shouted making him stop moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" he responded as several footsteps where heard and into the kitchen came Damien's younger brother Colin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you seen my basketball?\" You looked up at Colin and were instantly transfixed on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was shirtless with a soft four-pack of abs. He had muscle from his arms all the way down to his ankles. They were not giving him a bulk over muscle look but just something to his form. He had blond hair that fell to just above his eye brows. He was wearing a pair of dark red and black basketball shorts that went to his knees. The leg hairs appeared to be trimmed down adding to the appeal. He was sporting a pair of black Nike Reax which looked to be brand new. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Check under the table, that's where it rolled last time\". Damien spoke before quickly turning around and walking up the stairs to his bedroom. The motion was so fast and unexpected that you felt yourself pulled from the tape. reaching your arms out you try to grab on to the tape to keep from falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you grab on?</span></div></div>",

Checking yourself over you find yourself only bruised in a few places, standing up the rest of the way you look around and try to figure out where to go. You just decide on which direction to take when your interrupted another set of booming sounds. <br>\r\nYou turn around and see that Colin has managed to find his basketball and has made his way to sit on one of the bar stools in the area. Taking a seat he pulls out his phone and makes a call, while doing so he idly starts to bounce the ball on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Behemoth form of your friends younger brother was captivating to you but you where horrified of the massive noise that the ball was making every time it hit the ground. Each time it touched it made an earth shattering BOOOOM! that sent tidal wave of force vibrating through the wood floor boards making you entire body shake. Slowly but surely you walk backwards in an attempt to leave the range on the vibrations, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour almost to the point where you feel you can turn away and run without Colin noticing you.  You start turning around when he misses one of the bounces and the ball bounces away and starts rolling towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scream and start running in hopes that you could escape the impending fate that rolling towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Colin's View</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright dude thanks for the ride see you in a few- Dammit\" Colin grumbled as the ball slipped from his hand and went rolling away. Putting his phone in his pocket he went to go get it. Walking up to the basketball he simply put his foot on top of it to stop it from moving, while reaching down to retrieve the ball he stopped when he noticed a small speck on the floor. He stared at it for a second before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit not another bug\" he complained while picking the ball up and standing up to his full height and glared down at the bug he was looking forward to crushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Your View</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so focused on escaping the ball that you ended up tripping on a small crack in the wood you crash down. You huddle up into  ball as the baskets shadow rolls over your form. You lay there waiting for the pain of being steam rolled to over take you... but hearing a few booming noises all the sound stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly opened your eyes to see your self in the shadow of the basketball but it that is not what has your attention. Looking at the top of the ball you see a gigantic footing resting on top of it, glancing up as high as you could you see Colin standing high above you. Not thinking twice you immediately start running towards your savior and start shouting to try and get his attention until you hear him speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit not another bug\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose words got you to freeze in place in a instant. You watch as he reaches down all the way and grabs the ball before lifting up it the air. After waiting for a few moments a smirk appears on his face.</span></div></div>",

Deciding that you still need to get their attention you walk over to Damiens foot and begin to climb his shoe.

You try to move several times but to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about another 3 minutes you hear another bell go off and start to sweat with fear. You see Weston's hand move out from above you and grab his backpack, he starts to stand up and his feet begin to twist into the tile. The noise it made was amplified at your size five times greater making your ears actually bleed.<br>\r\nFinally Weston stand up to his full height with his feet on either side of your tiny broken form. The smell of rubber is almost over powering as the teen above sways to the side while casually waiting for the door to the class room to open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weston! Please look down here!\" You try and shout to him but it goes unheard for how high up he is. Suddenly the foot that is near you lifts up a little bit but it easily lifts over you casting a shadow over half of you. Shifting ever so slightly the massive structure comes down on your arm with unimaginable force so strong that your arm put up no resistance to the giant shoe. You scream in pain as blood seeps out from under the foot. You reach over and start weakly beating the shoe with you right arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you slowly get used to the pain the foot lifts again though and shifts back a little bit before coming down again this time on your legs under your knee caps.you are filled with a whole new pain as you cant's see but you can feel blood start to form at what remains of your legs. You try desperately to pull your self away with you remaining arm but it is stopped as his foot comes slowly down once again smashing it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForcing yourself onto your back you look up to see his right foot lift all the way up to where it blocked out all light around you as it slowly lowers to the ground encompassing your entire body under it. As you stared at it the corpses of previous insect remains became visible until the soul of the shoe moves forward to the heel where the most of the body's weight is put on each step. The heel slams down on top your body and still keeps going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure builds to the point were you feel your body compressing under the foot.then when it will compress no further you feel the blood forced out of your smashed limbs allowing you to be compressed just a little further before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSNAP! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all out yelled as loud as you could as all your bones were crushed at once except your skull and neck but they were quickly going to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the worst happens as Weston pivots on his heel. it took only a second but it instantly smashed you skull into your brain killing you, but over kill is inflicted as he spins it twists your corpse into the tile turning your body into nothing but paste. it only ends when the rest of the class arrives and they all step in the remains of your corpse's paste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey you now know what a bug feels like when you step on it..</span></div></div>",
