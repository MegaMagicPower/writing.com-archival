I bet you learnt about soldiers that went and dyed for the queen and country happily and the Germans were a blood thirsty gang of Nazis with no care of life? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBet you didn\u2019t know for many of us Queen and country left us for dead. This is my story and the story of my platoon. I was a rifleman in platoon Back Alley. We were supposed to attack Germany from the south. Take them by surprise. \u201cCatch them with their pants down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, they had expected this. We were going to be air dropped in and take Munich. As we swooped round to take it, their guns opened fired. I\u2019d only ever heard our rifles go off on the firing range or howitzers on the war ships at sea, but never before had I heard something so loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune 6, 1944, Skies over Boarder of south Germany<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched out of one of the small portholes as another of our airdrop planes exploded as the Anti-Air guns hit the fuel. 30 more men down from which we wouldn\u2019t recover the dog tags. I looked down at mine, glinting in the morning sun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarrington, Jack<br>\r\nJ.R.W<br>\r\nX12345<br>\r\n23/2/1926<br>\r\nB-<br>\r\nChristian<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI simply stared at it, tuning out the explosions from yet another plane going down. That was me; everything I stood for, that piece of thin metal was me. If I lost this I was no-one. A nomad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gripped tightly and tucked it under my shirt again. The brief moment my hand was down my shirt I remember feeling my heartbeat. Only gently, but there it was pulsing slowly. I looked up, hearing nothing, but seeing panicked faces of my comrades. Yet I was calm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden jolt brought me back. \u201cOk men! It\u2019s time to drop! Get out near the door and when then person in front jumps wait 2 seconds then follow. Count 10 then rip the parachute! Good Luck!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was first out. The door blew open, and the cold hit me first. I staggered but did my bit and jumped. That\u2019s what saved me. As I fell out of the planes way an unlucky bullet from a German gun zipped through the cockpit killing the pilot. The Co-pilot was already dead from a bullet like the same. Only his death was quick. The pilot was shot in the chest, but even though he was dying he never said a word and kept the plane flying until every man was out. We saw it tailspin into the ground exploding. I would have saluted him if it wasn\u2019t for my 10 seconds being up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grabbed for my rip cord and\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Instantly I saw 3 men, one crouching behind the wall at the top of the stairs, the other two manning another machine gun positioned at the top of the stairs behind sandbags. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrenaline still pumping, I ran at the man standing and knocked him out with a swift whack with my pistol, as I thought at close range a rifle would be clumsy, not thinking of the dangers I stopped any future firing of the machine gun with a lucky well aimed shot into the bullet release chamber. If the gun fired again, it would most likely explode, igniting the other bullets turning everything around the ammo holder into Swiss cheese. Booting the gunner in the face silencing him, I tackled the loader who was now standing trying to draw a pistol. He fired, I punched, I was a demon, here was the enemy, he was ready to kill me, and he would not spare me a second thought. he got his boot under my chest and kicked me off. I flew across the room, while he scrambled up, and aimed his pistol. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA single bullet rang out\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

An ugly would in his forehead, began to ooze crimson liquid. I was breathing heavily, as the sickening thud of a body pierced the silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownstairs nobody new what was going on\u2026 A gun had unloaded and the unmistakable sound of a body dropping heavily as it dyed was heard, but who got hit? \u201cCLEAR!\u201d I shouted, a cheer broke out and men piled up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCareful of the gun, the chamber is clogged.\u201d <br>\r\nI heard a grunt in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was staring at the man I had killed as I walked over his corpse. I expected to find what I had been told I would find; a hideous man battle scarred from a war loving country. But it wasn\u2019t, it was a kid, no older than 17. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just stared then pulled his jacket off him and placed it over him. I sighed not knowing what to think, so far my commander had got it wrong already just off 1 hour into the fight. I wondered how the coast attack was going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that the men just took base in that building, using the radio to call in the situation, position and how many wounded, dead and POWs. But I as conscience thought came back and survival mode turned off the conversation between the German communicator came back to me\u2026 what was he talking about? I caught something to do with wolves\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, does anyone know German?\u201d I called out to anyone, I was replied with a shaky; \u201cY-yes?\u201d and up came a small man, from my reckoning somewhere around 20, obviously not a fighter, pencil behind the ear, a simple pistol strapped to his leg. I bet he hadn\u2019t fired it in his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you tell me what err... experiment, Wolf-Auge mu\u00df durchgef\u00fchrt werden means?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWhere did you hear that?\u201d His eyes sparkling under his round glasses, \u201cThe communicator guy said it\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if you remembered it right he said something like; experiment, wolf eye must be accomplished, does that make any sense?

I am meant to explain all this to you as I have orders that say we must assault and capture the base. Other platoons are dropping in and taking other bases and getting ready to do so as we speak.\u201d \u201cYou mean there are more of these bases? What are they doing? Why are they important?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed and sunk into a nearby chair rubbing hid eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not sure myself what their doing, but intelligence told me that they were doing some weird experiments, since these are on the outskirts and less defended, we think they are the less important experiments that have a low likelihood of working, we know inland, from spies, they have factories working on something called mustard gas. Don\u2019t ask me, I haven\u2019t the foggiest.\u201d He finished hastily as the little man inhaled to ask another barrage of questions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJack, I want you to lead the attack. I know you\u2019re a sharp shooter, but they\u2019ve told me you were just as good with the ordinary rifle, and after this I\u2019m sure these men would follow you to hell and back. Sorry, but you don\u2019t really have a choice in this. Get some sleep; you\u2019ll need it you\u2019re attacking at Midnight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d I replied automatically. I walked out straight back, but once I got down the stairs, the days events took its toll on me. Slumping my shoulders I walked out the building. Looking around me, I saw bullet holes riddling all the buildings; it was obvious the German\u2019s tried hard to hold the position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to the opposite building I opened the door, and looked in. The rest of the men had set up bunks in here. Several were already sleeping, a few just sitting and smoking. Walked up the stairs, I found an empty room, a window looking out into an alleyway, a drain pipe next to it. If the German\u2019s launched a surprise attack then I\u2019d at least be able to escape quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before I nodded off under my rough blanket, another solider came in and said something and laid a rifle at my feet with ammo. At this point sleep took over, I\u2019d be woken up at the right time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the night\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I nodded and got up and stretched, I thought through the plan. Move into a base, check out any scientific experiments in case they might cause any major problems, if so; destroy them. Try not to kill any civilians, from reports most scientists are conscripted from universities around the country and neighbouring countries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were heading in by truck, cloak and dagger style. We hopped it would take them by surprise as they would expect a long range assault from the looks of the amounts of snipers on the roof. But lucky for us, they were sloppy; sitting on boxes rifles several feet away, when we hit it would be too late for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re reaching the laboratory, Charlie will go for the sewage, watch yourself down there, we don\u2019t have a clue the kinds of defences. Warrington, your going for the roof. If you keep to the shadows you can get to the fire escape and climb the ladder, you don\u2019t actually go on the roof, there\u2019s an open window just before. If they close it, try your best to remain silent while gaining entry. If all goes pear shaped, don\u2019t stop, we have the element of surprise, the snipers on the roof will be picked off by our own men in the trees, so don\u2019t worry about getting out.

Spreading my body out as much I could without all of my limbs being ripped off by the force of the wind whipping past me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGritting my teeth I stared at the clouds parting and the ground coming into view still a far bit off, but even the snow on the ground wouldn\u2019t help me travelling at these speeds. I spotted the lake nearby which would be the only way to remotely survive a drop like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling my arms and legs into my body and forcing my body to rolls in the direction of the lake I now had changed my course for the lake, but I had to speed up if I was going to make it. The lake was still fair way off and the only way to force myself forward would be to position myself like an arrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTucking my arms and legs in again I now preformed several forward rolls to set myself up on course again then made myself streamlined. I was beginning to finally come into the area around the lake so I could actually land in the deepest part. It didn\u2019t really occur to me that at this speed the water tension would be like concrete or that the water might be shallow and even if I didn\u2019t die by hitting the water like concrete or crushing my spine by landing in an overly large puddle, the water temperature in this unnaturally cold area would be something like -2 degrees centigrade. I would most likely have a heart attack from the shock of the drop in body temperature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpreading myself out I made as much speed reduction as I could before it was time to get into a diving position and hope to what ever force watched over me that they would take pity on me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SPLASH* I hit the water a massive speed, but\u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
