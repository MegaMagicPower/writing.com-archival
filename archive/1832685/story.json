Fluttershy loved hanging out with her Zebra friend and wished she could more often. Sadly, the zebra-girl lived in the heart of the EverFree Forest, a wild and hostile jungle on the outskirts of Ponyville. Pony-Girls like Fluttershy often avoided such places but Zecora insisted on a visit. They chatted for a long time, so long that the little yellow pony-girl lost track of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my....\" She said looking up at a clock on Zecora's wall. \"It's getting really late. I should be going before it gets dark.\" She said with her ears lowered. Last time she was out when it was dark she was almost dinner for a Timber wolf, a terrbile wolf like creature litterally made out of timber wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I recomend you stay inside, when it gets dark, there is little places to hide.\" Zecora warned, the zebra-girl almost always spoke in rhyme, though Fluttershy was used to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No that's ok... I know the way home... If I hurry I should be ok.\" Fluttershy smiled, finished her cup of tea and grabbed her pack. \"Thanks for the tea Zecora, it was lovely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please use caution dear Fluttershy. I would be upset, should you die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy frowned but than smiled. \"Thanks Zecora.\" She said as she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just straight down this path, Straight to the cottage... And I'll be ok.\" The yellow pony-girl told herself. She swallowed as it got darker and darker all of a sudden. \"Oh My... I better hurry... I'm losing track of the path.\" she said in a worried tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nAn hour passed and the poor pony-girl was hopelessly lost. \"Oh Fluttershy...\" She cursed herself. \"Why did you think that last turn was a shortcut....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around worried as she heard sevral noises, natural ones that the forest made reguarly... but somehow these ones sounded more... hungry. And Fluttershy knew in her heart if she didn't hurry, than lost scared pony-girl would be on the menu...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing a twig break, Fluttershy let out a scared yell and started running forward. Not watching where she was going she slammed face first into a sign. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW!\" She said rubbing her face with her hand as she fell backwards onto her butt. She got up slowly and once her vision stoped swirling she looked at the sign.</span></div></div>",

Maybe they will have a place where I can rest for the night.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe turned right and started walking down the stone path. She eventually came to a place that was well lit with torches and had hundreds of statues everywhere. She smiled for a momment, thinking it looked lovely, But as she got closer she noticed something. Almost all the statues were of pony-girls and boys, like herself, but that wasn't the worrying part. The worrying part was that almost all of them had looks of shock and terror on their faces, some had looks of confusion, as if sculpted while off gaurd, not a single one seemed to hold an elegant pose. Each stood on a pedastel with no discription as to the artist. What frightened her more was that they were all... every single one of them, Nude. She blushed looking around at the pony-girls, they're breasts shown off and even their...ahem... lower parts... (Fluttershy blushed more) Were perfectly sculpted. She couldn't resist and ran a finger in between the legs of one that was in a horrified sculpt, her legs spread and her hands up in front of her face. She was a unicorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such detail.\" Fluttershy said She said blushing as she rubbed the statue's pussy for a second. \"The artist of these is really good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe than turned and covered her eyes immidiatly as she saw  a... rather excited looking statue of a pony-boy who was kneeling, a look of pure ecstasy on his face and in the process of beating off his own cock, his hand holding a death grip on his rather well endowed self, looking as if he were on the verge of an organism.. \"Oh my! I'm all for the arts and everything... But I certainly don't need to see that...\" She said with an amused little chuckle. \"Least not right now...\" She blushed. She peeked out from under her hands and smiled as she admired it. \"The model was certainly... gifted... Unless that's exatrated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I can assure you. It's not... care to join him?\" A voice behind her said, sending a chill down Fluttershy's spine</span></div></div>",

She also sported the darkest sunshades Fluttershy had ever seen, despite it being night. Fluttershy swallowed, as there was something very errie and intimadating about this mare, yet for some reason, she also felt more calm in her presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"What... What did you mean... Join him?\" She gathered the courage to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Join him in stone of course.\" The mare said smiling. \"I would allow you to pose with him...\" She caressed flutter's cheek and chin as she walked by her and over to the stallion and ran a finger along his shaft. \"He's been so lonely here... He was a petraphile.. a stallion turned on by statues... I caught him masterbating to one of my girls over there so I felt it only fair to make him stone forever... But I hear his voice at night... calling out... Wishing for a partner...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Fluttershy listened with great intrest.. every word the Medusa spoke sounded like honey to Fluttershy's ears, almost...hypnotic... She hung on to every word...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"A Partner....\" She half asked, half stated. \"Yes... Someone to spend eternity with...To complete him... Her lips wrapped around his cock, their eyes meeting for all time... Together forever.\" The Medusa grinned at Fluttershy, and the poor, unsuspecting pony-girl felt an even weirder calm... as if... As if she wanted to be this partner... to be with this stallion for all eternity...locked forever in stone. He was the most handsome stallion she'd ever seen... she couldn't live with out him....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Know anyone... who might be interested?\"</span></div></div>",

My new mind control spell works!\" The Medusa cheered and with a wave of her hand a new, albiet shorter than the stallions, pedestal appeared out of the ground. \"Climb up onto your new home deary and we will get you posed and... shall we say... stoned?\" She giggled as the pegasus-girl complied and climbed dully up onto the pedastal. \"Strip for me dear.\" Fluttershy nodded and took her clothes off, tossing them aside and stood naked, read to be posed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Now... Get into a kneeling position.\" Fluttershy did so, her hooves tucked cutely under her pert rump, her tail draping off the side of the pedestal. She smiled as she felt the Medusa take her hand and place it so she was holding part of the Stallion's shaft... Fluttershy could almost swear she heard the stallion moaned and couldn't help but moan herself, her wings flared out and she felt really horny all of a sudden. She looked at the cock her lips would soon be permanently affixed to and her mouth watered. Her free hand went down to her slowly wetting pussy and she began to stroke her self, Moaning further. She needed this... She needed to be with her stallion forever.... She looked at the Medusa as if asking permission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Go Ahead dear... He's ready for you, I promise you, he's moaning... he can feel you... Feel your hand... Stroke him and suck him hard my dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Fluttershy nodded and started stroking the stone cock as far as she could, the stallion's own hand blocking the lower half of it, and with a lick of her lips she  wrapped her mouth around the head and started sucking as hard as she could. Fluttershy wasn't a slut, but she knew how to give a stallion-boy  a BJ. She stroked her pussy until she was near climaxing herself, sucking as hard as one could on a cock made of stone...Oddly it tasted to her like a flesh one. She than heard the Medusa calling to her. \"Look up here my dear..\" She looked up to where the stallions eyes would be and immediately she saw only a flash of green. She felt her hooves and tail growing hard and rigid, the sensation traveled up, her hand and pussy frozen together forever, Caught at the bring of climax for eternity. It traveled all over her body and she gave one last moan as she felt her lips freeze forever on the stallion's cock, her hand frozen squeezing it tight, and finally her eyes glazed over with stone as Fluttershy's transformation came to it's end. Oddly she could still see the stalltion's handsome face staring down at her, see his eyes locked with hers. she could still taste his cock and it felt like she was still sucking it despite not moving. Fluttershy could not be happier, she would be spending eternity with the most handsome pony in the word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I'll leave you two to enjoy eternity together.\" the Medusa said chuckled, She'd given both a gift, that linked their souls together, they could see and feel only eachother, She etched a small plauqe near their pedastal \"Eternal Lovers' and than smiled at Fluttershy. \"Welcome to my collection\" She said before slithering off to await her next victem.</span></div></div>",

He is in a pose like running with a hook for a hand equipped for some slashing right before he was frozen, and an eye-patch on his forehead, lifted above his - not scarred - eye. Just about to slash what's in front of him, running, with a certain look in his eye just filled with the desire to get at what is most likely the Medusa. and near that pedestal, there is one without a pedestal at all. It seems to have the same kind of legs, but has longer ears, a shorter tail, and instead of running toward something, she is in a pose that suggests she is screaming. Not in fear, but in both anger and sadness. The statue looks like she is reaching to the fox with one hand, tears like a river on her face, and... half-strangling the Medusa?

The artwork here was amazing, she thought to herself, she almost wished she could meet the artist to congradulate them for such fine work...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        She walked around for a while and noticed a small house in the distance. \"Oh. Maybe I could stay there for the night.\" She said smiling. She began making her way there when in the corner of her eye she spotted some gold statues, unlike the marble ones from before. Blinking she walked over to them. None of these statues were posed with faces of horror or fright, but rather in regal and almost natural poses. They were also made of solid gold, which intrigued flutters. She also noticed plaques on their pedestals, each one stating the statue's name. She looked at one of a Pegasus-Girl like herself, who's wings were spread, her eyes closed and she was in a kneeling position with her hands like she was praying to the gods., a smile on her face. \"Dew Drop.\" was her name. Fluttershy blinked. She'd known a Dew Drop in school but hadn't heard from her in years. She'd never been one for modeling but Fluttershy guessed she got a job in it as this statue looked just like her. She was completly nude too, which was even stranger as Dew Drop, like her, was very shy and would never pose nude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Poor Dew... Must have been hard for her to pose nude like that...\" She said out loud. Suddenly her ears perked as she heard a very enchanting voice call her name. \"Fluttershy....Come to me Fluttershy....\" Her attention turned to an empty pedestal near Dew. She blinked looking at it... \"Come to me Fluttershy... Come to me.\" It said again. This was weird... Pedestals couldn't talk.... She walked over to it slowly and looked at it... there was something... oddly enchanting about it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I'm lonely fluttershy... I have no one... I need you... please... climb onto me... be with me forever....\" The voice in her head was very soothing. The Pegasus-Girl suddenly felt like she should climb onto the pedestal... she felt the urge to strip and pose and be with the pedestal forever. Suddenly in the back of her mind it all made sense... Dew Drop didn't just pose for her statue... She WAS the statue. Fluttershy's mind yelled for her to run but there was just something so enchaning about the pedestal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Please Fluttershy... be with me... Be with us all... You'll be beautiful... forever.\"</span></div></div>",

Anyone?\" She yelled out. \"I got lost in the woods and was wondering if I could stay the night here?\" No one answered, she sighed guessing the place to be abandoned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Suddenly and without warning the door behind her slammed shut making her scream. She tried to open it but it was locked. \"Ok... don't Panic Fluttershy...\" She told herself. \"It was just the wind... You can find someone in the morning to open it for you...I'm sure it will be fine.\" She closed her eyes a minute and than looked around. To her right were was a long hallway of portraits in what seemed to be a gallery of some kind. there was also some stairs leading up to an upstairs area...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... there could be a place to sleep upstairs... but there might also be someone around here...\" She than looked over at the portrait gallery... Something about it seemed to be calling her to it...</span></div></div>",

This place was definatly a rich pony's home, she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  She looked around at some of the rooms, there was a library that would have made Twilight drool, a kitchen where she might be able to get something to eat, along with a dining hall with the longest table Flutters had ever see, and a rather large living area. There was also a set of stairs leading downstairs into what she assumed was a basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Hello? Anyone? Anyone at all?\" She called out. She heard no answer. perhaps the owner just wasn't home, But than, why would he leave his door unlocked? She shook her head. \"Maybe he doesn't care if he gets robbed...\" She thought. She than shook off the idea she was getting to steal some of the things int he house. \"No... You aren't a thief fluttershy...\" She said to herself.

Opening the door revealed a long hallway leading to a door with light shining beneath it. As Fluttershy walked down the hallway she couldn't help but notice the paintings and such held various disturbing images of anthro ponies like her in peril.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed one of a pony much like Rainbow Dash being eaten by a giant monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let a \"eep!\" of fear when she saw a painting of a well-endowed yellow pony that looked a lot like her being stuffed like a turkey and being shoved into an oven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-whoever made that must h-h-have some real issues \" she said in a fearful voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sped up her pace to quickly get by the paintings without having to look at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came to the door and opening it  she walked into the old fashioned styled kitchen  and gasped in delight as she felt herself begin to begin to drool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore her was the  most delicious looking and eloquoent banquet she'd ever seen in her life bowls of mashed potatoes sweet potatoes, plaitains, roast hams, mac and cheese, fried chicken, peas, a whole smoked turkey and whole assourment of other delicius items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy's eyes widened in awe licked her lips as looked over the scrumptious banquet on the long table in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just as she was about to begin diving into the food a figure in the corner of her eye caught her attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her head and gasped at what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was one she liked of a very attractive fox girl who was in a cute pose looking out at Fluttershy, laying on her belly, her arms crossed under her breasts and her cute back paws up in the air above her, she had a beautiful smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy took in the detail of her from her very detailed fur to a cute little mole on one of her paw pads. Fluttershy than looked at some of the others. There was a bunny girl posing the same as the fox girl but she looked more shy about it, a wolf girl sitting cutely with her arms around her knees, and one that made Fluttershy blush a little as it looked like a Fox-boy enjoying a handjob from a Fox-girl (though his cock was not in the painting, it was clear from the positioning of her hands and his expression what was happening)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... this artist really pays attention to detail, All of these are really good.... Almost life like...\" She said as her eyes turned towards an empty painting. there was something off about it compared to the others. It was an open field, but there was no one in it. Other than the field it was open and barren, no real subject. It felt like it was missing someone... Yet Fluttershy felt hypnotized by it... Almost drawn to it. As though it was missing... her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was so hypnotized she barely noticed the mist pouring out of the painting, coming towards her invitingly, as if reaching for her...</span></div></div>",

She was still in the same room as before, but this time she was across from the picture of the vixen. Near as she could tell she was kneeling, with her hooves tucked under her rump and her hands folded cutely in her lap, her tail draped around her legs like a dress of sorts. She was smiling bright and found she could not move a muscle. Or even blink. Yet oddly this didn't frighten her... she felt very calm and even happy. She just stared ahead at the picture of the vixen when she heard a voice in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Now you will be beautiful for eternity, now you will be admired by all who come through these halls. My beautiful little pony, you are now a part of this beautiful gallery...forever.\" The thought of being in this gallery forever, admired by all who saw her as a beautiful painting, made Fluttershy feel really good inside.

All the paintings in this hall of the gallery depicted furries in different forms of sexual activities, Almost all of them of a female being dominated by a male. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne showed a pony girl like herself on all fours being plowed from behind by a very horny looking stallion, one showed a vixen with her back turned to the viewer, but judging by the look on the male's face it was obvious she was in the process of giving him a blowjob and another still dipected a wolf girl riding a cock reverse cowbo, moaning out as her lover fondled her breasts.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... My... the owner of this mansion sure does have some...  tastes in art...\" She said as her gaze met one of another vixen sucking on the cock of a fox-boy, this one actually showing the cock being sucked on as well as the vixen's face. \"I need to get out of this place...\" She thought to her self... yet oddly she felt herself starting to get a little horny looking at all the pictures... getting envious of the vixens sucking on cocks and of the pony and wolf girls getting fucked...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes than settled on it... A picture of just a Wolf-Boy. His eyes wee hungry and horny at the same time and his cock was extremely erect. Fluttershy blushed looking at it and almost caught herself drooling looking into those hungry eyes and down at the cock again. She imagined her lips around it... imagined it impaling her and fucking her brains out for eternity... she blinked the images out of her mind and took a momment when she heard it. \"Join us Fluttershy... Join our orgy... forever...\" It was coming from all the paintings and she now felt if all their eyes were staring at her...pleading her to join their \"orgy\" and leap into the painting of the lone wolf boy....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swallowed as she felt the temptation roll over... she needed the wolf-boy's company... She needed feel his embrace... she needed his damn cock! If she was horny before, it was nothing compared to how she felt right this second!  She looked up at the painting again and saw the wolfboy smiling at her now, staring down at her with those lustful baby blues...and gesturing her towards him...</span></div></div>",

Even if it cost her her soul for all eternity....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming my prince!\" She shouted as she all but ripped her clothing off her body, showing anyone watching her beautiful naked frame. She was well endowed for such a small little yellow pony-girl.She looked up at the painting of her soon to be partner and swore he licked his lips looking at her and that he started stroking his cock as he beckoned her to leap in. With out hesitation Fluttershy walked towards the painting, furiously fingering herself as she took each step, her tongue hanging out in horny bliss. She reached the painting and held out her hand to it as a black mist oozed out and began to envelop her. soon she felt her body melt away and her mind and soul move to the painting. She was home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinked as a blinding light came and faded and there he was. Cock as erect as it was in the painting. \"Hello my love.\" The wolf spoke in a deep sexy voice. Fluttershy's wings flared out in arousal as she slowly walked towards him. \"Mmmm My you are a horny girl aren't you? Ready to be mine for all eternity?\" \"Yes! Oh god yes please! Fuck me! Pound me! Take my pussy and destroy it!\" She commanded as she laid down on her back and splayed her legs, panting hard as she looked at him with lustful anticipation. \"As you wish, my love. Welcome to the eternal orgy.\" As he said these words, Fluttershy heard other voices moaning in pleasure all around her. She couldn't see them, but she knew it was everyone from the other paintings, locked forever in the pleasures of sex. Soon the Wolf Boy layed over top her. \"Are you ready my dear? Once I'm inside, I will never come out. You will be pounded as you put it for all of eternity.\" \"Yes! Oh Sweet fucking Celestia I need this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the wolf's massive cock filled her. She moaned in pleasure and pain, as it was bigger than she was used to, and she fucked Big mac once! He began pounding into her and she let out moans of immense pleasure. This was better than any sex she ever had in her life. He pinned down her arms above her head and kept pace as he fucked her harder and harder with each thrust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome my love.\" He moaned. \"I've waited so long for someone to join me in thius prison. Every 100 years we will change positions and start anew.\" He gave her a deep passionate kiss. \"Now look pretty my dear.\" He moaned again. \"This is for eternity.\" With that her head rolled back and peered out the painting as she felt herself freezing in place, but could still feel the wolf pounding her. To the outside world she was now nothing but a painting of a beauiful pegasus-girl on her back, face fixed in one of pure pleasure and sluttinnes as the \"Big Bad Wolf\" fucked her missionary style. Every 100 years or so they would change to where she was on top, or sucking his cock or getting eaten out, but either way it was always lewd and their orgy never ended.</span></div></div>",

Oh I need to get out of here...\" She says as she runs, not paying attention where she's runnign to. After a bit she plows right into someone, knocking both of them over, her on top of him in a very...comprimising position. \"Oh...My!' She blushes.\"I'm so sorry...\" She said quickly getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all, my dear. Completely my fault.\" The man said getting up. He was a strikingly handsome Pony-Boy, who looked to be about her age. \"My name is Upper Class, this is my mansion.\" he looked over at the shaking girl. \"Oh you poor thing. You must be cold in those....drenched clothes. Rather nasty weather we are having... Come. I can offer you food and shelter for the night...\" \"Oh... Thank you, Mr. Class. I'm Fluttershy.\" She says blushing. There was something extremely charming about this man... almost too charming. Like every word he spoke sounded like honey to her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right this way, Miss Shy. It is Miss, Correct?\" \"Oh! Yes... I... I am unmarried and single.\" She blushed playing with her hair... Why did she say that?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I find that hard to belive.\" He said as they walked side by side down the halls of his mansion. \"A fetching young thing as your self, has no suitors?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... No... I... I mean I'm sure I do... back in ponyville.. Have admirers that is...\" She was panting as they walked. Her heart racing. Her mind was telling her she needed to get out, but her heart was telling her to stay longer. \"But none of them really...Strike me as mate potential, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do. Alas I too find myself brideless, Since my first wife met with a terrible fate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, What happened to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She took ill I'm afraid. 3 Years ago.\" He gestured to a painting on the main hall wall above a fireplace.

Sadly she passed and I have this whole place to myself and my servants...\" He sighed. \"It does get lonely...But look at me, talking to you in such a manner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine...I don't mind.\" She said simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes well. To buisness. THis room was once our guest room. In that closet you will find some fresh clothing, you may borrow them while yours dry.\" He said as he led her into a beautiful room. \"I suspiect that my chef shall have dinner ready shortly should you find yourself hungry. I'll leave you to get changed.\" He said as he closed the doors behind him, leaving Fluttershy alone. As soon as she was sure he was out of earshot she let out a giddy squeal. \"Oh my god! He's so handsome!\" She blushed hard. \"And this place is amazing!\" she said looking around. She could get used to living in a place like this.... Wait... Could she? Something felt weird.... Didn't she have a home? She shook off the feeling and went to the closet to fetch the clothes he mentioned and get changed.</span></div></div>",

She quickly undressed out of her wet clothes and set them on a chair and got changed into the dry ones. She wondered who they had belonged to? The jeans fit her perfectly, she thought looking into a vanity mirror in the corner, in fact they framed her butt perfectly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed at the thought of the stallion downstairs looking at her pert bottom.... than some other images flashed where he had her strapped down and was spanking her butt. She blushed deeper red wondering where those thoughts even came from and quickly shoook them from her mind. The shirt, though big, wasn't TOO big that it didn't cover her up. It showed a little of her cleavage, but than so did the sweater she wore a lot and for some reason, she didn't mind if her host saw the tops of her boobs. Again she blushed and shook the thoughts of him playing with them out of her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe yawned cutely and looked at the bed. It was very large, especially for a tiny pony girl like herself, she plopped down on it and stretched out on it. It was very plush and felt like the softest silk on her tired body. She imagined herself sleeping in it and smiled as she slowly drifted into a nap... that was immidiatly interuppeted by a dream of her host pinning her to the bed, her hands and hooves tied to it's posts as her pounded away at her. She shot up in a deep blush and sweat, \"What the hell is going on with you Fluttershy?! You just met this guy and already you are having... THOSE kinds of dreams?\" She panted. and got up off the bed. IT was this house. It had to be... It was doing something to her mind... No it could be.... IT's just a simple house right? She'd sleep her tonight with the stallion... WITHOUT the Stallion and head home in the morning. That' all there was to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the door and remembered Upper Class had invited her to join him for dinner.... She wondered for a moment if she should join him or if it would be rude to refuse and just get some sleep</span></div></div>",

Of course, the writing has almost completely faded, as if the sign hasn\u2019t been maintained in decades. Still, the mare was more than content. At this point, she didn\u2019t need to make it back to Ponyville exactly; she would be more than satisfied if she found some sort of shelter or civilization before nightfall. Nighttime is incredibly dangerous in the Everfree; getting lost in the forest at night was almost a death sentence, what with all the Timber Wolves and other monsters that hunt underneath the moon\u2019s light. In fact, when she was young, her parents told her that supernatural creatures and angry spirits also roam the woods during the night, though she was sure these were just rumors. Ghosts don\u2019t exist\u2026 right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly hurried down the dirt path, walking faster and faster as nightfall grew ever closer. Wherever she was heading, she hoped she would make it there soon. As she walked, she thought back on what Zecora had said earlier. <i>\u201cPlease use caution dear Fluttershy. I would be upset, should you die.\"</i> How creepy! And she seemed so casual about it too. Maybe Zecora was used to losing ponies to the Everfree Forest? A few dozen ponies go missing in the forest every year, after all. Fluttershy shuddered at the thought of contributing to that statistic. How careless she had been, trying to make it through the Everfree so late in the evening! She took deep breaths, trying not to panic and lose direction again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, through the trees, she manages to see a shadow in the distance. It was only a silhouette, but it was distinct in shape. A smile lit up her face as she saw it. That must be what she was looking for! Maybe there was hope for her after all. She could hardly see anything at this point, so she eagerly drew closer, until she could finally make out what she was looking at....</span></div></div>",

It looked just as old as the sign did, as if it hasn\u2019t been visited in decades. There were many holes in the walls and tiled ceiling, and the sides were overgrown with vines. <i>At least it\u2019s better than nothing,</i> Fluttershy thought to herself. Though finding this cabin may be a life-saver, she didn\u2019t feel nearly as relieved as she thought she would. Maybe that\u2019s because something about this cabin gave her goose bumps. There was just something off about it. Something\u2026 evil. She tries to dispel all the ghost stories she\u2019s heard out of her mind as she hesitantly walks up towards the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy knocked on the front door, only for it to slide open by itself. She peered inside, into the pitch blackness of the cabin. It\u2019s certainly as old and abandoned as it looks; everything was covered in cobwebs, and random bits of debris was scattered across the floor. She sneezed a few times just exploring, as she kicked up dust. Luckily, there didn\u2019t seem to be any insects, and she didn\u2019t detect any mold. She smiled, glad to have found shelter at least, but she wasn\u2019t out of danger yet. This cabin was about to fall apart -- she doubted it would stand up against a monster attack. She needed to fortify this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the furniture had been chopped to pieces, but she used what hadn\u2019t been to barricade all the entrances, effectively sealing her in. Just in time, too; proper nightfall had just arrived. She shuddered as she heard Timber Wolves howling in the distance as they began their hunt. She laughed to herself as she could finally relax for a while, sitting on the ground to calm her raging heartbeat. She was safe! She had narrowly escaped certain death. First thing tomorrow morning, she would climb up onto the roof and scope out the way back to town. But for now, she just had to relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shivered a bit. The cabin was a blessing, but it still wasn\u2019t the best place to sleep. In the night, it was freezing cold and completely dark. However, fumbling around in the darkness, Fluttershy managed to find a fireplace. Ah! Her good luck continues. She lights the fireplace, which gave just enough heat and warmth to make staying the night a little more comfortable. She sat in front of the fireplace, warming her cold hands over the flames, and yawned. There was a bed upstairs, but the bedroom kind of creeped her out, because for some reason,its walls were absolutely covered in mirrors. She felt much more comfortable in the living room, in front of the fireplace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe yawned again, interrupting her thoughts. It was late, and she\u2019d had a scary day. She should get some sleep. But where?</span></div></div>",

Please let me go.\" She said, digging her hands into the dirt and grass to try and get some hold, but it was no use, the vines were too strong and continued to drag her, her wings flaring in alarm as even more vines came out of the bushes and started to wrap her up more and more until she was practically cocooned... Only her head and little hooves still visible as the vines dragged her into the bushes...</span></div></div>",

As she turned to head out she felt something wrapping around her waist. Before she could react and look down to see what it was she was pulled up into the trees with a very surprised yelp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Sssssay now.... what have we here?\" She heard a voice as she was pulled up. \"A losssst little filly-cub?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Who...Who are you...Please let me go...\" She pleaded as she was pulled up to the tops of the trees, where she was met by a, albiet not unhandsome, Snake anthro. He had a long tail, which was currently coiling gently around her as he set her down on a branch, coiling up from her hooves to her waist. he also had a more human, though still scaled and snake like, upperbody, complete with arms, and the head of a snake with rather large eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Don't you know it'ssss dangeroussss here at night, little filly-cub?\" He said to her in a gentle tone. \"A girl could get eaten... or worsssse out here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Yes...I know. that's why I'm trying to get home....\" She said struggling in the coils a little, but the snake-boy just tightened them a little to hold her in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Now now...\" He said moving his upper body closer to her's. \"No need to ssssstruggle, I only wisssh to help you....Protect you...\" He carressed her cheek gently with one hand. \"What'ssss your name little filly-cub?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"F...Fluttershy.\" She said nervously, not exactly liking where this was going, but the snake did seem nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Nice to meet you Fluttershy, I'm Kaa.\" He said in a soothing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"H...Hi Kaa... Listen, please let me go. I really need to get home....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Kaa Chuckled a little \"But it's dangerousssss in these woodssss...you could get hurt. Why not ssssstay the night with me... Let me protect you.... You can... Trusssst me....\" He said looking into her eyes, his own suddenly becoming swirls of pretty colors, Fluttershy found herself unable to look away from them and could hear his voice in her head repeated to trust him, submit to him, let him protect her....forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   She quickly shook it off and shut her eyes. \"No! I know what youa re trying to do! Your one of those... Hypno-Snake-Boys twilight told me about... Leave me alone Kaa!\" She struggled harder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Come one little Fluttershy, Why not ssssssubmit? Give in and you will be ssssafe and happy and warm...\" He said in a strangely hypnotic tone that was like music to Fluttershy's ears, which she quickly lowered in defense, though it didn't help block out his voice. \"Give in... Trussssst in me... open those pretty eyessss and let me gaze into them....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Fluttershy knew she only had one option, her stare. A secret passed down through her family that made others more...suggestive to them. She tapped into her mind for a moment, blocking out Kaa's voice as best she could than opened her eyes, they were much wider than usual this time and seemed to almost Glow. Kaa was taken aback, but not yet beaten. His eyes returned to their hypnotic swirls and he stared right back. \"Give in little Filly, Be mine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Fluttershy could feel her mind slipping, wanting to submit, begging her to submit to the Snake-boy, but she held strong, staring back with all her might, trying to break his concentration and Sending thoughts into his mind as well, like how he should be ashamed of himself, capturing fillies and mares and having his way with them! Bad Snake!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  This went on for a while... Both staring hard, both coming close to breaking.... But Fluttershy could feel her mind slowly...slipping away...into an almost euphoric state... She had to win... could she win... did she want to win...would submitting be so bad?</span></div></div>",

She heard a ping in her head as her eyes began to more rapidly reflect the pretty colored spirals in Kaa's eyes and slowly her mouth became a silly grin that stretched across most of her cute face, her mind now telling her how wonderful it was that she submitted and that she was a good pony-girl who would do whatever Kaa says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Kaa chuckled knowing how he'd won. \"You are mine now Fluttershy.\" He said to her. \"Yes...kaa...\" She said in a trance like state.<br>\r\nKaa chuckled again. \"Strip for me my slave.\" \"Yes Kaa...\" Fluttershy said still grinning as the snake set her down on a large branch and uncoiled her so she could remove her clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy, completly under Kaa's spell, removed her green sweater and let it fall onto the forest floor, she knew she wouldn't need it anymore, Kaa would protect her... Kaa would keep her warm... She undid her bra next and let it fall as well, revealing her rather large and perky breasts, her nipples hard from the hypnosis. Kaa licked his lips in approval. Finally she unzipped her pants and let them slip off her legs and hooves and did the same to her panties,, revealing a beautiful naked yellow pony-girl to the now practiaclly drooling snake-boy. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n     \"Mmm You look deliciousssss my dear... Good enough to eat....\" He opened his arms wide. \"Come into my embrace.\" He said smiling. Fluttershy complied and walked slowly to her master's arms, Which quickly wrapped around her and began stroking her mane. \"Now trusssst in me... and go to ssssleep my little pony-girl... Closssse your eyessss...\" Fluttershy's eyes suddenly felt very heavy, she yawned cutely and slowly let them drift closed as Kaa sang a beautiful lullaby to her and coiled her up tight, giving her neck a little choke, which made her *urk* but than drift peacefully into a deep slumber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"When you wake..You will be somewhere nice and safe... and warm.\" He chuckled *if you wake* He thought to himself as he lifted the dozing pony-girl up to his mouth and opened wide.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was just as delicious as he imagined she would be. He gave a hard swallow, sending her head into his throat as he tasted more of her wonderful flavor, all the while, Fluttershy was fast asleep, dreaming of a lover's warm embrace slowly wrapping around her body. It felt nice and tight in his throat as he swallowed her up to her breasts, his tongue going over them, making Fluttershy moan softly and cutely in her sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaa Chuckled and swallowed her large breasts down and began working on her flat stomach as inside him Fluttershy began to dream she was in the tightest of bondage. She'd always had a secret fetish for it she'd only ever experienced with one lover and she was in bliss, She couldn't move her hands sadly as they had been swallowed or dhe probably would have started masturbating in her sleep. She felt Kaa swallow again, this time reaching her pussy and tight rump. He smiled as his tongue went over her dripping pussy. \"Hehe...Must be having a very wet dream.\" He said to himself. \"Might as well oblige her,\" He dove his tongue into her pussy and began eating her out while eating her. Fluttershy let out a loud moan inside him, her dream now turning very intimate as her lover began ravishing her poor bound body, taking in her honey. Her body quaked as Kaa brought her to a powerful orgasm, enhanced by his hypnosis over her, and she came hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaa tasted her honey and moaned himself, his cock getting stiff and unsheathing itself as he lapped up her juices. He sighed, wishing he had fucked her before eating her, but than decided to instead just masturbate while he finished her off. He put wrapped his tail around his cock, using his hands to hold her legs and hooves as he swallowed her pussy and ass. He moaned as he tasted his prey and beat himself off. this was easily the best meal he'd ever had. He smiled at her little twitching hooves as he gave them a good licking before closing his mouth around them and giving one final swallow that sent the doomed pony girl into his stomach. He laid back against a tree and continued to masturbate, moaning and thing about her wonder taste, still fresh on his lips and tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Fluttershy was once again feeling very tight, moaning her sleep, she was able to slip a hand and her fingers into her pussy and began to rub herself, completely unaware of the digestive juices flowing into the stomach to digest her. Both moaned out as Kaa felt himself cum and cum hard, spraying the trees with his seed as Fluttershy experienced her final orgasem as she felt darkness take her, sparing her from waking up to feel her self digesting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaa let out a yawn and rubbed his bulging belly as his cock withdrew back inside him. \"Mmm good little pony-girl, digest for me now... you are food.\"</span></div></div>",

She still has hooves as if she were a regular pony, but does have hands. It's just that I find the Anthro-Versions with hooves much cuter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy has two \"weapons\" at her disposal. One is that she is a pegasus, so she can fly. She just chooses not to due to a fear of hights from years of child trauma and being teased for her flight skills (or lack there of)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also has the Stare. The details of which are fuzzy, but it seems to give her temporary control over an animal's mind. It can be avoided and canceled out by hypnosis however. Also she refuses to use it on other ponies.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nRULES:<br>\r\nThis Interactive may include: Soft vore, Cannibalism (not to discriptive), Petrification, And sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you decide to include the CMC it is ok for them to die, but no under age sex will be permited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease give Flutters a fighting chance.
