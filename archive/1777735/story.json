Cream felt magical energy surge through her body. The world around her seemed to shrink, until she realized it was her growing taller. Her facial features matured, and slight breasts formed on her chest. Knowledge flowed into her head, giving her the mental experience she would have gained with age. Her dress changed with her, turning into a loose top over jean shorts.

She took the necklace in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic charm, I wish I was prettier!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe necklace glowed, and again Cream felt magic flow into her. This time she felt it center around her chest, fiowing in, filling it out more and more. From an A-cup to B. Meanwhile, more energy poured into her hips, which she felt inch out, making her shorts feel tighter. Her hair grew several inches longer, her eyelashes lengthened, and she saw in the mirror as she grew by several inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my!\" Cream blushed, as her growing breasts, now going from C to D, pulled her shirt up, revealing her midriff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the growing stopped. Cream stood, with her perky DD chest and hips and thighs that overflowed from her shorts, and felt a feeling of elation at her look.

He curled up and rushe forward. the tunnel was long and windy and Sonic popped out a few meters from where the dorr would have ended.  He couldnt see very well but sundely a large torch burst into a large flame near it's top.  Sonic grabbed a stck, dipped it into the fire, and ran depper into the temple.  The journey was rather enjoyable for Sonic, he dodged traps rushed through mazes, and solved puzzles as he went depper into the temple and further undreground.  Eventually he was in a large shrine at the very bottom of the temple, possibly over a mile down. Sveral torches light up like the first one, creating a path leading to a pedistal at the end of the room.  Sonic slowwed down as he walked to it to look around.  The hyroglifics had pictures of what looked like a tiger with an amulet creating the world.  Others showed similar images of the same tiger creating the sun the oceans, plants, other life and fire.  Sonic was now at the peddistal and on it sat a gold necklace with an ocean blue jem in the middle.  Befor Sonic picked it up, the writing on the wall behind it started to glow.  The glow rearagined itself from the anicent sybols to the english sonic was fluent in, and read, \"Those who psses the ancient tiger god, Acuwa's necklace, shall enhieret his power over reality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic whistled \"Sweet.\" Sonic grabbed the necklace, but suddenly the temble began to shake.  The ceiling began to fall as the entire temple impolded.  \"Uh-oh, if thing can alter reality, lets see if it can get me out of here!\"  Sonic said panicing, a light blue light surounded him as a lrage rock fell on where he stood.  Suddenly he was out side what used to be the temple enterence.  \"Heh!\" Sonic chuckled  \"It worked! Lets see what else it can do...\" Sonic fucused on his tails and watched as they suddenly grew inot a pair exactly like Tails'.  Sonic flew for a moment and got back on the ground.  \"Cool.  He said as the Tails shrank back into him.  Sonic wanted one more experiment and this one would be outregious.  In a moment, an exact clone of Cream and her mother Vinella were there.  The differnce though was that Vinella was dressed as Rough the Bat and though like Sally.  Cream was dressed like Amy and thought like Bunnie.  The two were interesting to watch for a little, but Sonic got rid of them also.  \"This thing is way past cool!\"  Sonic said to himself as he prepared for what he was going to use the neckalce for next...</span></div></div>",

Go to that story to understand how the necklace works. Also, I want to lay some ground rules: Sonic with the necklace can travel between different versions of his world, NOT into other series entirely (like mario); tg, tf, mental changes and swapping are encouraged; toilet humor, vore, descriptive sex scenes (no more than 1 chapter if you want to be detailed), and poor grammer are not allowed and will be changed or deleted; For anything else be as descriptive as you want but please make it last under two chapters; finally always leave an \"other\" option if you run out of ideas for additions. Have fun and please add. Before I forget, unless it is a choice chapter, try and make a paragraph long chapter.</td>",
