It's nothing too upscale, but that's what made it perfect: literally everyone was welcome with only the poorest of the poor not being able to walk in on a whim while still having that air of sophistication about it. A number of regulars said you need more televisions so you can air more sporting events, but that would turn this into a sports bar. Those are too noisy, get too many rowdy customers who have way too much to drink, and you aren't that big on sports to begin with. A pool table, a dart board, a couple of arcade games, and what few sports are on were more than enough for both business and conversation, and the books reflected this most of the time (every place is entitled to an off night once in a while).\u200b<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing only about 6:30, and given the fact that the big game for tonight doesn't start for another half hour, business isn't exactly booming yet. They start coming in right about now, though. Right about now, a few people pop in to grab dinner before the game, usually the people who aren't in relationships or the new couples. The grill is cleaned and ready to go, and all the food is cut and seasoned waiting for it. Literally the only thing holding you back right now is the fact that you have no extra help. A Help Wanted sign is sitting in the window and behind you, but no one has responded yet. Maybe that'll change tonight, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore we get wrapped up in this night of business, let's establish the identity of the owner and unassisted bartender here at The Hidden Away Lounge. Who are you?</span></div></div>",

Black's a wonderful color to wear since it hides any stains from the less vibrantly colored liquids, but it perfectly frames anything solid. No doubt you already trapped a good deal of it in your sleeves, but since you rolled those up to your elbows, you cut this corner. The annoying part is the black khakis. The belt makes it a little hard to reach the bottom of your pant legs, but removing the belt would cause them to dip in the back, maybe even fall down completely if you didn't fix them frequently. Even though you're wearing boxers underneath, you wouldn't dare risk being caught with your pants down since the customers are on the way. Hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf not customers, then at least someone answering the help wanted sign. The black sneakers are comfortable, but some of these patrons are downright rude; halfway through the night, merely standing over the grill or bar becomes a test of endurance for everything below your knees. Every moment on them was a moment they spent shrieking for a break, but with no one else to help out, sitting was something that could only happen before the bar opened, these following moments when there's no one in the bar and no work to be done, and after the bar closed. While you loved the bar, the near-constant work that comes with no hired hands made for an agonizing day of work, even on your more toned frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInitially, you wore dressier shoes to work, and spent a good amount of time polishing them, but at the end of the day drunker folks left them scuffed, the thinner material offered almost no protection against their haphazard stomps, and all that time on them left your feet covered in blisters. Now it's sneakers all the way: comfort, support, and defense. There was some concern immediately after this change, a little voice in your head telling you they made the bar a little too casual, but it quickly became apparent you were the only one taking note of such details, allowing this worry to evacuate the bar well before last call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you put the lint roller back on the shelf, the door opens, welcoming...</span></div></div>",

Finally, a perk to not having any help. With no one around, you quickly lift up your work t-shirt and expose your milky white flesh to the open air. Tossing the Lounge's specially designed white T-shirt onto the bar, you quickly unclasp your red lace bra and stash the garment under the bar. Your tips are always higher when your 36D boobs swing freely and bring smiles to the faces of the patrons, especially when it's cold in here and your nipples start threatening to punch a hole in your shirt. The problem was you couldn't go braless all day, you need some support, so you'd usually take it off in the car and stash it in the glove box when you had to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you're really ready, you slip back into the T-shirt and retie the bottom behind you, preparing your tight, curvy waist to be gobbled up by hungry eyes. With no signs of anyone else, you pull out your compact and give yourself a once over. Looking back at you is a pair of green eyes set in a perfectly made up face, not a single bit of make up smeared or clearly visible. Despite the rough treatment you gave your top, your hair still frames your face wonderfully and neatly in a cascade of scarlet. That makes things easy. Now you just need to check your lower half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tips were so good you even started wearing tight leather shorts that hid little of your long legs and hugged your bottom in all the right ways. After that spike in tips, you quickly invested them into more white T-shirts and leather shorts, as well as a pair of black ankle boots with four inch heels to help accentuate your legs. Some guys prefer stockings, and others open toed shoes, but you were also considering sensibility: you spend all day on your feet and they may get stepped on during a sporting event. You can't run very well in much higher heels, and the stepping would ruin the stockings and hurt worse in open toes. These were the smart choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect,\" you say to yourself. \"Now I just need to be patient...or not.\"\u200b<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you complete the thought, the door opens up and in walks...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Two thousand dollars for a night of work sounds appealing even before you remember that it would be a tip, under the table and therefore tax-free. Unfortunately, there was one major thing that kept telling you to turn it down, and it wasn't modesty or a safety concern. And considering The Lounge impressed a couple of police officers you haven't quite \"won over,\" that little voice quickly turned into a blaring siren, and almost literally. Despite that, you did have a plan that still turns a profit for the night, and allows you to add in a business expense come tax day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tim,\" you begin, \"that is a really generous offer, and I wouldn't mind doing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, Tim's face lit up like a Christmas Tree at your words. It only last a moment though, the moment it took him to notice your downcast eyes and the tone of your voice. He knew he wouldn't be getting boobies tonight. Not from you, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, none of my licenses let me run a topless bar, and a few cops may be coming regularly. I can't risk losing my bar for anything less than a lifetime of cash, and I still wouldn't since I love my bar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Tim says, \"I get it. Thanks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not done,\" you interrupt. \"I can't work topless, but I do have something you and your friends might enjoy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step out from behind the bar and beckon Tim with a curled finger. It leads him all the way up to the front door, which you're holding open, and then points his gaze towards the parking lot. For now it's deserted except for two cars, but you knock that painful sight out of your mind for a moment and point to your car, the one parked next to the the group's van.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In my trunk is bag from a clothing boutique, and in it is a bustier set I bought to feel special about the nice profit I made last month. It doesn't expose any of the naughty bits, so I can wear it with just my current licenses and not get in trouble. If you don't mind getting it while I watch the bar and then let me change, I'll serve the drinks in my new nightwear for the two grand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look on Tim's face was a blend of  excitement and disbelief, and the latter wasn't about your \"cooperation.\" You expected this from the beginning, and knew ahead of time what he said, even before he said it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I pay for that? So your tits would be bigger. It's still not seeing some new skin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite. See, first of all, there's no straps to it, so I wouldn't have control, or responsibility, if someone yanked it down if I fixed it quickly. Second, the bottom is a g-string, which is better than these shorts for seeing my butt. Sound like something to pay for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a big grin on his face, Tim answers, \"It does, but not two thousand. They're not always out, so how about one thousand instead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe offer makes you bite your lower lip in thought and hesitation. You have one more trick up your short sleeves, one that might be able to get Tim to offer even more money, but you really didn't want to play this one. Telling Tim what he could do with your top to get what he wants was already a bold move, especially since the first yank of the top would be an invitation for an encore with your panties, but that at least let you minimize the damage and keep some modesty for a while and at least only let you be seen naked in sections. This was a bit more daring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis last plan was to change in the back, where you could legally be naked since it wasn't open to the public, but to \"accidentally\" not close the door. The guys would get not only their topless woman, but also a solid look at your pretty red landing strip and the treasures beneath it. That would be a full frontal shot all at once, no imagination would be necessary anymore. However, the cash you could get for the total package would be more than enough to chase away any hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither option is very appealing, but you could use a little more spending cash since you're trying to keep the taxes down - about the only thing the lack of help aided. Plus you had all sorts of cutlery for the food, the knives would be useful if they tried anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, you...</span></div></div>",
