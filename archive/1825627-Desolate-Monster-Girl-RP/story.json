While his large and strikingly blue eyes tend to make him instantly likeable and give off a sense of (false) innocence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacky will typically wear whatever is practical and available but at the time of departing into the wilderness he wears a tattered, sleeveless black designer t-shirt, grey sweatpants, and white sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut by far Jacky's most striking feature is the large and crude tattoo (which he administered himself) over his right forearm which details many basic survival tricks and recipes he had learned from various books over the years... Too bad no one else can read it due to Jacky's abysmal hand writing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Item</b>: One day's rations, Rope, Bottle of Water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Strengths</b>: Jacky is absurdly charismatic, and he exploits this ruthlessly to get himself out of or into trouble, aquire free or discounted shit whenever possible, and surround himself with friends very quickly. This also helps Jacky keep morale in a group high (when he's not busy wallowing in self-pity or cowering in a corner).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is also the aforementioned tattoo, which, if Jacky has a knife and ink he will add to upon finding something worth remembering this can even include a small, crude map.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacky's small size and knowledge of survival also makes him a perfect recon agent (if one can convince him to leave the safety of the group, that is). High intelligence, if only the bookish kind with no real experience to apply it to. Still, Jacky's head for logistics can make him an apt strategist. Despite Jacky's stature he is surprisingly durable and can bounce back pretty quick (physically, that is) even after brutal stench or taste to nose or mouth torture, or even trampling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Weaknesses</b>: Jacky's diminutive size and negligible strength make him easy prey in close combat and even easier to just flat out dominate. You could probably restrain him with one bread wire and a sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacky also has a obvious intense fear of feet, especially smelly, sweaty, and/or dirty feet. Or really anything \"unclean\". Thus, if he is tortured, especially with feet, expect there to be a long while of trauma to go through after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis germophobia also makes him an incredibly shitty doctor or medic, despite any knowledge he may have on the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacky is also generally cowardly and when it's fight or flight time he has a tendency to simply hide behind a rock and cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear of the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear of isolation (Due to how vulnerable he is on his own).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor all the book smarts Jacky has, he still has no real experience surviving in a hostile environment. This can lead to good ideas and tactics being executed poorly and backfiring horribly. This issue is compounded further by his occasionally reckless personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacky's high durability and endurance also make him easier to torture for longer periods of time and at higher intensity, as it is unlikely he will pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tattoo comes at a price, if another survivor or group can manage to make out the writing, they may decide that Jacky is worth taking for themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Stink Resistance</b>: 50/50 (Won't pass out, as much as he would want to, but will flip the fuck out.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Orientation</b>: Straight (But feels hardly any attraction to anyone at all.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Traits/Other</b>: Has recently convinced himself he's a nihilist to cope with his lot in life, but he doesn't actually believe in it, despite any rantings on chaos and the meaninglessness of reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>(And below are a few of my other characters, which will largely consist of monster girls that can function as recurring characters.)</i></b></span></div></div>",

Her actual age is impossible to tell exactly, but it would be an understatement to say she is very, very old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Appearance:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrielle initially stands at a respectable 5'8\", but as she gains power will grow to a frightening 8'6\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer skin is a oily black that seems to consume all light it touches and then spit it back out in bioluminescent signals of color (like a deep sea fish) that confuse and lure prey, and react to nerve stimulation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tips and roots of her long, tendril-like hair is the same and it seems to have a mind of it's own as it coils and reaches in every direction like feelers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her large, cruel eyes one will find the same blackness of her skin, but broken by the illuminated rings of her irises that shine every shifting color, but they never match. Usually, one eye shines a deep crimson while the other radiates a blue glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer teeth, nails, nipples, and the tips of her fingers and toes similarly remain in a constant state bioluminescence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrielle is completely and perpetually naked save for the socks she will occasionally wear to torture her victims with, and the heavy chains she is burdened with dragging since her imprisonment at the hands of the other gods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bears a classic hourglass figure, with wide hips and an imposingly large heart shaped ass, jiggly D cup breasts, a toned stomach, and long, thick legs. Overall, she has the body of a fully matured woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonus: Adrielle has Size 10.5 feet at her base height of 5'8\". But, of course, the size of her feet stacks accordingly as she gets larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer feet are wide and only slightly calloused, and her toes are long but also quite rounded and large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Strengths</b>:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrielle grows in stature as she gains power from the fear and disgust of others, as well as time spent in the darkness (Each night after she awakens, she will get slightly stronger and therefore larger.), this can take place quite rapidly. And once she reaches 8'6\" in height she can then make herself grow temporarily even larger (Large enough to fit a human completely under her foot.).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bioluminescence can very briefly hypnotise some humans, this is very useful for luring in prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe can infiltrate a victim's dreams to feed off of the fear she will create while they sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chains she was cursed to drag wherever she goes can be used as vicious weapons in combat. They are also useful for capturing and restraining victims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is quite nearly completely impervious to lasting physical damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the Goddess of Shadows, Adrielle can travel much faster and see more clearly in the shadows. She also carries with her a cloud of darkness that covers a large area around her (about a mile wide) (This does not count as darkness for her to gain power from. Nor does this darkness affect any light that is not sunlight, although artificial lights will flicker in her presence.).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhomever touches one of her idols at her shrine, or scattered about the world, will be marked as her obsession with a foul smelling black footprint forming on their chest. Adrielle will form a psychic link with her obsession to allow her to know their location at all times, infiltrate their dreams over any distance, and influence their thoughts to varying degrees of auccess. And while she is slow to catch up with the pace of most humans, she will relentlessly pursue her obsession to the ends of the earth, not needing to eat or sleep. In short, Adrielle is a tireless, ever impending doom that looms over her obsession's head until they are cleansed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>(Note: The only way to cleanse this mark is to see a Priestess of the Goddess of Light. And there can only be one obsession to a time and that is whomever touched the idol last.)</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt short range Adrielle can move at very high speeds for a very short amount of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrielle has a small group of Cultists (Known as the Church of the Setting Sun) that will be more than willing to do her bidding, scattered about the wilderness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnless Adrielle is in combat she is completely impervious to pain or damage. So biting won't be any sort of \"Get out of Jail Free Card\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Weaknesses</b>:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon first being awakened, Adrielle will be weak, functioning as little more than an incorporeal poltergeist at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrielle is a slow traveler over long distances, even at full power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is hypersensitive to UV light (the cloud of darkness that surrounds her keeps the sun off her during the day, so sunlight is not an issue), as it saps her power and causes her a great deal of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether it is the cloud of darkness that shadows her, the sounds of her chains dragging nearer, or the slight flickering of lights, you will always know when Adrielle is near. That is, if you know the signs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Items</b>: Her chains and socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Stench Stats</b>:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrielle is the Goddess of Darkness AND Suffering\u2026 Prepare your nose\u2026 and also mouth because it's going to be just as awful if you are unlucky enough to find yourself in her grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Feet</b>: 100/100<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Socks</b>: 93/100<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>B.O</b>: 87/100<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ass</b>: 99/100<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Farts</b>: 100/100<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Burps/Breath</b>: 84/100<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Urine</b>: 100/100<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Stink Resistance</b>: 39/50<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Orientation</b>: Anyone whose fear she can feed on. Fearsexual, if you will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Bio:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording to old folklore, Adrielle was cast out and imprisoned and cursed to forever bear the chains of her captivity by the other gods, mainly her younger sister, The Goddess of Light, for her obsession with a young mortal, whom she endlessly tortured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince she has remained imprisoned in her tomb; a once unremarkable cave, but since adorned by The Church of the Setting Sun with an elaborate shrine to the fallen Goddess. Adrielle's cave is located by on a beach in Blackmore; a mysteriously quiet town that is occupied heavily by the Cultists that worship her. A town that seems perpetually covered in a thick blanket of fog that endlessly rolls in off the sea. It's a place where the sun doesn't seem to shine as bright, and the nights are just a little darker. And everywhere you can sense Adrielle's lurking presence as she haunts the town as a weakened poltergeist, waiting for someone to touch her idol to fully awaken her. (The Cultists don't because they feel it is disrespectful and will anger her.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrielle bears a cold, almost disinterested attitude with most, even during torture; treating it as little more than a means to an end. And once she is satisfied, or her victim passes out, she will send them to the prison camp without so much as an afterthought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when it comes to her obsession, nothing could be further from the truth as she pursues and tortures with the passion of thousand suns. And she never let's them go, going as far as to give them increased lifespan while marked and only ever ceasing to dominate them to make war with her sister and her followers in revenge for her imprisonment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrielle also displays a creepily intimate attitude with her obsession, abusing her psychic connection with them at every turn to learn what will disgust and terrify them the most and then exploiting it ruthlessly. And all the while she will call this love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>(Note: You can use Adrielle at your leisure, just don't kill or permanently alter the character.)</i></span></div></div>",

She looks to be in perfect condition with large breasts and a perfect ass. The only thing that causes her to stick out as a monster are the black horns on her head and her long black tail. She otherwise tries to look as human as possible, to lull her victims into a false sense of security.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hair is long, falling to her lower back in length and is blood red in color, always worn down. Her eyes are a dark green color and always shine with mischief that ranges from innocent fun to sadistic torture in practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor clothes she wears a black halter top, a red plaid miniskirt, and a pair of one inch high heels. Sometimes wearing a fur coat and hat to hide her demonic features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nItems: Two days rations, and rope,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Strengths:</b> Has a strong sense of smell that allows her to track her prey from far away. She's also highly seductive, capable of charming any careless human into trusting her, allowing her to infiltrate their group and either take them down from within, or lead other monsters to them. Her charms can also help her get along with other monsters, especially of her kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy torturing humans with her stink, her Succubus powers also allow her to (slowly) seduce said victim into loving and adoring her. But this can be undone if Moya is ever knocked out or subdued. Her Succubus abilities also give her slightly enhanced speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, her abilities make her an excellent scout, tracker and infiltrator. And while she rarely ever does, she also has the Succubus ability to invade peoples dreams and torture them there. But to do this she has to know where her victim is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Weaknesses:</b> Her strong sense of smell can be used against her. She can also be a bit cowardly when outnumbered, either by humans or fellow monsters who disagree with her. This is because she lacks enhanced strength, instead relying on her speed and charms in most situations, this makes her less powerful than normal monsters in a fight. This cowardice has caused her to develop a small submissive streak that only another monster or excessively skilled human (or group) could exploit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to her hedonistic ways, the longer she goes without torturing anyone, the more impatient she'll get. This may cause her to make a critical mistake. Using her ability to invade dreams also exhausts her the longer she does it, making her slower and possibly putting her to sleep, so a mentally strong victim could exhaust her into sleep, allowing them to escape or take advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStench stats:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Feet:</b> 60<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>B.O:</b> 40<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ass:</b> 70<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Farts:</b> 80<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Breath/Belches:</b> 20<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Urine:</b> 20<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Stink resistance:</b> 30/50 Difficult to knock out, but possible due to her strong sense of smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Orientation:</b> Bisexual<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Other:</b> She's a hedonist who willingly left her home to go out and hunt for humans to enslave. Her biggest desire is to form her own slave harem out of the humans she's captured.</span></div></div>",

Not helped by the fact that she's rather short for her age at 5'4 with a medium skin tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer black hair is shoulder length and always kept in a clean, controlled state, much like the woman herself. While her eyes are a soft brown color and seem to radiate sympathy, making her easier for other humans to trust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor clothes, she wears a faded white nurses uniform, complete with a small white cap on her head. Her shoes are very old and sweaty, making them capable of potentially stunning a monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nItems: One days rations, One smelling salts, one alcohol<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Strengths</b>: Her natural sweetness and empathy makes her likeable and easy to trust. Otherwise, she's very knowledgeable about monsters, knowing much about their typical traits and preferred methods of attack. This, coupled with her knowledge in medicine makes her a useful addition to any team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen around others she's calm and able to think clearly. Which can help either in battle or other areas. She's average when it comes to fighting, and can possibly use her weak appearance to trick monsters into thinking she'll be an easy target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Weaknesses:</b> She can be very naive, and thus easy for a clever monster or survivor to trick into working for them. Which is amplified by the fact that she's more of a follower than a leader, preferring not to make any hard decisions for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeyond that she's scared of all monsters in general, which can cause her to panic if she thinks one's nearby. She's also got a bad left arm due to breaking it a while ago, giving her an exploitable weakness in combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to her medical knowledge and being a follower, she's also easy prey for any group of survivors or monsters who want to make use of her talents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Stench stats</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeet: 25<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB.O: 10<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAss: 10<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFarts: 15<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreath/Belches: 5<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrine: 1<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Stink resistance:</b> 25/50<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Orientation:</b> Bisexual<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Other:</b> A willing sacrifice, Michelle studied as much about monsters as she could before being banished.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">You are a rarity. A human, being forced out of your home under the guise of being a chosen hero to rid the world of monster girls that enjoy torturing mortals with the ungodly reek they output from every part of their exclusively womanly bodies. In reality, you are nothing more than a sacrifice. With the population of your secretive home growing dangerously large, you are banished and left for a fate worse than death. Many people suffer your fate, whether you view it as an honour, or a curse is up to you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a world much like our own a calamity came from dimensions unknown. This calamity would doom all of mankind and overthrow their rule over the planet. After much fighting humanity was a broken shadow of it's former self. What brought on this terrible tide? Why, the monsters that came and fed off of the fear and disgust of men and women alike. At first they were merely brutal savages, killing off the new found prey, but decades later, with human numbers dwindling, something changed within them. Now, perhaps due to the need for humanity in order to survive themselves, they thrive not on killing, but torturing mortals with the ungodly reek they output from every part of their exclusively womanly bodies. You are a rarity. A human, being forced out of your home under the guise of being a chosen hero to rid the world of monsters! In reality, you are nothing more than a sacrifice. With the population of your secretive home growing dangerously large, you are banished and left for a fate worse than death. Many people suffer your fate, whether you view it as an honour, or a curse is up to you... Try your best to stay alive and clear of monsters, lest you be captured and left to the task of escaping a prison camp made to milk all the disgusting suffering possible from it's human inheritance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. You may attempt to escape or play a new character if your character is captured. No true game overs by monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. You can steal, torture, all but kill other characters if you are truly desperate, but at the cost obviously, of their trust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. You must play a monster girl for others if you want monster girls played for you. Not to say you need to every time, but no being selfish and only mooching off others.<br>\r\n</td>",
