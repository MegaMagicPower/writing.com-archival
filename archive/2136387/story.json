Ah, my head hurts...\", you said quiet to yourself. After you got up you saw a voicebox laying in the corner of the room. You made your way to it and examied it. After a few seconds you hold it to your ear and pressed the 'play' button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Lasse.\" Said the voice of the box, \"You might wonder why you are here, in this empty building. Well this is easy to explain... I kidnapped you. I've done this because I'm an agent of a heritage managing company. I brought you here bcause noone else has to know about your heritage your great great uncle left for you. But before I explain you what it is I explain you, why it is so secret. <br>\r\nFirst of all, when you get up and her this tape around 10 hours were gone. Your parents are introduced, You said them that You were together with Tim and you're going to spend the night there. Your Doppelganger is going to replace, when you use your heritage.\" \"Doppelganger? What the hell is going on?  And why have I told them I'm spending the night at Tim's?\" Your thoughts were racing through your head but the voice continued.<br>\r\n\"Well your heritage is a special object. Your life never will be the same again, that's why everything is so seret. This item is a special pen, which creates suits of the people you shoot them. You can wear them as long as you like and impersonate them.<br>\r\nYou were speechless. \"Skinsuits?\" You muttered to yourself. <br>\r\n\"With the pen, you can create a suit of the person you want to wear. To use the pen, you have to click the knob on it for five times so that the mine is outside. After that, you point the pen at the desired person and hold knob pressed. The desired person should deflate within two seconds. When the suit is ready you can get into it just how you like it to. You can rip the back open to get into it, you also can stretch the biggest bodyopenings, I mean to be exact, the mouth, vagina or ass to also get in. After you alligned yourself into the suit. it will seam itself and you're going to get headache for around twenty seconds.\"<br>\r\nYou were still confused. This was to much information to handle but the agent didn't stop to talk.<br>\r\n\"After these seconds you will get <b>all</b> the memories of the person you wear. You simply can impersonate the worn person. But be careful! You <b>Only can wear people up to 20 yers.</b> Every year you get older, the age also rises. Also You have to allign the face complete! You have to put your teeth into the empty ones of the suit and also the tounge into the pouch, which is the original tounge of the body. If you don't want to wear the suit anymore, you just exit as you entered. But Another important thing! The persons you shooted will not automaticly reinflate! You have to repeat the process you made them deflate. After that, they will regain they live but they are slaves of you. You can controll them complete with your mind and you can tell them what to do just by thinking!\" This is your heritage. You have now time to hear this message again before you get a surprise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were speechless and you tried to sum up what this totaly strange guy told you. After a minute you made your mind and summarised up the message the guy spoke onto the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can create skinsuits of the people I want. But the have to be at least 20 years old. I can be them as long as I want to... Doesn't sound bad at all. I will gain their memories and when I take them off, I can controll them with my mind. This is going to be fun I think. But what does he mean with surp...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't notice that gas was filling the room. With a big 'thump' you hit the ground and passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The next morning</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n6:50 a.m. Your alarm woke you up, but it wasn't your alarm. You opened your eyes and noticed, that you were lying in the guestroom of the house of Tim's parents. You sat up in bed and made up your mind.<br>\r\n\"Was it all a bad drem? Maybe... Well no time to think about it, time to get up!\"<br>\r\nAfter you showered and cleaned your teeth you got back to the guestroom to dress yourself for school. You closed the door and turned around. What you saw made you speechless...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck!?\" <br>\r\nYaour thoughts were racing. Right on the nighttable beside the bed, a pen was laying. The pen definitly wasn't there before. <br>\r\n\"What if it wasn't a dream?\" You thought. <br>\r\nRight in the moment you wanted to exaim the pen a bit more a fist hammered against the door.<br>\r\n\"Lasse, we have to go or we will get to late to the bus! Hurry up!\"- It was Tim. \"Yeah! I'm coming! Give me two minutes!\" You said back and dressed yourself.You put the pen into the pocket of your jeans and you left the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter five minutes Tim and you arrived at the bus stop and were greeted by Kaya who just lives a house above it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Tim and Kaya were chatting a bit, your thoughts still were racing about the pen, if it was just imagination or bitter sweet truth? The bus arrived and you got in. At the ride to school you were still thinking about he pen and who could be your first victim if it would work...</span></div></div>",

You got up and walked up to her deflated skin and you throw her onto the couch. You closed the fridge and locked her flatdoor so nobody else could get into it. Now you turned around and walked up to Lissys deflated skin. \"Hm, what should I do with you?\", you asked yourself, not waiting for any response of Lisa-Marie. <br>\r\nYou undressed yourself and thought a bit. <br>\r\n\"What should I do? Wear her? This would be the best for now.\" You walked up to her skin and undressed it. She was wearing a white loose pullover , a white bra, white socks and a pair of black leggings. You laid everything carefully on the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do you want to enter her skin?</span></div></div>",

Your errecion rose into something you culdn't describe.<br>\r\n\"Allright\", you thought wehen you opened the zipper. The Inside of Lisa-Marie was slimey and pink. You ignored it, only one goal: Getting into her skin. When you wut your left leg into her you felt how warm her skin was. You also put the right leg on and like magic it transformed into the leg of Lissy. Your errection grew more than a lot. You were just pulling her legs up, like a pair of leggings, when you noticed, that over her lips was a condom-like puch. You know that it was for your penis, so you pressed it carefully into it and although it looked pretty tight it was comfortably to wear. You alligned herr cheeks and pressed the slit of them into yours. After that you pulled her up and glided your hands in the glove likes of Lisa-Marie. The were much shorter than your hands were but you ignored it. After a second your hands were shrinking to fit these gloves. Last thing left was her head. You pulled it up and looked inside. The inside was just like the rest of her pink and slimey. But there were her teeth. But they were empty, just like the ones you put on on haloween when you dressed up as a vampire. Last but not least there was a pink pouch. \"Maybe the tounge?\", you thought out loud. You gulped and than you pushed the empty face over your head, pressed your teeth into the empty ones of Lissy and your tounge into the empty pouch. After that, you closed the zipper and everything went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt how the magic of the pen was doing it's work. You felt yourself being transformed, memories flooding into your brain, Lisa-Marie's memories. You suddenly remembered how much she hated you but was friendly to keep her image in front of the class. You remembered her first time. She was drunk and horny, so she picked a guy from her village and more or less raped him. Thanks god he was to drunk to remember anything. She was 14 whan this happened. <br>\r\nYou felt a feeling your old self never knew but thanks to Lissy's memories you know what it was. You were getting horny. You remembered that she has no dildos in her flat because she preffered it to finger herself. So you laid yourself on her bed and let her fingers glide over your new skin, just as she did it. When you reached your new lips, you pulled one finger inside it. The feeling was great and a yelp escaped your mouth. But it wasn't your voice! It was Lissy's voice, just a bit deeper because you heard it from inside now. you raised the tempo, just like she did. When you reached your G-Spot you almost screamed in pleassure! <br>\r\nAfter almost two hours of nonstop masturbating you stopped and dressed yourself in her, now your clothes she was wearing before. You remembered, training was starting soon and you wanted to know how it felt to be so flexible like Lisa-Marie, so you grabbed your keys and sporttights and went out.</span></div></div>",

A pair of tight leggings and a louse top. After you finished you went into the hall and the workout started. First stretching, a thing which was totally new for you because your old self never was so flexible than Lisa-Marie is. After twenty minutes of stretching your team decided to start with the new programm. The topic was \"Halloween\". So you practiced your poses and moves. Lissy's memories were very helpful to stay cool in that situation. but just it was difficult it was also arousing to you. Later in the dressingroom you saw Vanessa, a classmate and good friend of you. Lisa-Marie admired her for her figure which was almost model like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lissy, eant to come to my hose now?\", Vanessa asked, not knowing that she was talking to Lasse, perfectly imitating Lisa-Marie. <br>\r\n\"Of course. What do you want to do?\"<br>\r\n\"Just chat a bit and maybe watch a film or so...\" Vanessa answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought for a moment if you should go with her and hang out or if you should go with her and capture her in her house.</span></div></div>",

Luckily Kaya was still looking inside her locker (or at least pretending to look) and the other people around you were too obsessed with their phones to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, just you watch. Man when I scare you, you're going to jump out of your underwear.\" You give him a fake stump laughing it off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to see you try that. But serious man, what's up with you? The whole trip you have this weird gaze, like you're someplace far away.\" Tim asks getting a bit serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just...\" At that moment you want to tell Tim about the pen and the weird explanation you got about it. But would he believe you? If he were to tell you, you would just laugh it into his face. No, perhaps you will tell him after you tried the pen out. No, you just have to come up with some excuse for now. \"I played a video game way after midnight and it's a game where you have to make a choice. Still can't make my mind up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. I hate those games, whatever choice you make it's always wrong.\" Tim shakes his head. \"That's why I stick with COD.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right, like you don't have to make choices in games like that? Which way you need to go, which enemy you will hit next.\" You tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim shakes his head as he grabs his bag. \"No way man, it's easy. It's all about strategy. I'm serious man.\" He tells you after you grin at him. Tim and strategy. \"Look, you have to pick your opponent knowing if you can take him on. For example take Kaya there.\" He says pointing at her. \"I know her, and you too of course, and that makes taking her out much more easily than for example .....\" At that moment he stops speaking as he sees Annalena, his crush walking by. Of course she pays him no attention, but Tim just stares at her until you shake him awake. \"Thanks, so now you get it?\" He asks you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, thanks for a lesson of strategy o wise one.\" You bow to him low. \"Wise ass.\" He tells you as he makes off to the bathroom before class starts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it didn't seem like much, Tim's explanation did give you an idea for a target to pick.

And for that you need Kaya. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaya.\" You call to her as she looks up from her locker.

He's your best friend, so he's the closest. Although it could be tricky zapping him in there. Hopefully, there wouldn't be anyone else there. If he was in a stall, though, it wouldn't be noticeable. But if he's in a stall, ... You mind rejects that picture as well as him standing doing his business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, maybe Tim isn't the best. Besides, after you use someone as a skin, they become your obedient slave or something. You really don't want to do that to him. Not to Kaya either.

Your mind fades from the teacher droning on and on. Half the class is already playing games or checking messages on their devices while the teacher thinks they're taking notes.

I'm the best, the most popular, natural beauty, the most desired.\" Her hand drifts up into your crotch as she licks her lips and says, \"You want to be in me, to be in me first and be me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly another hand reached in from the other side and a voice announced, \"Now wait a minute. Why waste time with that soft fluff when you can have this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head swings to reveal Susanne next to you in her soccer kit wrapping tightly around what little skin isn't showing. Her long blond hair flows over her chest giving the impressions she's not wearing a top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd really rather have this well toned body and see what it can do for you when you're in me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the two of them were currently doing for you was to get you very aroused with their hands massaging your swollen manhood. If that weren't enough, a bare foot was gliding up your leg until its toes were crawling inside your boxers. You didn't even have time to think where your pants went or why she is here as you looked forward to see Laura straddling the chair backwards in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lasse, we always hang out together, and I've told you so much about me that it's just natural that you should get in me first. Maybe we can switch later or get me a boy skin.\" She winks then adds, \"Remember what Tim said about knowing who you can take on - or be in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if you're in me, you can give me to Tim, make me break up with Max, and then I'll obey you when you're out and you tell me to be Tim's girlfriend that he crushes so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lasse, be in me.

Be in me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be in me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In me.\" \"In me.\" \"In me.\" \"In me.\" \"In me.\" \"In me.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bell rings, and you pop alert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And remember the paper due Friday. You all heard. No excuses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou must have fallen asleep and dreamed of those three.

Her hands were soft, and tenderly she stroked each toe. \"Which one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe throbbing rapidly moved from your toe to your crotch, getting stronger with each caress as you gazed at her chest. Pain seemed to fade, replaced with growing excitement. This all had short-circuited your voice causing her to look up when you didn't answer after a while.

You had forgotten that you left it on the sink and must have included it with your clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The button doesn't seem to work the point or the laser thing. Is is broken?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, no! She's pushed it several times and holding it towards me. If she does it enough, it may go off, and I'll become a deflated skin.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel all the blood draining to your feet in panic. You rushed over and took it from her just in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah. It's a little tricky. Sometimes it may, ah, um, er, squirt. Yeah, squirt. So we shouldn't play with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Squirt?\" Laura gave you a funny look, then suddenly she gleamed mischievous and tried to grab it back. A playful struggle ensued with you rubbing against her breasts and feeling her nubs rubbing back. It was exciting you, but you were terrified what could happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only think that you must get it back safely. But then your mind asked <i>Why? \u00a0Just zap her.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there was a buzzing flash of light.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You could still feel Laura's hand on your arm fighting for the pen, but your grasp on her hand loosened then fell away. Your whole body collapsed underneath you. You thought for sure you were fainting for some reason, but you weren't losing consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven stranger was that there was no crash as you crumbled to the ground. There was no heavy thud of legs and arms and torso, and definitely there was no bonk of your head. It was like it just settled onto a soft pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTry as you might, you couldn't open your eyes to see or move any muscle of your body.  However, you did hear Laura gasp as she let loose of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the . . ?\" she muttered. A few seconds of silence then, \"Oh my! Oh my ohmyohmyohmy. It's, it's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a clatter of something hitting the floor. Your guess was that it was the pen. She must have dropped it. You just wish you could see or speak or move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can't be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt hands on your head then they lifted you by the neck, but you head just flopped backwards. It all felt so weird being held upright with your arms dangling uselessly and you legs giving no support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But,\" her voice soft with amazement. \"But, it is. I didn't think such a thing was possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What was?</i> your mind screamed trying to get her to answer. But then you realized what had happened. She was holding up a Lasse skin suit. The pen fired and must have hit you. Now you were just a wearable image of yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lasse, why didn't you tell me? Or did you know? Hmmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt yourself pulled across the floor. Laura moved your arms to the sides and then laid out you legs. Obviously, she was spreading you out. It just felt like you were lying down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, what should I do with you? How does this thing work? Maybe I just need to push the button again to re-inflate you. Wait. Are you really a skin suit or just a boneless boy.\" She giggled at that last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then began moving you around and pulling on your clothes.  However, you soon found she was not pulling them on, but off. Before you could feel embarrassed, she held you up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a suit. Here's a seam going up the back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she laid you face down, her finger ran along your spine if you still had one which you certainly didn't now. But more than that, you could feel her finger push inside you run from neck to tail. It was weird and a bit exciting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, you began to worry. What if she decides to try you on? What if she uses the pen again on you? What if she seals you back up? Will you come back? There were so many things that could happen that you lost track of what was happening and had to stop and try to sense where she was.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your whole head feels formless with your nose twisted without shape and crumpled flat at the bottom. Your tongue is sideways against a pile of teeth. At least you think they're teeth. They aren't solid, but you can feel little rounded squares collapsed against your cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyelids remain shut, and you don't feel any eyeballs. Still unable to move, you rely on your hearing which seems to be fine even though you can feel your ears folded over. Also your skin is still sensitive, and the cool air makes you want to shiver, but you can't. Every little movement of air seems exaggerated now. At least she left the fuzzy pink robe under you so you're not all against the bare floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you hear is not very loud but sounds like Laura is moving some clothes - maybe the dryer? No. It's too soon for that. There is a slight swish of air beside you and the sound of material being dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What is she doing? Did she get a sheet to cover me or something else?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA memory pops in your mind of talking about when you were kids. Laura mentioned that she liked pretending with her dolls and that the boy doll she had didn't have any boy parts, so she always thought boys and girls were the same down below and that she could dress them up in each others clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No! Laura wait. Please don't put me in your clothes and make me up before you re-inflate me,</i> you begged in your mind, hoping somehow you could get through. You felt awkward enough before in the robe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then you were shaken from your thoughts - literally - as Laura picked you up. From her fingers clutching your shoulders, you hung down and must be facing away from her. At least she wasn't examining your privates which you sensed now being very tiny in their deflated state. She might think that's all the bigger you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I never thought I'd do this,\" she said. \"In fact, I always thought that you'd make a skin suit of me after all those conversations we had about them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What? What are you planning to . . .</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat question was answered as her hands came together at your neck. You felt her thumbs part the seam in your skin.

Her foot began its slide inside your leg, and you felt it under your skin. It was something like having your bones put back if they were wrapped in silk because it was so smooth, but it gave a sensation of being gently caressed from underneath. You were too consumed by the sensation to ponder whether it was Laura's doing or just how being filled as a skin suit felt. It was very, very nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her toes slid into yours, suddenly your leg was alive once more, only you didn't have control. You felt her move it and then the weight as her sole and heel pressed solidly on the floor. The second leg filled and took weight. Unfortunately, you could still sense your perspective as bent over at the waist, hands dragging on the floor, and your face bobbing against your shins with her legs inside. You would have been nauseous as the leg hair tickled your cheek, but thankfully you had no stomach. She adjusted your hips up over hers maintaining her balance  by shifting your feet. Having your legs move by themselves, since you couldn't do anything with them, was quite bizarre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wow,\" she gasped, pausing with you in this half upside down position. You knew exactly what had caused her to react. The sensation was clear to you and must be to her as well. \"They seemed so small a minute ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe excitement must have been simmering in you both. So when the suit snugged up just below your belly, that excitement started to boil. Your mind was blushing even if your face wasn't under your control. The thought that she was inside you \u00a0<i>and</i>\u00a0 inside your most manly possessions was a thrill, and it was manifesting itself like would happen to any boy. Fortunately, Laura didn't try to look since your upper body was flopping down covering them for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arms animated your arms like happened with her legs into yours. First, it was sensing that warm flesh under your skin, then the merging into being just your skin - or was it her skin now? When her tummy and torso pressed inside the skin's, you felt breathing as her diaphragm moved up and down. You hadn't even considered before that you weren't breathing, but you hadn't been ever since becoming a suit. How could you? So soon your two tummy's became one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer full breasts next tightened behind your pecks. Her nipples poked hard into yours until you felt your own grow full and tight - albeit, much smaller - then the feeling of hers inside you disappeared. You wondered if you now had boobs, but your chest felt normal - except your little, taut nubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, again. I'm as flat as a, <i>[giggle]</i> as a boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that answers that question. Her, or actually, your hands now reached across to pull the suit together at the shoulders. Her back was so smooth and warm under you for a few seconds until it just became you as the suit must have sealed itself - or you merged into her. The thought of merging bodies really began to excite you, at least mentally. Your body was already showing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. Here's the real test,\" Laura sighed right behind your ears as you felt your flabby noggin finally held upright from having your nose on your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill blind, you wondered what would happen as you felt her pull the neck opening wide then stuck her head inside. The skin eased on. Her nose pushed into your deflated one so it felt full again. Then there was a tongue and teeth filling your mouth. Your lips puckered, and that tongue moistened them. It felt familiar but slightly different like Laura must move her tongue differently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hands pulled the hair that was still hanging down her back and pushed it into your head. With a tug, your face tightened on her forehead. You felt eyeballs form against your eyelids.  You wondered if you were going to see or if it was just her eyes now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you waited for her to open your lids, you felt a warmth grow around your neck then down the back seam. The bump you felt under your head that was her hair faded with a tingling that lasted a couple seconds.  Laura must have felt it, too, as she straightened up. You felt a wave of excited anticipation. You weren't sure if it was from her or yourself, but you sensed her twitching your eyelids getting ready to open them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she opened them . . .<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You could see the kitchen again, but your body turned and started down the hall not caring about looking at anything where you were. The steps seemed odd - a bit different than you normally walked. But then you rarely run around naked, and maybe it's just because of the shock of what you just went through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPast the bathroom, your body took you straight into Laura's room. You'd never seen it before, but your eyes didn't give you time to look around. Your hand took the door and closed it leaving your body facing the mirror on the reverse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere you stood seeing your own normal reflection. Your eyes looking back were wide with amazement. Your head leaned in while a hand pushed your eyelid around then poked in your mouth as it was opened wide. Your tongue stuck out a bit before she turned you around looking over her shoulder and reached at your neck and back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's perfect. No gap. No seam.\" Her hand went to her throat. \"Even the voice.\" She giggled which sounded and looked very odd on your face than when you laugh. You hope you - she - never giggle like that, at least where anyone can see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped you back a pace as she moved your eyes' focus up and down over your whole body. Eventually she stopped mid-level. You hand came round to the erection that you had sensed earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what have we here? Oh,\" she gasped as she made your fingers slide up to the tip. She wrapped them around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you've done this yourself lots of times, it was something new to have someone else control your body and, especially, play with your most precious part. However, it made the sensations more intense, and you found yourself starting to enjoy it. The thought that your good friend Laura was now playing with your body . . . but without your permission, suddenly triggered a sense of embarrassment and anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hey!

Besides the physical sensation itself, internally your body was churning with young male hormones setting off who-knows-what chemicals that were making your heart beat faster and faster and warming your body with each pumping. Plus it was pulsing endorphins throughout so your brain would relax and concentrate only on the pleasure, which it seemed to be doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't help either that your subconscious was repeating about having a naked girl inside you. <i>Girl. Naked. Inside. Girl. Naked.</i> Even though you were upset about Laura playing with your male pride, knowing that you couldn't control it, or her, somehow just intensified the thrill. In other words, you were being seduced by your own body and mind. It was like a dream that scared you but was too wonderful to stop. It was all so overwhelming that you lost focus, a surreal gallop in rapture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly the haze over your mind faded to a feeling of comfort and bliss as your body lay perfectly still after bounding so delightfully. Sight was gone again, but you heard and felt yourself breathing heavy and deep. Serenity was the state you were in - calm and peaceful in body and mind as you lay on your back not even trying to consider the question floating on the peripheral of reality:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How did I end up lying down?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderneath you, it was very soft and cushy, not the hard floor you had felt earlier. But it wasn't scratchy like carpet. About then you sensed the sticky moistness on your hands and the spots of warm goo on belly and thighs. That could only mean one thing: she had taken your body where no girl had gone before and must have done it on her bed. The ambiguous feelings wrestled again thinking what she did without asking but also that you just peaked in a girl's bed.<i> In. Girl's. Bed.</i> A deep breath came, and the ceiling appeared above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was interesting,\" your voice spoke then gave that awful giggle. \"Different, but still very enjoyable.\" She raised her hands and added, \"Except this mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, what did you expect if you don't catch it in something?</i> you taunted even though she obviously couldn't hear you. <i>Ugh.

In fact, you no longer even considered moving her eyes or head to see something that was of interest to you.  Just to be under Laura's control felt natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was until the memory of receiving the pen surfaced in your mind.

Laura reached behind her head and pulled off your head. You first felt her hair bubble up underneath, then your sight went dark. There was a soft popping noise as your ears separated from hers, and your tongue and teeth fell loose as their insides were pulled out.  Her hair streamed across your shoulders and neck. It felt so foreign and tickled a bit when she shook her head making the hair bounce against your skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I guess that's what girls feel all the time. It's rather soft and nice. Maybe I could grow my hair long - or if I ever get to wear a girl skin.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura continued sliding out of you. It was almost as stimulating as when she got in except it reminded you of pulling bones out of an animal.

It's only a few seconds, but you feel like it's happening in slow motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst your feet pop out, then legs expand from the ankles like they are filling from the bottom up. Next actually is your bottom that happens to be on top with your belly on the floor. As if you ate too much and got gas, your torso expands to your neck. You have to wait for your shoulders to round out before your muscles roll down your arm like those old Popeye cartoons when he ate spinach. Your thumbs, then each finger in line becomes straight and full down to your pinkies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you feel pressure build in your neck. Your jaw pushes against the floor, and you think you've grown chipmunk cheeks from the quick change. Ears begin to wiggle and flap as your nose lifts your face at the same time. Pressure builds in your forehead as your eyeballs become round causing you to blink. Then it's over with a real skull in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm back!\" you shout ever thankful to hear that you're able to speak your own voice and also be able to see again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bounce to your feet and wave your arms dancing around, glad that you're controlling your body again. Then you turn to look at Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with you?\" she asks. \"Did passing out in our little fight make you go crazy?\" she giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, ah, er, well, ah, ...\" you stammer. You notice that Laura isn't holding the pen which you assumed she would if she just zapped you back from being a skin. Frantically you scan the room until you spot it on the floor. Why would it be there unless she dropped it when you collapsed? Maybe you did pass out, and this was all a dream. After all, most skin suit stories always say that the skin never remembers what happened to it. So why would you remember?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to find a way to find out if you were out or a skin. You're still in the robe like you were when you fought. Laura's still in that shirt that clings to her chest. You can see her nipples which makes you embarrassed and look away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she dropped it in surprise or to keep her story about you blacking out. That's what she said when you were a suit. Could you have dreamed that about her mentioning a blackout and then have it come true from her saying it to you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at her trying to read her expression. Is she tense and sweating a bit because she's lying? Or is it from the battle you two just had? She stares back and seems to be daring you to challenge her. Or is it just because she's concerned you bonked your head?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is one way to find out: make her a skin, and you get her memories - at least that's what the voice told you. She didn't seem to get yours, but maybe that's because it's your pen and your special heritage makes it work differently. There must be some other way though. How long would it be if you were really made into a skin suit? Of course, you could just ask. Surely as a friend she wouldn't lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, are you crazy or not? Answer me.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The shock froze you in place staring down then looking around for Laura, She seemed to have disappeared until you realized what you're holding was more than just her t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! She's deflated just like, like she was, was, ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped and held up the t-shirt pulling her hair up with it. It was slightly heavier than just a shirt, but it's the beige colored things dangling out of the t-shirt openings that scared you. They looked like long gloves and - legs. Instinctively, you jumped back letting the skin dive to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura, what have I done to you?\" You trembled and stared at the pen in your hand. <i>It must have worked. It fired during the struggle and hit Laura. Is she, is she really a skin suit?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGathering your courage, you bent down and picked her up. Her head flopped forward and the arms slid inside as you held the t-shirt. You twisted to stop them but too late. Her hands fell out the bottom as the shirt rode up with just her head keeping it from falling off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now had a good view of her tummy and panties along with her empty arms and legs. It was creepy and exciting. It's just like a cloth body suit but made of real skin - your friend's skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting her back down on the ground and laying her head back, her face became visible although rather flat without the roundness of a skull, her ears splayed out to the sides making it almost comical. Eyelids were closed, and you wondered if her eyes were in there. What about her teeth?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple swallows and reassuring yourself it's OK, you reached for the mouth. It opened showing teeth and even a tongue, although all were like a thin film. You started to poke a finger into the mouth, but pulled back when it felt warm and slightly moist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if she's still alive and can feel anything,\" you murmured to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, there was one way to find out: use the pen to turn her back and ask her. You probably should and explain it all. That's what a friend would do when an accident happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, you remembered those conversations with Laura about wearing costumes and disguising yourself as someone. You even talked about the fantasy of skin suits, and she said that if it was possible to become one, she hoped you would wear her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you were not sure she really was a skin suit or if you could wear her. Maybe you should at least investigate her condition further and see if there was a way to put her on. That would mean taking the rest of her clothes off. That was a little perverted without her permission. If you turned her back, she could tell you before you zap her again. But did she already give you that when she said she wanted you to wear her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Supposedly you could get her on through any of her openings, but that seemed a bit nasty like invading her without permission and you won't do that to a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you turned her over and pulled her shirt up her back. To your amazement, there it was - a seam running along her spine or where her spine would be if she had any bones. It went from her neck to her tail bone. Fortunately, it didn't go between her cheeks which would have grossed you out and any thoughts of entering her would be over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seam was shut like Velcro or something. It would open but just fall back together with her laying there on the floor. Taking her by the shoulders, you held her up facing away. As you did, the opening fell open, and you could see inside. Well, not really \"see\" since it was just a dark grayish void. No matter how you held it to the light, nothing would come into focus. Then it dawned on you. This is magic or some science beyond comprehension, so why would you be able to see inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat immediately got you to wonder if you could actually get inside. What would you be stepping into if you lowered her some to raise your foot to slide inside. You mind filled with all sorts of possibilities, first like a wet boot or a rubber suit. But if you can't see anything, would you feel anything. You might not even know it was there like stepping into air. You could put in your second leg and not even know it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe excitement of having Laura as a skin had been been building since you saw the seam, and you could feel it pointing forward as you day dreamed what it would be like to have her skin on. How would you be able to get over a throbbing boner? Maybe it would stick out her pussy like a she-male. An image came into your mind of Laura with a bulge in her panties. Suddenly you felt caught between laughing and puking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing your eyes to shake that off, you took a deep breath and stretched your arms out in front. When you opened your eyes, Laura wasn't being held in front of you anymore. There was nothing in your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shit!\" was all you could say as you saw your hands. They weren't your hands, but they obviously were because you could move them and you could feel things. What you felt was something hanging in front from your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must have put her on without realizing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough as your new hands moved around the mass of hair and skin dangling below your chin, you could see Laura's legs on you and her panties and tummy. That excitement grew again but just a bit under the skin of your crotch - Laura's crotch. You couldn't feel your man parts at all. How could they be crammed against you by this suit and not be felt? Slowly one hand slid down across your abs and on top of the silky panties to check. Fortunately, you weren't a she-male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hand flew back away as you became very self conscious of what you've done. Or maybe it was the new sensation of touching Laura's mound that surprised you.  You also felt a tingle run up your back which must be the skin sealing up the seam. You tried to reach around behind to stop it but you couldn't touch anything except skin. The movement also made you aware of the new weight of her breasts now attached to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hand moved her flopping head aside again as the other reached up and cupped a boob. You could feel her, er, your hand on it. They were real. You had breasts. You gave a little squeeze. It felt like a little squeeze, and the nipples began to grow as you watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got nipples. Big round nipples,\" you gasped bewilderedly as they pointed forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking you moved your thumb to touch the nipple then pushed it like a button. It felt like a thumb pushing your nipple. That's all. You were a little dismayed but also glad that it wasn't something that would be so intense that you couldn't stop and might take you somewhere you shouldn't - at least not now - or with your friend. But you wondered . . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother deep breath as you held the head and hair in your hands. It was time to decide whether to become fully Laura and put the head on or not. If you do, this might invoke the magic of making her your slave. You still didn't want to do that to her. But you really, really wanted to know that the skin suit worked 100%.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At the edges, you had Laura's hands holding it open like a massive void waiting to consume you. It appeared much wider than her neck, and the murky interior seemed to be infinitely deep about to swallow you whole. You closed your eyes at the thought of what may happen, all the consequences, all the possibilities, all the new sensations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeasing your tummy and new breasts with its soft strands, her hair drooped down your front seeming to move on its own. Once it stopped, everything felt strange for a few seconds.  Your tongue felt coated by a slippery glove, and your teeth bit into a gummy candy that melted down your throat. You were scared to open your eyes, but when you felt something close around your throat and something tickling your back, they popped open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could focus, there was a warmth at the top of your spine and everything felt normal - no suit over your body, head or hair. It was just the air on your skin - your new, real skin. Laura's skin. Then it struck you hard and fast - a headache like none you've ever experienced. Something inside your head was swelling and heating up. Your hands immediately went to the sides of you head to hold your skull against the pain. Your fingers became enmeshed in long hair, and you tried to rationalize through the pain, but thoughts were useless. You sank to your knees, then to a fetal position until, just as suddenly as it started, it stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure how long you laid there curled up trying to calm the pounding in your chest, but you were getting cold and uncomfortable. The first thing you saw was your t-shirt on the floor before you, and you wondered how that came off. Reaching for it as you sat up, you remembered finding a strange looking pen in Lasse's clothes you put in then dryer.  Then he freaked out, and you two started to struggle until - you ended up here on the floor, you guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your shirt back on, you looked around for Lasse while combing back your hair with your fingers. \"Lasse. Lasse?\" No answer. <i>I wonder where he went.</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Strangely, you're only giving out simple answers and not gone on like you would normally do with details of everything. You really need to get control of yourself, er, of the Laura in you. You start thinking of how this is happening and drop concentration again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how did you get it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lasse dropped it when we were fighting over it earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? Where is he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's inside me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After the pen accidentally went off and turned me into a skin, he put me on.\" You mentally grab at your own mouth to control the words but end up just blurting, \"It's me, Lasse. I'm Lasse inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuliette just stares for a few moments then starts laughing hysterically. \"Good one. You've really been hanging out too much with Lasse. You're starting to talk like him and how he thinks skin suits can be real.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're somewhat relieved and angered that she didn't believe you. Maybe you should show her by zapping her into a suit. But she wouldn't know or understand or remember anything if she was a suit. Just take off the Laura skin and ... \u00a0But what would she think then - Lasse naked holding a skin of their friend?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe just pop off Laura's head and then zap her. Turn her into your slave like Laura will be. That stops you cold as you remember what will happen to Laura now that you've worn her. You didn't really want to make her a slave.
