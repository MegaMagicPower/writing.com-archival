Not only was powerful because of their leader Stoick the vast, but also because thanks to his son Hiccup they were able to make peace with the dragons. However someone wasn't entirely happy about all this success, that somebody was Astrid, a young and very skilled female warrior. She always was very proud, and even though she liked the changes that happened to Berk, she was a little disappointed by the fact that once she was the most respect young wiking of all Berk, while now Hiccup took her place thanks to the dragons. One day, while she was flying alone above the sea with her dragon Stormfly, she was thinking \"Oh man, nobody now pays attention to me anymore. Hiccup takes all the credits for himself. I'm sure he is not doing that on purpose, but still I can't help of seing him very happy every time the people of Berk complimented him. Man I wish there is someway for me to do to change all this, to make me back on top of the hill.\" And when she said those words she noticed something glowing on a very little island \"Wow what is that? Stormfly down\" said Astrid and so her dragon flied down. As soon as she landed on the island, Astrid got down from stormfly and looked for the source of that light. After a few seconds she found it and once she took a closer look at it she was speechless. It was</span></div></div>",

There was something deeper that was different too. Astrid just couldn't quite put her finger on it. All she had changed was Stormfly's colour, but she looked .... was she bigger, more muscular ....more aggressive. Her lip curled up at the edge and a menacing wisp of smoke emerged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay girl. I can take a hint.\" She grasped the gem firmly. \"I wish Stormfly was back to her normal colouring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid watched carefully this time.

As first born, she'd be the one trusted to lead the village. Hiccup could be free. She told herself, free to invent and earn that dismissive viking name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gem glowed in Astrid's palm, as it strained to comply. Only a final flare of light coming from it before, the light vanished, and it looked a plain, piece of quartz. Looking about the home, she recognised the chief's place... Well, hers now.... hers and Hiccups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpotting her little sister snuggling in the furs, the nearby slab of stone covered by Toothless. She spotted her own bed. The stone slab for Stormfly at the foot of her bed, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiccup turned restlessly, moaning softly in her sleep, as if facing a nightmare. Kissing her forehead she settled, and Astrid went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dull gemstone, she tucked beneath the bed. It didn't show any promise, but she didn't want to lose it... just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night passed quickly, with her waking to the smell of bacon being fried for breakfast. Looking sideways, Hiccup was yawning and stretching, \"Morning Sis...\" she said brightly, spotting Astrid's gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of Stoick humming a tune to himself downstairs made Astrid happier than she'd ever been. With both her parents dead, even having a father felt like a luxury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breakfast is ready.\" the voice calling through, as the humming stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt selfish, and a little guilty. But as she took in the new female Hiccup, she was still the same person that Astrid remembered. Still happy, inventive and rather petite. As a young viking woman, she wasn't scrawny, or weak... but petite definitely suited her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompared to some of the viking women, Astrid knew she wasn't bulky herself, but she towered a head over her sister, rather than vice versa. It was an odd sensation. Both dragons playfully scuffled before racing out the front door to hunt for their own breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFed and watered, they headed down to the arena. Hiccup eager to find out more about the dragon they'd discovered and recovered the previous night. After a restful night it should be calmer, and more willing to accept help for it's injuries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey chatted about how to gain the dragon's confidence, and how to feed it, help it, and learn from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reached the arena... Well, dragon training academy now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1f5318ca71166f516e5946ed5b462755/c8ab79f076d79a29-26/s1280x1920/70f7beaf849130fc65dfbd29dbce03fef12422a6.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/1f5318ca7116...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a passionate discussion, with them both having particular ideas.</span></div></div>",

However after a second, she shook her head, and her usual open smile returned to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuff and Tuff, were now identical twin sisters. Astrid just re-imagined them as bimbos, Ruff remained largely the same. However, for Tuff the changes were deeper. She lost a few inches, and dressed like her sister, but with accents in blue rather than green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Fishlegs was a rather stocky girl, but not without her charms. Her intelligence and friendly nature remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as Astrid thought of Snotlout, she recalled all the sexist and offensive comments that he'd made. She considered how he'd manage having to face them on a daily basis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnotlout lost his stubby nose, replaced with a delicate button nose. She gained some razor sharp cheek bones, and entrancing wide limpid pools for eyes. They were a fascinating emerald, and the talk of the village when she was born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid concentrated harder, as she imagined Snotlout as a shapely beauty. The sort of girl that had the guys falling over themselves to help, who wasn't allowed to even attempt any task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found a foul taste filling her stomach as she wrought the changes. With a realisation, she released the stone, allowing it to fall to the bottom of her pocket.</span></div></div>",

He turned his gaze towards Runa, but was unsettled by the darkness of the dragon, besides he wasn't sure he trusted Runa to be as safe a flyer with her leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe choice was easy for him to make, he caught Stormfly's eye, and -well- she seemed to approve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Astrid reached out her arm, she helped him to mount up. He settled down behind her on the dragon's muscular neck. It shifted beneath him in a rather unsettling way. So he quickly grabbed onto Astrid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... Hey... not so tight.\" Astrid objected quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And keep your hands a little lower too.\" she added. Runa couldn't tell who was blushing more Astrid or Isaac, but before he could decide Stormfly kicked off and with a powerful sweep of her wings was airborne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid was feeling a little self-conscious as she'd aged the riders a few years. The extra years had given her a more generous set of curves. But still keeping her taut and toned body, athletic and lithe. Even now, she felt a little insecure, looking over to Runa, who already being a year older was more generously shaped. She snorted, even as Hiccup, he'd been less fit than her. Although as Runa she had to admit to a degree of jealousy about Runa's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeatlug wasn't far behind the steady purring of his wings as he launched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuna leaned forward, \"Let's show them, how fast a dragon can really fly.\" she whispered to Toothless's ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a quick couple of steps and launched. With his wings extended and paws lifted, he flew. Just inches above the grass he quickly caught up with and overtook Meatlug, and with a whoosh, passed beneath the claws of Stormfly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three dragons soared onwards, and flew over the cliff. With a yelp, Isaac announced his fear, looking downwards didn't help as the sea raced past a hundred or so feet beneath them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid didn't tell him off for the sudden clutching at her waist. With a chuckle she recalled her own first dragon flight. Toothless had given her a terrifying first experience. Although it had left her excited and eager for more, with an enthusiasm that stayed with her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe talked to Isaac the entire flight, to keep him distracted, telling him of the adventures of the riders. All the while she made sure that Stormfly flew steadily and ignored Runa's swooping passes and displays. Everytime she was up, she wanted to push her dragon to her potential, it seemed a shame to hold her back. But now wasn't the time for such indulgences. Stormfly seemed to appreciate the novice rider too, and kept her wings fully extended and flew very smoothly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragon Island appeared on the horizon, and she pointed it out to Isaac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked over her shoulder she saw the sense of wonder and magic written all over his face. He was transfixed by the flight, by the beauty.... by the whole situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled in close to her, \"I can never thank you enough for this.... this whole experience....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShyly he gave her a kiss, a chaste peck on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid flinched in surprise and turned her gaze to the front, unsure how to react.</span></div></div>",

So she slid off, Stormfly, and gave Isaac a hand as he jumped / fell from the back of the dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe landed off balance, and toppled forward. As he went he landed on top of Astrid, he head fell between her breasts.

There was a gentle gurgling from it's stomach and a pale emerald glow deep in it's mouth.

They both knew better. He stared at them a while then said, \"Look girls, we have had this conversation before. We need treaties of cooperation with other islands, and since you are females, the best way to do that is to have a marriage that unites our peoples. Cass is especially important, since they are our closest neighbor. Now, come back out and mind your manners. And if one of you won't volunteer to marry the boy, I will pick one of you. I really hope that I won't have to do that.\" He waited and said, \"Now come back outside, and this time, keep your manners.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls looked stubborn, but followed their father out. Fortunately for Astrid, the wish worked, and as soon as Hiccup looked at Isaac again, she almost swooned, and veered into her sister!

Then she realized that when she had fallen, she had thrown her legs and feet out to get balance. As she landed on her back, her legs were widely spread! Then, to her horror, she saw her armor fade away to be replaced by clothing more common to married women on Berk. Also, her braided pigtails were replaced by her long hair pulled back into a pony-tail, also common to the younger married women of Berk. She was no longer a shield maiden. She was Snotlout's wife!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw the shocked look on his face as he saw her transformation. Then he noticed the braided band of hair on his wrist. It was the custom for the bride to braid a band made from her hair, and give it to her husband on their wedding day as a symbol of her devotion to him. He stuttered, \"It, it, it worked. We 'are' married!\" He looked at his hand, \"This gem grants wishes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid jumped up, \"That is mine!! Give it back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe easily held her away, \"You know Astrid, I wish you wouldn't fight me, but be a totally obedient wife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like that, Astrid stopped struggling with him. \"Please Snotlout!

She also  did not complain or try to stop him when he grabbed or massaged different, intimate parts of her body.

Then let's go inside and start making babies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid was in turmoil on the inside. This CAN'T be happening! She just can't stay married to a smelly slob like Snotlout! She HAD to find a way to get that gem back! And she better do it soon, or she might really get pregnant by Snotlout! That thought made her sick! She couldn't show it though. His wish made sure that she had to act like a good wife and not fight him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when they found their cottage, they both walked in as if they owned the place, which they did of course. It was also a horrid mess! This was no shock, since Astrid always wanted to be a shield maiden, not a housewife, so it was doubtful she put much effort into the home in that way. Combined with Snotlout's slob-like ways, it even smelled. It was so bad that even Snotlout thought it was a smelly mess! He looked at Astrid, \"Wow! I never appreciated what mom did at home. I wish that, from now on, you can't stand a mess in this house, and when you are not doing something to please me, you will work to make this the neatest, cleanest house in Berk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid shuddered in fear as he spoke, but when he was done, she felt a tingle in her head. When it was done, she was so overwhelmed with disgust for the condition of their home that she had to run outside and throw up! When Snotlout called her back in, he said, \"Now, let's get to know each other a lot better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't resist him, but the thought of making love to the filthy Snotlout on 'that' filthy bed was now sickening to her, so she begged, \"Please don't do this! Especially not now! Please! At least let me clean up first!\" She couldn't believe she was saying that. Until his wish, she hated cleaning and housework!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled, \"Time enough for that. And from now on, call me 'My Love' when you address me. In private or public.\" And he held her close and began to kiss her with great passion!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were done, Astrid cried in deep sobs over the thought that it was now possible she could have Snotlout's child! For his part though, the thought of being married to Astrid, and having her bear his children, was the fulfillment of his greatest fantasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got up and dressed, \"I am going to go flying. I will be back for the evening meal. Make sure it is ready on time.\" And with that, he walked out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout Snotlout to please, Astrid soon found herself compelled by his last wish to, first clean herself up, and then dig in and start cleaning their filthy house! She knew it was the wish, but it didn't matter, she couldn't bear to see her house this dirty!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an exhausted young woman who reluctantly began to cook the evening meal. He had told her to have it ready when he returned home, so even though she was wanting to lay down and rest, she couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food was ready when Snotlout came walking in. He looked around, \"Wow! It looks a lot better! Come here and let me thank you.\" She walked up to him. She couldn't help it. And even though he smelled awful, she returned his kiss as he kissed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ate, and then he said, \"Come here woman, and tell me that you want me to make love to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she did. She had no choice. And after he was done, he fell asleep. Astrid cleaned up after the meal, then cleaned until she passed out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, she woke up on the bed. At first, she thought that it was all some terrible nightmare. But looking around at her personal items mixed with Snotlout's, she realized to her horror that it really was true. She really was Snotlout's wife! She had to find a way to escape that fate before it was too late!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made herself some breakfast, then searched her husband's things as she continued to clean the house. Unfortunately for her, after almost three days of cleaning, she had only found blisters and exhaustion! And worse, of course, was that every time Snotlout came home, he made love to her over and over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she needed to go to the market and buy them some food. She was still the Cheif's daughter, but as the wife of Snotlout, people were upset with her. After a while, she understood what was wrong. She was the eldest daughter, and by marrying Snotlout, as her husband, he would be in line as the next chief! She had to admit, that was a scary thought!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the market, she ran into...</span></div></div>",

She used the gem to make sure that she was the first-born of Stoic, and that Hiccup's name was now Ingrid. However, only herself and Ingrid would remember the existence of Hiccup. Even Toothless would only remember Ingrid. And just so that she wouldn't feel too odd, Astrid made sure that Ingrid was attracted to males, and only felt normal in female clothing. She also made sure that her sister could only use or respond to the name of Ingrid. Then she released her from the trance that she was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head, then took in the changes. Astrid found it a bit amusing to watch her feel her body, especially her missing manhood. At last, she looked at Astrid, \"What have you done to me? Why did you do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid smiled, \"I couldn't help it. As the first-born daughter, I will become the queen some day. If I left you a male, you would have been king no matter what.\" She smirked, \"Besides. Admit it. Your small body and peaceful spirit is more suited to a girl than a viking warrior anyhow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid sputtered, but for some reason couldn't deny that last part was true. \"It is still not right. You have no right to do this to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid smiled, \"Look. You really are more suited to being a female. I will make you a deal. We will walk to the dragons. If you don't find a single male attractive as we walk through the village, I will change you back. But if you do. Even one. Then you will have to stay as you are until the winter solstice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiccup/Ingrid reluctantly agreed, \"Oh! Blast you! Okay! Be ready to change me back as soon as we get there though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid smiled at she agreed. With the wish she made, her poor sister would never make it without finding a male attractive! It did make her think of one thing though. One of the things that had made Hiccup and Toothless such a good team was the bond they shared. To make sure that continued, she wished Toothless to also be female, and for Ingrid and Toothless to have a very special connection between them. So even to Hiccup/Ingrid, toothless had always been female as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen there were in the village, they ran into Erik. A prince who had recently been rescued. He was the last of his tribe. He was tall, strong, and very handsome. To her dismay, Hiccup/Ingrid was very, very, attracted to him! She looked over at her sister, and turned red in in a blush as she saw Astrid looking at her. So there was no denying it. She was attracted to males! Maybe Astrid was right. Maybe she was better off female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't say anything as they got to the dragons. Hiccup/Ingrid was deep in thought as she saddled Toothless.Astrid let her alone. For her part, Ingrid was amazed at how much closer she felt to Toothless. It was like they understood each other's thoughts and feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they flew, Ingrid found it a strange feeling to sit with her legs spread in the saddle and have no pressure in her crotch. It was odd, but she soon forgot about it as she flew with Toothless. It was strange, but wonderful, that since becoming female, she seemed more in tune with Toothless. It was like Toothless knew what she wanted to do without her saying it, or giving a signal. Maybe it was because they were both female now. If so, it might be worth while for her to stay female permanently. </span></div></div>",

She could use this gem for good. And seeing them flying together, Astrid realized that Toothless was the last of the night furies. They are beautiful creatures. It would be a terrible loss to see them go extinct. As they were exploring a new island, Astrid saw a lone dragon. It was perfect for her plan. With one wish, she turned that dragon into a night fury. A MALE night fury! With the next wish, she made sure the Toothless and he would not only be attracted to each other, but have an intense desire to produce many offspring. That would ensure the return of night furies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got the new night fury to follow her. Sure enough, when they encountered Ingrid and Toothless, it was love at first sight. Toothless almost threw Ingrid off as she greeted the newcomer. When they settled down, Astrid flew next to Ingrid and said, \"Isn't this incredible? Another night fury!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid seemed to shake herself out of a trance. She smiled a bit distantly, \"Yeah. We love him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid looked a bit confused, \"We?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid shook her head, looking confused too, \"I, um, I meant Toothless loves him. Astrid, she wants to mate with him! I think we better head back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey did, and Astrid thought that Ingrid acted strangely the whole way back. When they had landed, in a private cove, Ingrid unsettled Toothless, then took a ride back with Astrid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were back in the village, getting ready to go to eat, and Ingrid was mooning over Erik, when suddenly, Ingrid got a strange look on her face. She turned bright red, and seemed to be sweating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid looked at her, \"Ingrid. What is wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid shook her head, \"I feel such a bond with Toothless that...\"</span></div></div>",

Maybe it was a gift from Astrid. he didn't see her today.<br>\r\nHaving thoughts about drinking it. He didn't know that Astrid was watching from under the bed, he's set his lips on the edge of the bottle and drank from it. It was a very smooth liquid and sweet like a mixture of fruit.

The only thing he could do is breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to him his manhood got very hard and it was very pleasuring to. He didn't see it but his feet changes first the shrink down a little to become feminine so does his lower legs. His upper legs gain a bit of fat and smoother out as his lower does and lose traces of hair Hiccup felt his butt inflate and become more heart shape, there was a sharp pain in his hip bones as they becAme wider making his butt stick out more. His abs started to smoother out and make a nice toned core. This waist felt tighter and propelled to make his body more hours glad shape. His arms also slimmed down a bit and lot their hair. Their was suddenly pressure on his spine and his ribcage make them elegant with his new body figure.<br>\r\nHiccup suddenly felt weight gathering on his chest.He didn't know that they were breast and the swelling up to a nicee c cup. They were firm and perky to touch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hair started to grow longer a some covering his eye site. His face starts to shift and become more feminine his eyes stayed the identical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tingling became more intensive at his manhood that stood erected upwards. It starter so shrink slowly. And a new hole made its presence known hiccup suddenly had pleasure coursing through his body and it was intense. He had neither thought about it like this. The lump in his pants disappeared completely making a smooth crotch. Afterwards, he fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid quietly moved from under the bed and looked back before leaving the room see a complete female hiccup sleeping the she heard the moans of hiccup and thought that he was touching himself inappropriately. she was shocked to see what happened to hiccup and was curious to see that the change had completely changed him so she grabbed the rim of his pants and pulled them down to see that it to had changed.

Where her father was still sleeping downstairs, having woken up after that strangely uncomfortable event he didn't realize what had occurred to him he sat up and felt movement on his chest that wasn't there before and his hair covered some of his eyesight. That wasn't right hiccup thought he didn't have long hair   until his mid-back he looked down only to see to the breast with a nice size and nipples.  He immediately sprang out of bed and looked into the mirror seeing a beautiful girl standing there with all the right curves of a female. His pants have slipped down. He gazed at his female groin where a little bit of hair had grown to match his brown hair. His eyes were glowing emeralds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe touched his breast to see if they were real and moved them with his or now her hands, only to have pleasure course through her and feeling warmth in her lower parts . She suddenly smells a nice scent coming from toothless who was still sleeping and lying on his side.<br>\r\nShe found herself in trance, her dragon was one of it's kind having protected her as a brother now sister. She walked over towards where it got stronger and saw it was coming from a hidden slit of his lower belly. She dropped to her knees and she let one of her fingers slip into that slit to see if her dragon was male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer finger met the tip of the dragons penis. She started to rub it and toothless started to moan in his sleep. It grew outwards into a foot long manhood leaking pre. Hiccup didn't know she was doing this to her again didn't it mean that she was female currently attracted to men with this body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving the dragon hood out of it's hiding place the reality of was beginning to change. The people of berk had snotlout as the heir and hiccup was slowly turn into a dragon after an incident with getting hurt with toothless. Her father was in happy with her even if the was peace. The reality also made everyone believe she was female .only Astrid knew otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow hiccup found it right to crawl closer to toothless and start to rub his penis .the more pre leaked the closer she got and it dribbled other her hand and she licked it off finding it was a like burnt and spicier unknown fluid to coax her head onto the dragons Pride and started to suck him off rubbing the length. Toothless knew he was quietly moaning not to wake her father but was surprised that his rider would go so far to pleasure him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving her lick and suck him off. More heat gathered in her nethers, she still being naked a trail of fluid was leaking between her tights running down her legs. Her other hand was sneaking it's way downward toward her lips and she started to play with her self. What she didn't see that was happening her lower spine was getting longer and new bone was being formed. A tail with two tailfins had grown as long as her legs so she wouldn't drag it on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToothless was getting to his climax and cummed inside of hiccups mouth with out him roaring out loud and waking her father. Hiccup swallowed as greatly the amount was coming out of the tip she also had hers seconds later sealing the change. Her change will take several days. What also had grown was hip fins what toothless has. .<br>\r\nThe reality change also meant that she didn't have to wear clothing and would walk around naked. The was still warm but it was getting closer to dragon mating season. Having getting colder to each day and night.<br>\r\nToothless open a eye and wrapped a paw around hiccup and embraced her and kissed her on her lips, he rolled over to his back and had her on his stomach.with his male hood still erect. She kissed him back and placed her sex near his and rubbed against it having the warmth of his flesh against hers. It was still to large for her to fit inside of her but that will change soon. Hiccup climaxed and laid down on top of him and drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhat happens next to her and what's Astrid plan.?<br>\r\nDoes Astros find a bottle and it goes right like intended? <br>\r\nAstrid finds a bottled and it goes bad for her?</span></div></div>",

So she took the bottle back home and her parents were not at home. She realized that she was about to do and hopefully she was gonna become a male Viking. <br>\r\nShe opened the bottle and put it against her lips thinking about it. If this was right what she was doing. And without a second thought, she downed the contents of the bottle. She set it down and looked in the mirror saying goodbye to her female figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA heat suddenly rolled through her body and heat gathered in her nethers. It goes so hot she shed herself of her clothing and accessories. She stood there completely nude in front of her mirror. <br>\r\nPain rolled through her body and she looks downwards and sees scales start to a pear everywhere on her body sky blue scales and cream coloured in her abdomen.<br>\r\nAnother pain in her midsection and her hourglass figure disappear s and she starts to shrink in size. She saw this happen to her and hopefully, it wasn't true,  her tailbone started to grow outwards and wings came out of her back. As she saw what kind of wings she knew what she was becoming. She was turning into a terrible terror the smallest of the Dragon. She was getting smaller her bed was getting enormous it happened in a matter of moments and she was two feet tall. Her wings we're fully grown and so was her tail. She also was heeding that her balance was getting worse every second and it was getting harder to stand upright. A pain went through her hands and the started to change her pinkies vanished and had a became paws her body had stopped decreasing. There were some distinct noises coming from her hips as they were changing form so were her legs she tried to grab something but couldn't so she fell forward on all fours. Her hips changing and coming to lock her now in that position never to walk upright again. She starred at her changing body and saw that it was nearly complete only her head was missing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hair was falling off her head and some small horns grew. Her eyes stayed blue but her pupils turned into slits. Her head also started to shrink and turns into a terror's skull. Her cranium was shrinking her brain and primal urges came into play with her reasoning. And her neither we're getting ready for mating.<br>\r\nHe thoughts dulled out and the only thing what was left was finding a strong mate to have a good clutch with.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The black dragon growled at her and informed hiccup of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey talked and made a deal and hiccup showed her toothless and she made him eat this fruit she obtained. Hiccup was smart but didn't know what it was and it was for toothless safety that his secret wouldn't come out. as Astrid watch hiccup eat and finished the fruit she smiled at him. Because she was going to enjoy his change that will change his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both headed back to berk. As they walked hiccup felt weird and and tired.

Hiccup was now highly regarded amongst the tribe, although still considered ..mmm.. eccentric for a viking. He was frequently off exploring, finding new distant islands and documenting exciting new breeds of dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFishlegs would even accompany him on some adventures. He had a fine artistic eye and a deft hand for capturing detail. Snotlout was still a proud member of Berk's dragon riders. His father Spitelout was less impressed, as Snotlout was always Lieutenant to Hiccup's leader. Hell, some days he was even lower, following Astrid's ideas and plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was less of a problem now, he told himself as Astrid was becoming more womanly. She was developing her own curves, and at the same time having to fight the traditional viking views of a woman's place in the tribe. A snarl crossed his face as he thought back to the looks that she cast in Hiccup's direction when she thought nobody was looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStoick was clear in his desire that Hiccup follow him as the next leader. Encouraging him to work with everybody and molding him to become the next chief. Snotlout ground his teeth as the idea, it just wasn't the viking way. A chief should rule by strength... not by ... well, not by weakness and alliances. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuff and Tuff were curiously still the same, just older. Snotlout knew that Ruff was a woman, but her constant battling with Tuff. Well, it just never seemed that important. Besides the twins had no drive for leadership, at times he wondered if they ever had an idea that wasn't designed to antagonise their other half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea started to form in Snotlout's brain, how he could solve both of these problems at the same time. If only Hiccup were as female as Astrid....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman couldn't be a chief.... that just didn't make sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides he rode a Monstrous Nightmare, whereas Hiccup had to make do with an injured dragon. Clearly he was the better viking. It all made sense. It was for the good of the tribe, for the good of the village. Hell, maybe over time Hiccup would come to thank Snotlout for her transformation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnotlout was also sure that a skinny and weak as Hiccup was as a male would mean that <i>she</i>'d become a beautiful, delicate flower of a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how to carry out such a plan....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Snotlout scuttled off to the Berk library, eager to find the way to sideline Hiccup. It galled him, that even the library was there because of Hiccup, as his eyes scanned over the spines of the two dozen books, he thought of abandoning his plan. But it was too good a plan, so he decided to talk to Fishlegs. As a viking he was a good librarian, (a terrible viking insult). Hell, he'd even authored some of those books himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few false starts he found Fishlegs and Meatlug on the beach on the far side of the island. Meatlug looked to be randomly blasting and eating rocks while his rider took notes. He waved at him, as he circled Hookfang around, looking for somewhere to land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnotlout and Fishlegs had never been the best of friends, but Fishlegs had bottomless reserves of goodwill. Snotlout hated that about him, such weakness. But he put a smile on and waved to him as he walked over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Working on a new book...\" his voice trailed off, as he struggled to find the subject of any interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... I thought you might like this. We're testing the rocks to see what effects they have on Boulder class dragons.\" he rubbed Meatlug's stubby little ears affectionately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnotlout just pretended to listen, adding the occasional grunt and general agreement to keep him talking. Snotlout was happy for the chance to talk about dragons, and Meatlug in particular. After fifteen minutes or so, he almost snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with a snarl tried to change the subject instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... yeah... Boulder class are really interesting. But... er... what about Stormfly... I mean what about ... Sharp class dragons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hadn't meant to mention Stormfly, but Astrid was a girl he found very interesting. An interest that went entirely unreturned. As a dragon rider he wasn't short of attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know you were ... oh, Astrid's dragon ... \" he gave Snotlout a sly wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you tried Chicken... as an alternative to fish... If you want to win her favour, you will need to get on better with Stormfly. But....\" he fell silent, and turned his gaze to the sky. It wasn't really a secret, that Astrid craved the eye of Hiccup, even if she were unwilling to admit it most days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps the only vikings unaware of the simmering chemistry were Hiccup and Snotlout themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, he started talking about the poisonous spines of the Sharp-class dragons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most immobilise their prey, allowing the dragon time to swoop down and capture their prey, or if necessary slow down an enemy and make their escape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnotlout grunted, settling on top of a rock in preparation for a long and boring discussion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some spines are even deadly.\" he added, as if the name Deadly Nadder were unearned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFishlegs then started on about how long it took a dragon to replace a thrown spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnotlout's chin slid off his fist as he listened distractedly. With a snort he distracted Fishlegs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".... you know that Stormfly is a female.\" he finished saying, looking over to the bored viking, as if explaining a great secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and Hookfang is male.\" he bit back his anger. This wasn't working, and it was frustrating. He was just about to insult the heavy viking and leave, when Fishlegs beckoned him closer with a wave of his chunky hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've not checked recently... but... she might not be female any longer...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis ears pricked up at this. He didn't really care about dragon sex, but this sounded promising. He'd certainly never looked that closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would you find out... and why would she not be female any more...\" his confusion written on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look made Fishlegs smile, even if he hid it from Snotlout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waved him closer. \"Well, a nadder has a gland that can give it's spines the ability to change sex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnotlout lifted his head, barely able to contain his excitement, as Fishlegs chattered on about the advantages for breeding cycles and so forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will this work on other dragons?\" Snotlout asked, genuine fascination clear in his voice.</span></div></div>",

Meatlug went on to describe the dark spine that would look out of place, even warning the young viking of the danger of plucking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth from the affronted dragon, and the risk from the spine itself especially if he didn't wear gloves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready he was planning how to get close to Astrid, naturally using his charm and her fascination with his masculine viking virility. His chest puffed out, already it felt almost too easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he waited another hour or so, listening to Fishlegs witter on endlessly about the other spines on a nadder and the effects they could have on a subject that was struck by them. He didn't want it to be too obvious, if Hiccup became a girl just after he'd asked about the effects of nadder spines. So he kept his interest as best he could occasionally piping in with a half-hearted question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... fascinating.... truly fascinating.\" he said when he heard enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFishlegs didn't pick up on the sarcasm, happy as he was to spread his dragon knowledge to every other flier, <i>even</i> Snotlout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hookfang and Snotlout flew away, he tossed a pebble into Meatlug's gaping maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know he's not half bad, if you give him a chance, Meatlug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnotlout had to restrain himself from acting immediately. It was almost a physical pain to hold himself back from immediate action. It was unviking-like, he told himself. But after flying across the island, Hookfang was in need of a good sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went to bed and had a good sleep. In his dreams there was even a new figure, a new Hiccup, a female Hiccup... a rival with Astrid for the attention of the new chief in waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe woke to a banging on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYawning and scratching he went to the door. Without opening he knew who it was. Hiccup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for the Dawn Patrol.\" Hiccup's happy voice carried through the thick wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps a couple of spines through his bedroom window.\" Astrid suggested half-jokingly... but only half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he opened the door the chill air finished the job of waking him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiccup was already mounting up. Toothless eager to be away. The twins were knocking lumps out of one another as their dragon hovered in the air. On the other side of Hiccup were Astrid on Stormfly and Fishlegs and Meatlug. As ever the gronkle was the most stable of the dragons as they hovered around the viking standing in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a moment to examine the nadder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid's control was excellent he hated to admit. But from this angle it was very clear which particular spine that Fishlegs had been describing. Spotting it put a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leapt to Hookfang's back in a couple of bound, and landed ready to fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiccup was already leading from the front. They flew in a rough V-formation. With Toothless at the apex. Just to the left and slightly behind went Stormfly. She was followed by the twins on Barf and Belch. Forming a line from Toothless's right was only Meatlug. With a gap for his Monstrous Nightmare to fill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in formation, they circled on the thermals rising higher until they dove in formation across the village, heading for the harbour before doing a complete circuit of the island.</span></div></div>",

He cupped his hands far in front of his own chest, cradling an imaginary bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It all depends on the person's size, and imagination, apparently what dreams come when they're sleeping can change how a patient transforms, it's not down to merely their original size.

But at least he could kick the stones as he muttered to himself about life's unfairness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cursed Hiccup for being born the chief's son. He cursed Astrid for being Hiccup's favourite. He cursed Fishlegs for his love of books, and the details of dragon behaviour. He cursed the twins and their damned pranks and jokes. He cursed them all for failing to appreciate him, and Hookfang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting a tremendous effort in he sent one stone flying, off his toe and out to sea. He hopped furiously, as the pain hit his brain. A scream aimed at the sky was only heard by the distant Hookfang, sunbathing on a nearby rock. He went to kick another pebble in his fury. Barely restraining himself in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, his eye was drawn to the odd stone. It was unlike the dark sharp edged pebbles, or the rounder, redder ones. It looked really out of place. Not just on the beach, but unlike any stone he'd seen anywhere. It glowed with an inner light, that danced as he looked at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven picking it up, and examining it more closely. The light was more lively than even quartz or any other precious stone, the few he'd seen Trader Johann display. There wasn't much use for precious stones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he hated the idea, Fishlegs sprang to mind. He hated asking him questions, having to listen to the answers. But with him riding that dull Gronkle, he had to admit Fishlegs knew his rocks. Obviously, he wouldn't trust him with a valuation. But he could trust him with a name or a type of rock.</span></div></div>",

Realising it's usefulness, he started scanning the beach as he walked back and forth. At times he'd kick at the stones, in frustration. Night flying and flying higher above the clouds was a chilly business, and any relief would be happily welcomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his natural superiority, he knew he wasn't regarded as the smartest of the Dragon riders. With Fishlegs' seemingly endless knowledge more annoying than he wanted to admit. He also distrusted Hiccup's intuition with dragons. After half an hour, on the beach, it was getting darker, and he hadn't found any more of those glowing stones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling it from his pocket he wondered if it could work as a torch at night. Doubting that thought even as it occurred, the stony beach wasn't exactly speckled with glowing stones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as he withdrew it, he spotted something worrying. The damned thing had grown, and was encasing his hand in it's stony embrace. He tried shattering it against boulders on the beach. But beyond sending off a few sparks didn't do any damage. Worryingly, also the stone's glow pulsed in time with Snotlout's heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying nightmare gel, he tried to burn it away. But it burned brightly without weakening it at all. Before Snotlout's eyes, it's flame flickered and failed much quicker than it should have. The reason became clear with the next few beats of Snotlout's heart, as the stone surged up his arm, binding and locking his wrist in one position. Four heartbeats later, it had locked his elbow into a bent pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfraid of being glued to Hookfang, or stuck to his saddle, it took him a moment to realise his danger. As his pulse raced, it seemed like the rush of speed was spent, as the stone advance slowed as it approached his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe confronted his isolation, and called Hookfang over. It looked like the glow was distorting his arm, making it look different. An internal yellow glow, a hint of sparkles seemed to light his flesh from within. Mounting Hookfang from the other side, he was soon airborne and headed back to the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer the hero, with the magic warming stones. Now, he was the invalid, the fool. He cursed himself for her impetuous bravery in risking this unknown danger.</span></div></div>",

Ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiccup/Ingrid gasped, \"I don't know what you did, but my father will make you fix this!\" And with that, she jumped onto Toothless and flew off. Snotlout grinned and followed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Hiccup/Ingrid spotted her father from the air and headed down.She saw Snotlout following her, but her made no attempt to stop her. As soon as Toothless landed, she ran to her father, and when she got to him, she didn't even realize when she gave him the equivalent of a Viking female's curtsy in show of respect as from female to a male. \"Father! I need...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Stoick held up his hand to silence her. He looked down at her and said...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Stoick held up his hand to silence her. He looked down at her a moment then pulled her close, hugging her, then he said, \"Perfect timing daughter! We can now announce your betrothal.\" Just then, Snotlout landed next to Toothless and dismounted. Stoick grinned, \"I am glad the two of you were flying together! It is good to have the future groom present too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiccup/Ingrid stumbled along as Stoick half dragged her toward Snotlout, \"Wait dad! You don't understand! I can't marry Snotlout!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStoick paused, and kneeling down, held his daughter's shoulders firmly, \"Sweetheart. You know I would not do this if it weren't necessary. If only you had been born a boy, perhaps you could have married a girl like Astrid. But you were born a girl. We will need a chief. Since it can't be you, that will be the man you marry. And only your marriage to Snotlout will prevent a civil war here on Berk. I am sorry daughter, but that is the way of women. For the sake of peace on Berk, don't fight me in this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiccup/Ingrid found herself being pulled along again, but now stunned and limp. Now she was confused. Her father and everyone else seemed to thing that she had been born as Ingrid. And there had always been tension between Snotlout's family and her's. Astrid was from that Snotlout's clan, and Hiccup's marriage to her would have united the island. However, now, she was the female, and somehow, because of whatever it was that Snotlout had been holding, she was being forced to marry for the sake of peace. At least for Astrid, they were in love with each other. Unity or not, they would have married. Now Hiccup had to marry a man she not only didn't love, but could barely stand!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole time these thoughts were running through Hiccup's head, her father was proclaiming her betrothal to Snotlout. She was in stunned shock as Snotlout took her in his arms and kissed her forcefully and deeply to the cheers of the village. She was numb as she stood there, held close to Snotlout by one of his strong arms, and was congratulated by people of the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStoick announced, \"The wedding will be in two weeks, at the start of the Spring festival!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the crowds had faded, they walked back toward the dragons together. Snotlout looked down at her, \"An early wedding present for you Ingrid. I made sure that Toothless is female too, so that you don't have to worry about riding a boy dragon.\" He leered at Hiccup/Ingrid, \"And just think. At the same time that the farmers will be putting their seed in the ground, I will be planting my seed in you. I think you will look cute with a baby bump.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of what Snotlout was saying almost made Hiccup/Ingrid throw up! What was worse yet, unless she could undo this, there was no way to prevent it. Once the official announcement had been made, it could not be undone. She was powerless to stop the wedding now. And after the wedding.... well, she did not have the strength to resist Snotlout, and there was no such thing in the laws of Berk as a husband raping his wife. Once married, she was almost the same as Snotlout's property in Berk society. All this made her shudder! It was bad enough to be trapped in the body of a female, but to be forced to bear Snotlout's children was unthinkable! She shouted, \"I will still find a way to undo this before our wedding day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnotlout grinned, \"Not this time Ingrid.\" And with that, he grabbed her, and lifting her with one arm he forced a long, sloppy kiss on her as the other hand harshly groped her rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finally released her, she gasped out, \"You are a bastard Snotlout! And if you go through with this, I will never love  you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed, \"Who needs love? But I will love having you over and over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn total disgust, Hiccup/Ingrid ran off. She ran to her favorite hideout in the woods, not stopping until she got there! Once there, all the emotions, which seemed even stronger in this female form, overwhelmed her, and she bawled like a baby. Even when she calmed a little, she could not stop crying. How was this possible? How? She was a man! Or should be at least! How did Snotlout do this to her? How did he not only turn her into this female, but make it that nobody but the two of them remembered her ever being Hiccup? She knew that it had something to do with whatever he held in his hand earlier, but what was it? She had to find out! Then she had to get it from him! Maybe she could undo this! But how?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only then that Hiccup/Ingrid realized that there was a gentle arm around her shoulder, and someone was stroking her hair. She looked up to see Astrid and wondered how long she had been there? Astrid spoke softly, \"Don't stop crying on my account. We have always been like sisters. I know what you are feeling and I don't blame you.\" She growled, \"It is not fair we women have no choice in who we marry! Not that there are a lot of choices for us on Berk anyhow, but Snotlout!?! You poor thing! I would be crying too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiccup/Ingrid sniffed the tears away, \"Please Astrid! You need to help me! I can't marry him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid hugged her, \"You know I would do anything for you Ingrid, but what is there to do? It is announced. You are already his.\" She paused, \"You could fly off of course. Go to another island maybe. But that would only guarantee war on Berk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiccup/Ingrid looked up at Astrid with red eyes, \"There is a way.\" She told Astrid of the strange stone that Snotlout had come in possession of. She could not tell about having been male and turned into a female, but she could tell most of the rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid shook her head, \"Ingrid. My dearest friend. I know how much you loathe Snotlout. But I think your imagination is running away with you. We had this talk before. Your dad has been talking to Spitelout for weeks. Snotlout wouldn't need to wish to marry you. It was almost guaranteed since the day you were born.\" She sighed, \"And it is not going to go well for me either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiccup/Ingrid looked at her concerned, \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid sighed again, \"I heard my parents talking. We both know that the only other males our age on Berk are Fishlegs and Tuffnut. If I had a choice, it would be Fishlegs. At least he would be a caring husband. But my parents were talking to Tuffnut's dad. He pointed out that, if I married Fishlegs, there would be nobody left for Ruffnut to marry. He offered them three sheep and two goats if my father would select Tuffnut as my husband.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiccup/Ingrid gasped, \"Wow!\" Then she realized, \"Your parents couldn't possibly turn down an offer like that.\" There was sympathy in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid nodded, \"Yes. And Fishleg's family could never afford to beat that offer.\" She shuddered, \"And if any man on this island is more perverted than Snotlout, it is Tuffnut. I don't even want to think of what it will be like to be his wife!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMale or female, Hiccup/Ingrid was always more motivated by the needs of others. She grabbed Astrid's hand, \"List to me Astrid! I swear to you that Snotlout has that object! And if we can get it, I know that it is possible for both of us to choose who we will marry and still have peace on Berk! Just trust me! Will you help me...,\" she hesitated to use the word, but she needed Astrid's help, \"... will you help me sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid laughed, \"We are like sisters, but you only call me one when you are trying to get me to do something stupid! But why not? It is better to try and fail! I am with you sister!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiccup/Ingrid flinched at being called a sister by Astrid, but it fit, and they hugged each other briefly, then sat down to make plans.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was almost noon by the time they finished talking. It amazed Hiccup/Ingrid at how close of a bond she felt with Astrid now. Without the sexual tension that had always been present between then when she was a male, they truly were like sisters. Very close sisters. She was seeing Astrid through a whole new light now, and her admiration for her had grown immensely. Sure, as Hiccup she had understood that it was harder for Astrid, striving to be regarded equally with the male warriors, but now as Ingrid, she understood how little regard their society had for females in general, and how quickly all that she had worked so hard for could be taken from her. In fact, as Ingrid, if she didn't find a way back to being Hiccup, her freedom would be gone in two weeks. Just being betrothed meant it was greatly diminished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid said, \"I hope we can find this thing. Snotlout is not the brightest torch on the island, but he will know that he needs to protect something like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiccup/Ingrid agreed, \"Yes. But his biggest weakness has always been his over confidence. Let's hope that works in our favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked back toward the village, Astrid paused and walked off of the trail a bit to a small but shielded clearing, \"You will come to my house for lunch, but let's stop her to pee. I really gotta go!\" Without hesitation, Hiccup/Ingrid saw something she never witnessed before. Astrid just squatted down and began to pee! (Underwear hasn't been invented yet.) She saw the puddle of urine forming beneath Astrid's skirt. It was embarrassing! Not so embarrassing that she could overcome the sudden urge to pee herself. This was the first time that she was forced to acknowledge the depth of the change that had been forced onto her. Standing to pee would never be an option as long as she had this female body. Not seeing any other choice, she followed Astrid's example and squatted down. It felt odd as the urine shot out of a hidden place between her legs, but the overall feeling of relief was the same. When she was done, Hiccup/Ingrid followed Astrid's example of tearing off a large leaf and wiping between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got to Astrid's place, and Hiccup/Ingrid knew that, as a female, she would be expected to help with the preparation of the meal. Somehow, things like that came to her as if she really had grown up as a female, even though she could not remember learning them. The same went to cleaning up afterward. However, as soon as they were done, Astrid's dad stood up and grabbed Astrid's hand. She seemed to understand what was going on, and immediately tried to resist, but her father was far too strong and easily took her outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce out, he called out with a lout voice, \"Everybody! May I have everyone's attention! I have an announcement to make!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid screamed, \"No! I...\", but a swift slap shut her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued, \"I am announcing the betrothal of my daughter Astrid to Tuffnut. If the Chief consents, they will marry on the same day as his daughter, at the Spring festival.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the fight went out of Astrid. There was no longer any point. She was now officially betrothed to Tuffnut, and nothing she could do would change that now. However, as soon as her father released her, she ran inside. It was the first time Hiccup/Ingrid had seen her cry like that. Now it was her turn to comfort Astrid. She was sorry that they now had this in common. She whispered, \"We will find that stone and fix this too! I promise!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Astrid and Hiccup/Ingrid spent the next couple of days flying to remote locations and trying to figure out where Snotlout might be hiding his secret.  During that time, Hiccup felt even closer to Astrid than ever. She wished that she was able to tell her the truth about having been male, but all attempts failed. It would have been nice to at least talk to her about having to get used to the constant bounce and motion of her breasts, and the fear of what sex would mean to her now, but all of that was impossible too. Well, they did cry together over the thought of being forced to bear children for Snotlout and Tuffnut, which made both of them sick, but Hiccup could not relate her terror of sex as a female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings took a turn for the worse on the third morning when they tried to take off, but both Toothless and Stormfly seemed too weak to fly. As they tried to figure out what was wrong with their dragons, Snotlout showed up, \"Are you girls having trouble?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately Hiccup/Ingrid knew this was Snotlout's doing, \"What did you do to our dragons!?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled, \"Come over here with me Ingrid, and I will tell you.\" She reluctantly walked up to him, and he put his arm around her and led her farther from Astrid. Then he stood her in front of him, \"For now, I just made them too weak to fly. I am sick of how you have been avoiding me, and how you refuse to act like a proper betrothed when we are around each other. That is going to change! If you don't start behaving like you are happy to be with me and marry me, not only will Toothless never fly again, I will make sure that she is deformed in a very painful way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped, \"You wouldn't! Not even you could be that cruel!\" But his silent stare made it clear that he would. She had no choice or Toothless would suffer. She sighed, \"Okay Snotlout, you win. I will do as you ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned, \"Good. Prove it right now. Kiss me. And not a little peck. I want you to kiss me the way you used to kiss Astrid, with passion. And if I don't think it is good enough, the next sound you hear from Toothless will be agony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiccup was totally defeated. She knew that he would do it. She had to brace herself, then she reached up, wrapped her arms around Snotlout, and kissed him with as much passion as she could muster. She tried to pretend that she was still male, and kissing Astrid, but Snotlout's whiskers ruined that. All she could be was the weak female submitting to her lover. Snotlout held her head in place as their tongues intertwined while his other hand groped her rear. When he released her, she was gasping for air!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnotlout smiled, \"That is more like it. Only in the future, you will do that in the market, or the Hall, or wherever, regardless of who is around. And  you will not go flying, or anywhere, unless it is with me. Understood girl?\" She nodded, \"Oh, and no more of your flying gear. From now on, you will wear your betrothal dress. You are a female now, so start acting like one!\" As he said this, he unbuttoned her top and kissed her there. She did not try to stop him. When he was done, he groped her rear again and pushed her back toward Astrid and the dragons, then he added, \"Oh, and tell Astrid that the same goes for her. Either she submits to Tuffnut, or Stormfly will suffer for her disobedience. Tuffnut and I will expect our women to be with us before the sun is higher than the Hall roof.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiccup/Ingrid was crying as she walked back up to Astrid and the dragons. Astrid looked at her, \"Ingrid! What did he do to you!\" Hiccup/Ingrid composed herself and gave Astrid the bad news. She turned pale, \"You don't think he would do it! Do you?\" But they both knew that he would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn silence they went back to their homes and put on the flimsy, feminine dresses. They walked in shame to the market and paused a moment when they saw Snotlout and Tuffnut together there. Of course, they would choose the most public place! Then they each went to their betrothed and kissed them a long time. The whole time, they were pawed and groped from top to bottom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnotlout broke the kiss, then loudly said, \"Tell me you want to have my babies Ingrid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a group of people nearby who could not help hearing what was said. Hiccup/Ingrid thought of Toothless as she said, \"Of course my dear. I want to bear your children.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Tuffnut had to get that out of Astrid, \"Yeah Astrid! How about you? Do you want me to get you knocked up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid turned bright red in both anger and embarrassment as she said, \"Of course Tuffnut. I want to have your babies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole rest of the day was marked by pretending to love the idea of marrying their men and by being handled shamefully but in silence. This went on for two days before the girls could talk in private again. At last, Hiccup/Ingrid said, \"Astrid! I have been waiting for this chance to talk! I think I know a way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Astrid was broken by her public humiliation, \"Why don't you give it up Ingrid? We are doomed. The best we can do is accept our fate. I wonder if Tuffnut will make a good father?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiccup/Ingrid grabbed her by the shoulders then shook her, \"Where is that shield maiden I know! I need her now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid shook her head, \"She is gone. She will soon be Tuffnut's wife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiccup/Ingrid gasped, then slapped Astrid, \"Snap out of it girl! You can do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them actually fought for a while, until Astrid had Ingrid pinned on the ground and had her fist ready to pummel her friend. She stopped suddenly, \"What am I doing!?! I am sorry Ingrid! Please forgive me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiccup/Ingrid grinned, \"Don't apologize. That is the Astrid I need! I have a plan, but I need my sister to make it work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid got off of Ingrid and helped her up, \"Okay sister. I am listening. What is your plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grin, Hiccup/Ingrid said, \"You have the worst part. You need to pretend that you really have started to love Tuffnut. He will believe it because he wants it to be true. When he does, you need to...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Astrid having to pretend to fall in love with Tuffnut was rough for her, but not as hard as she thought, only because she was already humiliated by having to submit to Tuffnut's constantly pawing her body anyhow. It added to the humiliation, but it was no worse. Well, except for the fact that she had to pretend that she really wanted his touches now, and some times would ask for them, or even initiate things. Just like her friend predicted though, his early suspicion quickly turned into lust-filled acceptance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat did not mean that Hiccup/Ingrid had it easy. Her job was to keep Snotlout away from Tuffnut. The best way for her to do that was to convince Snotlout to take her flying, and land at some 'romantic' spot where she would willingly make-out with him. Hiccup/Ingrid was quickly learning the real power of a female body over a male. A sexy smile here, a well placed tear there, and she was already beginning to manipulate Snotlout. She knew that he would be suspicious of her cooperation, so she made sure that he understood it was for the sake of Toothless, and frequently made him promise not to hurt toothless if she was compliant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another danger for Hiccup/Ingrid that she had not anticipated. She was starting to enjoy being female! While Snotlout was sometimes rough, she was teaching him  to be gentle. And when he was gentle, his touches were becoming enjoyable. She was really beginning to enjoy their make-out sessions.... for real! She was even enjoying having breasts! Perhaps worse yet, she was warming to the idea of being a mother. The thought of a child growing inside of her womb fascinated her. And she understood why she was feeling this way. As a male, she had been small and weak. For a Viking male, that was a huge humiliation, even after proving himself with brains over brawn. However, as a female, there was no expectation to be tough. Sure, there was the occasional shield-maiden like Astrid, who was as close to male aggression as a girl could get, but in the end, just like Astrid, a girl's duty to the village was to marry and bear children. So, being female now, nobody looked at her, as Ingrid, and thought less of her for being small and weak. She was actually treated with more respect from the women as Ingrid than she was from the men as Hiccup, even after becoming a hero. And she still did the same things as Ingrid, so was still a hero. So, with being small and weak being okay, she had a new power now. Her body. And it was already working against Snotlout. It was not that she was liking the idea of marrying Snotlout, but if it was some young, tall, handsome Viking, perhaps staying Ingrid would not be such a terrible thing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Hiccup/Ingrid was exploring her femininity, Astrid was trying to convince Tuffnut that she loved him without throwing up! Fortunately, it was working! His guard was going down without Snotlout around. Finally, when she thought he was ready, she said, \"I can't believe that Snotlout will be our Chief some day!\" She sighed, \"I wish that you could be the Chief. It will be great to be your wife, but it would be even better to be the wife of the Chief!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Tuffnut grumbled, \"I would make a better Chief than Snotlout!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid sighed, \"I know that you would my love! If only we had the power to change things the way that he can! If I had the power, I would make you our Chief!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned, \"Really? Well what if I gave you that chance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed, \"You know I would my love! But Snotlout would never let us control that thing he has.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTuffnut grinned, \"Yeah. But I followed him. I saw where he hid it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, they saw Snotlout and Ingrid flying back. Astrid saw her chance. \"If what you are telling me is true my dearest, tell me where it is! You can keep Snotlout occupied while I get it for us! Once I have that, we will be in charge on Berk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last phrase really appealed to Tuffnut. He agreed and told Astrid where to look! While Tuffnut went to be his annoying self, Astrid followed his directions. She was a bit skeptical, but with the weddings less than a week away, she had to try! To her delight, it was exactly where he said! It was a strange looking stone, with odd runes on it. She slipped it into her belt pouch so that she wouldn't lose it, then she ran to Stormfly! On another hill near the village, she could make out Tuffnut talking to Snotlout and Ingrid. Perfect! She took off, then flew over and wheeled above the group. In the code for success, she yelled down, \"Hey Ingrid! How would you like to go for a little girl-time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiccup/Ingrid's heart leapt! She was able to control herself though. She clung onto Snotlout's huge arm, \"May I go? Please? Astrid and I won't have much time together once our babies start coming.\" That had the desired effect, and Snotlout agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, they were flying off. They took a complex course to make sure that they were not followed. Soon they were in their secret cove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they landed, Hiccup/Ingrid jumped down, \"Did you really get it!?!\" Astrid just grinned and produced the stone. She handed it to Ingrid, who squealed, \"This is it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid still said, \"Are you sure that this stone has as much power as you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiccup/Ingrid looked stern, \"I will prove it to you.\" She held the stone, \"I wish that Astrid knew the whole truth of how Snotlout used the stone and who I used to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like that, Astrid gasped! \"Hiccup!?! That is really you? He turned you into a girl! That bastard!\" Then she grinned, \"You do make a cute girl though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiccup/Ingrid punched her arm, but it was too soft to even make Astrid say ouch. \"Well, now I can fix things!\" She held the stone, \"I wish that all that Snotlout did to me was undone, and that I was a male again.\" They both held their breath, but nothing happened. Hiccup/Ingrid tried again and again with different wordings, but nothing happened. She gave the stone to Astrid to try, but Ingrid remained Ingrid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, taking the stone from Astrid, she said, \"Snotlout wished that what he did to me could not be undone, by me or anyone else, ever. I guess that wish came true. I am Ingrid forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid was almost in tears, \"What will we do then?

Neither of us can change that. But if you were male, it would not only give you what you always wanted. We could still be together, just not like we expected. And our marriage would still unite the clans.\" She paused and blushed, \"Besides, I think I would enjoy being your wife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid looked at her, \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid blushed deeper, \"I mean, I like being a girl!

YES!\" She threw her arms around Astrid and kissed her passionately! Then she stopped and they both blushed deeply. Finally Ingrid said, \"Um, maybe we should take care of making you male first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiccup/Ingrid took out the stone, \"I wish that Astrid had not been born a female, but a male named Erik. And that only myself and Erik remember things ever being different.\" Before her eyes, she watched the reverse of what Snotlout must have seen happen to her. She saw Astrid grow much taller and thicker. But not thick with fat, but layers of muscle over muscle. Her clothes changed too, from the top and skirt of a shield-maiden, to a warrior's armor. Soon, she, well, now he, towered over Ingrid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was done, Astrid/Erik looked down at Ingrid in awe, \"It really worked!\" He said it in a deep, rich, male voice that Ingrid found pleasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part, Hiccup/Ingrid was finding the new Astrid so attractive, he took her breath away! She felt things in her body that she never felt before, but she had no doubt about what they meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid/Erik realized that Ingrid was tongue tied, so he took her in his arms, \"Thank you Hiccup! I love you, and I swear to always take care of you!\" Then he kissed her passionately. It was not embarrassment that coursed through their bodies after the kiss this time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings might have gotten out of hand early, but Hiccup/Ingrid said, \"Not now, though Odin help me, I want to! We still have things to fix.\" She kissed him again, \"Oh, and don't call me Hiccup any more. Hiccup is a part of who I was, but I am Ingrid now, and forever. And you sure are not an Astrid anymore!\" She giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid/Erik.sighed as he released her, \"Then we better fix them soon. I had no idea how powerful a man's desire could be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid blushed, \"Or a woman's.\" Then she recovered and said, \"First, since I am still betrothed to Snotlout, we need to fix that.\" She held up the stone, \"I wish that, the day my father announced my betrothal, it was not to Snotlout, but to Erik, and only myself, Erik and Snotlout will remember what had been.\" The stone glowed, and suddenly, both of them knew that it was true without any doubt. Their union was sealed! The girl that had been Hiccup knew that she was a female through and through now. And it made her happy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid held the stone, and mumbled something that Astrid/Erik could not hear. He asked her, \"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned, \"A surprise. One that I can reverse if you don't like it, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked back to where their dragons were, and Astrid/Erik got a shock. There, instead of a Night Furry and a Deadly Nadder, there were TWO Night Furries! One he recognized as Toothless, but now there was a much larger male Night Furry with her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid blushed, \"I thought that, since we have each other...\" She paused, \"Should I change him back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid/Erik asked, \"Does he know that he changed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid said, \"No. Nobody does except us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid/Erik watched as Stormfly nuzzled Toothless. \"They both seem happy, why change it?\" He stroked Ingrid's cheek, \"And maybe both couples will have many children.\" Ingrid blushed, but liked the idea. He kissed her, then said, \"So what is next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid/Erik saw a cloud cover her pretty face. This woman scorned was not one to be messed with! She said, \"Now we return to Berk and make a few more changes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey mounted their dragons and returned. As soon as they landed, Snotlout came running up to them. \"What have you done! You can't do this to me! Give me the stone back! It is mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid/Erik was amazed at his own strength as he easily held back Snotlout. Ingrid gave a chilling grin and said, \"Oh, I can do it, and there is more.\" She held up the stone, \"I wish that....\"</span></div></div>",

Ingrid gave a chilling grin and said, \"Oh, I can do it, and there is more.\" She held up the stone, \"I wish that Snotlout had been born female and named Sif (meaning wife and bride) and that her father has already announced her betrothal to Tuffnut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnotlout screamed in anger and tried even harder to get past Erik, but it was no use as he began to get shorter and weaker. Still, it was not the slim shield maiden that Astrid had been that began to come out. Instead, while his shoulders narrowed, his chest remained large, only now instead of being wide, it was fairly large breasts that pushed out. And as a dress formed and his waist narrowed, his hips flared out. Soon, Snotlout was fully female. \"Noooo... please don't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid smiled, \"You introduced me to the joys of womanhood. I just wanted to return the favor. I now wish that Sif will enjoy Tuffnut's attentions, and will always be a dutiful wife, and that they will make a very fertile couple.\" Through Sif/Snotlout's wails, nobody heard her also wish that she and Erik would be a fertile couple as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSif/Snotlout begged, \"Ingrid! Please! I can see how wrong I was now! Please change me back! I won't do anything like this ever again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid grinned, \"No, you won't Sif. Because now, you can never be a chief. But who knows? Maybe someday, one of your children will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Tuffnut came walking up, \"There you are Sif! I have been looking all over for you. Come on. Show your future husband you love him.\" And before Sif/Snotlout had a chance to respond, Tuffnut grabbed her and leaned her back, kissing her passionately. She resisted at first, but Ingrid and Erik saw her melt, and she didn't even object as Tuffnut grabbed her breast and began to squeeze it and massage it, right there in front of them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErik smiled, \"That makes me want to go find some place private.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid grinned up at him. \"I agree.\" Though when they were out of earshot of the other couple, she added, \"But first, we must find a good hiding place for this stone.\" She smiled, \"And I know just the place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, they mounted their dragons. They watched from the air to make sure that Sif/Snotlout was not following, but not only was her dragon far away in the pens, but Tuffnut was still keeping her quite busy. They sped away and were soon out of sight. As soon as they were out of sit of Berk, they changed course several times based on some landmarks Hiccup/Ingrid had learned. They came at last to an isolated island that was mostly barren and inhospitable. Hiccup/Ingrid led them to a canyon with sheer cliff that nobody could have climbed. There, hidden from above and below, was a cave. Hiccup/Ingrid flew in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they had landed, Astrid/Erik looked at her, \"Wow! Talk about a secret place! How did you ever find this?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked shy as she replied, \"It was an accident. On day, on a patrol back when I was looking for more and and new dragons, there was a terrible storm. It would have killed Toothless and I, but I saw this island. I was trying to land when a gust of wind pushed me into this canyon. I thought for sure that we would be smashed on the rocks below, but Toothless saw this cave, and with great effort, made it inside. It saved our lives.\" She walked over to a cave wall, there a small, flat-topped boulder looked almost like a bench. She pulled at it, but could not budge it. \"Oooof! That was heavy for me before, but now I can't move it at all! I don't suppose there is a big, strong man that could help me?\" She grinned up at Astrid/Erik.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked over, \"You want me to move it?\" It looked very heavy to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned, \"Yes. There is a small depression beneath it. More than deep enough to hold this stone.\" She smiled, \"Don't worry. If I moved it as Hiccup, you won't have trouble moving it as Erik.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugged, \"I can try.\" To his amazement, he easily lifted the end and held it there long enough for Ingrid to put the stone beneath it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, \"Good! Now let it down gently.\" He did, and she exclaimed, \"Perfect! It doesn't even look as though it had been disturbed! Nobody would even think to look there, even if they somehow found this cave.\" She walked over to Toothless and opened a saddle bag and got out a thick blanket. She blushed as she said, \"Were you saying that you wanted to take me somewhere private?\"</span></div></div>",

She moaned softly as he massaged her breasts. She moaned more loudly when he reached up her skirt. Since Erik/Astrid had been a female up until today, he knew all the right buttons to push, and as they made love, Ingrid found out just how much pleasure a female body could feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were done, she was resting her head on his chest when she realized that, after what they just did, she could easily become pregnant. In fact, because of the wish that she had made, she probably would be. However, since they would be married in just a couple of days from now, it made no difference, and besides, she wanted to know that she had Erik's child inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErik/Astrid stroked her hair and said, \"You like being the girl, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled up at him, \"Yes, I do. Let's face it, I was a wimp of a viking man. I could never compete with the other males. I am much happier as a female. It feel right in every way.\" Then she giggled, \"And look at you. Tell me that you don't like the change. Not only in me either. You always wanted to be the warrior, but we both know that your body would never have allowed you to compete with males in a real fight. Now look at you! You like what you are now too!\" They kissed, then she added, \"Somehow, I think we have corrected a mistake of nature. I am who I was supposed to be, and you are who you should have been born as.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was getting late. So they dressed and flew back to Berk. In the great hall it was fun to watch Sif/Snotlout be humiliated by the way Tuffnut treated her, yet, unable to fight the spell, she couldn't do anything to make him stop. Probably even worse for her was the fact that she couldn't help but enjoy some of it, which embarrassed her all the more. Ingrid and Erik on the other hand were perfect lovebirds, and Ingrid loved the little secret they shared. Ingrid was sure that she had conceived, and was loving the thought of being a mother. She was also looking forward to being married to Erik so that they could take care of these other longings she felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the day came. Sif/Snotlout was brought to the chief's house to get the brides ready. Sif was crying the whole time as she was bathed and clothed in a bridal dress. When they were left alone for a while, she came over to Ingrid, \"Please! I am begging you! Don't make me go through with this! I will do anything you ask, but please change me back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid gave a wicked smile, \"This is what you wanted for me! Now you will be joining me. Both as being a wife, and eventually a mother as well! And besides, it can't be undone now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSif gasped, \"Yes it can! Use the stone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid loved the look on Sif's face when she said, \"No it can't. I no longer have the stone. It was too powerful for our little island. I flew over the sea and dropped it in. Nobody will ever see that stone again. So get used to being a woman, you will never be anything else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSif wailed at her fate. It was a bitter thing to have been at the top of the heap, a man about to marry the chief's daughter and eventually become chief, to fall to the lowness of being a woman, and worse, the wife of the most ignorant and perverse male on the island, and forced to serve and obey him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had finally gotten herself under control when the women of the village came to take them to their wedding ceremony.</span></div></div>",

Snotlout collapsed back to the grass, only a stubborn sheep stopping him from being laid flat. Blood started to flow freely from his nose. He looked up to Erik standing firm, ready to knock him down again. The loyal Ingrid hanging on his arm... not restraining it, but clinging to her protector.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis vision swam, as his eyes watered, one smear standing on her tip-toes to whisper in the ear of the other. Blinking away the tears, the two slipped back into focus. A new cruelty clear in Erik's eye, and a nod of amusement passing between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't want to marry Ruff, then?\" Erik asked, a meaty fist still holding the stone.

He became she, the stubble he was so proud of falling from her face uprooted in that moment. Hands coming up finding a softer jawline, and a smoother face. The smoother face with a cuter, smaller nose. A squeak spilling from lips that were fuller and more inviting. Snotlout realised what the changes really meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands snapped to her chest. Armour plate stopped the exploring hands, but the shape of the armour suggested she was a big girl. Plucking at the top of the armour, Snotlout received an eyeful of her own cleavage, pressed flat by the unforgiving metal, she shuddered to imagine in unrestrained. It looked terrifyingly too real, too large, and far, far too sensitive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat passed for beefy as a man transformed into busty for a woman. She looked to Ingrid, the traces of Hiccup still visible and a twinge of jealousy fired deep inside her.

The bewilderbeast had just been vanquished and everyone in Berk was bending over backwards to do him favours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that's not a bad thing, Hiccup thought to himself. But he did miss the days when he was younger and the villagers would ignore or avoid him. As the chief's scrawny son, he couldn't reassure the villagers that Stoick would hand on power to ... to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't want to be weak and ignored, but at the same time he wasn't entirely comfortable with all the attention either. Hell, Astrid knew he liked his personal space, and he knew she kept an eye out for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToothless was always a good companion, never interrupting and suggesting things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kicked a stone, it went skidding through the sand, as he walked onwards. The beach was surrounded by cliffs and only accessible by dragon so he knew he'd be safe. At least until Astrid decided he was being self indulgent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly he felt a bond with Astrid even before they were friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to define.... It wasn't a friendship.... it was just the sense of not fitting in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was the chief's son, and also the least viking-like viking in the whole village. He thought back to Stoick's disappointment in his son. Stoick was a good dad, Hiccup knew this deep in his bones, but he felt the pain of his dad's disappointment deeply, as he thought it was true himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Astrid.... Well, Astrid was different from him. A smile crossed his face with just the thought of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer family was not powerful or well connected, it didn't hold sway in the village. But Astrid didn't fit in either. As a young viking, she was expected to learn how to keep a house... and a husband...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViking life was rather more limited for the women of the village. Astrid fought against the pressures of people's expectations, and took to carrying her axe. She practiced with it endlessly, and built her strength, and ability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was always going to make a fierce viking warrior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiccup reached the stone, and gave it another kick, shooting it off down the beach another hundred yards. This time though he noticed it give off a pale blue glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chased after it, hoping it wasn't a dragon egg. Although dragon eggs are sturdy, their mother's wouldn't like to see it being kicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached it, and dropped to his knees. As he picked it up, the glow brightened and strengthened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering deep inside, there were dancing lights, but no sign of a baby dragon. Hiccup's thoughts went back on track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIdly he wondered if Astrid would have made a better son or he'd have been a better daughter. A random thought just to be dismissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light flared, and painfully too late, Hiccup dropped the stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hiccup blinked his eyes clear, he looked around his feet, everything was still blurry and imprecise, but there wasn't anything 'glowy' near his feet. But something was different. Hiccup knew it in his bones. He settled back onto his rump, and waited until he could see properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2014/067/b/c/genderswap_hiccup_by_artist_em-d79cwdd.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2014/0...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiccup swept his errant hair back over his shoulder. Pausing he wondered when it became that long, it was always untidy, but never this long. He couldn't carry off long hair, it just made him look ... well ... girly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the thought, and everything fell into place. Hiccup's hands raced over his body exploring it....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swallowed nervously, it was undeniable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStoick had a daughter.</span></div></div>",

The bust that she had been learning to handle and display to tease the guys (especially Hiccup).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hicca... I'm sure you appreciate that Gobber will still be available with his advice, and you shouldn't sideline him. A change of chiefs can be a difficult time for a tribe, and we need to manage the transition well. You have your wise friend.\" she ruffled Astor's hair playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could never ignore Gobber.\" she quickly assured her mother. \"He did make this for me.\" The artificial foot gave a creak, as she adjusted her weight, as her gaze darted to her lower leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToothless pushed his face between Hiccup's arm and body, \"And I can't forget you.... can I.... can I...\" she scratched his neck playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValka took a deep breath, and soaked in the scene of family bliss, including the soon to be family members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStormfly was also eager to be off, and nudging Astor's hand, snuffling for food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.

The odd shriek of surprise came as they passed through the centre of the village. As Hiccup glanced behind them, he saw that some had dropped what they were carrying. Mildew shook a fist after the young viking when he saw that he'd turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, he knew that he'd hear all about this later, and some more rules for the riders to follow too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid rode her dragon like there was nobody else in the village, even having Stormfly do some target practice as she went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to admire her precision, as every spine hit it's intended target, or at least what he hoped was the target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth dragons drifted apart before flaring their wings for landing.

Don't make me come in there.\" Astrid threatened.... in a friendly way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe emerged still rubbing his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Astrid... Hiccup...\" he yawned. \"Ooh ... I like your new hair Hiccup but isn't dying your hair a little...\" he looked over to Astrid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a scowl from her he fell silent. She didn't like it when people pointed out she was a girl. She was a tough as any of the boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took her a moment, \"Hey! He's right! Your hair is red now.\" she said tilting her head to check it wasn't a trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiccup grabbed a handful, she was right. Well sort of... his normally mousy brown hair was shot through with streaks of red, a natural coppery colour. It reminded Hiccup of a carving in the main hall. Stoick had said it was his mother, with a glint of a tear in the corner of his eye. He didn't like to talk about her, and Hiccup didn't want to press for details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this some kind of a trick?\" she asked, her hands quite close to her axe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!!\" he answer quickly. Obviously Hiccup wasn't scared of her ... as such... but it was only polite to answer a girl's question quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToothless was kicking out a lot of heat, and Hiccup was glad for that. The weather seemed particularly cold this morning. He shivered inside his jerkin, pulling it closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFishlegs said that Snotlout had boasted last night of going fishing with his dad, so the headed off towards Ruff and Tuff's home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe steady fluttering beat of gronkle wings accompanying the slower steady beating noise from the other dragons.</span></div></div>",

The familiar roof above his bed, made him think about those weird thoughts or perhaps they were dreams. But with a sigh he tried to push them from his mind. He really didn't need anything to make him stand out -even- more, or to look less like a manly viking. His achievements spoke for themselves, but intelligence wasn't as valued as physical strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he heard a cough from the foot of his bed. He sat bolt upright in shock, to see who was there. As he did he felt an unfamiliar and very worrying movement from his chest, almost how he imagined breasts would behave and move. Automatically his hands started to rise, just to confirm this revelation. But he saw that there wasn't a single person at the end of his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like the whole village, his friends were there, as was Toothless, his father even Gobber, Gunna the village wise woman, and a few other faces peering around the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get Out!\" he screamed in anger and shock, -well mostly shock-. That was offset by the high feminine voice it emerged in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGunna stepped through everybody, her reputation helped clear the way. She was one of the few in the village whose authority wasn't based on the threat of violence. Not physical violence in any case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she reached the side of the bed, she sat down slowly and deliberately, before giving them all a fierce stare. Most of them melted away, but Stoick remained, and to Hiccup's surprise Astrid too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToothless advanced into the emptier room, seemingly immune to Gunna's presence. His snout snuck in and tickled Hiccup, bringing a smile to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look just like your mother, ... at that age. Ah, she was a rare beauty.\" Stoick said distractedly. He then coughed and pretended not to have spoken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Close the door.\" she ordered, and again Hiccup smiled to see that it was his father who obliged, with Astrid holding his hand and not moving an inch.</span></div></div>",

He saw that his body was covered from head to toes with shiny White scales. <br>\r\nHe must be hallucination to this. He thought harder and he heard that Grimmel said something and felt a pain in his neck. He must have given him a injection of his drug he knocked out toothless with and the light fury. He got up from the bed and also looked more to his body. He now scaled body his male parts were still there but he didn't know that they will change into the female counterpart.  <br>\r\nHaving got up he also got dressed and headed down towards the kitchen to have something to eat. The smell of fish was very alluring to him now. Somehow he knew he was turning into a dragon. But didn't want to believe in it. This is what Grimmel means before he fell into the water. He wanted to ruin his life. He opened the basket with fresh fish and picked up a Salmon.

Those scaly knees raising dust as they hit. Swallowing the cry of pain, she got back to her feet. But, she was bent over. Like an old woman, she couldn't stand up straight. She reached for the support of her bed to help keep her standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then she felt the weirdest sensation. As her leather kilt started to flat. It felt like her spine was lengthening.... But she wasn't any taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the growth surges, she reached a tentative hand backwards, to discover that she now possessed a spiny tail. A double-checking glance confirmed it matched her scaly legs and arms for the same matching shades and patterns. It should've reached the floor, it was more than long enough. But it was raised to avoid brushing on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn errant thought, as she watch. Astrid found it responded to her thoughts, swishing and swaying from side to side. Extending her arms, she found they were now wings. All traces of their humanity vanished. Giving them an experimental flap, she felt herself become lighter. Felt a little lift from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down her body, she saw that it had changed without her being aware of the changes. Her underbelly a lighter shade of scales than covered her back and legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother realisation crashed over her as she took a deep breath, a vain attempt to calm her rising fear. She felt her nostrils flare, and they felt far larger than they should. Her hair felt stiffer, and oddly... primed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her head this way and that, she worked out that her vision was different. Her field of view wider. Then she caught her reflection in the window. She was a beautiful amber coloured nadder. From snout to tail, she was a dragon.

First Stormfly was transported back to her pen on Berk acting like she never left. But almost at the same time hiccup was exploring the woods looking for anymore wild dragons unaccounted for when he felt an itch in his hand he scratched it expecting it to go away but it only got worse. He assumed it was a bug bite and stopped scratching little did he know that he was sprouting scales all over his hand and it was spreading toward his arm.<br>\r\nAfter the scales finished with his hand he felt a cramp like pain he looked to see what was wrong to find his arm covered in scales and starting to look like a nadder\u2019s wing. He felt another itch in his shirt so he removed it to find that more scales were spreading there too they appeared to be red and orange in color except for on his stomach where they were tan.<br>\r\nAs his other arm caught up with the first the scales were spreading to his legs and he felt a pressure around his tail bone so to keep from ruining his pants he removed them the scales already covering his private parts nothing was revealed. He looked at his backside to did that a bump was starting to form and his legs were getting thicker wherever the scales spread his balance also shifted so he could no longer stand straight up. When the scales reached his toes the turned into nadder claws one toe fussing with another leaving him the usual amount of claws as all other deadly nadders after his feet had finished his tail grew to full size and was covered in spines that he could fire at will. However as the scales spread up to his head it wasn\u2019t the transformation that worried him most it was that this new body was starting to feel normal like he was born this way and as his face turned into that of a nadder\u2019s he was teleported into the same pen as Stormfly where she nuzzled him and all memories of being human faded and new ones of being Stormfly\u2019s mate set in.</span></div></div>",

After they fused their remaining limbs started turning more cylindrical and grew yellow scales while two toes and two fingers from each person fused turning into claws with the rest.

She was feeling very frustrated, having just failed to pull off her latest stunt. It had left Stormfly with a badly injured wing, and herself with badly injured sense of dignity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd broken into floods of tears, a rare display for her. But the idea that her pride had caused Stormfly pain just tore at her heart. Until Fishlegs and Hiccup arrived on the scene, she just watched horrified, as her dragon's wings, just flailed, painfully. Hiccup wanted to comfort Astrid, but was himself pulled towards the Deadly Nadder. Fishlegs examined the injured wing, tentatively running his fingers over the membrane, and the bones beneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll be fine... But she needs to rest and recover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid promised her dragon would eat only the finest chicken until she was sky-worthy again. She found herself clamped onto Hiccup's shoulder, as the pain and fear left her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiccup wanted to be sure that she was okay, but Astrid wanted to be alone. Hiccup was used to Astrid, and kissing her gently on the cheek let her wander away. He called out re-assurances to her as she left. Dearly she wanted to go with Stormfly, but wasn't sure she could handle the rising guilt, or the endless questions from Fishlegs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven stomping along the beach angrily was frustrating. The sand just absorbed her angry footsteps, and the advancing waves, just washed her prints away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night was falling before she realised how much time had passed. It had given her a lot of time to think. She had come to some very uncomfortable conclusions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat deep down, that she felt as a woman... somehow unworthy of being with Hiccup. She knew that her place in viking society was not as high as the boys. They were expected to become warriors, to fight for the clan... to fight for the village ... to fight for his partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought of her only female companion. Ruffnut. Tolerated only for her stupidity, and the fact that she was too similar to her brother. Her entire life had been a battle to be taken seriously. And now.... And now, it had caused Stormfly ... she sobbed, as she considered how much worst it could have been. Her arrogance... her pride... her <i>insecurity</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only she didn't feel the need to prove herself... everyday ... every time ... if only she'd been born a boy. She could be a friend to Hiccup, an equal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was disturbed from her thoughts, by a small cough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, then down... she spotted Gunna. Berk's wise woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling a little distracted are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling a little out of place...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind her back she pulled out a scarlet stone. It glowed with an internal light, sparkling and teasing.</span></div></div>",

Hiccups vocals were getting higher and Astrid deeper in tone. <br>\r\nHiccups neck became more feminine to him as his apple disappeared. Making his speech girly in tone and sound. Astrid's became deeper and Husky making it sexy to females. As they were hugging each other, Hiccup lost inches of high as became Astrid's size in figure and she became taller to hiccups. Hiccups shoulders pulled in. His Shoulders becoming more compact. On the other hand Astrid became wider and boarder.<br>\r\nHiccups arms slimmed down to become feminine and his chest started to fill out. Growing breasts that were a nice C cup what Astrid had. <br>\r\nAstrid's arms filled out and her breast became pecs. They were still kissing and weren't paying attention to the change that was happening to them. It travelled lower and hiccups waist pulled in losing it's fat and giving him a nice stomach. His hips widened out and he got a nice ass like Astrid. He lost his leg hair and they filled out too. As they were kissing they had there Eys closed and they were making out. Toothless was watching the change happen. Astrid lost her childbearing hips and got a male but her stomach got a six-pack and hair started to grow on her legs.<br>\r\nThe change focused on hiccups penis as it grew erect one last time and began to retract into his body and so did his balls. A slit opened up between his legs. It also started to function and get wet from the kissing from Astrid. Astrid's ovaries made there was outwards and became balls. Her clit became longer and thicker and was the same length of hiccups male hood. The final adjust ments occurred and it becomes hard. The time became normal and they broke the kiss.<br>\r\nHiccup felt the new weight of her breasts and look down. Shocked to see her new body. Astrid was now taller and also shocked. About her body and they turned to toothless. Who was looking innocent at them.</span></div></div>",

Stormfly, could match toothless for speed... well almost, and for agility it was also close. Keeping her body close to Stormfly's neck, she enjoyed the warmth of her scaly body, and whispering encouragement to go faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that she noticed something. She wasn't as comfortable in the saddle as normal, and the cold didn't feel as bitingly sharp either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching down, she tried to adjust herself, to free whatever piece of armour or fold of cloth was causing her discomfort. As she did she pulled her nadder back, now was not the moment to overtake, she told herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it was herself that almost gave the game away, as a startled, shriek burst from her throat. She snatched her hand back. Hiccup must have heard something, as he turned around, a question on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Astrid waved it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at her hand accusing it of betrayal.

Looking once more to ensure Hiccup wasn't looking, she peeked down her top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were still there. She felt a sigh come, as her tension eased. As a viking, she worked out, and was glad not to be as .... top-heavy as some of the village women. She wanted, and fought to keep a more stream-lined, body, a body fighting fit. Although she did enjoy the furtive glances that Hiccup cast her way, when he thought she wasn't looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore her eyes, she felt a tightness in her chest, and before her eyes. The girls, Her girls, shrank, pulling tighter in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no denying it she was losing her gender. She was becoming a male viking.</span></div></div>",

It was just below the snowline, with a view over Berk that glittered red in the light of the fading sun. Stormfly was snoozing behind a pine tree leaving her to explore the rest of the ledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take her long there was only room for a couple of dozen trees and a few boulders. She was cursing her fate. That as a viking female she would be expected to marry and give up her freedom to be somebody's wife. She looked over to her dragon, his eyes flickered fitfully behind his lids as he slept a puff of smoke escaping his nostrils as he dreamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just isn't fair.\" she muttered aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe liked Hiccup, at least she thought she did. Whenever she thought of him she felt confused and angry and happy, and more confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut surely it would be fairer if she were the Chief's son, and Hiccup was the girl. She trained harder and everybody knew it. Hiccup well, he was just Hiccup... smart and all... but, without his luck with Toothless, he'd still be a joke in the village and an embarrassment to Stoick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow there was a viking, he lead from the front, and <b>nobody</b> questioned his order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all fine and dandy. But the world is the way it is. She jumped for a branch and started to do chin-up exercises. Quickly she reached ten before being satisfied with her progress. It was the branch that failed first, with a loud -crack- it snapped and she fell to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rubbed her behind, glad that none of the other trainers were there to observe this particular moment. The vibration woke Stormfly and he looked over at his rider, his mouth forming a snarl, or perhaps a smile. A lick of flame cleaned his teeth and satisfied that she wasn't in 'real' danger he closed his eye dismissively.</span></div></div>",

She should have known she was coming down with something. Nothing for it now, she'd have to go see Gothi, the Elder for the village of Berk as well as the primary healer, and get some kind of medicine. Getting out of bed was absolute miserable, at least she wouldn't have <i>walk</i> all the way to Gothi's little hut. That was one of the best things about making peace with the dragons, they made travel so much easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teen gingerly climbed off of Stormfly's back, cradling her head. Astrid staggered up the stairs that led to the top of the raised platform that Gothi's house sat on, the highest point in the village besides the Great Hall. The going was not easy, not when she was feeling so light-headed that she felt like passing out, and not to mention the fact that she was starting to feel the first chills of a fever. Astrid <i>finally</i> reached the top and sat down for a moment, panting and out of breath, before staggering up and knocking on Gothi's door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old woman opened the door and quickly motioned her in upon seeing the miserable state that Astrid was in. After a few moments of poking and prodding and general examination the healer limped off to a corner of her house and started rummaging and searching through the collection of bottles on the shelves. Gothi returned and wordlessly handed Astrid a bottle and written note instructing Astrid to drink the whole bottle as soon as she got home and to check back with Gothi or one of the other healers in a few days. \"Thanks,\" Astrid mumbled, though due to her cold came out more as \"dhunks\", before gingerly heading back down the stairs and mounting Stormfly to head home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eagerly downed the bottle of medicine, an absolutely foul concoction barely fit for human consumption...though she did feel a little better all ready. It no longer felt like Thor himself was beating on her skull with Mjolnir and the headache had faded to a dull throb and she could breathe at least a little bit now. Mostly though, Astrid felt drowsy and made her way back to her room to lie down. Most of the day had passed by the time she returned to wakefulness. She was surprised at how good she felt, there was still a few lingering symptoms from her cold, but none that would prove too bothersome, and the worst was definitely over with. Astrid was suddenly brought to her senses by a <i>very</i> loud grumble from her stomach and realized she hadn't eaten anything all day except for Gothi's little bottle of medicine. She should feel <i>this</i> hungry though should she? Astrid couldn't put it off any longer, she rushed to the Hofferson's pantry and assembled as much food as she could carry and then some. She finished her first round, but still felt absolutely famished, by the time she felt satisfied she was sure she had eaten more food than she had ever had in her whole life. And now Astrid was feeling tired again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teen returned to her room and got undressed before crawling into bed again. By the time she woke again it was morning and all of the symptoms from her illness were completely gone. Astrid quickly got out of bed to start the day, Hiccup and the others would want to know that she was all right after missing whatever they had been doing for Dragon Training yesterday. As she wrapped her breasts in their bindings she couldn't help but notice that the cloth didn't seem to go as far as it normally did before she had to pin it in place...and not only that, her shirt felt <i>much</i> tighter on her than it normally should once she had gotten it on...her tights and skirt felt like they had gotten a little smaller as well. What was going on? Was she starting to go through a growth spurt or something...it honestly wouldn't be too out of place, she was only 15 afterall and still had plenty of growing left to do.</span></div></div>",

She lead Stormfly into a downward spiral. She pulled her dragon in tighter and tighter, each circle increasing her speed. With a signal, Stormfly tucked her head and started to perform a loop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loop with her rider on the outside. Astrid was ready, her feet secure in the stirrups as she floated and the shot out of her saddle. The whoop that burst from her lips was just the encouragement her dragon sought. She shot between the chalk columns, the waves just a few feet beneath her flapping hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she reached the peak again, she dropped back into the saddle. She settled back into the saddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that was the plan. What Astrid hadn't realised was much further back. As she dropped from her straining legs, she wasn't above the saddle. She gave a yelp as she impaled herself on one of Stormfly's needle sharp spines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was painful, but she shot back up. She whimpered as she pulled it out. Dropping the offending spine into the sea. She leaned forward to stroke her dragon's neck, assure her it was her riders mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer frustration faded to embarrassment when she realised this wasn't an injury that she'd be able to hide well. She let out a rare but sincere curse when she thought about how her friends would react. She was going to be the butt of so many jokes, and crude attempts at sympathy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFishlegs would blush and probably ask some thoughtless question about Nadder spines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuffnut wouldn't have any empathy fellow feminine sympathy, she was cut from the same cloth as Tuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnotlout would make crass jokes and worse offers of helpful hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scowled, Hiccup would be the worst, his sincerity and genuine warmth was oddly the hardest to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStormfly flared her wings and landed gently on the beach.

Her feet were cold, and as she ran her hands over them, her skin also felt harder and drier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light revealed a worrying colour as well. Her feet had the same hint of splotchy blue colouring, extending to just below her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slid the boots back on, and jumped into Stormfly's saddle. Seconds later, with a push from her powerful legs, and a languid flap of her wings, Stormfly was airborne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid had questions, and was worried about the shade of blue. More worried than she liked to consider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there weren't any answers here. She'd need to find help from somewhere.</span></div></div>",

She gave Hiccup a measuring stare, matched by Astrid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was out of breath, having spotted and chased the dragon, on spotting them from the ground. She wanted to confide in him, to share her worries. But... \"Sorry, Hiccup.

They needed cutting she thought idly, hell even her legs were starting to look blotchy in the half-light of her hut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aches drove her to her bed. She really needed to lie down.

Her clothes obviously making that growth tight and painful, she tossed her top aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYawning, she stretched, and saw that same membrane stretching between her elbow and torso. All looked the same shade of speckled blue that she associated with Stormfly. Listening carefully, she thought she could hear the familiar leathery flap of her wings circling above her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if she were performing her own protective patrol.

Astrid couldn't help but wonder what sorts of things the trader had brought to Berk this time. While weapons were always a good thing and of extra fine quality when they came from Johann, she already had plenty of them...there had to be <i>something</i> equally as useful as a good weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid strode down the docks to Johann's ship, browsing through the man's wares. Unfortunately, she wasn't seeing anything too interesting or out of the ordinary for Johann, sure there were plenty of interesting things, but none that really fit with what <i>she</i> wanted...Hiccup and Fishlegs would probably be all over the books or the things like ink for writing.<br>\r\n\"Ah, Miss Hofferson,\" Johann called happily and making Astrid jump in surprise, \"One of my most loyal customers. Anything catching your fancy or anything that I can interest you in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Johann,\" Astrid greeted the trader, \"And yeah, you certainly can. I was wondering what you might recommend,\" noticing the man about to speak she quickly held up a hand and cut him off, \"That <i>isn't</i> a weapon...I mean they're always nice, or useful, but I have plenty of them all ready. So knowing what I'm like, what <i>else</i> might you have that I'd be interested in?\" Johann seemed to pause in deep thought for a moment before beckoning her toward the hold. He began rummaging through several chests and other various containers before finally letting out a cry of success and returning to her with a small bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ordinarily I don't put much stock in items claimed to be of a magical nature, but this is something I received from a <i>very</i> reliable source. I'd trust that it does what it's supposed to. This here, is a potion meant to increase the strength, endurance, and durability of the one who drinks it. I was guaranteed that whoever drinks this would become the most physically powerful man, or woman, alive,\" Johann declared happily. Astrid only looked at the bottle in suspicion, could he really be serious about all of this? You could definitely trust Johann not to cheat you and rob you blind, but his stories weren't always the most reliable. She had no doubt that the contents of the bottle he was offering were something worth a lot of money, but she wasn't sure she believed that it was a magic potion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it were true though, that would definitely be something that she was interested in. Especially now with all of the boys hitting their growth spurts, she was still the strongest and the most capable overall of the group, but they'd been catching up to her and she was afraid that they'd only surpass her as time went on....even <i>Hiccup</i> of all people had finally started to not only grow taller, but also to bulk up slightly, he was still a skinny twig, but he was getting there. This potion would give her the edge she needed to stay at the top if it actually worked. She decided she'd take the gamble and buy the potion. If it didn't work she could always tell Johann and he'd either get her money back or get her an item of roughly equal value. \"I'll take it,\" Astrid declared firmly, digging around in her money sack for the amount that Johann specified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter climbing out of the hold of the ship she rushed back to her home, she didn't want to drink the potion out in public and attract anyone's attention. She wasn't afraid of questions they'd ask, but she did worry that they might try to take it from her and use it themselves. Once inside the safety of the Hofferson clan's home and making sure that no one else from her family was around, Astrid gently pulled the stopper out of the bottle and downed the whole thing. It didn't taste awful, but it wasn't necessarily an experience she enjoyed either.....Astrid suddenly felt rather woozy and like she was going to faint, she could only assume that it was the potion taking hold....it was that or she'd accidentally poisoned herself. She staggered to her bed and crawled into it before her eyelids began to close and she passed out into a deep sleep.</span></div></div>",

It was at that point that Fishlegs realised that this was probably the fastest dragon.... in existence. It's sleek body was designed for speed, it's armour was light, and it didn't seem to have much in the way of offensive weaponry. It lacked Meatlug's heavy tail, so couldn't bash anything, and the teeth while impressive weren't exceptional. But what was exceptional was .... and he had to look a second time to be sure... it had two sets of wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFishlegs gave an appreciative whistle as he tried to estimate how fast it would be in the air too. Doubtless faster then Astrid's nadder and probably even faster than Hiccup's dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't even want to think what it breathed for a weapon.

He knew... He hoped that any dragons found here would be unique. His heart raced as he spotted a meadow. The steady fluttering of Meatlug's tiny wings a constant joy to his rider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough when he wanted Meatlug could fly almost silently, if a little slowly. That was something even Toothless couldn't do. Fishlegs puffed up a little at the thought is if this was down to his skills as a rider. Deep in his heart he knew that for all the strengths that his dragon had, and he would happily defend Meatlug against any comers. He knew that in a fight, a Gronkle wasn't going to win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they landed, he leaped off and landed in the swaying grass. Meatlug rolled over and gave himself a dust bath. Fishlegs stood nearby, his eyes watched the trees around the edge. A flash of green scales was all he saw..... before the head snuck back back behind the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFishlegs was almost dancing with delight. He hadn't recognised it at all. This was a totally new... totally unknown dragon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted to appear non-threatening, and gave Meatlug a tickle under the chin.

Especially where there food was involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he waited, patiently taking the time rest and catch some sun with Meatlug. The grass in the meadow was wild and tall in patches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he heard a rustling he turned and looked. The rustling stopped with the quiet crunching of a grass being flattened. He saw a scaly tail flick agitatedly from side to side, before settling down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeliberately, he turned his back on the noise and went back to scratching his dragon behind the ears. The rustling returned getting closer and closer to him. He kept calm as he guessed it was less than 10 feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Meatlug groaned in pleasure, hearing a snap. He glared past Fishlegs ready and willing to fight for his rider. But a steadying hand on the back of his neck settled the dragon. The huff of hot breath set the hair on the nape of his neck twitching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his heart racing, and on the verge of fainting, he turned slowly to see the new dragon.</span></div></div>",

It was sleek like a nightfury, but the head was topped with a crown of spines that went from the top it's forehead before running down the dragon's 'spine'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides the spineback, it was an iridescent emerald green. With wide eyes it looked intelligent, and his wingspan promised great speed. Well great speed compared with a gronkle, he hugged his dragon affectionately even as he admired the new one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the dragon opened his mouth, 'Oh boy' was all that he got out. He was looking for cover until he noticed there wasn't any light at the back of the creature's throat. He clearly wasn't planning on frying the young viking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided it was safer to take a little initiative, and quickly stepped to the side of the creature's head. Before it could butt him aside he started to tickle it under the chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a cough it started to purr a deep throaty noise, undeniably pleased. Fishlegs spotted something had come out it's mouth with the initial cough. A slick gooey mess lay in the dirt. It was the size of his two fists, and sticky to his cautious touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Fishlegs went to his gronkle, he wanted to sketch this wonderous new discovery. With such evidence he could convince the others of his worth and show them his new dragon. He hoped to be the one to name it, he looked it over for inspiration. Yeah, Spineback was going to be it's species. As he rummaged through the saddlebags, a roar announced a new arrival. A shadow flew across the grass, and Fishlegs turned his back to Meatlug, looking up to see if this was another new dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn almost avaricious thought struck him. Why did it need to be only one dragon per viking, he was sure to find enough time for both Meatlug and this beautiful fellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, he hadn't accounted for the effect on the Green Spineback. His mouth open wide in fear, he vomited forth huge quantities of white slime.</span></div></div>",

Next he tried to wipe the gunk away, but with the dragon still vomiting up copious amounts of whatever it was he felt like he was bailing out a boat with a teaspoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took some comfort in the fact that Meatlug didn't seem worried and wasn't rushing to defend his rider. He merely crunched away on some quartz he had dug up. However, as the moments passed Fishlegs noticed a tingling in his fingers and legs. Holding his hands up in front of his face, they dripped excess goo, he felt they were losing sensitivity. Cautiously he touched his chest to confirm, and while he felt it, there wasn't any sensation from his fingers themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried fleeing, but the white gunk was sticky and only let him writhe around. Next he felt his legs collapse as all sensation vanished from them entirely. As he lay in the long grass, his head became heavy as his neck struggled to support the weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon was still letting loose the horrible stuff as it advanced. Fishlegs thoughts turned to the creatures name as it finally closed it's enormous mouth. He was covered from his throat down to his toes.

If he found more he could sell them to the village women... or give one as a present to Astrid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpending the rest of the afternoon hunting, he was tired and frustrated as the Sun dipped behind the mountains. He still only had that one gem. He tried and failed to stifle a yawn. Returning to the warmth of Hookfang's body, he rested against his dragon's flank. The warmth eating away at his last reserves. Settling himself, he looked deep into the stone, Hookfang's tail curling around to keep him cosy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt hypnotic, the light dancing within, hinting at but never revealing a sinuous dancer. A smile spread over his features, as he dropped off. Eyelids getting impossibly heavy, Snotlout fell asleep, to dream in the comfortable, safe embrace of his dragon's warm body. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A couple of cautious flap, grazed the grass and gave him an idea how much lift he could expect. Like Stormfly a couple of stomping, bounding steps, and he took to the air.

Snotlout's long draconian tongue lashed out, and wrapped around the chicken taking it, and swallowing it in one satisfied gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had never tasted so good. Snotlout paused, as she savoured it's delicious snack. She'd.... She'd thought of herself as Gustav's mount.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing she should be offended... she couldn't summon the anger.

So using a magic rune he found a little while ago he thought \u201cI want Snotlout to transform into a female monstrous nightmare\u201d and with that the rune went to work. Starting by snotlout\u2019s scales growing in the colors where mostly purple with some yellow next his arms started turning into monstrous nightmare wings due to how Snotlout was asleep he didn\u2019t notice the changes. After his arms fully became wings he started to grow a monstrous nightmare tail with mostly purple scales. Once his tail grew in his legs began transforming slowly they became more cylindrical and wide one of his toes merged with another and they all became claws. Once his legs transformed his torso became wider and began looking more like a monstrous nightmare\u2019s. After his torso changed his neck became thinner and longer and his head started to change into a dragon muzzle with a yellow snout. After he finished transforming he looked kinda like girl-hookfang and was teleported to the stables with hookfang.</span></div></div>",

The trees were too densely packed to fly between them... and with the prize that Fishlegs hoped to find, and Hiccup wanted to meet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving their dragons on the verge of the forest, they had to search on foot, looking for caves, hollows, and any hiding places they could find in the thick tree cover. The ground was overgrown, forcing them to cut their way through the bracken and heather as they hunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiccup had thought he'd spotted one on the ground as he flew over the area. A second visit by Astrid on Stormfly only confirmed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Changewing... and if Fishlegs was right, probably injured. The hope being to make contact with and hopefully train a Mystery class dragon. If they had a tame, one they could examine it closely... It's variable coloured scales, giving it a chameleon-like ability to disappear into the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe use the riders could make of colour-shifting armour would aid their own attempts at stealth. Their own dragon scale armour was light and strong. Another bond with their mount. But, the potential for near-invisibility was too tempting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSplitting into three groups, they naturally paired up. Astrid and Hiccup taking one direction, cutting their way through the undergrowth with her axe, and his flaming sword. Fishlegs, and Snotlout were a team, neither wishing to work with either of the Thorston twins. Fishlegs' gronkle iron sword making light work of the plant-life, and Snotlout using brute force to kick and beat his way through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins charged into the green dappled darkness, as an unstoppable force of nature. Bickering and fighting, they didn't seem to notice the hazards as they vanished into the depths of the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a long and frustrating search with the riders finding little of interest. The Changewing too well hidden from their random thrashing search. Sadly, lots of biting and stinging insects seemed to find them easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFishlegs found a cave, and traces of the acid green spittle of the dragon burning hollows in the floor. Proof that their definitely was one in the area. Calling out, Hiccup and Astrid joined them in the cave, agreeing that the burns seemed to be recent, and that the dragon seemed to be injured... or at least not flying far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick search confirmed there weren't any eggs in the cave, and they agreed they'd need more people to have a chance of finding the dragon. As Snotlout wanted to boast about his discovery of the cave, the burn, and all <i>his </i>conclusions he looked around for the twins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that the cries of the twins reached them. The sound not of their usual chaotic action. But with an added tone of terror filling their shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They've found it...\" Astrid and Hiccup said at the same moment, before all four raced from the cave towards the sounds of the shouts. It was hard to tell where they were in the forest, but the shouts were getting closer, as they hacked their way forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group burst free of the forest, into the sunlight, surprising even themselves. Quite near the waiting dragons. Looking around they spotted the twins near Barf and Belch. Blinking for the brightness of the Sun, they were relieved to see they didn't look to be in immediate danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a reason to return to their search, they headed towards their dragons. But, there was still something about the tone of the arguing twins that was.... <i>well</i>, wrong.</span></div></div>",

Even the livestock was safely protected in the barns and outbuildings of Berk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiccup was getting Toothless to blast a rock repeatedly just to heat his home. Stoick had considered keeping everyone in the Great Hall, but it wasn't best suited for all the villagers to sleep there and he was sure the storm would blow itself out... well some time during the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToothless looked mournfully at the door. He enjoyed riding the wild currents of a stormy sky... what dragon didn't enjoy the wind beneath it's wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiccup felt sympathy for his dragons desires, but really didn't fancy taking him up in this weather. He felt sure that his father was right, and it would be rather hard to hide his absence when they were both in such close proximity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides even with his warmest clothes and riding Toothless, he didn't have the same fire in his belly as a dragon. He curled up in the living room, resting his head against Toothless's flank, he was soon asleep. Hiccup didn't wake when his father covered him with a blanket, although Toothless had a wary eye on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied that his son was warm and protected he went off to bed himself. After all, it had been a tiring day preparing the village for the storm. But the black clouds on the horizon hadn't been hard to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thought that troubled him was Gobber. His friend had chosen to stay at his forge, rather than shelter at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Gobber was resilient, and he assured himself wise enough to go home if he needed. With a deep yawn, he stretched and headed off to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the wind howled, the clatter of an unsecured shutter punctuation the night. But this was no ordinary storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPink sparkles glittered among the snow, as it crashed through Berk, bringing unforeseen consequences to the village.</span></div></div>",

The first light of day was barely brightening the horizon, but she was eager to be up and about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://images6.fanpop.com/image/photos/36800000/Astrid-and-Stormfly-how-to-train-your-dragon-36858321-1259-884.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://images6.fanpop.com/image/photos/3...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving her a tickle under the chin. The dragon gave a gurgling chuckle at the attention, she knew what was coming next, and Astrid didn't disappoint. She tossed a whole roast chicken towards Stormfly. Snatching it out of the air, she gave a draconian purr, deeper and more resonant than any cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed no reason to ride her dragon, but she was always eager to keep her edge, and stop Hiccup getting too cocky. She soon had Stormfly saddled, and it was hard to tell which of them was more eager to get airborne. A gust of chill air billowed into the house, as they went outside. The freshly laden snow blanketing the village, only the warmth of the Gobber's forge showed any green around it's dry ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a powerful leap, her thigh muscles propelled her into the air. Astrid guided her dragon towards the sea stacks. A swift slalom should be enough to shake off the cobwebs. Already the fresh air was tickling her lungs as she gulped down a lungful of the freshest air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwooping low over the village, it was clear she was the first one to be up and awake. Stormfly raced down the hill, sweeping between the building only five or so feet off the ground. The sheep cowered, as the pair flew past, a rippling of frosty flakes trailing in their wake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a faint pink hue to the snow, which Astrid put down to the low Sun. The sky was hers and hers alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had the sky to themselves, with Stormfly trailing her claws in the water, Astrid trusted her mount instinctively. Objecting to the occasional splash as an unwary fish found it's end scooped up into Stormfly's maw. Astrid held tight to Stormfly, pulling her legs close around the dragon's neck. She soaked up the warmth, as the wind sped past her. Flat out, there weren't many dragons who could beat Stormfly for speed. However, one of them was Toothless, and so she trained hard to offer him competition... and for the chance of her own victory, their own victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the blue, a plasma bolt shot past her shoulder. Hiccup was awake. Glancing back over her shoulder she made out the shape of Hiccup, and clutching tightly to his neck, the rider. She waved a challenge to Hiccup, and swerved towards the stacks. Another plasma blast flew past her shoulder, this time closer than she liked. She felt the heat as it passed. It also stopped her from reaching the stacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was pissed, it was too close. She did an evasive turn, and was heading back into the village. It was no surprise that they were instantly on her tail. Air hissed angrily from her lungs, but if she was going to have an argument, she wanted some privacy. Landing on the beach, Stormfly kicked up sand as she landed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToothless landed with grace and poise, a wide smile on his face. Hiccup dismounted, a little less gracefully, and pulled off his helmet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/20/d3/bb/20d3bb9ed351a6101f4af1a740737b98.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long mane of hair slipped loose. Hiccup was a girl her emerald eyes giving her a feline look that briefly made Astrid jealous, before she dismissed the thought. She was still too stunned to speak, Hiccup started....</span></div></div>",
