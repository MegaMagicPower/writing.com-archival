            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were sitting at your desk, writing an essay you had procrastinated until today. Not only were you un-energized, the essay had really tired you out, but you were really bored with life in general. Already a year into college, and you still had no girlfriend, a small amount of friends, and weren't doing too hot on your classes. Life was pretty hard, and you just needed a break from it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour phone began buzzing for the sixth time today. The first two times it had been your mother Sarah that had been calling you, a mother of two who had to do a lot around the house. She had been attractive in her early days, her dark hair and green eyes making her quite the looker, but she had grown tired after raising you and your sister. Sometimes, you wished you could help her a bit, just so you could see how hard she had it, and so she could see how safe you were here at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third time it had been your 17 year old sister, Sophie. Though she was bubbly and popular at her school, she wasn't exactly the most intelligent person ever, so you helped her out sometimes on her homework. She complained a lot about life, but you knew it was pretty easy. Today she was asking you for help on her math homework, a task that would be much easier done if you were simply there. You'd be there anyways, so what was the use of just explaining it all over the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fourth call was from your next door neighbor, Emily. A cute blondie, she'd been asking for your help moving all morning, since she couldn't really move her stuff since she had an interview going on when the delivery men came. Problem was, she had to be there in person, and was going to have to reschedule the movers, and therefore reschedule the whole trip she was planning next quarter because of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last call was from your math professor, Ms. Moreno. A recent graduate from your college, she was short, plump, and very energetic. She was calling about your essay, about why you hadn't yet turned it in, and was telling you that she had begun grading the essays, and needed yours now. You simply looked at your blank page. If only you could just skip this whole assignment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when the meteor hit. Loud, and violent, the sound was loud enough for you to hear over your noise-cancelling headphones. You went outside to check what was up, and were surprised that no one else heard it. At the center of a small grassy park close to your dormitory, you found a large, violet crystal. It glowed as you touched it, as if it enjoyed your hand, and suddenly, you felt a new power course through you. Memories of past users flashed between your eyes, and you realized the power of this stone. With it, you could alter reality and swap identities with others. Now, all you needed to do was choose whom to use it on first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you looked at your phone. You hadn't seen who had actually called you that last time, and you decided that that person would be who you swapped with. The person was ____________________.</span></div></div>",

When you woke up, you felt a huge difference. At first, all you noticed was a tiredness all over your body. It transcended simple overnight tiredness, it was years and years of weakness all hitting you at once. Your hand drifted towards a coffee cup immediately to your right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was here you noticed your situation. You were in your childhood home, apparently cutting some tomatoes. It was something you\u2019d seen your Mom do a million times before, and something you\u2019d done a few times yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weirdest sensation was the feeling of your Mom\u2019s clothes. You were wearing a simple black top and brown mom pants. Underneath, you could feel the usual for a woman your mom\u2019s age, a pair of white granny panties and a t-shirt bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the\u2026\u201d you heard yourself say. Even your voice was your mothers\u2019. Everything felt a bit\u2026 smaller, even though you knew you were the same height as before. Even the knife you were holding felt a bit heavier than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned the knife to face you. Reflected on it was the image of your mother. She followed your every move, to great comedic effect. You started doing things your mother would never do, such as picking your nose, shuffling your hair, even bouncing her breasts to the beat of famous pop songs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow this is pretty funny, I can\u2019t believe I have her reflection,\u201d you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you remembered what your mom was doing later tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit she had a date tonight. Err I guess I do now. Though that seems pretty weird now, considering\u2026 maybe I should just cancel and hang out with my sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cNow what to do\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">You, a 19 year old in college called Tony, come across a special crystal that allows you to swap lives with others. While you are them, they remain in your body, and you decide whether they know or not. While you are them, you retain all your bodily characteristics and they retain theirs, but your reflection is that of the life that you are currently inside. You can swap into anybody, and you can even swap lives with animals and inanimate objects. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough these powers are strict at the beginning, you can evolve your powers to be able to change your body eventually. For instance, if Tony starts to have sex while inside a girl's life, his body changes into a female version of himself to satisfy the paradox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSex is ok, but no gay sex, killing off characters, or bringing in randos. No short chapters or non-spell checked chapters</td>",
