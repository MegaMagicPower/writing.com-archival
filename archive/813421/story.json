This was not one of those absence of things to do board, no, it was one of those \"I'm-missing-something-important-in-my-life\" kind of boards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got up from the sofa and half walked half floated over to the kitchen. He reflected on how, even though he was now recognized as the first Pokemon citizen, had his own house, and worked for Prof. Oak as a lab assistant, he still felt that he wanted to do something with his free time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he pulled out the makings of a ham and cheese sandwich, he reflected on just how much he had changed, as well. Since Jessy, James, and Meowth has left Team Rocket a month before the organization crumbled away, and thanks to Mewtwo who vouched for them, the were given full pardons for ever being in the team. Recently they had started their own pokemon Gym right there in Pallet Town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeowth, in gratitude, had been coming over to Mewtwos home for the past month and a half to teach him about human culture and to help him begin to speak English like himself. For even though Mewtwo could convey his thoughts on a level deeper than words, it made people more comfortable around him if he would speak to them instead of using his psychic powers. But only a few days ago, after Meowths session with him, Meowth had announced that Mewtwo know knew just as much about humans as he did. There was simply nothing more to teach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo sat back on the couch, after finishing the sandwich, remembering that, that was not all that had changed about himself recently. He had become more calm. He respected others, humans and pokemon alike, for their accomplishments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe awoke suddenly, he hadn't even noticed it when his remembrances had slipped into dreams. As he tried to get up he noticed that his center of weight had shifted. Looking down he realized what was wrong. his stomach (or equivalent there of) had bulged out around four inches. He quickly teleported upstairs to the bathroom, Mewtwo knew he must have put on some weight, even though he didn't look like it his normal weight was usually 268 pounds, but upon stopping on the counter it shot up to 318 pounds! A fifty pound weight gain since that morning. There was only one pokemon he knew of that would pull such a prank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;MEW!&gt; he bellowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small pink cat-like creature appeared<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Translated<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Yes?* she asked in her syrupy sweet voice she used whenever she was in trouble.<br>\r\n&lt;What did you do this time?&gt;<br>\r\n*What ever do you mean?*<br>\r\n&lt;This!&gt; he said pointing to his enlarged gut, &lt;I know you're behind it so own up already.&gt;<br>\r\n*Ok fine I did it*<br>\r\n&lt;Why?&gt;<br>\r\n*Because you look so mush cuter with a bit of a belly on you and I happen to know that over weight people tend to be happier*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo thought about this and realized he did feel happier. As well as warm an comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;You're right. I DO feel better!&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought about this and decided if this little gain made him feel this much better, what if he gained more?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Mew, will you help me gain weight?&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew was a bit taken aback by this but agreed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;OK then let's get started&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Hold on there. there are other types of bigness you could enjoy too, ya know?*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich path will Mewtwo choose?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His tail grew so much he could no longer lift it, so he let it drag on the ground, bigger than an Arbok in diameter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis gut and chest came next, with his stomach pushing out and then down till it almost touched the floor and stuck out about three feet, his chest grew soft and flabby with his pecs flowing down his stomach in a pair of man boobs that would make most women jealous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast came his arms, neck, and head. His arms grew thick and lumpy, with his upper arm drooping down enough to cover his elbow and hands to puffed out that he couldn't even bend his fingers (it was a good thing he could levitate the food into his mouth or he would have stopped by now). His neck had long since vanished into a thick collar as big around as a car tire. His face too had grown thicker, with cheeks the size of softballs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating every bit of food in the house, though, he was still hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*You're quite a butterball now.* said Mew floating near Mewtwo. *So what should we do? *<br>\r\n&lt;I'm not big enough yet Mew.

He was licking his chops, then if he could bend his knees he would but he couldn't because of his weight. Mewtwo then levitated to the restaurant's doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Then, using a psychic blast of energy to blow open the doors. He was so fat that he couldn't even fit through the door, so he just forced himself through the door until the doors' edges bent the busted away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   He then levitated to the buffet.

Then, everyone in the restaurant backed away and let Mewtwo have his fill of food and he did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   He ate so much food that his butt cheeks were the size of monster truck wheels, his tail was the size of a of half an Onix, his gut and chest was that of an obese Snorlax, he had about 10 chins of fat, his face cheeks were about the size of basketballs, and his neck was the size of a tire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   After the had had his fill of food (for now) he made the front restaurant wall fly away so he could at least fit out of the restaurant.

What a ways he had come, and in such short time too! 614 lbs is quite a lot of weight for a body type like Mewtwo, who at one point was quite slender in  appearance.  His arms, which were once almost   anorexically thin, now bloated out like a thick down jacket, bulging out of either side of his chest plate.  Speaking of which, his chest plate had lost all \"plate\" like qualities.  What used to be a firm layer had bloated out itself; each pectoral had softened and expanded outward, like two water balloons resting atop of his expansive gut.  His neck, once extremely slender, had also gained it's own girth and had transformed into an extra chin (or two or three).  His face had filled out quite a bit, and weight even seemed to go to his \"second neck\", which was also somehow considerably wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo had always been known for having \"thunder thighs\", but what he had now would amaze even Zeus!    Each thigh bulged out greatly, the amount of weight on them made them appear like two lofty pillows on either side of his abdomen.  Well, at least what you could see of them.  His stomach was by far the most obnoxiously large part of his body by far.  Mewtwo's abdomen had never been that far from the ground anyway, and the additional 400 lbs to his frame had united the two.  Trying to walk human style was almost a chore-- each step dragged his massive gut across the floor!   Luckily, his telekinesis helped aid him in this situation, offering a much less physically taxing method to mobility.  His tail had also taken one of the larger chunks of his overall gain, as it had followed his stomach to the ground.  He didn't bother moving it much-- it was too much of a burden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, Mewtwo was something he had never been before, and that was LARGE.  Sure, he's been intelligent, powerful, and respected, but never has his raw appearance made an impact on the viewer!  Yet, his appetite to grow (as well as his appetite to eat!) was not satisfied yet, and he still wanted to keep going.  \"KFC should do me justice...\" he thought to himself.  He trudged over to the door and began to open it, before he realized that there was no way he was going to fit through there.  Luckily, Mewtwo was able to simply teleport himself outside.  Being psychic sure came in handy sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo landed with a bang inside the KFC.  He had to wait until a spot opened up so that he wouldn't rematerialize on anyone.  His entrance certainly was a shocking one however.  The entire restaurant practically froze in fear and awe.  Mewtwo was probably just a little smaller than the average Snorlax at that point!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo dragged himself over to the counter to make his order.  The cashier gulped, and...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"...may I take your order?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA customer off to the side started laughing at this, and apparently couldn't stop. He fell on the floor, hat coming off to reveal brown spiky hair. When he finally regained his composure, he flashed a grin towards Mewtwo. \"So this is the powerful Mewtwo,\" he said, obviously recognizing him. \"What happened, fatass?\" He doubled over in laughter again. \"I heard it was you that took out my Nidoking and Arcanine in Viridian Gym, but--HAHahaHA--whatever did that wasn't the size of a Snorlax!!\" The customer fell over again, laughing extremely hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo simply ignored the guy and started making his order, but when the customer finally stopped laughing, he asked, \"So, am I right in believing that you're Mewtwo?\" Mewtwo didn't even acknowledge him. The customer rolled his eyes impatiently and took out an old Pok\u00e9dex, scanning Mewtwo. The screen flashed up with Mewtwo's normal picture, height, weight, etc. He put the Pok\u00e9dex away and glared at Mewtwo, who was still ignoring him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Mewtwo finished his order, he sat down at a nearby table to wait--or he tried. The booth was nowhere near big enough for him, so he chose to sit on the table. He stopped himself before doing this, however, knowing the table couldn't possibly withstand his weight. He was trying to figure out where to sit and wait when that same customer walked up to him. \"Mewtwo!!\" he shouted. \"I haven't forgiven you for that time in Viridian Gym!!\" &lt;I battled everyone who went into that Gym, and only you have decided to hate me for following my commands. Explain yourself.&gt; \"What the hell do you mean, explain?!\" &lt;I'm afraid I don't even recognize you.&gt; \"Don't recog--GAH!\" The customer kicked the table and threw his hat at the wall, creating quite a scene. The manager walked out from the back, asking, \"Could the both of you please move outside? You,\" he said, looking at the customer, \"are disturbing the other customers and you,\" he said, looking at Mewtwo, \"are simply too large for this building.\" The customer started laughing again at this, but stopped fairly quickly and stomped outside after grabbing his hat. \"Don't worry....sir,\" the manager was talking to Mewtwo again, looking very unsure of himself, \"your order will be taken to you outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon exiting the restaurant, Mewtwo found himself in quite the situation. The customer had apparently drawn, with chalk, a Pok\u00e9mon arena layout in the middle of the parking lot. Mewtwo, not noticing this until now, had come to rest in the trainer's box on one end of the layout. \"I want a rematch, Mewtwo,\" the customer said. His black eyes bored into Mewtwo's purple ones, and suddenly it clicked in Mewtwo's mind who this boy--after all, he was only sixteen--was. &lt;Wait--&gt; \"NO. No waiting. We fight NOW.\" &lt;But I remember you!&gt; \"Yeah? Don't care. You put my Nidoking and Arcanine in the freaking hospital. Now you'll pay--\" &lt;But I KNOW you!!&gt; \"GOOD!! Now, battle!! Go!\" The trainer threw out a Pok\u00e9 Ball, which exploded into a large Blastoise, ready for battle. Mewtwo had no choice--HE certainly wasn't up for a battle--so he telepathically called upon a team of cloned Pok\u00e9mon to fight the battle. His own Blastoise was the first to arrive, dropping onto the asphalt with enough force to trigger a few car alarms. \"What is that?!\" the trainer yelled at Mewtwo, apparently not believing the cloned Pok\u00e9mon was a Blastoise. It didn't really look like one, Mewtwo silently agreed, but, &lt;It's my own Blastoise. Shall we battle?&gt; The rest of Mewtwo's team dropped into place behind him: two similarly-marked clones of Charizard and Venusaur. The customer sneered. \"I'm Gary Oak,\" he said, \"And I will kick your ASS!!\"</span></div></div>",

Even so the crash as the pair collided was loud enough to set off alarms on the nearest cars. &lt; Counter with Bite. &gt;<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The clones head emerged and lunched at Garys pokemon trying to bite down on it's neck.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Blastoise!\" Gary shouted, \"Water Gun! Blow him back!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The cannons came out just as the clones attack came down, biting into Blastoise's right most water cannon. Both pokemons eyes widened as the jets of water began firing. The clone was forced to drink down the water as gallon after gallon passed its lips. The softer cartilage-like underbelly of the clone began to groan and push forward with the huge amounts of water it was attempting to contain. The clone tried to pull its teeth free but found them embedded in the canon and stuck tight.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For whatever reason the display was both so shocking both Gary and Mewtwo failed to give any orders as the clones belly continued to swell. By the time either pokemon thought to try and push free of the other, the clones arms had begun to bloat, making it hard to bring them forward and Blastoise was having a hard time getting a grip on the softer mass pressing against him. The water kept flowing too, the attack never having been called off as Gary had commanded Blastoise to 'blow him back' and since he wasn't blown back the flow continued.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finally, just when the clone was starting to look more like a balloon than a pokemon, Gary thought to call off the attack and the flow stopped, allowing the pair to separate. The clone by now was the size of a van and bloated almost to the point of being unable to move. Strange as it was to see, Gary still smirked, figuring he now had the upper hand.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&lt; Time out. &gt;<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What?\" Garry shouted across the parking lot, \"Afraid you're going to loose?\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&lt; I merely wished to propose an offer of a prize for the fight, &gt; Mewtwo replied, &lt; Surely you would like to hear it. &gt;<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gary smirked, the win seemed in the bag, \"Fine. Let's hear your offer.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&lt; It's simple. If you win this fight I'll become your pokemon to battle with. &gt;<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gary almost couldn't believe his ears. here, the most powerful psychic in the world was practically offering himself up on a silver platter. True he'd need a lot of training to get back into fighting shape, but it would be worth it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&lt; However... &gt; Mewtwo continued, interrupting the trainers line of thought, &lt; If <i>I</i> win... You and all your pokemon will become my 'servants'. &gt;<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Something in Mewtwos tone indicated he meant more than just butlers and wait staff, but even with that fear Gary was too blinded by the prospect of Winning Mewtwo to worry about it. \"Deal. Time in. Go Blastoise! Knock his blimp out!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The pokemon rushed at the bloated clone, eager to deliver the final blow.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&lt; Mimic. &gt;<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0How it happened was a blur, but suddenly Gary was watching with shock as his own pokemon suddenly had it's mouth wrapped around the clones water gun and was swallowing the same long stream of water it had just pumped into the clone. And then some.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As the clone began to deflate Gary's Blastoise began inflating in return.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&lt; You should know, &gt; Mewtwo stated, &lt; My clones are far stronger and more resilient than normal pokemon. That includes how elastic their bodies are. &gt;<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Indeed already the Blastoise was looking uncomfortable as it's shell looked too small for it's bloating form. If this kept up his pokemon would probably explode. There was only one way out, to concede the fight.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Garry dropped to his knees.\"I... I surrender...\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The attack ended a moment later, just as Blastoise was looking fit to explode.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mewtwo was suddenly there by Gary, his massive form looming over the trainer. \"You did the right thing. It's never worth it to risk a Pokemons life for your own gains. I know that first hand.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But... I lost... So now...\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0&lt; Yes, you are mine, &gt; Mewtwos eyes looked down on him firmly, &lt; And I have plans for you. But if you approach them with an open mind I think you will find a few pleasent surprises... &gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Mewtwo intends to turn Gary into a female Mewtwo. He has longed for a companion for some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Mewtwo intends to turn Gary into a new hybrid of human and pokemon to begin a news species of Pokemorphs </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gary felt stiff under Mewtwo's firm and unrelenting glare. He wished he could turn his head away from his soul-piercing eyes, but his body wouldn't let him. Mewtwo smirked as the young human squirm by just looking at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Hmmm...descant skeletal structure...exceptional metabolic reflexes...&gt; Mewtwo  examined. After a few more seconds his smirk got even wider. &lt;Yes. You'll do nicley for what i have planned.&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what are you talking--Gah!\" Gary felt his body become even more stiff and erect as a purple hue enveloped his body. His arms were pressed firmly down his sides to the point they were digging into his body. He winced in pain and bit his lower lip to keep him from crying out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo noticed Gary's hurt expression and loosened his grip a tad. Gary opened his eyes and shot Mewtwo an angry look. Mewtwo smiled, making his softball cheeks even more pronounced. &lt;I hope you have more endurance then that, Human. We haven't even started yet&gt;.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name...Is...Gary Oak...!\" Gary breathed as the grip was still firm on his body and left little room for his chest to rise. Mewtwo watched gleefully as Gary tried in vain to break free of his psychic hold. &lt;You let me tell you what your name is, Human.&gt;.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a wave of psychic energy swept across Gary's form. He felt his muscles contact and release as they tried to make sense pf their environment. A large headache formed in his brain as it's Neuro-transmitters were being re-configured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n,I have to say, I did not anticipate my day turning out like this when i woke up this morning&gt; Mewtwo remarked. Gary was listening, but only half-listening as the pain in his head was increasing by the second. &lt;I suppose i should thank Mew for giving me those cookies. For the first time in a very long time, i feel happy. And your going to make me even more happy&gt;.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It...hurts...!\" Gary shouted. His brain felt like and probably was throbbing. He would do anything in the world to just have the power to rub his temples, but they were bound to his sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Woop de doo&gt; Mewtwo patted his gargantuan belly, not really listening to the boys cries. He sighed happily and closed his eyes, eagerly awaiting the transformation's results. &lt;I wonder what i'll have to eat afterwards. Maybe something cheesy?&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CHEESY?! Your thinking about food when im--!\" Gary couldn't finish his rant as his an immense amount of pressure formed in the back of his head. All at once, a second spinal cord erupted from his skull and shot through his back, wrapping itself around his already existing one. Gary let out the most pained, most loud, most pitying cry he had ever escaped from his mouth. Tears ran down his eyes as he suffered internally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo, however, did not hear his scream. He was too lost in his own mind to register what was going around him. He had just naturally expected the process to go smoothly. His eyes were still closed and his tongue now laid out of his mouth somewhat cutely as he anticipated his next meal. He rubbed his behemoth gut, giggling at the slightest touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Mmmmm, if i want this to be over with before lunch, i should speed up the process.&gt; Mewtwo lazily waved his paw and Garry felt his whole body form those familiar pressure points. His skin turned pale grey and tiny hairs sprouted up all over the place, His eyes went from brown to a vibrant purple. His mouth and nose merged together and created a small muzzle on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary looked down at his hands. They were merging themselves into three bulbous digits. His felt underneath his clothes his stomach area and crotch just...fuse. It was too much to handle. The moment he felt himself sprout a tail, he fainted mid-process from pain.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------<br>\r\nLater...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;...gary...gary...Gary...Gary!&gt; Gary heard in intervals as he slowly regained consciousness. He opened his eyes slowly and looked up to see Mewtwo's dominating form above him, casting out the sun. He had a look of worry and guilt on his face, and looked somewhat releived when he finnaly woke up. &lt;You gave me quite the scare, Human...well...i really shouldn't say Human anymore should I?&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary groaned and closed his eyes again, the sun was too bright, depite him being in the shadow. He rubbed his head with his paw...paw? His eyes shot open and he looked at the horror that was his right appendage. What was once a normal, human hand, was now a Pokemon Ppaw. But not just any Pokemon's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary sat up and looked at his body in shock. He was now a Mewtwo, just like his captor. Only less fat and...and...less masculine. Gary stared cautiously at the two protrusions on his new body's chest. They were big and fluffy and quite sensitive to the slow wind picking up in the air. He slowly put his paw down on it and a sense of pleasure soothed his aching body almost instantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;I am afraid your new body is going to take some time to get used too, As well as your...enlarged prominences&gt;. Mewtwo rubbed the back of his head nervously. He had not expected the process wold be so painful. Gary continued to stare down at his new chest orbs before looking up at Mewtwo and asking: \"You turned me into a girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;A female member of my species, yes.&gt; Mewtwo stated. &lt;I have been lonely for quite some time, and i would have liked another one of myself to spend time with.&gt; <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything hurts.\" Gary stated bluntly. \"My bones ache and my hearts feels like it wants to punch my brain\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;The feeling will subside soon.

A blue liquid started pumping down through the tubes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Wow this stuff tastes really good!&gt; He said in his mental voice. His second thought was how strange it was to have something being pumped into his body via his belly button. He could feel himself getting bigger. His arms inflated and started to strain the cuffs around them. His legs, started to bulk up, but mostly the upper legs, giving him a bit of a comical appearance. His tail filled up underneath him, lifting him off the table as the steel restraints snapped from his flab. His cheeks started to poof up and his neck, plus the thing on the back of his neck started to fill with fat, giving the impression that his neck was twice as thick as his head! But his huge stomach was the most impressive. It was pushing upwards constanly, it filled outwards, trippling his size. By the end, Mewtwo's stomach was four times as large as the rest of him. It was a mountainous gut that went six feet  into the air before sloping down all around Mewtwo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew was having a party flying above Mewtwo, and cutting off his levitation, falling into Mewtwo's body, and bouncing right off again.</span></div></div>",

At last the table under him could take no more and broke apart, Rolling Mewtwo forward onto his hge gut, now bigger than a van and still growing. His legs could easily be mistaken for wine barrels by this point, and he could feel his toes slowly being covered by his rolls of fat. His arms were little better. His forearms were bigger around than water barrels and his hands were vanishing into them. His upper arms looked more like the size of a snorelax. His tail must've been twice as big around as an Onix now and very lumpy. His butt was his second biggest feature, with each cheek looking like a full sized sedan in size as they never stopped jiggling. But above all that his stomach reigned supreme, bigger than two vans now and still surging forwards.

He could've sworn there was an extra around before his answer was recieved from grope against his rear end, which had grown just as round and puffy, bouncing and squishing against that hand while Mewtwo grunted and the inflated cheeks on his cheeks reddened! He tried to move and wiggle out of their grip but to no avail, as not only did they have a strong grip, but he could feel his limbs thicken like trunks filling up with air! Even his tail wasn't spared from the air filling him as it too thickened and expanded like a giant purple sausage!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBigger and rounder, puffier and girthier Mewtwo became in such a short amount of time!

I have nothing against Gay/Lesbian people but I would just rather not see that in this story. Also, no blood and guts, I want to keep this a story for everybody. Last, no deaths if Mewtwo or another character should pop it would be just like a balloon popping, and if anyone did I'm sure Mewtwo and/or Mew could use their psychic powers to pull the characters back together again. Addition: I won't tolerate /human/ vore, creature vore is fine, though. Addition #2: Male Pregnancy, while not strictly denied, will not involve living beings being born. Unbirth may be possible, and so will artificial pregnancies, but nothing involving creating new life taking and shape just for fun.<br>\r\nIf you need any more info on Mewtwo, a lot (along with a picture) can be found here: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mewtwo\" target=\"_blank\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mewtwo</a></td>",
